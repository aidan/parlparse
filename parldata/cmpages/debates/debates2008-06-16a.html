 I am sure that the whole House will wish to join me in sending our profound condolences to the family, friends and comrades of Lance Corporal James Bateman and Private Jeff Doherty of 2nd Battalion, the Parachute Regiment, who were killed in Helmand province, Afghanistan, on Thursday 12 June. They were young men of remarkable courage and professionalism, and we owe them an enormous debt.</p>

 I am grateful for the opportunity to ask that question, and I echo my right hon. Friend&#146;s thoughts on those who continue to give their lives to secure peace and security in Afghanistan&#151;I send them my eternal thanks. Does he agree that the best way for the people of Afghanistan to have confidence in the work that is taking place there is to forge ahead with the health and education programmes that are crucial to that work? Education and health are a basic right, and people in Afghanistan will come to understand that when those programmes are rolled out throughout the country.</p>

I am pleased to say that, as a result of ISAF&#146;s effect in Afghanistan, 80 per cent. of people now have access to basic health care&#151;less than 10 per cent. did so before. Education offers a long-term sustainable future for Afghanistan, and there are now 6 million children in education, one third of whom are girls. We should remember that the Taliban refuse to educate girls, and they still kill those teachers who educate girls, and try to destroy the schools.</p>

 From a parliamentary reply from the Department for International Development, I notice that there is just one single non-governmental organisation operating in Helmand province. Seven years after the invasion, it is astonishing to discover that we cannot invest more and encourage NGOs to do their work. If that is the case, why do the Royal Engineers not have one single Trojan or Terrier vehicle, which would mean that they, instead of DFID, could help the reconstruction and development work? It appears that we have taken over responsibility for the provisional reconstruction team, but we are not doing enough about it.</p>

I am sure that he will accept that, from my recent visit to Afghanistan, I have seen significant improvements in reconstruction. When I was in Lashkar Gah a couple of weeks ago, 30 projects were under way across that city. I may have more to say later in some detail about what is happening across Afghanistan, but he can be assured, in terms of reconstruction and development, that we, with our allies, are investing $12 million a week in Helmand province alone.</p>

 With respect, my hon. Friend always manages to make a partial analysis of what is going on in a country of great complexity. He forgets to remind the House that while civilian deaths caused by ISAF forces are accidental, deeply regretted and always investigated, they are part of the Taliban&#146;s plan. Indeed, they intend to do that, and that is the substantial difference between us. As for his other two observations, I know from my work with Bob Gates, who is the US Secretary for Defence, and from the American Government, that they are doing a significant amount to get the Governments of both Pakistan and Afghanistan to work across their common border to deal with insurgent and other terrorist activity that blight both countries, and cause significant difficulties for them. A lot of positive work is under way: I just wish that my hon. Friend would occasionally refer to that as well.</p>

 I was in Lashkar Gah the week before the Secretary of State and with reference to his earlier answer he did not tell the House that there are fewer schools and health clinics open in Helmand province this year than last year. One of the principal concerns that I heard from my colleagues in the Royal Engineers is that they are frustrated that, while they have been asked to undertake reconstruction and development work&#151;and progress has been made by the stabilisation unit&#151;the time that it takes to obtain the money for the project is getting longer.

 The hon. Gentleman says that it is true, but I do not recognise those statistics. For example, during the week that I was in Helmand province, the hospital in Garmsir opened for the first time in two years, because of the work achieved by Scots soldiers and Americans working together in that part of the province.</p>

Member for Bournemouth, East (Mr. Ellwood): we are currently investing $12 million a week through projects in Helmand province, which is $600 million a year. I think that that is quite a significant amount of money. The ability to invest there stretches the capacity and capability not only of the Afghans, but of our own forces.</p>

 May I associate myself with those whose thoughts are with the Paras who died last week?

Does my right hon.

 In my conversations with our troops on the ground in Helmand province, Kandahar and, indeed, Kabul, very many of them have said to me that their deepest frustration is with the failure of people back in this country to appreciate exactly what progress is being made&#151;the concentration always on the negative and the lack of understanding about how difficult an environment it is. I remind the House that Afghanistan has gone through the best part of four decades of violence and lost 2 million of its own people, and two generations in respect of education. In many parts of the country, only between 17 and 22 per cent. of the indigenous population can read and write. There needs to be some strategic patience with what we are trying to do. Nothing will happen year to year on a metric that meets the demands of some unreasonable commentators on what is happening in Afghanistan.</p>

 Is the Secretary of State aware of a report, which was published by Oxfam earlier this year, that found that the provincial reconstruction teams had extended beyond the remit that was originally intended at the expense of delivery by the local Afghan institutions? Does the Secretary of State believe that that is true? If so, how does he think that we can build up the capacity of the Afghan institutions so that they can deliver much more of their own aid, development and reconstruction?</p>

 I read many reports written by people about Afghanistan. The reports that I place greatest store by are those from people who are on the ground in Afghanistan, living and working in that environment. There is, however, an issue about provincial reconstruction teams. At present, the second in command of ISAF, who is a very experienced British general, is, at the request of the previous commander of ISAF, undertaking work on provincial reconstruction teams. On the question whether it is time in certain parts of Afghanistan to move from that sort of reconstruction support to longer term development, I think that the general will almost certainly conclude that in some circumstances provincial reconstruction can exist for too long. At present, however, that is hardly likely to apply to the south of Afghanistan, where most of the most difficult work is being done. Reconstruction is at the heart of what we need to do there.</p>

The operational allowance, introduced in October 2006, now stands at &#163;2,380 for a six-month deployment.

 A variety of factors affect recruitment and retention.

We always face challenges and we always look at various initiatives to deal with them. For instance, we obviously take advice from the Armed Forces Pay Review Body, and we have implemented its recommendations, but we continue to look at what more we can do to improve the pay and conditions of our armed forces.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman, who is a great defender of Haslar hospital, has done a lot of work over the years on the issue, and I recognise that he feels very strongly about it. However, I do not recognise his viewpoint as regards rehabilitation. Only a few weeks ago, we announced a &#163;24 million investment in Headley Court, which is our main rehabilitation centre. I think that everyone accepts that it is doing remarkable work in rehabilitating and helping our injured service personnel. In many cases that care now means that they can stay in the service and not necessarily leave. We also have a regional group of rehabilitation centres providing world-class treatment and support. We are continuing to invest in rehabilitation for our armed forces personnel to ensure that they get the best possible care and treatment.</p>

Does he accept that the role of a member of our armed forces is unique? Unlike any other public sector servant, our servicemen and women promise, by contract, to serve even until death. The public therefore need to be reassured that the remuneration that we are giving to those young men and women is adequate to the sacrifice that they are prepared to make. Some misleading comments have been made over the past month or two. Is he in a position to tell us about the value of packages available to soldiers serving, say, in Afghanistan so that we can cut through some of those stories and the public can be told what is the very minimum that is paid to a young soldier in Afghanistan?</p>

That is why we have accepted the Armed Forces Pay Review Body recommendations in full&#151;I must stress that to the House. In the case of a newly trained private who is going to Afghanistan, if we take into account certain benefits that they might receive, such as the operational allowance and the separation allowance, and the excellent contribution made by the very good pension scheme, the package can amount to about &#163;25,000.

 I can absolutely assure the hon. Gentleman and the House that I am not complacent about the level of pay. I have clearly stressed that we have an independent review body, and we accepted its recommendations in full. Additionally, we introduced an operational allowance, the separation allowance has been increased, we have introduced a council tax rebate and we are looking at what else we can do. The pay review body talks to armed forces personnel and their families around the world to get their view of conditions. The Chief of the General Staff and the other chiefs want to see further improvements and so does this ministerial team. I know for a fact that when I spoke to the Chief of the General Staff, he was pleased about the increase given this year.</p>

The key thing is that most people now accept that that deal, which was done by the previous Government, was not in the interests of armed forces personnel or their families, and we have had to deal with a legacy of decades of underinvestment. After 18 years in power, the Opposition could not solve that problem.

 My hon. Friend makes an important point, and I know that she takes a great interest in the matter. There is a contract, which was signed under the previous Government, to pay a set amount of money to Annington Homes under a deal that most people now recognise as pretty disastrous for accommodation for armed forces personnel. We have met representatives of Annington Homes to discuss what more we can to do to improve the housing position of our armed forces personnel.

 I know that the hon. Gentleman takes a great interest in the matters that we are considering. The response, repair and maintenance service in England and Wales now shows sustained performance levels, with more than 96 per cent. of service family accommodation meeting the move-in standard. More than 99 per cent. of emergency calls are dealt with in 24 hours, and customer satisfaction with the response, repair and maintenance service is consistently above 90 per cent. However, I accept that more needs to be done. We must ensure that we stop the problems occurring in future and that services continue to improve.

 Does the Minister not accept that retention is a serious problem and that many experienced, trained soldiers are leaving the forces early, for whatever reason? That was highlighted to me recently when my wife and I attended beating the retreat on Horse Guards as guests of the Army Benevolent Fund.

 Retention is a huge issue&#151;the hon. Gentleman is absolutely right&#151;but pay in itself is not the only answer to it. There are many complexities to the retention issue. We lose an awful lot of people during training and the Army is actively considering whether it can lose fewer during that process&#151;without lowering standards, but by looking at its procedures.</p>

But they get their soldiering experience much quicker, over a shorter time scale, than previous generations. Therefore, retention will remain a difficult, complex issue. We must continue to strive to do everything that we can to meet that challenge. The hon. Gentleman is right: we cannot afford to lose the skills in which we have invested so much.</p>

 It is accepted that NATO has found it difficult to transform itself from the most effective political-military organisation that the world has ever known, and one which was configured for a cold war situation, into one that can respond to the modern challenges. A common view is that a transformed NATO will have the capabilities that it needs to succeed in operations of the sort to which we currently deploy NATO troops, such as in Afghanistan or Kosovo; will use its resources efficiently to support our future needs; will have all its members sharing the burdens and risk of operations; will work better with organisations such as the European Union, UN and African Union; and will have a slimmed-down command structure, suitable for modern operations.</p>

 In November 2006, the Government decided to take the lead internationally in addressing the humanitarian concerns posed by certain types of cluster munitions. Since that date the United Kingdom has been actively engaged with the convention on conventional weapons, and in February 2007 it decided to join the Oslo process to drive the issue forward and secure the best possible humanitarian result. In March 2007, we withdrew two types of cluster munitions from service because we took the view that they would inflict unacceptable harm. We were the first country to do that after the Oslo conference, and we are one of the 46 nations to have supported the Oslo process from the outset. The Government are delighted with the outcome of the Dublin conference, where we gave a very strong lead.

My right hon. Friend knows more than anybody else how dependent on such work the shipbuilding industry is, particularly in Scotland, and the extent to which that relationship is at the heart of the United Kingdom. Those who work in those yards know fine well that if they are to preserve the skill base and to continue the historic contribution that they have made into the future for decades or more, it will depend on the British Government relying on their skill base in order to maintain the capability of the Royal Navy.</p>

 Last December, my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister set out a clear and long-term framework for bringing security and political, social and economic development to Afghanistan. I would like to give the House an update on some of the progress that we have made since then in Afghanistan, based on my most recent visit to Afghanistan last month, and to set out future plans for the UK&#146;s military contribution to the NATO-led international security assistance force&#151;ISAF.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o13"><a name="80616-0004.htm_para0"><a name="0806163000150">The security situation in Afghanistan has improved in the past 12 months. The Taliban&#146;s leadership has been targeted successfully, and recent operations in southern Helmand have disrupted severely their training and lines of communication. That has had two principal effects. First, their sphere of influence has been reduced; nine tenths of the security incidents are confined to one tenth of the country, and the rest is relatively peaceful. Secondly, we have seen them reduce their ambition from insurgency to terrorism. The Taliban&#146;s campaign is now limited to intimidating Afghan communities, coercing the vulnerable into becoming suicide bombers and carrying out brutal and indiscriminate attacks on the international community and, above all, on the Afghan men, women and children themselves. As the Taliban&#146;s conventional attacks have failed, we have seen their tactics shift to the use of mines, roadside bombs and suicide vests. Those tactics run deeply counter to the Afghan culture, as does the Taliban&#146;s reliance on paid foreign fighters&#151;the so-called &#147;$10 Talibs&#148;, who now make up the majority of those doing the fighting for them. I fully recognise that the Taliban&#146;s new tactics pose a different but very serious challenge, both to our forces and to the local people. We need to ensure that we do all that we can to mitigate the new danger, and I am fully engaged on ensuring that we do so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o14"><a name="80616-0004.htm_para1"><a name="0806163000151">I share the understandable international concern about the breakout from Kandahar prison that took place on Friday 13 June. The Government of Afghanistan are leading the response to the incident and we are monitoring that closely. We have always said that the challenge of supporting an Afghan lead on security goes wider than providing support to the Afghan armed forces to include the justice sector, and we are already engaged in supporting a programme of justice reform that includes work on prisons. International support to the Afghan Government&#146;s security response is being provided through NATO&#146;s presence in Kandahar. Let me conclude on this point by saying that notwithstanding the extremely serious nature of this incident, it does not change our view that the Taliban are losing the fight in southern Afghanistan.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o15"><a name="80616-0004.htm_para2"><a name="0806163000152">The Afghan people, like people the world over, long for security, stability and prosperity. They understand that the Taliban cannot deliver those things. Our forces, alongside the US, Canadian, Dutch, Australian and Danish forces, and many others, are in Afghanistan to fulfil a UN mandate, to support the elected Government, to train and mentor the Afghan army and police, and to give the Afghan people hope for the future. I believe, as I think do the majority of this House, that Afghanistan is a noble cause, but we also know that it comes at a tragic human cost, as we have been reminded over  <br>

the past week. The recent deaths of five members of 2 Para&#151;as well as the 97 other UK fatalities in Afghanistan since 2002 and all those UK personnel who have been wounded or otherwise scarred by this conflict&#151;are an enduring measure of the dangers that our young servicemen and women face on operations on our behalf.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o16"><a name="80616-0004.htm_para3"><a name="0806163000153">The military know better than anyone that this is a campaign that cannot be won by military means alone. Once security has improved&#151;it has already improved&#151; delivering improvements in infrastructure, governance, the rule of law, schools, hospitals and services must follow. Generating those things in a country that has been devastated by decades of conflict and that is the fourth poorest country in the world is difficult and challenging&#151;it will be a long-term endeavour. But I saw real progress there during my trip, and there is now a tangible sense that life for many Afghans is improving. In Helmand, they have a new and extremely able governor&#151;Governor Mangal&#151;who is spreading the writ of the Government of Afghanistan further into that once lawless province. During the week of my visit, the local people of Garmsir reopened their hospital for the first time in two years. In Lashkar Gah, they had also just opened a new high school, and some of the girls attending that school will represent the first women in their families ever to go to school and receive an education.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o17"><a name="80616-0004.htm_para4"><a name="0806163000154">We the UK are not alone in our commitment to Afghanistan. Last week, 80 countries and international organisations met in Paris at the international conference in support of Afghanistan. In Paris, the Afghan Government&#146;s national development strategy was launched. That plan provides an Afghan blueprint for the future development of their country. Last week in Paris, the international community pledged $20.4 billion to help to fund it and reaffirmed its support for Kai Eide&#146;s role in co-ordinating its efforts to help to deliver it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o18"><a name="80616-0004.htm_para5"><a name="0806163000155">I am not underestimating how much remains to be done, but the green shoots of development and democracy are becoming even more firmly rooted in a security environment that has improved out of all measure since UK forces deployed in southern Afghanistan two years ago.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o19"><a name="80616-0004.htm_para6"><a name="0806163000156">The focus on development does not mean that we are complacent about security&#151;in fact, far from it. As I said before, the shift in tactics, while being in one sense a sign of strategic weakness, presents us with a different but still very serious challenge&#151;one that our forces are confronting with the same courage, professionalism and intelligence that they have shown throughout the campaign. At the same time, the Prime Minister&#146;s December statement made it clear that, over time, we plan to rebalance our military commitment from one based on direct combat operations to one of support for the Afghans&#146; own security forces. There is some good news here: the Afghan national army is a success story. Afghan soldiers are fearless and redoubtable fighters and the ANA is respected and admired by the Afghan people. Their professional competence is also increasing by the day. The first ANA kandak&#151;or battalion&#151;has now reached capability milestone 1, which means that it is capable of fully independent operations. Our soldiers are finding that the mentoring that the Afghan national army requires has reduced as its capability and experience has grown. That is no mean achievement.</p>

<notus-date day="16" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>16 Jun 2008 : Column 677</b><br>

<p><a name="stpa_o20"><a name="80616-0004.htm_para7"><a name="0806163000157">Creating an effective police force is, however, proving to be a more difficult challenge. To accelerate that process, the coalition has introduced a process called focused district development, which is, in effect, a mass training and retraining of the Afghan national police, district by district. That ambitious plan has an annual budget of $2 billion, and it is making a big difference. But we have to accept that creating an independent, effective police force in Afghanistan will not happen overnight.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o21"><a name="80616-0004.htm_para8"><a name="0806163000158">Counter-insurgency campaigns are ultimately about winning the support of the local population. With the diminishing relevance of the Taliban&#146;s campaign and the increasing delivery of development, I am in little doubt that we are winning that, too. It is in this context that I have, with the military advice of the chiefs of staff, decided to make a number of adjustments to the profile of our forces in Afghanistan. Currently, we have 7,800 troops in Afghanistan deployed to Helmand, Kandahar and Kabul. As a result of a recent review, I have approved the removal of around 400 posts from the Afghan operational establishment table. Those posts are no longer required due to reorganisation and the changed nature of the tactical situation. At the same time, we have identified a requirement for, in total, 630 new posts, creating a net increase in our forces in Afghanistan of some 230 personnel, to around 8,030 by spring 2009.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o22"><a name="80616-0004.htm_para9"><a name="0806163000159">Broadly, those adjustments have three aims: first, to improve the protection afforded to our personnel; secondly, to increase the capacity of our forces to deliver training and mentoring to the Afghan national security forces; and thirdly, to increase the capacity of our forces to deliver the civil effects of reconstruction and development in an insecure or semi-secure environment. All those aims are vital if we are to sustain the progress that we are making.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o23"><a name="80616-0004.htm_para10"><a name="0806163000160">Let me set out the nature of those changes. The first objective of the force adjustments is to increase the protection that we are able to give to our brave servicemen and women as they conduct their mission in Afghanistan. In the months ahead, we will deploy more troops to man the additional Viking and Mastiff vehicles that we have already ordered. Further specialists will deploy to man reconnaissance and warning systems in our forward operating bases in Helmand. We will also reinforce the Royal Air Force Regiment squadron that helps defend Kandahar airfield.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o24"><a name="80616-0004.htm_para11"><a name="0806163000161">The House will recall that the improvements that we have made to ground support and crewing arrangements for our CH-47 Chinook and AH-64 Apache helicopters have increased the total amount of flying time per month available to our commanders in Afghanistan. Part of the uplift will be delivered by an increase in helicopter crews, which I am announcing today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o25"><a name="80616-0004.htm_para12"><a name="0806163000162">Among the most potent of all our capabilities in deterring and denying the insurgency is our ability to project close air support. In Afghanistan we have a contingent of Harrier GR7/GR9s that have proven time and again their value in defending the lives of our troops, our allies and those whom they are there to protect. The Harrier force first deployed to Kandahar airfield in November 2004 and has been operational continuously ever since. That is an impressive record by  <br>

any standards, but I am mindful of the strain that that extended deployment has put upon the crews, their families and the wider role of Joint Force Harrier. I have therefore decided to withdraw the Harrier force by spring 2009 and to replace it with an equivalent force of Tornado GR4s.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o26"><a name="80616-0004.htm_para13"><a name="0806163000163">I have already mentioned that by developing the Afghan security forces we are setting the conditions to allow them to take an increased role in their own security. To accelerate that we will expand our fourth operational mentor and liaison team to accelerate the development of the Afghan national army, and we will continue to train the Afghan national police. In particular, we will focus our efforts to help Afghan national army and police commanders to develop the skills they need to lead their forces effectively in a demanding and often very dangerous area.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o27"><a name="80616-0004.htm_para14"><a name="0806163000164">The improved security situation that our forces are generating has provided us with a real opportunity to increase the rate of our delivery of civil effect. I have therefore decided that when 3 Commando Brigade deploys to Afghanistan this October, it will deploy with an additional infantry battalion headquarters and sub-unit. The forces will operate in southern Helmand to ensure that we are able to consolidate and exploit the security gains that we have made in that area and 3 Commando Brigade will also deploy with an extra troop of Royal Engineers to support our provincial reconstruction team by undertaking quick impact projects in support of the local community. Those forces will be supported by more medical, logistical and equipment support troops.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o28"><a name="80616-0004.htm_para15"><a name="0806163000165">In addition we will attach civil-military co-operation officers to each of our battle groups and we will form military stabilisation teams on the model of the ad hoc team that we deployed with great success in the wake of the reoccupation of Musa Qala. Both measures will enable us to take forward development projects including quick impact projects in areas where the level of threat remains high.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o29"><a name="80616-0004.htm_para16"><a name="0806163000166">My announcement today of a net uplift of 230 additional troops does not in proportionate terms represent a very significant increase. It does mean our mission is expanding. It means we are taking the steps necessary to take our mission forward as effectively as we can, with a force whose profile and capabilities are optimised to the conditions that they face. As I have explained, the uplift and rebalancing will enable our forces to strengthen their protection and to increase the rate at which they can build Afghan capacity in security, governance and development. Some of those new capabilities will need a year before they are available for operations in Afghanistan, but others will deploy much sooner. Of course, we shall continue to work to develop the optimum balance of forces and capabilities, in conjunction with the Afghan Government and our allies, in what can be rapidly changing conditions. The additional forces will ensure we can maintain the growing reach of the Afghan Government in Helmand, increase the military contribution to development and accelerate the pace of Afghanisation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o30"><a name="80616-0004.htm_para17"><a name="0806163000167">We talk in this House in terms of numbers, units, and strategies, but as the events of the last week have reminded us all, behind these numbers are individual young men or women, working courageously in strange, difficult and dangerous conditions far from their family back home. I am constantly impressed by their bravery and resourcefulness, and on behalf of the Government  <br>

<p><a name="stpa_o33"><a name="80616-0004.htm_para20"><a name="0806163000171">We must always remember that we are in Afghanistan for reasons of national security, to deny a safe haven to those who would commit indiscriminate acts of terrorist murder on men, women and children. We must remember that it is an international mission sanctioned by the UN and led by NATO. The Afghanistan compact, which followed the London conference, set out four objectives: increased security, drug reduction, an efficient executive and economic and social development. Progress has been made on social development, but the process of government remains compromised by corruption and a lack of co-ordination between the military, reconstruction and political missions. The military command also needs greater clarity of purpose and simplification of structure&#151;a point regularly raised by my right hon. Friend the Leader of the Opposition, and he raised it again today in talks with President Bush.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o34"><a name="80616-0004.htm_para21"><a name="0806163000172">There has been no progress on the drugs issue, with no alternative sources of income being made available to those for whom growing poppies is the only means of feeding themselves. If anything, the situation has deteriorated. Security has improved in some parts of the country, as the Secretary of State said, but it remains undermined in the south by the continued insurgency, the breakout of Taliban prisoners in Kandahar, and the Pakistani Government&#146;s attitude to border issues. A former NATO commander, General McNeill, recently said that more troops were needed to defeat the Taliban-led insurgency. He said that</p>
<a name="80616-0004.htm_brev0"><a name="0806163000330"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;it&#146;s an under-resourced force&#148;,</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o35"><a name="80616-0004.htm_para22"><a name="0806163000173">and he expressed concern that NATO could become a &#147;two-tiered alliance&#148;, with an insufficient number of countries truly committed to fighting against the Taliban.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o36"><a name="80616-0004.htm_para23"><a name="0806163000174">We have seen how the fighting in the south of the country has been left to the Americans, the British, the Canadians, the Dutch and a number of valiant smaller forces, while some of the biggest NATO allies have been risk averse, to say the least. Will the Secretary of State give the House an assessment of how great a threat is posed to the achievement of the aims of the Afghan compact by the underactivity of some of our NATO allies, and does he agree that the message from the United Kingdom should be that it is unacceptable for all those in NATO to have the same insurance policy if only some of us pay the full premiums?</p>

Afghanistan. Does the Secretary of State believe that, with the increase that he announced today, the force size is now sufficient for the safety and effectiveness of our troops, and can he tell us by how many troops General McNeill believes NATO, as a whole, is short? How confident can the Secretary of State be that he can fill the 630 new posts that he announced today with correctly qualified personnel who have had sufficient rest and training? He tells us that some of the announcements that he made today will take a year to come into effect; can he be more specific on that point?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o38"><a name="80616-0004.htm_para25"><a name="0806163000176">Recent deaths in Afghanistan have shown the Taliban&#146;s shift towards suicide bombing as a tactic. We have seen in Iraq what that can mean. Will the Secretary of State give an assurance that all necessary protective equipment is available to minimise the risk to our armed forces on the ground, and can he give an assurance that there is the fullest co-operation from the Afghan police and military in attempting to minimise those threats? The increase announced today was predictable, but does it not make a mockery of the Government&#146;s national security strategy, published only 12 weeks ago, which said that</p>

Above all, we need to recalibrate expectations. We cannot simply drop a Jeffersonian democracy on to a broken 13th-century state and expect it to work in five or even 10 years&#146; time. It will be a long haul, so we must properly plan for a long haul, and not for six-month rotations for our commanders, or sixth-month or annual budget allocations for reconstruction efforts. We need to bring our military and financial planning into line with the political reality. I am sure that those on both sides of the House agree strongly that the costs of failure are far too high to contemplate.</p>

because of the contribution of our forces, but not only because of that, as he knows. Indeed, the situation in the south of Helmand province has largely been created by the deployment of the marine expeditionary unit that served with our forces in the lower part of the Helmand valley, and which has transformed the area around the town of Garmsir. I am responding to that, because that marine expeditionary unit plans to be there only until about November, so we are putting some forces down there who will work alongside Afghan security forces to hold what has been achieved and keep the Taliban from reinfecting that part of the country.</p>

I agree with the hon. Gentleman about sharing the burden across the whole alliance. I repeatedly make those points, and there is now some success to be gleaned from that advocacy, in which I and indeed others engage in NATO. I should share the statistics with the House, because they show an impressive commitment by the alliance, the broader ISAF alliance and, principally, by NATO. When NATO met in Riga last year, there were 32,000 forces in the ISAF. When we met in Bucharest, there were 47,000, but when NATO Ministers met in Brussels only last week, there were 50,000, and those numbers are increasing. That is a measure of the level of commitment: there are more helicopters, there is more helicopter time, and other allies are now taking steps, in conjunction with initiatives that we have generated, to improve helicopter availability. In short, the NATO alliance has been transformed by its engagement in Afghanistan. I have a different way of going about it from the hon. Gentleman, but I think that my way has shown significant progress in that regard, in the number of countries that are there, the absence of caveats for their forces, and the significant increase of force deployed in the south.</p>

 We have trained 55,000 members of the Afghan army to date, but they are not all trained to the level at which they can conduct operations without significant support from command and control, logistics and planning. As I said to the House earlier in Defence questions, the first kandak of that army has reached capability measurement 1, which means that it is capable of moving forward. There are other niche capabilities in the Afghan national army and security forces that are very effective. The other day, we saw the biggest ever haul of drugs seized by an Afghan force which we trained in part.</p>

ought to look at what has happened recently in Iraq. In a comparatively short period, the Iraqi army has gone from being almost totally dependent on the support of the allies to being capable of carrying out operations that it plans and commands itself. When one reaches the tipping point in relation to the training of an army, then, at least in my experience over the past two years, the process of improvement accelerates quite dramatically.</p>

In that regard, it is a matter of regret&#151;to me at least&#151;that the announcement should have been made on a day when George W. Bush is in the country. I fear that there is confusion in the public&#146;s mind between what we are doing in Afghanistan and in Iraq. The biggest connection between the two is overstretch, and the sooner the public can be persuaded to see those situations separately, the better our chances are of getting the public on board for a long haul in Afghanistan.</p>

House and, indeed, in the other place in respect of what we are seeking to do in Afghanistan. Of course, many people say that the mission is impossible. They either say that it cannot be done and we should not be engaged in Afghanistan, or they misrepresent the situation. They do exactly what I suspect the hon. Gentleman fears in respect of the coincidence of the visit of the President of the United States and the statement, which is to look at everything that we do militarily through the prism of Iraq. That is deeply unhelpful. I have spent a lot of my time as Secretary of State trying to persuade our media that Afghanistan is the right place for our people to be. The fact that 40 countries are involved and that many of the most developed social democratic countries in the world are present with troops on the ground is an indication of just how right it is.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o48"><a name="80616-0005.htm_para5"><a name="0806163000191">This morning I had a conversation with the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Ban Ki-moon, in which his support for what we are seeking to do in the context of the Security Council resolution was completely unwavering. We all have a responsibility to try to shift British public opinion. I believe that it has shifted in relation to the rightness of the mission and the military objectives, and we now have to shift it in relation to the progress being made in all the other complementary parts of the comprehensive approach and explain to them that we need strategic patience in order to do what we are doing in a very difficult and challenging environment.</p>

There may be several reasons for that. The hon. Gentleman rightly identifies that that generates an opportunity. The whole focus of our efforts in northern Helmand is designed to put together the secure spaces that we have generated and to control the ability to communicate between them. That is part of the key to creating a secure logistical environment for moving other, legitimate, crops around so that they will not be taken advantage of by the Taliban. That will be key to building sustainable alternative crops for the farmers in Helmand province.</p>

I would be grateful if he could confirm how many servicewomen will be going to Afghanistan as a result of his announcement; whether we have recruited any female translators, who are often the only people who can communicate with women on the ground; and what efforts are being made by ISAF to adopt a comprehensive plan regarding UN Security Council resolution 1325.</p>

Recently, the outgoing NATO general has said that he would wish to see 400,000 troops there.

made it clear to them that the deaths, terrible as they are, and which can never be explained in a way that is satisfactory to families, are part of a greater whole that has made a significant difference to many millions of people in Afghanistan. The men and women who do this work are genuine heroes. With respect, that work is not restricted to members of the armed forces.

The most relevant part of his question was his use of the past tense. We have made significant improvements. The last commander of ISAF, General McNeill, was very conscious of the effect that collateral damage, or civilian casualties, had on the overall mission, apart from the effect that it was having on those people caught up in it. He issued a series of instructions dealing with the issues raised by my hon. Friend, and they have had a significant effect. We should never forget that all the civilian casualties caused by ISAF operations are accidental. Those caused by the Taliban are, more often than not, caused deliberately.</p>

It was a positive speech, and I took great comfort from the knowledge that none of that could have come about were it not for the bravery of our armed forces. The Secretary of State referred to Afghanistan as a noble cause. In order that the British people fully appreciate that, could I urge him to redouble his efforts so that people know that our military personnel are making a huge difference to the lives of ordinary Afghans, ensuring that their country does not return to being a haven from which terrorism is exported around the world?</p>

What we need&#151;and I have been trying to get&#151;are more Afghans telling us the substantial difference between life now and what it was only five or six years ago, because of the presence of our young men and women in their country. That message will convince our people that the sacrifices and investments that we make in Afghanistan are worth while.

 My hon. Friend raises an issue mentioned by the hon. Member for Woodspring, which is key to a sustainable and peaceful future for Afghanistan. There is a mirror image of Afghanistan&#146;s problems on the other side of the border in the Fatah and tribal areas of Pakistan. With respect, hon. Members need to be consistent. We cannot celebrate the election of a democratic Government in Pakistan without living with the consequences of control in that country moving from the military to politics. The engagement with politics in the areas that we are considering will create challenges for that Government, but we universally welcomed the elections, to the extent that they were successful, in Pakistan. However, they have consequences. The army is moving from the position that it previously occupied in the Pakistani community, and that change is important to the future stability of that part of the world. When I was in Afghanistan and subsequently in Pakistan, and when I spoke this morning to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, I concentrated on the need&#151;I know that my colleagues do it all the time with institutions and on visits to the region&#151;to get the two countries to work together across the border, recognise that they share a series of common problems and stop blaming each other for the problems in their countries. That is the only way we will make progress.</p>

 Following directly from that, does the Secretary of State agree that one of the key issues is that of patrolling the border between Afghanistan and Pakistan? To do that, we need to fulfil the terms of NATO&#146;s combined joint statement of requirements&#151;in other words, provide more troops. Does the Secretary of State agree that that is the only way we can avoid the catastrophe of the forces of Afghanistan or Pakistan making incursions into the other?

 The necessity for a battle group that can manoeuvre around the border is crucial. However, that is only part of the solution to problems on the border. I emphasise that there are 2,900 km of the most mountainous border one can imagine. There needs to be an acceptance on both sides of it that both countries face the same problems, with the same roots. There are opportunities for the two Governments to speak to each other. Indeed, the Foreign Minister of Pakistan was in Kabul immediately after I was there and after I spoke to him in Pakistan. Some progress was made, although this morning&#146;s press conference or statements by President Karzai suggest that the progress has gone backwards a bit. However,  <br>

we need to keep working with those two countries so that their forces, which will be there in the long term, recognise the issues that they have in common on that border. If we can get them to live up to commitments made separately to secure and police the border, that is as much a long-term issue as any challenge that we face in that part of the world.</p>

 The Afghan economy has grown at the rate of about 9 per cent. or more a year since 2001. Frankly, however, that masks the problem in the Afghan economy, which is that a substantial proportion of the real economy relies on drugs. Breaking the link between the Afghan economy and its dependence on drugs is crucial. At the heart of that is the ability to deal with the comparatively small number of people who are extremely influential in Afghanistan. My assessment is that if we can develop the governance and justice system of Afghanistan in the short term, so that it can deal with the comparatively small number of very influential families and their leaders, we will be able to make important progress in developing the Afghan economy. However, exactly when we will be able to do that will be a function of our ability to get the Afghan capacity built up.

 I have no difficulty in acceding to my hon. Friend&#146;s request. Everybody who has made a contribution to the success we have enjoyed in Afghanistan, the recognised improvement in security there and the creation of the opportunity to which this announcement is designed to respond deserves the utmost credit. That is true whether they do what they do in uniform or out of it. In whatever way they have contributed, we should celebrate the success of these extraordinarily brave, dedicated and professional people.</p>

Will the Secretary of State take this opportunity to confirm that, as far as he is aware, these accusations are entirely baseless?

 I do not think the hon. Gentleman believes these allegations either&#151;at least, I hope he does not. There are often people who advise President Karzai of some quite bizarre allegations in respect of ISAF, and I have personally had to disabuse him on many occasions. I remember that on one occasion, a deeply corrupt individual who had access to the President&#146;s ear advised him that we were, in fact, training the Taliban; I wondered why that was given any consideration at all.</p>

although I often personally disagree with him in his analysis, I respect the man as the democratically elected leader of the country. In my view, we should support him to move forward as long as he is the democratic leader, and we should give him a little bit of leeway in what he says publicly.</p>

 The Secretary of State stressed the importance of security and intelligence, saying that he was not complacent. This has not been mentioned so far, but what role does he see for the spy in the sky&#151;the Nimrod aircraft, particularly the upgraded MRA4? They could provide fantastic information from observation and reconnaissance not only over the Pakistan-Afghan border, but from elsewhere, to give warning about what the Taliban are doing and their movements.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman makes a good point. One lesson of deploying the current Nimrod to do exactly that in Afghanistan has been an astonishing level of detailed information. He will forgive me if I do not, in public, go into just how effective it can be. I know that those who fly the aircraft look forward to the updated and further-invested version and the capabilities that it will have. This aircraft not only can be used in a maritime environment, but has proved very important to our capability above Afghanistan, and indeed above Iraq.</p>

 It is probably a bit early to be asking whether people who were sprung from prison on Friday night have made any statistical difference to the people whom we will face.

<h3 align="center">Political Parties (Funding and Expenditure)</h3>
<a name="ordayhd_1"><a name="80616-0006.htm_ordayhd0"><a name="0806163000340"><h5 align="left">4.32 pm</h5>
<p><a name="st_o137"><a name="0806163000230"><a name="80616-0006.htm_spmin0"><a name="0806163000495"><b>The Secretary of State for Justice and Lord Chancellor (Mr. Jack Straw):</b>
 With permission, Mr. Speaker, I would like to make a statement about the funding of political parties. The Government are today publishing a White Paper on party finance and expenditure in the United Kingdom. Copies are available in the Vote Office and on my Department&#146;s website.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o57"><a name="80616-0006.htm_para3"><a name="0806163000231">How our politics is funded is vital for the health of any democratic system, including ours. Over the last decade, important steps have been taken towards achieving this. In 1998, the Committee on Standards in Public Life under its then chairman, Lord Neill of Bladen, published a landmark report, which went on to form the basis of the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o58"><a name="80616-0006.htm_para4"><a name="0806163000232">It must also be fundamental to the health of our democracy that the regime for regulating political parties should never be used as a partisan tool by one party against others, and instead that change should be by way of broad cross-party agreement and achieved in a manner that carries wider public support. That spirit led to the passage of the 2000 Act by consensus and continues to be a guiding principle for this&#151;and I hope any&#151;Government&#146;s approach.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o59"><a name="80616-0006.htm_para5"><a name="0806163000233">The 2000 Act represented the first major overhaul of the regulation of party funding and expenditure for more than 100 years. It has greatly helped to improve transparency and standards, but it has not proved sufficient. In the intervening period, there has been continuing public disquiet about many aspects of how parties and politicians are funded. In March 2006, Sir Hayden Phillips was therefore invited by the then Prime Minister, Tony Blair, to conduct a further review, including as to whether state funding should be enhanced in return for a cap on donations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o60"><a name="80616-0006.htm_para6"><a name="0806163000234">Sir Hayden&#146;s final report was published in this House on 15 March last year. It made major recommendations for reform of the Electoral Commission, for tightening the controls on expenditure, for greater transparency and for a gradual move to enhanced state funding linked to a cap on donations. All parties explicitly welcomed Sir Hayden&#146;s report and accepted its main recommendations, including those for cross-party talks chaired by him to take forward the report&#146;s recommendations. Those talks proceeded satisfactorily until last year&#146;s summer recess. Sir Hayden then issued detailed proposals based on what he judged might form the basis for a consensus between the parties. It is a matter of great regret that, in late, October one of the parties decided to walk out of the talks, making agreement impossible.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o61"><a name="80616-0006.htm_para7"><a name="0806163000235">Against that background, Her Majesty's Government undertook in the Queen&#146;s Speech to bring forward proposals on party finance and expenditure. The White Paper is the result. It proposes measures to improve the regulatory system. It sets out the Government&#146;s aspiration for long-term comprehensive reform, building on the model proposed by Sir Hayden Phillips. In those areas where the Government believe that a broad consensus exists, it outlines plans to bring forward immediate legislation, including reform of the Electoral Commission and more effective controls on candidate spending.</p>

<notus-date day="16" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>16 Jun 2008 : Column 692</b><br>

<p><a name="stpa_o62"><a name="80616-0006.htm_para8"><a name="0806163000236">The excessive spending by parties and candidates gives rise to the wider problems with party finance that we see today. Repeated independent reviews&#151;including those from Sir Hayden Phillips, the Committee on Standards in Public Life and the then Constitutional Affairs Committee&#151;have called the problem a &#147;spending arms race&#148;, although some individuals, I know, still question its existence. But a spending arms race is evident within each electoral cycle. As Sir Hayden&#146;s report said, spending by the two largest parties was &#163;90 million in the 12 months preceding the 2005 election, up from &#163;65 million in the 12 months before the 2001 election. That was despite the campaign limit being set at &#163;20 million for each party. Although the parties did not act unlawfully, their ability to spend well above the campaign limit under the Act reveals a problem with the rules. In the interests of democracy, we need finally to achieve what all parties had sought to do through the 2000 Act, and to stop this damaging arms race.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o63"><a name="80616-0006.htm_para9"><a name="0806163000237">The White Paper proposes some important steps for immediate action. Strengthening the Electoral Commission will send a clear signal that politics and politicians are effectively scrutinised: never above the law. The Electoral Commission will have robust civil sanctions to deploy, with criminal proceedings as an alternative. The commission will have more effective investigatory powers, enabling it to access information from anybody when it suspects a breach of the rules. Its governance arrangements will be overhauled better to ensure that greater practical experience is available to it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o64"><a name="80616-0006.htm_para10"><a name="0806163000238">The Committee on Standards in Public Life, the then Constitutional Affairs Committee and Sir Hayden Phillips all recommended that the commission would benefit from the knowledge and judgment of individuals with political backgrounds. Therefore, we propose, as the Committee on Standards in Public Life recommended, the appointment of four commissioners with recent political experience and fewer restrictions on staff appointments. Far from politicising the Commission, that will enable it better to understand the people it regulates and so help it to do a more effective job.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o65"><a name="80616-0006.htm_para11"><a name="0806163000239">There has been widespread concern that a loophole in the 2000 Act has allowed certain unincorporated associations to obscure the original source of donations to parties. Therefore, as the Phillips review proposed, those will be better regulated, as will third-party campaigning organisations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o66"><a name="80616-0006.htm_para12"><a name="0806163000240">Let me turn to spending by parties. In 2000, when I took through the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act, all believed that we were, in the words of Lord Neill&#146;s report, &#147;buttressing&#148; the existing restrictions on spending, including those in the Representation of the People Act 1983 and its predecessors. What we did not foresee at the time was the likelihood of significant increased and unregulated candidate spending as a result of the detailed drafting of the Bill, although the late Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish, who was on the Conservative Front Bench, sought to alert us to the problem by tabling a clarifying amendment on behalf of his party.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o67"><a name="80616-0006.htm_para13"><a name="0806163000241">The White Paper proposes a return to the system of &#147;triggering&#148;, which will regulate all candidate spending directed towards electoral success, and which was a key feature of the last Administration&#146;s 1983 Act. A stronger, more focused Electoral Commission will help to avoid   <br>

the previous uncertainty about the rules. In parallel with that, we propose to re-examine the list of activities that are defined as campaign spending.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o68"><a name="80616-0006.htm_para14"><a name="0806163000242">Let me turn to the question of introducing donation caps in return for enhanced state funding. To do that, we would have to carry with us not only all the main parties, but the public&#151;the taxpayer&#151;as well. That is not happening at present. We are very ready to have the debate, and, indeed, to discuss donation caps at a lower level than Sir Hayden recommended, but that will require us to come together to allow discussion between the parties and the public. I intend to introduce a Bill before the summer recess, but with Second Reading taking place in the early autumn and the other stages being carried over into the next Session. That will provide ample opportunity both for comments to be made to us and for scrutiny to be carried out.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o69"><a name="80616-0006.htm_para15"><a name="0806163000243">By any international comparison, the standards of our political system have long been high. Nothing more infuriates most Members of Parliament, local councillors and, especially, the thousands of unpaid voluntary activists in all parties than the fact that their work and good faith can be tainted by the failures of a very few. However, perceptions matter hugely. I hope the whole House recognises the imperative in these circumstances of strengthening the probity of British politics and of people&#146;s faith in our democratic process as a whole. That is the principal aim of the White Paper, and we hope that all parties will support us in our endeavour. I commend the statement and the White Paper to the House.</p>

<p><a name="st_o138"><a name="0806163000244"><a name="80616-0006.htm_spnew9"><a name="0806163000496"><b>Mr. Francis Maude (Horsham) (Con):</b>
 I thank the Secretary of State for advance sight of his statement and of the White Paper. I think the whole House will agree that party funding reform is very much needed to restore trust in our politics, and to deal with the perception that large donations, whether from individuals or from organisations such as trade unions, can buy undue influence over policy or patronage.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o70"><a name="80616-0006.htm_para16"><a name="0806163000245">I entirely agree with the Secretary of State that perceptions matter hugely. That is why we produced radical reform proposals early in 2006, well before Sir Hayden&#146;s appointment. Sir Hayden, incidentally, deserves our huge thanks for the enormous work that he put in. His proposals on Electoral Commission reform are especially welcome. We took part in the discussions enthusiastically, and, as evidence of our commitment to reaching agreement, even accepted that an overall settlement could include an increase in state funding, although we neither seek that nor consider it desirable. We further accepted that there could be overall caps on spending by parties, although it is clearly how money is raised that worries the public, not how much is spent. <i> [Interruption.] </i>It is interesting to note that Sir Hayden&#146;s terms of reference refer only to donations. Spending by parties does not even get a mention.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o71"><a name="80616-0006.htm_para17"><a name="0806163000246">The Secretary of State will recollect that, in setting up the review, Tony Blair said explicitly that there would be no no-go areas and, in particular, that trade union funding should not be exempt from any donation caps. Was it not always understood that reform must be comprehensive, and that there should be no cherry-picking to serve the governing party&#146;s partisan interests&#151;that  <br>

<notus-date day="16" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>16 Jun 2008 : Column 694</b><br>
nothing would be agreed until everything was agreed? Does the Secretary of State accept that a partisan Bill now cannot provide the basis for a long-term and sustainable settlement? Has he read the independent research by Dr. Pinto-Duschinsky, which shows that there is no arms race in party spending? Is this not a myth to give credence to a bankrupt Labour party&#146;s desire to hamstring its opponents?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o72"><a name="80616-0006.htm_para18"><a name="0806163000247">Will the Justice Secretary agree that the discussions came very close to overall agreement, but foundered on the key issue of whether trade union donations should be subject to donation caps on the same basis as other donations? Will he now place in the Library the minutes and the background papers to the review, which will show that it was Labour&#146;s refusal to allow further work on trade union funding that brought the talks to an end? Does he recall that he and Peter Watt&#151;the then Labour general secretary&#151;refused point blank even to discuss giving trade union members the right to a real choice in whether to pay the political levy? <i> [Interruption.] </i>Well, does the Secretary of State remember the revelation that a Lib Dem MP received a ballot paper for Labour&#146;s leadership contest, having unwittingly become a Labour party member through a trade union? Will he not acknowledge that when trade unions routinely declare that 100 per cent. of their members&#151;and in two cases, more than 100 per cent.&#151;are paying the political levy, the idea that these are voluntary individual donations to Labour are laughable, especially when polling shows that fewer than half of union members even vote Labour, let alone want to support it financially?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o73"><a name="80616-0006.htm_para19"><a name="0806163000248">Does the Secretary of State accept that his proposal to reintroduce &#147;triggering&#148; was not even part of Sir Hayden&#146;s draft agreement? Is not this change designed to make it more difficult&#151;a caption in the White Paper makes this clear&#151;for candidates to campaign effectively, and thus to benefit sitting Labour MPs? Does the Secretary of State not understand that it would be an atrocious abuse of power for the Government to force through restrictions on what parliamentary candidates can spend from money they have raised privately, while sitting MPs can spend ever-more taxpayers&#146; money on promoting themselves?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o74"><a name="80616-0006.htm_para20"><a name="0806163000249">Last year, we came close to an overall comprehensive agreement that could genuinely have started to repair the public&#146;s trust in politics, and I say to the Justice Secretary that we can still achieve this. However, it would require Labour to accept that dependence on a small number of union bosses has to end. Sadly, it is hard to see that happening when 92 per cent. of Labour&#146;s income comes from the unions, who even now are squaring up to demand their payback in the form of a Warwick agreement mark 2. It is precisely Labour&#146;s dependence on these union bosses and the big donor culture that is preventing us from getting the reform that our politics so desperately needs.</p>

Gentleman may, if he wishes, put in a freedom of information request for the minutes, but he has not yet done so. That would deal with this situation, however. An independent individual could judge the issue. We would consider this, but it is a matter for Hayden Phillips, not for me. However, we do not need FOI requests or the minutes of the meeting, because two other Members of this Chamber as well, as the right hon. Gentleman, bear witness to precisely what happened. The truth is that, as we have just witnessed from his partisan approach&#151;which was totally different from the one that he and his party colleagues adopted in the working party&#151;the Conservative party decided to move away from the main recommendations of the Hayden Phillips report. <i> [Interruption.] </i>Did the right hon.

It said, again endorsed by Sir Hayden Phillips, words to the effect that no party had the right by legislation to seek to change the constitution of another party. We have never done so. We could have when we had a very considerable majority in this House back in 1999 and 2000; we still have, and we are not going to do so.</p>

In general, however, I have to say that this is a woefully inadequate package, and the Secretary of State is getting scant reward for his modesty from the official Opposition. There is nothing in this statement that will stop the arms race between the parties. He was quite right in his remarks about Dr. Pinto-Duschinsky&#146;s paper&#151;which was, by the way, produced and published by a Conservative-leaning think-tank. Nor is there anything that will clean up party funding by capping big contributions. There are no caps on donations or local spending, and is public confidence not at a low because the Labour and Conservative parties are seen to be in the pockets of big business or the trade unions?</p>

Lord Ashcroft already accounted for 8 per cent. of Conservative funding last year. The Justice Secretary says that he can legislate only with all-party consensus, but in that case, many abuses would never have been cleared up, including some of the most anti-democratic practices of the trade union movement that were put right in 1984 by the Conservative party against the Labour party&#146;s views at that time. Are we now to give miscreants a right of veto over new offences?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o82"><a name="80616-0007.htm_para4"><a name="0806163000261">Does the Justice Secretary really think it just a coincidence that the Conservative party broke off cross-party talks in the very quarter when it took record donations of &#163;9.7 million, which was an increase on the previous quarter&#146;s &#163;3.7 million and a record quarter for a non-election year? Was that mere coincidence? Why should the Government not now legislate to remove the stink of big-money politics? Is it not time that millions of votes, not millions of pounds, decided British elections?</p>

It was very difficult then to take that forward without the kind of constructive negotiation in which representatives of the Liberal Democrats, Labour and the Conservatives were participating perfectly happily until the summer recess last year. That is the problem. If the Conservative party now wishes to go back to where it was last July, we are happy to join it, and I believe that the right hon.

 The recommendation on the communications allowance happened to be a unanimous one from the House of Commons Commission, but I understand the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point.

 Sir Hayden Phillips did a very good job during the talks, in which I played a part, in establishing near consensus on a wide range of issues concerned with party finance. He also found some of the answers, until the Conservative party decided to change the question rather late in the day and therefore left the talks. Is it not therefore very disappointing that the proposals that the Lord Chancellor has brought forward today fail properly to address the issues of the cap on donations and expenditure and to make the significant changes to the transparency and propriety of trade union funding that we agreed?</p>

It is disappointing, but we can make progress, if there is broad agreement across the Chamber on spending controls, which is what we are proposing.

Some enlightened Members of the Opposition see that their interest lies in closing the loopholes, but others see that their interest lies in keeping them open. Those who want to keep the loopholes open are the ones who benefit from being able to escape controls on party spending by channelling money to local candidates and bypassing the controls on anonymous and foreign donations by channelling money to unincorporated associations.</p>

Those issues are complicated and&#151;let us be clear about it&#151;an increase in state funding would be involved, at a time when there are big questions about whether the taxpayer would be willing to bear that. There are many other complications, too. However, we were close to an agreement, and I hope that one day we will be close to one again.</p>

<p><a name="st_o189"><a name="0806163000312"><a name="80616-0008.htm_spmin0"><a name="0806163000547"><b>The Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs (David Miliband):</b>
 It is a pleasure and a privilege to be able to make this statement today. <i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> I urge right hon. and hon. Members to contain their enthusiasm. With your permission, Madam Deputy Speaker, I should like to make a statement about the Irish referendum on the Lisbon treaty, which was held last Thursday. The no vote on the treaty in the referendum is important because of our strong national interest in an effective European Union, and that vote needs to be respected. The next step is for the Irish Government to give their views on how to proceed from this point, consistent with their aims for Ireland&#146;s role in the EU. They have made it clear that they need time to absorb and analyse the result and its implications and to consult widely at home and abroad. The Irish Prime Minister has said that he is disappointed by the result but wants Ireland to continue to play a full part in the life of the EU.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o87"><a name="80616-0008.htm_para0"><a name="0806163000313">I have just returned from a meeting of EU Foreign Ministers in Luxembourg, and that message was reiterated by the Irish Foreign Minister at that meeting. He emphasised the diverse nature of the Irish debate, and the overlap in the debate between issues that are affected by the treaty and those that are not. He also expressed his appreciation that around Europe, leaders had committed themselves to work co-operatively with Ireland. He committed Ireland to work for a common European approach, with Ireland at the heart of Europe. There will be further discussion among Heads of State and Foreign Ministers at the European Council this Thursday and Friday not to take final decisions but to hear a preliminary report from the Irish Government and preliminary thoughts on the next steps.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o88"><a name="80616-0008.htm_para1"><a name="0806163000314">The rules of the treaty and of the EU are clear. All 27 member states must ratify the treaty for it to come into force, and we on the Government Benches will defend that principle extremely strongly. There is no question of ignoring the Irish vote or of bulldozing Irish opinion. Ireland clearly cannot be bound by changes that it has not ratified. Equally, there is no appetite for a return to years of institutional negotiation. The EU as a whole needs to find a way forward for all countries that allows the EU to focus on the big policy issues that confront us.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o89"><a name="80616-0008.htm_para2"><a name="0806163000315">Eighteen countries have approved the Lisbon treaty. The Irish Government have set out clearly their respect for the right of other countries to complete their ratification processes. My conversations with other Foreign Ministers, representing all shades of political opinion across the EU, show this to be a very strongly held view. The reason for the approach is simple: an Irish vote is determinant of an Irish position but cannot determine the ratification decision of other countries. The British view is for this Parliament to determine. In this House and the other place, there have been 24 days of debate, and both Houses have voted strongly in favour of the European Union (Amendment) Bill at each stage. The final stage is Third Reading in the other place on Wednesday.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o90"><a name="80616-0008.htm_para3"><a name="0806163000316">The Government believe that ratification should proceed as planned. It must be right that every country takes its own view on the treaty in accordance with its democratic  <br>

traditions. That is right according to democratic principle; it is right in terms of our negotiating position in the EU; and it is right in terms of our national interest.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o91"><a name="80616-0008.htm_para4"><a name="0806163000317">Our national interest is a strong Britain in a strong European Union. The EU now consists of 27 countries and 490 million people. The reform of EU institutions and working practices is important to ensure that the EU can function more effectively and cohesively, and to ensure that the EU embraces an outward-looking agenda that tackles in an effective way international issues such as migration, climate change, security and defence policy and counter-terrorism. But treaty change rightly requires unanimity across all countries. That is why it is right that we take the time to allow the Irish Government to make proposals on what they will do next, right that we assert Britain&#146;s national interest in an effective EU that addresses the problems of the modern world, and right that we work to maintain the cohesion of the EU. That is what the Government will be doing in the weeks and months ahead, and I commend that approach to the House.</p>

 The Foreign Secretary began by saying that the referendum result in Ireland is important because of our national interest in an effective European Union. I agree with him about that, but I hope that he agrees with me that it is also important because it is an inspiring example of democracy in action. People say that there is a disconnection between the EU and its peoples, but Thursday&#146;s vote was proof that when people are given a real say on the EU, they respond in vast numbers with turnout higher than in any European elections held in this country. Was it not also a courageous vote, given that the threats that Ireland would suffer if it voted no did not deter the Irish from making their own decision on the treaty? I am sorry that the Foreign Secretary did not find it in himself to congratulate Irish voters on either of those points.</p>

Given that no one would ever call the peoples of France, the Netherlands and Ireland anti-European, is it not now clearer than ever that it is absurd to describe as anti-European disagreement with a treaty that further centralises power away from Europe&#146;s nation states towards remote EU institutions?</p>

from them? Did not a previous Labour Foreign Secretary set out the only right course for this country yesterday, when he wrote:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o97"><a name="80616-0008.htm_para10"><a name="0806163000324">So why, given that after those referendums the then Foreign Secretary came here to announce that the ratification of the constitution was suspended, has this Foreign Secretary come here to announce the opposite? Is the message that in today&#146;s EU small countries do not count?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o98"><a name="80616-0008.htm_para11"><a name="0806163000325">Should not the Government now plainly state that Britain will suspend ratification in this country immediately, give a clear message at this week&#146;s summit that the treaty is finished, and make the fundamental point that no lasting political institutions can be built in democratic societies without the people&#146;s consent? Is that not what real respect for the referendum would mean? Is it not essential that all preparations for implementing the treaty, including on the European External Action Service, are now suspended and that the EU takes no action that is not legally provided for under the current treaties? Does the Foreign Secretary agree that respecting the result means not asking the Irish people to vote again? Will he undertake on the Government&#146;s behalf that they will take no part in any bullying of Ireland? Would it not be extraordinary for the Irish to vote twice on this treaty, when British voters have not had the opportunity to vote once?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o99"><a name="80616-0008.htm_para12"><a name="0806163000326">The Foreign Secretary has said that ratification here must proceed so that there can be a &#147;British view&#148; on the treaty, but the reality is that the Government have never spoken for the British view. If they want to find out the British view, are there not two very easy ways for them to do so? The first is to call a general election, of which the Prime Minister is, with good reason, terrified; and the second is to keep the promise that the Government made at the last election to call a referendum in the United Kingdom, which would assuredly tell the people of Ireland that in rejecting the Lisbon treaty they are by no means alone.</p>

He says that that treaty would make life simple. The first thing that will happen, if we embrace the Nice treaty as he recommends, is a new institutional debate about the number of commissioners&#151;an issue left unresolved by the Nice treaty. Precisely the sort of institutional discussion that he says we should abandon or move beyond would be restarted by his proposal.</p>

It is right, therefore, that the Czech Government cannot proceed with ratification at this stage, because the treaty is before their court.

He is absolutely right about that, which is why I defended today&#151;and will continue to defend&#151;the right of the Irish Government to take their time about how they want to respond to this result, and how they want to come back to the matter. It is for the Irish Government to decide what their position is going to be. The treaty cannot come into force unless the Irish Government succeed in ratifying it&#151;it cannot succeed in coming into force&#151;and the Irish constitution is absolutely plain that constitutional change requires the consent of the people; it is absolutely clear on that. That is why it is right that we wait for them to decide on their next steps, but it is also right that we are clear about our responsibilities to ensure that there is a British view in the discussions. That is what we are determined to do.</p>

 I will start with the hon. Gentleman&#146;s last point: the way in which the European Union can bridge the gap between politicians and people, whether nationally or at European level, is to ensure that it focuses on the issues that matter to people. International issues such as energy and climate change, migration and terrorism are precisely those that the European Union should address.</p>

It is important to proceed with ratification because the Lisbon treaty is good for Britain&#151;among other things, it increases our voting weight.

 The right hon.

If the treaty is not ratified in Ireland, it cannot come into force across the European Union. As my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Edgbaston (Ms Stuart) said, that issue needs to be addressed&#151;I have not described it as a problem, because it would be wrong to do so and would imply that the Irish were somehow doing something that was beyond their rights.

In respect of the first part of the question, I do not think that now is the time to start cherry-picking parts of the Lisbon treaty. The rules are clear&#151;that the treaty comes into force if all 27 member states ratify it&#151;and we should rest there at the moment.

 The hon. Gentleman underestimates the Irish people if he thinks that talking to the French and Germans&#151;as if that were some kind of sin in the European Union&#151;will bully them into anything. However, I can tell him one thing that will make him happy: I had an excellent discussion with the Polish Foreign Minister today about the plans for each of our countries. The hon.

 I beg to move, That the Bill be now read a Second time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o126"><a name="80616-0011.htm_para3"><a name="08061637000006">Every child should have the right to be happy, healthy, safe and successful, and we must help families to stay together and achieve the best for their children. When that is not possible, however, it is our duty to ensure that an outstanding system of public care is in place: a system that is ambitious for children, provides them with good parents, puts a premium on their needs and wishes, and will accept for those children no less than we would want for our own. Many Members in all parts of the House have promoted the interests of children in care, and I welcome the support that the Bill has received. I am sure that today&#146;s debate and our deliberations in Committee will continue that constructive dialogue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o127"><a name="80616-0011.htm_para4"><a name="08061637000007">As well as introducing specific measures for children in care, the Bill enables a statutory duty, for the first time, to be placed on the Secretary of State to promote the well-being of children, complementing the existing duty to promote educational achievement and embedding the principles of Every Child Matters at the heart of government. As with all duties, uses of the duty for significant long-term commitments will always be subject to the usual parliamentary procedure and authority, but this unequivocal commitment to all children, a landmark in any terms, matters most to those for whom the state has parental responsibility.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o128"><a name="80616-0011.htm_para5"><a name="08061637000008">Approximately 60,000 children are in care at any one time, in most cases because of abuse or neglect. They need the highest standard of care to help them to overcome the multiple disadvantages that they often face&#151;disadvantages that all too often contribute to a host of poor outcomes. For example, looked-after children are five times less likely to achieve five good GCSEs, eight times more likely to be excluded from school and nine times more likely to have special educational needs. Just under half have a mental health problem, and a quarter of adults in prison today have been in care.</p>

Does my right hon.

 I pay tribute to my hon. Friend&#146;s work, and the expertise that she has acquired in helping us with our proposals. I am particularly grateful to her for examining what happens, or currently does not happen, to inspection reports. I know that she has discussed the issue with the Under-Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families, my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, West (Kevin Brennan). We shall want to explore with her ways in which the use to which inspection reports are put can include the elements that she has mentioned, and thus become a much stronger lever for improvement in the quality of care.</p>

 On outcomes for children in care, I welcome the provisions on support for those in higher education, but will the Minister give more support to children who want to go into vocational education or apprenticeships in the way that I did?</p>

 Yes, that is equally important. The current provisions allow for the funding of first-time level 2 and level 3 vocational courses, and also for local authorities to contribute to children&#146;s subsistence costs when they go into vocational education&#151;and I am pleased to say that more of them are going into that. The real issue at present, however, is that only 6 per cent. go to university, which is why we have placed an emphasis on enabling them to do so more readily.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o129"><a name="80616-0011.htm_para6"><a name="08061637000013">The figures I was citing mean that a child in care is more likely to end up in custody than at a university. That is not to say that outcomes for children in care have not improved over recent years; they have done, as a result of measures introduced by this Government. The five-year Quality Protects programme began the reform of children&#146;s services, the Children (Leaving Care) Act 2000 was designed to delay young people being discharged from care until they are ready, and the Children Act 2004 and the Every Child Matters programme are transforming multi-agency arrangements for vulnerable children. Indeed, the Every Child Matters programme and the children&#146;s plan have given us the essential platform for the further reforms in this Bill.</p>

 I am grateful to my right hon. Friend for giving way and for the great leadership she has shown in this area.

the life chances of all children have improved, those of children in care have not improved as fast, and although their poor outcomes are undoubtedly significantly related to the serious problems with which they come into care, for too many children they are also exacerbated by the very experience of care itself. Multiple placements, successive social workers and moving school at crucial times all militate against the stability and strong attachments that these children need in order to thrive. Therefore, our priority in this Bill is to achieve a step change in the improvements we have already begun to see for children in care, to enable them to progress further and faster and, crucially, to close the inequality gaps between them and other children.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o132"><a name="80616-0011.htm_para9"><a name="08061637000018">The Bill follows the Care Matters White Paper that we published last June, which set out our strategy to transform the life chances of children in care. It drew on detailed and extensive research and a wide-ranging consultation with children and young people themselves, parents, carers, local authorities and voluntary organisations. The Bill and the White Paper enshrine four key principles: good parenting from every person involved in these children&#146;s lives; the voice of young people being at the heart of the system; stability and continuity as its hallmarks; and an uncompromising culture of high aspirations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o133"><a name="80616-0011.htm_para10"><a name="08061637000019">We all understand the importance of strong, warm, interested parents in developing happy and successful children. When a child lacks that support from their own parents, we have not just a legal, but a moral responsibility, to look after children in care as well as any good parent would. The Bill embeds good &#147;corporate parenting&#148; across the whole care system&#151;from carers, teachers and social workers to directors of children&#146;s services and elected lead members. As the Care Matters implementation plan makes clear, everyone in the system must not only care for looked-after children, but also care about them. Replicating the care that a child would normally receive from parents means a change of culture, which we expect directors of children&#146;s services and lead members to drive forward. It also means a relentless focus on the quality of care in the places children live.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o134"><a name="80616-0011.htm_para11"><a name="08061637000020">Despite some excellent provision, only a quarter of residential homes meet 90 per cent. of the national minimum standards. That is completely unacceptable. The Bill therefore gives Her Majesty&#146;s chief inspector more power to take swift and decisive action when standards are not met. Clause 26 allows her to issue a &#147;compliance notice&#148; to providers failing to meet expected standards, while clause 27 allows the chief inspector to restrict admissions to residential settings where necessary. Simultaneously, we are reviewing the national minimum standards to make them clearer and more focused on outcomes for children. The Bill also addresses foster care approvals, establishing an independent review mechanism similar to the current mechanism allowing prospective adopters to challenge decisions by adoption agencies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o135"><a name="80616-0011.htm_para12"><a name="08061637000021">Improving quality also means developing a truly world-class children&#146;s work force. In social care, that means a stable, motivated work force who are appropriately trained, skilled and confident in their abilities.</p>

children and young persons&#148;, yet parliamentary hearings in May 2000 recommended that staff in all social service departments should receive further training on female genital mutilation. It is thought that about 98,000 girls under the age of 15 have either undergone, or are at risk of undergoing, female genital mutilation, yet there has not been a single prosecution since the Female Genital Mutilation Act 2003 became law. Therefore, we are failing those children.</p>

 More might need to be done to raise the level of awareness and consciousness among social workers, and I am sure that my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State will pay attention to whether that is necessary in his work on the work force reforms. I hope the hon. Gentleman will agree, however, that we have taken the necessary action to outlaw that practice, but I agree that social workers need to be alive to the possibility of it happening.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o136"><a name="80616-0011.htm_para13"><a name="08061637000024">Alongside the provisions in the Bill, the Government are investing &#163;73 million over the next three years to improve the quality, capacity and supply of social workers for children and families. I am sure that other Members will wish to join me in paying tribute to the social workers, foster carers, residential workers and others who contribute so much to children in care. They are on the front line, keeping children safe every day, yet they are often in the firing line for critics and headline writers. We must be relentless in eradicating poor practice, and we will be, but we should also applaud the talent and commitment of those doing the caring, without whom the measures in this Bill could not be achieved.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o137"><a name="80616-0011.htm_para14"><a name="08061637000025">Part 1 of the Bill will also enable the piloting of new social work practices, allowing local authorities to delegate some of their social services functions to more autonomous agencies. We want to explore through these pilots whether additional flexibilities and freedoms will deliver a more personalised and effective service to children. We will be working closely with partners to implement the pilots, and we will commission an independent evaluation before deciding whether to extend these social work practices nationally.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o138"><a name="80616-0011.htm_para15"><a name="08061637000026">Effective corporate parenting depends upon close contact between practitioners and the children. Clause 16 places a duty on social workers to visit regularly all children in care, whatever and wherever their placement, and including those in custody. Clauses 18 and 19 also require regular visits by social workers to disabled children placed away from home long term, as well as support for the family at home.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o139"><a name="80616-0011.htm_para16"><a name="08061637000027">The second key principle of the Bill is that the child&#146;s voice should be central. In future, the child&#146;s views must be actively solicited and taken fully into account, as any parent would do.</p>

measures in the Bill on independent reviewing officers will go a very long way toward making sure that children have a stronger say. I certainly want local authorities to appoint independent advocates where that is necessary, but I point out to my hon. Friend that, in this Bill, we are trying to get everybody involved with children to see themselves as advocates for those children. That, to me, is what the system lacks at the moment, and that is what we are hoping to achieve.</p>

<p><a name="st_o285"><a name="08061637000030"><a name="80616-0011.htm_spnew18"><a name="08061637000103"><b>John Hemming (Birmingham, Yardley) (LD):</b>
 On independent advocates, whom I have dealt with myself, does the Minister not accept that where the local authority is paying their salary, that creates a conflict of interest? Does she not further accept that a child who is Gillick-competent should be permitted to appoint their own solicitor from the age of 12-plus, rather than the guardian ad litem coming in and ignoring the views of the child?</p>

<p><a name="st_o286"><a name="08061637000031"><a name="80616-0011.htm_spnew19"><a name="08061637000104"><b>Beverley Hughes:</b>
 I do not accept the hon. Gentleman&#146;s premise; nor do I think that that does a true service to the people who undertake the independent advocacy function. They are perfectly capable of representing the views of children and advocating for them, which is why they want to do that work. It does not matter terribly much who is paying for that, and I do not think that it compromises at all their ability to press the interests of children.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o140"><a name="80616-0011.htm_para17"><a name="08061637000032">Clauses 11 to 15 lay the foundation for a systematic refocusing of the independent reviewing officer&#146;s role and practice. They make a single, named IRO responsible for monitoring the performance of the local authority and overseeing the care planning process, so that it is fair and reasonable and gives proper weight to the child&#146;s wishes. The IRO will not only spend time with the child before a care planning review, but will check that other professionals are also listening and responding to the child. I considered carefully whether we should now, at this point, make the IRO fully independent of the local authority, and I can tell Members that it was a finely balanced decision. If these reforms do not quickly achieve the step change that we require, we will go further, which is why the Bill includes an enabling power to make IROs fully independent of local authorities if necessary.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o141"><a name="80616-0011.htm_para18"><a name="08061637000033">Stability is the foundation for any child&#146;s development, and yet the experience of care for many children is one of instability and unpredictable change. Looked-after children are five times more likely to move schools in years 10 and 11 than other children. Some see as many as 30 social workers or go through nine or 10 care placements within a few years. Children cannot be happy and they cannot do well at school or be ambitious for the future when they are subjected to such regular upheavals.</p>

coming out in pilot form today. They are very keen to know when it might be rolled out nationally, and they are very supportive of that proposal, as, indeed, I believe many Members of this House are.</p>

<p><a name="st_o288"><a name="08061637000035"><a name="80616-0012.htm_spnew1"><a name="08061637000106"><b>Beverley Hughes:</b>
 I thank my hon. Friend for that and I join her in paying tribute to the fantastic work that foster carers do. I know that my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State met a group of foster carers today to talk about the &#147;staying put&#148; pilots, and he announced the 10 areas. We want to see rapid progress as far as we can, and it is important that we look at the legal and financial barriers that need to be overcome, which is why we are piloting in the first instance. However, the direction of our intention beyond the pilots is very clear: to see a need for young people to be able to stay in foster placements well beyond the age of 18.</p>

<p><a name="st_o289"><a name="08061637000036"><a name="80616-0012.htm_spnew2"><a name="08061637000107"><b>Lynda Waltho (Stourbridge) (Lab):</b>
 There is already ample evidence, particularly from Northern Ireland, of how successful these schemes can be. Foster carers from Dudley whom I have met are looking for a roll-out even sooner and wondering why the pilots are necessary, because there is ample evidence to show that something similar to the &#147;staying put&#148; scheme works already.</p>

<p><a name="st_o290"><a name="08061637000037"><a name="80616-0012.htm_spnew3"><a name="08061637000108"><b>Beverley Hughes:</b>
 The scheme that my hon. Friend mentions is itself still relatively new and we are waiting to see the results, but as I said, the Government&#146;s intention is clear. I and my colleagues accept the argument that, at a time when most of our children leave home, on average, at the age of 24, it is very reasonable to expect that children who have come into care need to stay in their placements beyond 18. How quickly we can go will depend on the pilots and on resources, but that is our direction of travel.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o142"><a name="80616-0012.htm_para0"><a name="08061637000038">The Bill seeks to improve stability in every aspect of a child&#146;s care. Clause 9 will make sure that local authorities pay greater attention to the educational impact of care placement decisions. We will use regulations to prevent any upheavals in years 10 and 11, when children need to focus all their attention on GCSEs, unless there are exceptional circumstances for the child. We also know that children placed out of their local authority area often do less well than those placed closer to home, so clause 9 will also restrict out-of-authority placements, subject, again, to the best interests of the child. Clause 10 will require local authorities to commission, plan and provide sufficient placements in their area. In addition and as I mentioned, this morning my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State announced the areas for the &#147;staying put&#148; pilots, which will allow young people to stay on beyond 18, with the agreement of all concerned.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o143"><a name="80616-0012.htm_para1"><a name="08061637000039">Of course, the best way to improve stability is by preventing children from going into care in the first place. Children have told us that, when they cannot stay with their parents, they want to be cared for by family and friends wherever possible. The Bill therefore requires local authorities to give preference to placements with relatives where that is in the child&#146;s best interests, and to give support to family carers. Clause 24 enables authorities to exercise wider discretion over cash payments to those caring for children in need. Clauses 36 to 38 remove some of the barriers for kinship carers applying for residence and special guardianship orders, and extend residence orders until the child reaches 18, rather than the present age of 16.</p>

 Does the Secretary of State see this provision, which I very much welcome, as a way of alleviating some of the legitimate concerns that Members throughout the House have had regarding grandparents in a position of care?</p>

 Yes, and that is true of all those provisions, including the ones I mentioned on cash payments and giving preferences for placements. During the consultation I talked to many grandparents, and I am aware, as the hon. Gentleman doubtless is, of heart-rending stories that people told of how matters were made really difficult by the current arrangements in many local authorities. We want to make sure that such things do not happen, because if children can live with grandparents and that is in their interests, that is by far the best place for them to be. We want to make sure that practice changes in this regard.</p>

Schools must understand the unique learning needs of children in care and have the capacity to help them fulfil their potential&#151;whatever their starting point. Clause 20 will make sure that there is a designated teacher in every school to give children in care the encouragement and personal support they need to realise their talents. Clause 14 will require local authorities to make arrangements for an independent, trained volunteer to be appointed to visit any looked-after child if it is in their interests. As I said earlier, we want more looked-after children to set their hearts on going to university, and to achieve that ambition. We know that financial barriers can also be a deterrent, so clause 21 will make a bursary available, of a minimum of &#163;2,000, for every child in care who goes to university.</p>

 The right hon. Lady said &#147;finally&#148;, but she has not yet mentioned clause 2, which deals with adoption.

 Does the Foyer movement have a role to play in this, because, in a sense, it has worked as a bridge for young people who may not have been in care but who obviously find themselves in difficult circumstances?

 I am great supporter of the Foyer movement. I agree with my hon.

 We certainly welcome the Bill. This is another year and another children&#146;s Bill, and, as with previous such legislation aimed at protecting vulnerable children, we will support it. This latest and long-awaited Bill deals with probably the most vulnerable group of children and young people in the UK&#151;those in the care system. As the Minister has rightly said, it has been a scandal for too long, and remains so, that the treatment of, and outcomes for, children in the care system are woefully poor. Those children have been the victims of systemic neglect and of an institutionalised paucity of expectations for too many years, and it is vital that the Bill marks a major turning point in reversing that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o148"><a name="80616-0012.htm_para6"><a name="08061637000053">I welcome what the Minister has said about the change of culture that is required, and I share her praise for social workers and foster carers, many of whom have lobbied us today about their vital and dedicated work. Some 61,000 children are in care in England and Wales, 42 per cent. of whom will return to their families within six months. However, we should not forget the estimated 350,000 adults who have spent part or all of their childhood in foster or residential care in this country. For many of them, the experience will become a generational legacy, as their own children end up in the care system, which happens all too often.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o149"><a name="80616-0012.htm_para7"><a name="08061637000054">We have heard about the scandal of outcomes for children in the care system in areas such as education. Despite the public service agreement targets, the priority action toolkits for key stage 4 looked-after children, the Education Protects programme, life chances funds and so on, the achievement of children in the care system on basic measures such as the achievement of five good GCSEs is still too poor. Worse still&#151;the Minister alluded to this&#151;the gap between children in the care system  <br>

and mainstream children has widened over the past few years. All standards have gone up, as measured by GCSE achievement, but the gap in achievement between those who are and those who are not in the care system has widened. Furthermore, the increase in achievement has not been nearly as fast for those in the care system as for all children, which is deeply worrying. In addition, children in the care system are more than 10 times more likely to be excluded from school. Some 33 per cent. of them end up not in education, employment or training; just 2 per cent. of them go on to university; and 27 per cent. of them have statements for special educational needs compared with just 3 per cent. of all children.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o150"><a name="80616-0012.htm_para8"><a name="08061637000055">The same thing is happening in the justice system. Some 25 per cent. of people in prisons came through the care system, and the figure is anything up to half of those in youth offender institutes. Such children are four times more likely to smoke, drink under age and take drugs, and last year, 9.5 per cent. of over-10s in the care system were cautioned for or convicted of an offence. Not doing something more urgently about this situation is a false economy, because by the age of 19 a persistent offender will have cost &#163;164,000 every year. That figure includes the cost to the victim, the court costs, the cost of prison and benefits and the cost to social services, which is an enormous cost not only to society but, most importantly, to the individual involved.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o151"><a name="80616-0012.htm_para9"><a name="08061637000056">We must also consider teenage pregnancy rates&#151;one in four women leaving care is either pregnant or already a mother&#151;and health statistics. Children in the care system are more than five times more likely than children in general to have a diagnosable mental illness, and many still do not receive the health checks that they are supposed to receive within the first 14 days of coming into the care system. Some two thirds of those children will have at least one physical health complaint. Perhaps the most tragic and disturbing statistic is that last year no fewer than 100 children in the care system died, which was an increase on the figure of 95 in 2004. We often talk about children who are killed at the hands of their carers or parents&#151;the relevant figure is about one or two a week&#151;but more children are dying within the care system for a host of reasons.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o152"><a name="80616-0012.htm_para10"><a name="08061637000057">The system is there to protect those children from the ravages of deprivation and health inequalities, so those figures are deeply disturbing. The Bill is desperately required and very welcome, but there is an urgent need to translate its good intentions and good directions into actions and results. We will do everything possible to speed the Bill&#146;s implementation. It has enjoyed close and positive scrutiny and improvement in the other House. I pay tribute to Lord Adonis, who has great personal experience of children in care, to my noble Friend Baroness Morris of Bolton, who has great expertise in and dedication to this area, and to many other Lords who brought about constructive improvements to the original Bill. They, like the Minister, are all too aware of the challenges that we all face in helping children in the care system, because the effects of failure will impact on the whole of society and are not restricted to the cost of more than &#163;2 billion a year of children in the looked-after system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o153"><a name="80616-0012.htm_para11"><a name="08061637000058">We welcome much of the Bill, such as, for example, the rewriting of clauses 7 to 10, particularly in respect of the mechanics of placement and the preference for  <br>

placement with extended family members, which should be, but is not, happening already. We also welcome the references to proximity placement, which has been discussed since Sir William Utting&#146;s report in 1997 suggested a 20-mile radius cap. Although kinship placements are supposed to be the preferred option in this country, only 1 per cent. of social worker-instigated placements ended up with kinship carers, compared with 45 per cent. in Denmark, for example.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o154"><a name="80616-0012.htm_para12"><a name="08061637000059">We need to maintain continuity of school and education. The poor outcomes are not surprising, given that the social exclusion unit reported that 29 per cent. of children had undergone three or more educational placements during secondary school and that 25 per cent. of children had been in six or more care placements during the same period. We also support the Bill&#146;s hierarchy of kinship care placements locally to retain a familiar environment. We are talking about providing appropriate foster carers locally or, ultimately, in a residential home, where the appropriate care can be made available, especially for those with complex needs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o155"><a name="80616-0012.htm_para13"><a name="08061637000060">We recognise that residential children&#146;s homes, which look after about 6,500 children at the moment&#151;they tend to look after older children&#151;have a place. They may be more appropriate as the first port of call, but the average cost of some &#163;2,100 a week in those residential homes is leading to some local authorities cutting placements, although those fees include contracting for psychiatric and other specialist services in many cases.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o156"><a name="80616-0012.htm_para14"><a name="08061637000061">We need to take on board the shortage of skilled foster carers as well. On any day in this country, 50,000 children are living with 43,000 different foster families. Just last month, local authorities said that they urgently need at least 5,250 more foster carers to come forward this year, with the worst shortages in Manchester and the north-west. That results in thousands of children being sent to residential homes or being forced to travel miles to temporary placements and siblings having to live apart from their brothers and sisters, according to the Fostering Network.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o157"><a name="80616-0012.htm_para15"><a name="08061637000062">We welcome the greater specifications for visiting children far away from home in the residential placement provisions contained in the Bill.

children still dying before they can be taken into the care system or even after that? Is the system sufficiently flexible either in care or with the birth family?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o159"><a name="80616-0012.htm_para17"><a name="08061637000064">This is a good Bill. Lots of work has been done to improve it, but there are a number of areas where it can be made better and will stand a better chance of working in practice, and we will table amendments to that effect. I hope that the Government will continue to engage with us in a constructive manner, as they have in their lordships&#146; House. In particular, we want an amendment that will put a welfare checklist at the forefront of the Bill. There are concerns that many of the measures in the Bill do not go far enough and that many local authorities will only do the minimum to comply, not least given the constraints on spending, because of all the other children protection requirements that the Government are rightly introducing, and the more thinly spread funding for children&#146;s centres, which are now competing for funding within children&#146;s services budgets.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o160"><a name="80616-0012.htm_para18"><a name="08061637000065">We suggest a checklist at the beginning of the Bill mirroring section 1 of the Children Act 1989, which forms the heart of that legislation and which remains an important benchmark today. For every case, the actions of the local authority or other agency that acts for looked-after children would be expected to measure up against a checklist of considerations designed to be in the best interests of individual children, and such bodies would be accountable for that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o161"><a name="80616-0012.htm_para19"><a name="08061637000066">We will table an amendment to propose the post of a chief social worker. That measure was recommended by the Conservative party commission on social workers, which reported last October and which I chaired. Such a person would be the public face of social workers, akin to the chief medical officer or the chief veterinary officer. We have such an officer for animals, for goodness&#146; sake, and we should have one for people who deal professionally with children as well. The officer would be directly responsible to the Secretary of State and advise on ways to promote the image and perceptions of social workers among the public and on how social workers can do a better job and be held accountable when that is not the case.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o162"><a name="80616-0012.htm_para20"><a name="08061637000067">Too often, the perception of a social worker is as someone whose first contact with a vulnerable family is the knock on the door to initiate proceedings for a child to be taken into care. They are caricatured as child catchers. Not only is that deeply demoralising and not in the interests of social workers, but it is certainly not in the interests of the children and vulnerable families with whom they work and with whom they need to establish a relationship of trust and empathy in difficult circumstances. Such a role is used in New Zealand, and I have had a long conversation with Marie Connolly, who is the chief social worker for New Zealand. There are signs that that post has done a lot of good for the perception and standing of social workers in that country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o163"><a name="80616-0012.htm_para21"><a name="08061637000068">We revealed yesterday that one in five of the 76,000 social workers in this country have signed off work for 20 consecutive days or more in the past five years. That is not good for the profession, and it lies behind why we still have high vacancy rates. My local authority has vacancy rates of about 20 per cent. for child social workers., yet those people are absolutely integral to the success of child protection legislation and the Bill, and we need to do more to boost their position.</p>

That provision was proposed by my noble Friend Baroness Morris and passed in the House of Lords with a large majority against the Government, and we very much hope that the Government will not seek to remove it in Committee.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o165"><a name="80616-0013.htm_para1"><a name="08061637000070">We want more direction in the Bill. Wherever possible, and in accordance with the interests of the child, the default position should be that an extended family member is the priority for a placement. We want greater safeguards for children in care over the age of 16. As the Minister mentioned several times, it is absurd that the majority of children leave care at the age of 16 or 17, when they are facing most turbulence in their lives with exams at school, the possibility of getting a job and trying to sort out accommodation. Yet for our sons and daughters, with their birth family, that happens when they are at least 24. We look forward to a discussion with the Minister on that front. There has been some progress since the Children (Leaving Care) Act 2000, but 41 per cent. of children leave care by the age of 17.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o166"><a name="80616-0013.htm_para2"><a name="08061637000071">We need to give more focused, ongoing support. We need far tighter controls over multiple placements. We need greater specifications for the qualifications of responsible social workers who visit children placed out of the area, usually in children&#146;s homes&#151;out of sight and out of mind in too many cases. That was supposed to happen already. Some of us took a delegation to see Lord Warner, the then Minister responsible, but it is still not happening in too many places. In my authority in West Sussex, it is estimated&#151;it can only be an estimate&#151;that more than 700 children have been placed in the care system by other authorities. That compares with 42 children placed by West Sussex out of county&#151;in Kent, the figure is estimated to be 1,250. Yet the local children&#146;s service department, the local police, the local council or the local justice system must pick up the pieces when things go wrong. That notification should be happening; it is not happening, and it must happen in the interests of all those involved.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o170"><a name="80616-0013.htm_para6"><a name="08061637000075">We also want to give greater powers to foster carers, so that they can take on the role of as normal a parent as possible. We want them to have the authority, without having to refer back to the social worker, to say whether a child can have a sleepover with a mate from school or go on a school trip. At the moment, much of that must be delegated back to the social worker. We need foster carers, many of whom are long-term foster carers, to be able to play the role of the pushy parent&#151;a figure whom those children lack and so desperately need in the place of a birth parent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o171"><a name="80616-0013.htm_para7"><a name="08061637000076">We need to give foster carers greater powers by sending out a clear message from the Government to local authorities to back them. Similarly, we need safeguards to ensure that foster carers do not become the victims of vexatious allegations by difficult children. There needs to be a balance so that children are protected. As we heard from foster carers again today, too many vexatious complaints against them result in their being instantly suspended and their allowances&#146; being suspended too. We need to get the balance right.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o172"><a name="80616-0013.htm_para8"><a name="08061637000077">In our amendments, we will return to the thorny subject of private fostering. It was mentioned and recommended by Sir William Utting in 1997 and by some of us in amendments to the Adoption and Children Act 2002. It was mentioned in my private Member&#146;s Bill in 2003 and again in 2004, when the Minister came up with a sunset clause that the Bill will extend and that we will try to abolish. Surely, now is the time at long last to implement a proper legal requirement for the registration of private foster placements, given that the voluntary scheme has yielded only a relatively small number of cases. Too many private fostering schemes go on at the moment without the knowledge of local authorities and without proper safeguards for vulnerable children, as we have seen in certain tragic cases over the past few years.</p>

Again, there are too many cases of children who have been through the care system falling foul of what turns out to be a congenital illness. If the medical records had been available from their birth parents, preventive action might have been taken.</p>

We also want to see greater rights of sibling contact, if children cannot be placed together. A National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children survey showed that 40 per cent. of children and young people said that they did not have enough contact with siblings. That evidence was backed up by A National Voice and the Who Cares? Trust. Such contact should not merely be allowed by local authority, but facilitated and promoted. I am sure that many other considerations will come up in Committee and I greatly look forward to debating children&#146;s issues with the Minister again.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o175"><a name="80616-0013.htm_para11"><a name="08061637000080">Most of this is not rocket science. There are already many examples of good practice around the country. For example, a few months ago I opened the new Horizons education and achievement centre in Ealing.  <br>

It is a fantastic institute manned by former care leavers who have been to university and come back and who now teach educational, computer and other skills to young people in the care system. It is no coincidence that 14 per cent. of children in care in Ealing now go on to university, which is substantially more than the national average.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o176"><a name="80616-0013.htm_para12"><a name="08061637000081">In Barnet, the authority has invested in a buddy system. Every child in the care system has a buddy who is an officer in the local authority, from the chief executive down. That officer looks out for them and asks the questions that a pushy parent would ask at a school parents evening or about health records. Barnet invested in its social work force some years ago. It invested to save, and it is now no coincidence that the vacancy rate for child social workers in Barnet is less than 4 per cent., which is one of the best in London.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o177"><a name="80616-0013.htm_para13"><a name="08061637000082">Other great examples of best practice include the Community Service Volunteers scheme&#151;I think that the Minister has mentioned it. I declare an interest as a trustee of CSV. It has piloted the use of volunteer social workers in child protection in Bromley and Sunderland. The volunteers primarily support the parent with the stress of having their children on the register and the threat of their children being taken into care. They can establish more stability by helping parents to manage the heavy schedule of meetings with schools, social workers and health professionals, attending parenting classes and ensuring that children go to school or nursery, and they can help to organise a routine at home. When the approach was piloted in California, instances of child abuse fell by 80 per cent. The volunteers are viewed differently from social workers, who are metaphorically in uniform. They have a great role to play, and I hope that the legislation will allow the flexibility to promote similar schemes and the use of volunteers, whether through CSV or other organisations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o178"><a name="80616-0013.htm_para14"><a name="08061637000083">Family support is key. As the Minister has said, we are talking about children and the care system, but we need to do an awful lot more to prevent children from entering the care system in the first place. The charity NCH, for example, has been running the Phoenix project, which I recently visited in Merton. The project works with families in crisis using a solution-focused therapy model of work. Support is offered for a period of three months, with all interventions regularly reviewed. When the work is completed, families are tracked after six months to see whether their progress has been maintained. The project consists of a rapid response team, an adolescent resource team, family group meetings and so on. It has found an enormous fall in the number of children who then go off the rails, thanks to the fact that those families have been kept together.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o179"><a name="80616-0013.htm_para15"><a name="08061637000084">Let me give a third example, which is another project by NCH in Fareham on intensive fostering. Intensive fostering has learned from the positive practice used in remand fostering of co-ordinating services around the young person. This tried and tested method has many proven benefits. Research by the British Association for Adoption and Fostering to evaluate the NCH&#146;s remand fostering scheme found that more than 70 per cent. of young people committed no offences during their placement despite persistently offending before and that all the young people were engaged in school, training or employment by the time that they left the placement. Intensive fostering has a great role to play, because it has been piloted and has been shown to work.</p>

Perhaps there is too great a focus on the child rather than on the problems undermining a family that might result in the loss of a child to the care system. We need to talk more about fostering families, rather than just fostering the child, and keeping families together wherever possible. We need greater flexibility and greater innovation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o181"><a name="80616-0013.htm_para17"><a name="08061637000086">We must ensure that the work force is appropriately trained, motivated and free to get on with the job of looking after children at the sharp end. We need to end bureaucracy and the excessive aversion to risk that can culminate in perverse incentives to take more children into care rather than working preventively with families to keep them together. At the other end, the system hurries children aged over 16 out of the care system to free up social worker time and resources. That is likely to turn out to be a false economy as vulnerable young people slide back into the mire of the familiar problems that I described earlier.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o182"><a name="80616-0013.htm_para18"><a name="08061637000087">We also need to listen more and take note of children and young people. A report by the &#147;What Makes the Difference?&#148; project revealed that 40 per cent. of young people in care said that they rarely or never have a say in a placement, which is another great sign of weakness that we need to address and reverse.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o183"><a name="80616-0013.htm_para19"><a name="08061637000088">The Bill is a last chance for many in the care system whom we have failed for too long. Every two months&#146; delay represents 1 per cent. of childhood with the child in the care system condemned to mediocrity and the likelihood of underachievement. That situation is simply not acceptable any more. It is an enormous waste to society as a whole, to us and, most of all, to the 61,000 children and young people in the care system for whom the failure to invest seriously in the problem has been a false economy for far too long.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o184"><a name="80616-0013.htm_para20"><a name="08061637000089">We should approach the Bill by asking ourselves whether the current system, or the proposals, would be good enough for our own children.

I have been involved with the organisation for most of my life, although I took a more objective view, of course, while I was in government. I have been involved in the issue of children in care for many years and I trained as a family case workers many years ago, before several people who are taking part in the debate were born.</p>

The reality is that significantly more investment has been made, both directly in the care system and in a series of other ways&#151;through the work that my right hon.

<p><a name="stpa_o186"><a name="80616-0013.htm_para22"><a name="08061638000003">However, it must be said that we are still not content with the results. That is why the Bill is particularly well timed. It allows us to take account of what has already been done, but it also says to all involved in the care system, &#147;Have another look, because despite increased investment and increased opportunities, things are not working sufficiently well for the most vulnerable children in our society.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o187"><a name="80616-0013.htm_para23"><a name="08061638000004">Two years ago, I was asked by the then Prime Minister, Tony Blair, to have another look at social exclusion. One of the issues that he asked me to consider was the care system. He was particularly arrested by the poor educational outcomes. For me, it was a good opportunity to look again at what we could do really to move things on again. There are lots of points that I could make, but many other Members want to speak in this relatively short debate, so I will confine my comments to some of the critical issues, although other issues raised by Members, including my right hon. Friend the Minister for Children, Young People and Families, are very important, too.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o188"><a name="80616-0013.htm_para24"><a name="08061638000005">In particular, I looked at why we were not getting the results that other systems were getting, although we spent more per head on children in care than others did. There are two or three points to raise. The first is early intervention and preventive work. The Government are now much more clearly focused and targeted on that. As my right hon. Friend the Minister has heard me say many times, early intervention work has to be clearly focused and to systematically pick up the most disadvantaged children and families, and it must be rigorous. There are a number of programmes doing such work now. I am delighted that last week, the Government increased the number of areas that can benefit from nurse-family partnerships to 90, from the 10 that were initiated last year. That is proving to be the most effective programme worldwide, not only according to the cost-benefit analysis, but in terms of its impact on the most vulnerable children and their chance to have opportunities when they grow up and to not face the level of disadvantage that too many children do.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o189"><a name="80616-0013.htm_para25"><a name="08061638000006">Generally, we have to be much more rigorous in picking up on the most vulnerable. That is challenge to several people in the House who object to data sharing. I believe that it should be a criminal offence not to share data concerning the most vulnerable, because not to share those data is to say, &#147;We think your individual liberties are more important than your opportunity to prosper and succeed.&#148; The two things get confused for the very young child. My right hon. Friend the Minister has problems ensuring decent data sharing. When we go to schools, teachers say, &#147;We know which children will have difficulties as soon as they first come in,&#148; yet the data are not systematically and rigorously shared in a way that would ensure good intervention right from the beginning. Hon. Members can tell that I feel passionate about the issue; I will move on.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o190"><a name="80616-0013.htm_para26"><a name="08061638000007">There are also preventive services to consider. The hon.

There will now be about 50 family intervention projects across the country. There are other ways in  <br>

which we should intervene at the very earliest stage to give a family support, so that children do not end up having to be placed in care, for whatever reason. There are good programmes that we know work, and we have to get on with them in every area of the country. NCH makes a powerful point about children on the edge of care in its briefing for Members: good, preventive services involving the whole family can make a huge difference and can help to ensure that children do not end up in the care system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o191"><a name="80616-0013.htm_para27"><a name="08061638000008">In my second look at children in care, I became convinced that work-force issues are another area in which we have not got things right, so I am pleased that my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families is chairing a working party on the subject. I encourage him to be ambitious. Members present on both sides of the Chamber have considered the example of the social pedagogy model in Europe. Using that model would mean ensuring much better, longer training for people who work with our children, but I find it perverse that we continue to accept that sometimes the least qualified and trained people are those who work with the most vulnerable. As a result, they frequently do not take hold of a situation because they are fearful of it, and because they know that they do not have the quality, reserves, training or strategies to deal with whatever problem comes up.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o192"><a name="80616-0013.htm_para28"><a name="08061638000009">When there is a problem that, in this country, would frequently mean someone calling the police, in Denmark, Germany and Finland, the worker deals with the problem. Obviously, if it is a really serious problem, the police have to be called in, but frequently it is not, and the worker deals with it. I went to two or three children&#146;s homes in Germany where the worker would automatically do an hour&#146;s work with the young person when they came in from school, to make sure that the day was understood and that the young person knew what would happen the next day, and to support the young person in doing their homework. That was not considered anything special. An educational worker was not brought in to do that work; the child&#146;s key worker&#151;the person who worked with them most consistently&#151;did it automatically. I know that the Government are looking at the social pedagogy model, and I encourage them to be brave, to start pilots that involve social pedagogues, and to monitor the effects.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o193"><a name="80616-0013.htm_para29"><a name="08061638000010">A point that struck me powerfully and that has made me stop and think a great deal is the relationship with the family once a young person is in care. In this country, there is the odd example of good work in that regard, but that good work is not nearly sufficiently systematic, and does not nearly take place often enough. Too many of the young people who have been or who are in care whom I meet are frustrated that they have so little contact with their natural family. I found that out way back when I was a social worker. Even if the relationship with the family has been destructive&#151;even if it has been really poor&#151;young people none the less want to know about their family. They want to know how to deal with them. They want to know who their mother and father are. They want contact. Too often, we say that that is too difficult and that they would be better off without it, or we just do not do the hard work to make sure that they are placed somewhere where that will be easy.</p>

That was the norm, and the work force saw their role as negotiating the space between the child and the family. When the child leaves care, even if there has not been any contact, they go into environments that are not controlled for them. They go into a different environment, and many children seek to re-establish contact with their family, and they experience a series of different emotions, including anger, frustration and concern.</p>

 I am following very closely what the right hon. Lady is saying. I visited that children&#146;s home in Copenhagen shortly after she did. Is not the point, which she rightly makes, that in this country, things are black and white: someone is in the care system, or they are with their birth family? In homes in Denmark where children may go back to their birth parents or to a member of their extended family, or have them over for dinner during the week, there is far greater flexibility: there is a middle way.

 I understand what the hon. Gentleman is saying, but it is about a bit more than flexibility. It is about the quality of the work force and whether they can handle that relationship. It is about whether they are confident about negotiating that space. Our legislation says that they are in loco parentis, which means that they try to be the parent, but frequently that is not what is required. It may be required for some youngsters, so it should be available, but the next stage is personalisation, to recognise much more effectively what the individual child needs and what is the right response to them.</p>

There should be incentives for local authorities to make sure that the child keeps out of custody. We should also think about rewarding them if the child reaches university or obtains a qualification that gives them the licence to work. We must be much more ambitious in how we look at local authorities&#146; responsibility for children in care, so that they take responsibility for what actually happens to those children, instead of taking the view that they just have them for a period and do what is necessary, rather than regarding their responsibility as an ambition to transform opportunities for that child.

 We would very much like to welcome the Bill, but obviously we are sad that it has been introduced against the background of extremely poor outcomes for our most vulnerable children for far too long. Thirteen per cent. of young people looked after for at least a year achieve five A to C GCSEs, against 62 per cent. of all children. Twenty-seven per cent. of the prison population was taken into care as children, as opposed to 2 per cent. of the general population. Children in, and leaving, care are at high risk of pregnancy&#151;almost half of care leavers are mothers within 18 to 24 months of leaving care and, saddest of all, the children of children who have been in care are likely to be taken into care themselves.</p>

Our shared objectives today&#151;and I believe that there will be a great deal of cross-party work on and support for the Bill&#151;are about improving the life chances of a large number of young people. At any point in time, there are about 60,000 children in the care system. Some children are fostered on a short-term basis and can return to their families. Others go on to be adopted, and others are fostered on a long-term basis. It is particularly striking that 45 per cent. of children who enter care are adolescents. They are especially vulnerable, and they are not in the care system for long before being faced with the challenge of GCSEs.</p>

person and their wishes, and not by local authority concerns about the cost of providing housing and other services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o198"><a name="80616-0014.htm_para3"><a name="08061638000022">In 2005-06, authorities in England spent a net total of &#163;2.05 billion on looked-after children, compared with just &#163;687 million on family support services&#151;a ratio of 3:1. In a recent answer to a parliamentary question from my hon. Friend the Member for Yeovil (Mr. Laws), the Minister provided figures that showed great variations in the number of children taken into care per 10,000 of the population under 18. For example, figures for 2006-07 show that Kirklees had six such children; Merton, four; and Kent, four. However, on the same basis, other authorities had figures as high as 24. The boroughs that I cited with the lower figures have a spending ratio nearer to 2:1. We must conclude that, at the very least, family support is one important factor in the equation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o199"><a name="80616-0014.htm_para4"><a name="08061638000023">NCH tells us that the annual cost of a mid-range, intensive family support service to prevent admission to care is just over &#163;300,000, which provides support for 60 young people and their families. An average success rate of 80 per cent. means that accommodation is avoided for 48 of those young people. Compared with the average cost of foster care or a children&#146;s home placement, it represents a large monetary saving. However, the greatest savings must be in respect of the value of the services to the people, which enables a child to remain with their own family and community, and in the contribution to long-term development and well-being.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o200"><a name="80616-0014.htm_para5"><a name="08061638000024">Preventive family support services are all-important, as is ongoing support for vulnerable families and, indeed, support within the foster family, if that route is judged to be in the child&#146;s best interest. I listened with great interest to the right hon. Member for North-West Durham (Hilary Armstrong), who seemed to be almost describing a bridge between the family and the care placement&#151;whatever that would be. It is quite an exciting idea, which could be backed up by the family support measures that are, basically, in place in some areas. My challenge to the Minister is in respect of what can be done to spread further the good practice on early intervention, which, according to the statistics, is clearly so lacking in many places.</p>

As the Bill has progressed through the other place, there have been welcome moves to address a few of the issues. I welcome new clause 7, which should have been included in section 11 of the Children Act 2004 when it was debated. The Border and Immigration Agency should be subject to the duty to make arrangements to safeguard and promote the welfare of children who have been trafficked or who are seeking asylum, placing an equal duty on all services that come into contact with children, and further steps could be taken&#151;for example, with the appointment of a guardian for every unaccompanied child in the asylum process.</p>

About 40 to 49 per cent. of children and young people in custody have been in local authority care at some point, and 18 per cent. are still subject to care orders. In the other place, the Government provided some welcome assurances about the new duty that will be placed on local authorities to visit every child whom  <br>

That is such an important issue that I hope the Minister will today reassure us about monitoring and about any future guidance and regulations.

 Does my hon. Friend also see that role in a school context, to be undertaken by the designated member of staff?

 I do agree. That approach has been missing in many schools despite their having had guidance that there should be a designated teacher. We know that, in reality, it has not happened. Of course, the issue is not just about the academic side; underpinning that side is good pastoral care and appropriate care. We never know who the child or young person will find as their best confidant, but it is important to ensure that they find them.</p>

addition independent advocacy is crucial because it ensures that the child&#146;s voice and rights are represented by a professional outside the system.</p>

 I welcome all that the hon. Lady has said, but does she agree that the extension of looked-after status to disabled children is a trick that may have been missed? They are often in placements for 52 weeks a year. On the Children, Schools and Families Committee, we have both heard of stories in which the most vulnerable of vulnerable children do not receive their visits or anything until it is far too late.</p>

<p><a name="st_o311"><a name="08061638000037"><a name="80616-0014.htm_spnew5"><a name="08061638000073"><b>Annette Brooke:</b>
 I thank the hon. Lady for her intervention. I shall certainly come on to that point, but at this stage I shall just say that independent advocacy is particularly important for those severely disabled children who may be forced by the severity of their condition to remain in a residential placement for most of the year. It is very important that their voice is heard, and in respect of children with extreme needs I can see that happening only when they have somebody who can work closely with them and almost tune in to how they feel about certain issues. That independent advocacy is vital, particularly when such children are far away from home.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o210"><a name="80616-0014.htm_para15"><a name="08061638000038">As far back as 1997, Sir William Utting, in his report &#147;People Like Us&#148;, concluded that looked-after children needed independent advocacy as a source of protection and as a means of making their voices heard within an otherwise closed system. Most importantly, children and young people say that they want advocacy. A National Voice indicated that up to 90 per cent. of children it surveyed held that view. There are two aspects: the expression of a child&#146;s views by those responsible for the outcome; and the representation of a child&#146;s view and their rights by a professional advocate. Those are two very different things, and the role of the independent review officer never entirely covers both aspects. I would firmly come down on the side of those who have long argued for a statutory right to independent advocacy for looked-after children when significant decisions are being made in their lives. It is sometimes suggested that with all these adults in a child&#146;s life, an advocate would be just one more, but I think it would help them to make sense of the roles of all those adults.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o211"><a name="80616-0014.htm_para16"><a name="08061638000039">We have heard a lot about the work force, and of course social workers are absolutely key to the futures of looked-after children, who want a stable relationship with their social worker and find it very disruptive when there is a churn of temporary social workers in all the areas where there are shortages. The right training for social workers is absolutely vital.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o212"><a name="80616-0014.htm_para17"><a name="08061638000040">I have some reservations about the proposal for independent social care practices. We do not know whether that will produce the outcomes that might be achieved&#151;we do not have evidence one way or the other. I can therefore see the point of having pilots, but we are in danger of having more and more pilots with  <br>

long periods before evaluation. In this case, I wonder whether we will get more social workers or end up with the displacement of social workers. As the Select Committee said, the pilots need to fill the evidence gap on social work practices. It is vital that they are properly evaluated and are not rolled out unless there is clear evidence that they will provide essential continuity and stability for looked-after children. The evaluation must also take account of any knock-on effects on our local authorities in terms of whether there has been any diminishing of services, perhaps because of an overall shortage of social workers. The jury is out on that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o213"><a name="80616-0014.htm_para18"><a name="08061638000041">We saw some welcome policy evolution in the other place. We started with the commendable objective that we wanted to have as many children placed within their own local authority as possible, but overlooked the fact that some children need to access highly specialised provision that will not be in the immediate area. We have reached a point where local authorities have a duty to secure a sufficient and diverse provision of accommodation for looked-after children in their area, to make decisions that are in the best interests of the child when there are out-of-area placements, to take on board the issue of schooling, particularly in the critical years 10 and 11, and to look on kinship as a preference when there is consideration of a child perhaps being moved away from its immediate birth family. I have long been committed to the idea that we should expand the use of kinship care, which is very patchy across the whole country. We need to be clear about what financial payments are made in those circumstances. I am sure that we have all had visits to our surgeries from grandparents who are struggling to cope because there has not been the necessary funding.</p>

 I thank my hon. Friend for his intervention. I understand the point that we do not want people doing this just for money; it has to be more than that. On the other hand, I hope we can make progress with regard to situations in which hardship is created or where it truly would be the solution that was in the best interests of the child.</p>

Member for Stourbridge (Lynda Waltho) intervened on me about looked-after status for disabled children in long-term residential care. The situation strikes me as very odd. I have heard from parents whose children go into short-term respite care and are upset because that means that they have to have looked-after status. It is an interesting anomaly that we need to consider carefully in Committee. It is clear that in relation to long-term residential care there would be several benefits in having looked-after status&#151;an allocated social worker, a care plan, a contact plan, a health assessment and health plan, and so on.</p>

see more use of intensive fostering, which is used in Scandinavian countries and keeps children out of custody. That is important. We need to give more support to foster carers. An issue that was particularly raised with us today is that 30 per cent. of foster carers are faced with allegations at some time or another, and there is the peculiar situation whereby they appear to be presumed guilty right from the word go, entirely contrary to normal practice in this country. It is important that fees should continue to be paid. We heard about examples where once allegations have been made, even if found to be unfounded, not only are fees stopped but those allegations appear on a criminal record. That can affect foster carers&#146; futures. A full reason should at least be given of why the allegations were found to be unfounded. This is probably not directly relevant to the Bill, but I want to place on record the fact that it needs to be examined.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o216"><a name="80616-0014.htm_para21"><a name="08061638000046">I emphasise the need to give more powers to foster carers, particularly those who are performing the parental role. When I was a chairman of education services in 1997, looked-after children would come to tell us how difficult it was to get permission for a sleepover. We have got through that problem, but now there are others whereby foster carers do not have the power to give consent for normal children&#146;s and school activities. Action must be taken on that.</p>

I share others&#146; disappointment and frustration in the sense that we all think this is intrinsically a good idea and want to get on with it. I hope that the Minister will agree that as information evolves and the system is seen to be working, the pilots can be rolled out rather more quickly than might be the case if we were to wait three years for the evaluation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o219"><a name="80616-0014.htm_para24"><a name="08061638000049">On many occasions I have discussed the provision of therapeutic services for all abused children. In 2006, the then Department for Education and Skills said that of 60,000 children in care, 63 per cent. were in care because they had experienced some form of abuse or neglect. The long-term consequences of child sexual abuse include anxiety and depression, anger and guilt, difficulties functioning at school, poor self-image and difficulties with personal relationships and parenting. Adults who are being treated for mental health problems often identify childhood abuse as an influence. Research shows that 25 to 40 per cent. of all alleged sexual abuse involves young perpetrators, and the majority of those children and young people have been or are being sexually, physically or emotionally abused themselves. Therapy at an early stage could help to reduce the scale of the problems over time by breaking the cycle.</p>

How can children be adequately protected and safeguarded if we do not know the conditions in which they are looked after? It cannot be right for the Government to say, &#147;We&#146;ll have another three years, and we&#146;re going to do better this time.&#148; We need to know how the Government are going to do better in the next three years.</p>

Some Members had the undoubted advantage of moving into my constituency for the duration of the by-election, a worthy experience that I am sure will remain with them. Nevertheless, I ask the House to allow me a few moments to remind them of its many and varied qualities. What I hope they found was a place blessed with a strong and proud community and a deep and diverse heritage, together with people of frank honesty and open decency, for certainly that is true.</p>

Lying in the heart of south Cheshire, Crewe remains synonymous with the birth and rise of the railways through the 19th and early 20th centuries, and indeed it was down to that industry that the town was born. Its influence in the town and the prosperity that came with it can be seen in the impressive array of Victorian buildings and open spaces. I recall my grandmother reminiscing to me about the tea dances she attended in the 1930s at the Crewe Arms hotel, the world&#146;s first railway hotel built in 1838. Crewe continues to play an active and central part in the railway industry today.</p>

Crewe has a growing sense of enterprise that has enormous untapped potential. Further regeneration in and around the town centre can only help to set that potential free. My predecessor worked tirelessly towards her vision of Crewe becoming a university town. With substantial investment in place for many of the further and higher education institutions located in the town, that vision is closer to becoming a reality.</p>

Sitting on the banks of the River Weaver, Nantwich began as a salt town that gave way to a leather then clothing industry. Today, Nantwich boasts a thriving tourist trade. Visitors to Nantwich are attracted by the magnificent market square, dominated by the 14th century parish church of St. Mary&#146;s, christened the cathedral of south Cheshire, and surrounded by leaning half-timbered black and white Tudor architecture.</p>

I, too, welcome the Bill and support its efforts to improve outcomes for children in care. It contains many praiseworthy objectives: improving stability of placement; education and support for longer; promoting early intervention, and increasing family support. However, we must ask ourselves: does it hit the spot and does it go far enough?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o235"><a name="80616-0015.htm_para13"><a name="08061642000013">For too long, most social workers have started out on their career hoping to make a difference to the lives of disadvantaged children, but have finished up frustrated by risk assessments, box-ticking and targets, so that, eventually, their objective is to protect their department, not the children whom they are there to help. The time spent by social workers dealing face to face with the children whom they are there to protect, nurture and support is less than 5 per cent. of their working day. I believe vehemently in empowering professionals to do what they do best&#151;their job. I hope that the Bill will go some way towards giving social workers the trust and freedom that they need to treat each child as a special case.</p>

Every designated teacher with responsibility for promoting the educational achievement of children in care registered at their school requires, in my view, additional training to ensure that each child&#146;s specific and specialised needs are properly met and that they are afforded the opportunity to flourish rather than fail. A case in point is the growing number of children in care who are affected by attachment disorder as opposed to attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Teachers will need additional training to understand that difference and how to respond effectively.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o237"><a name="80616-0015.htm_para15"><a name="08061642000015">I also believe that the Government need to increase the number of registered foster carers as a priority. A more embracing and welcoming recruitment programme, which provides better guidance and less bureaucracy, will, I am sure, stimulate more interest and commitment to a noble, rewarding, and, at times, undervalued role.</p>

They are, of course, now my constituents, and, I am pleased to say, thriving as a family and as individuals. They are testament to how our care system can work.

 I congratulate the hon. Member for Crewe and Nantwich (Mr. Timpson) on his speech.

That can be done only if children and young people feel cared for.</p>

Bill, which the hon. Member for South-West Devon (Mr. Streeter) promoted. Everybody who was involved with the private Member&#146;s Bill and the parliamentary hearings will applaud this Bill&#146;s provisions for short breaks.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o246"><a name="80616-0015.htm_para24"><a name="08061642000025">I also welcome the creation of the role of the designated teacher; the introduction of the bursary of &#163;2,000 for care leavers going into higher education; the &#147;staying put&#148; pilot; extending entitlement to the support of a personal adviser up to the age of 25 for care leavers in education or wishing to return to education; piloting the role of the virtual head; and the additional funding for personalised learning for children in care, who are at risk of not reaching the standards that they should attain.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o247"><a name="80616-0015.htm_para25"><a name="08061642000026">Other hon. Members have mentioned poor educational outcomes for children in care, but no one has pointed out that children are often in care because they were already outside the education system. Dysfunctional families or personal problems meant that they were all too often truants. By the time they enter the care system, they have already lost much schooling and, just as important, the habit of going to school. They are reluctant to go back because they know that they will be behind their fellow pupils and they are embarrassed about that. Given that we are considering educational outcomes for children in care, we must recognise the background and examine the special measures that we can introduce to keep them in school and bolster their confidence as well as improving the education available to them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o248"><a name="80616-0015.htm_para26"><a name="08061642000027">I want to talk about two areas in more detail: first, the voice of the child; and secondly, social work practices, which have not been mentioned in any great detail thus far. On the voice of the child, I welcome the strengthening of the role of the independent reviewing officer and the opportunity for more looked-after children to have independent visitors. However, I again urge the Minister to consider the role of independent advocacy&#151;I know that I seem to say that every time I meet him, but it is an important issue. As has been mentioned, early-day motion 1126, on advocacy for looked-after children, which I tabled, has the support of 144 hon. Members.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o249"><a name="80616-0015.htm_para27"><a name="08061642000028">The purpose of independent advocacy is fundamentally different from that of the IRO or independent visitors. I do not want the Minister to misunderstand my championing of independent advocacy. I recognise what he and colleagues say about all professionals involved with the child having a role in advocating on their behalf. Social workers are trained as advocates on behalf of the people with whom they work, and teachers, foster carers and all the other people involved will speak up for that child. However, speaking up for the child is not the same as sitting down with them, asking them what they want and then putting their wishes into words. Sometimes those words will not be ones that professionals want to hear. That is why the young person needs an advocate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o250"><a name="80616-0015.htm_para28"><a name="08061642000029">Let us try to put ourselves in the place of a 12, 13, 14 or 15-year-old going into a meeting with all those professionals, who are experts in their field. Would we really open our mouths and say things that we knew would annoy them or with which they would disagree? Some young people might do that, but a lot will not. That is why they need a voice to speak up for them&#151;not  <br>

someone to say what is best for them, but to say what they want. The young person might not get it, or it might be impractical; nevertheless, their voice should be heard.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o251"><a name="80616-0015.htm_para29"><a name="08061642000030">As president of Blackpool Advocacy, I have seen for myself the vital work that independent advocates do. The question of who pays for independent advocacy was raised in an earlier intervention. That is an important issue. An advocacy service tries to get money from wherever it can to deliver the work that it does. The important point is that the service&#146;s contract&#151;whether it be with the health authority, a local authority or whomsoever is paying for the services&#151;makes it clear that it is independent. The young person who goes to an independent advocacy service will therefore be guaranteed independence and someone speaking up for them and nobody else&#151;indeed, the advocate might argue with the person providing the funding.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o252"><a name="80616-0015.htm_para30"><a name="08061642000031">As was mentioned earlier, in his report, &#147;People Like Us&#148;, Sir William Utting emphasised the importance of advocacy services, which help to protect children in the care system. More than any other group, disabled children need independent advocacy, especially if they are placed away from home. Many children with a disability have communication problems. It is often frustrating for them to try to explain what their feelings are. The social care staff or other professionals who deal with them are all under pressure, and will often make assumptions about what that young person wants, instead of trying to develop the communication skills to understand what that young person is trying to say. Having an independent advocate working on behalf of young people with disabilities, and especially those with communication problems, is vital.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o253"><a name="80616-0015.htm_para31"><a name="08061642000032">The Bill is very good, but it could be made even better, if the 13,000-plus disabled children and young people placed away from home in England could have a statutory right at least to be offered the opportunity of advocacy services. Not everybody will want or need them, but they should be entitled to the opportunity to ask for them. I therefore hope that the Minister will consider strengthening the guidance on that matter.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o254"><a name="80616-0015.htm_para32"><a name="08061642000033">I know that there is already a lot of guidance on making advocacy services available, but I also know, from research that the Children&#146;s Society has conducted, that not many advocacy services have the skills to deliver to children with disability. Therefore, although I am arguing the case for independent advocacy and saying that the Government should do more to strengthen guidance on the matter, I am also arguing that advocacy service providers need to build up their services, so that they, too, can properly respond if, as I hope, we expand young people&#146;s entitlement to advocacy services. My final point on the matter is that the Children&#146;s Commissioner for England said in response to the &#147;Care Matters&#148; Green Paper:</p>
<a name="80616-0015.htm_brev3"><a name="08061642000092"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Advocacy offers crucial protection where children face particularly complex circumstances, are in contact with...different services, or have communication difficulties.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o255"><a name="80616-0015.htm_para33"><a name="08061642000034">Again, I urge the Government to consider the issue carefully.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o256"><a name="80616-0016.htm_para0"><a name="08061642000035">Hearing the voice of the child is especially important for children with disability who are placed away from home on 52-week-a-year residential placements. We in Blackpool are fortunate, in that a Lancashire child can usually be placed fairly near home, because Lancashire is such a large county. However, I know of many other  <br>

young people who are placed far away from home, because there are no local services. My fear is that some of those children who are placed away from home will not receive visitors, will perhaps lose touch with their families, will not have someone who can speak up for them and might feel that their voices are not being heard.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o257"><a name="80616-0016.htm_para1"><a name="08061642000036">Those young people not only need advocacy services, but should at least be considered for looked-after status, as the Every Disabled Child Matters campaign and other campaigners have argued strongly. Many of them will already have looked-after status, but there are some 338 disabled children on long-term placements away from home who are not looked-after children. Some of those children might not need looked-after status. I am not urging the Minister to ensure that every child affected should have looked-after status, because that might not be appropriate. However, local authorities, which currently have a duty when placing a child away from home to consider looked-after status should do so within strengthened guidance from the Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o258"><a name="80616-0016.htm_para2"><a name="08061642000037">I fear that there is a good deal of confusion about what looked-after status means. It does not necessarily mean a child being in care. A child can be looked-after under section 20 of the Children Act 1989, which means that the parent still has parental responsibility but is working in partnership with the local authority. That would be the ideal outcome for many young people. We have heard in many contributions this evening about the importance of maintaining a child in the family or, if they have to be taken out of the family for whatever reason, of maintaining the link with the family. If a disabled child is looked-after under section 20 of the 1989 Act, those links can be maintained. The child can still have that family link, but receive all the benefits that looked-after status brings.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o259"><a name="80616-0016.htm_para3"><a name="08061642000038">The hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole (Annette Brooke) listed some of those benefits, which include the entitlement to a social worker, three-monthly visits from the social worker, a care plan and contact plan, health assessments and a health plan. However, there is another key aspect, in that if the child has looked-after status for 14 weeks prior to their 18th birthday, the council has further duties of care at least until that child is 21. For a child with disability, that can be even more important than for other children in care in the looked-after system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o260"><a name="80616-0016.htm_para4"><a name="08061642000039">For all those reasons, I hope that the Minister will consider strengthening the guidance. There was some debate in the other place about every child being looked after, but I am not saying that; I am putting the needs of the child first, and doing this for every child would not necessarily be in the best interests of some children&#151;it should be considered at the very least, however. I note that a report from the four UK children&#146;s commissioners to the United Nations committee on the rights of the child, stated:</p>
<a name="80616-0016.htm_brev0"><a name="08061642000093"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;We are concerned that disabled children in 52-week residential placements do not have the same statutory rights and protection afforded to children in the care system. These children should be granted looked after status to ensure they are provided with legal safeguards including more rigorous care planning provision and review.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o261"><a name="80616-0016.htm_para5"><a name="08061642000040">I agree with those four commissioners.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o262"><a name="80616-0016.htm_para6"><a name="08061642000041">I shall move on to make some brief comments on the proposals to establish social work practices. Social work practices could offer new opportunities to support young  <br>

people and provide new opportunities for social workers to practise more creatively in supporting them. I am sure that local authorities would like to see clearer guidance from the Government on their role with regard to social work practices and on how their development might impact on the services that local authorities directly provide.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o263"><a name="80616-0016.htm_para7"><a name="08061642000042">As the chair of the all-party group on social care, I know that we have recently completed an inquiry into the challenges facing the social care work force. Our key findings concerned status, recruitment and involvement. If these social care practices can improve the status, recruitment and involvement of social workers, they will be welcome. I know that the British Association of Social Workers has welcomed these proposals&#151;well, it has certainly welcomed the setting up of pilots. Let us make sure that the pilots are practical, that they are spread around different parts of the country and that lessons are learned from them. If the pilots are successful, let us roll them out.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o264"><a name="80616-0016.htm_para8"><a name="08061642000043">I note that some voluntary sector organisations say that they may rethink whether to bid to be involved in the pilots, mainly because of the possibility of proposals to pay them according to performance outcomes. I am sure that the Minister will liaise with those voluntary sector organisations on the development of an outcomes framework, which could be linked to payments in such a way as to reassure such organisations about their involvement in social work practices. It could be a win-win situation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o265"><a name="80616-0016.htm_para9"><a name="08061642000044">I finish by saying that I welcome the Bill, which includes wide-ranging measures that will improve the life chances of the very vulnerable young people for whom we, local authorities and parents have a responsibility. We should all work together to ensure that those responsibilities are fulfilled so that we and those young people can move on.</p>

It is to the law and practice of adoption that I wish to address my remarks. Clause 8 is, of course, quite right. There is no more profound duty for society as a whole than the well-being of children. We have all been shocked again and again by incidents of the most terrible abuse inflicted on children&#151;incidents that we find it very difficult to believe can occur in our country in the 21st century. That applies, too, where what happens does not hit the headlines and falls far short of grievous abuse, as many children in our society suffer disadvantage of one kind or another.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o268"><a name="80616-0016.htm_para12"><a name="08061642000048">The ideal environment in which a child should grow up is a loving family. That is what is most likely to increase the sum of human happiness. That is what is most likely to lead to children growing up to enjoy full and satisfying lives. That is what is most likely to lead to their avoiding a life of unemployment and crime.</p>

They have a difficult task and I pay tribute to them&#151;to the vast majority of them&#151;who do their very best to perform this task in a selfless and conscientious way. But the statistics tell us clearly that children in care do less well&#151;significantly less well&#151;than other children. The gap between the words with which the Minister for Children, Young People and Families opened her speech and the reality is, alas, a large one.</p>

I shall not go through all 11; I do not need to, because some of the examples that I intended to cite have already been cited by the Minister and my hon. Friend the Member for East Worthing and Shoreham. Let me nevertheless touch on one or two. For example, 13.4 per cent. of looked-after children missed at least 25 days of schooling in 2006. Among year 11 students in 2006, 66 per cent. of looked-after children obtained at least one GCSE at grade A* to G or GNVQ, compared with a national figure of 98 per cent.&#151;66 per cent. as compared with 98 per cent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o272"><a name="80616-0016.htm_para16"><a name="08061642000052">The conclusion that I think any sensible Government would draw from that depressing litany of statistics is that where there is a viable alternative to care, and in particular where it is possible for a child to be brought up within and by a loving family, everything possible should be done to facilitate that alternative, to encourage it and to smooth the path of those who want to provide it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o273"><a name="80616-0016.htm_para17"><a name="08061642000053">The most obvious alternative, or at least one of the most obvious, is adoption. Of course, that will not be possible in all cases for every child, and of course great care must be taken to ensure that any potential adoptive parent is properly checked and helped to understand the difficulties and pitfalls that may lie ahead, but surely that does not mean that those who could provide a loving family should be discouraged, deterred or forced,  <br>

as so many are, to look abroad for the child they want to bring into their family, yet as we all know, that is exactly what happens in far too many cases.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o274"><a name="80616-0016.htm_para18"><a name="08061642000054">I have long been concerned by that state of affairs, but my interest was sharpened by a report that I read recently in <i> The Mail on Sunday</i> on the difficulties encountered by Gavin and Teresa Allen. Mr. Allen is an executive editor of the BBC&#146;s &#147;Question Time&#148; and &#147;Politics Show&#148;, and Mrs. Allen is a director of a staff recruitment business. I should say that, as far as I know, I have never met either of them, although I did check with Mr. Allen this morning that he had no objection to my raising his case in the debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o275"><a name="80616-0016.htm_para19"><a name="08061642000055">The Allens have been together for nearly 20 years and married for nearly 10. They have a comfortable home and supportive family and friends, and they were judged to be a suitable couple to adopt. They were willing to adopt any child who needed a loving family home. Yet despite years of trying, when it came down to specific decisions on specific children, adoption panels repeatedly decided that they were unsuitable in that case. They have come to the shocking and devastating conclusion that all they can offer is outweighed by the huge disadvantage of the fact that they are white and middle class.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o276"><a name="80616-0016.htm_para20"><a name="08061642000056">The Allens&#146; story is one of many. Their story, like so many others, paints a picture of adoption that is far from what I assume any of us in the House would want to be the case. Mrs. Allen told the newspaper:</p>
<a name="80616-0016.htm_brev1"><a name="08061642000094"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;We have discovered that if you are white and have a decent living, the adoption authorities put you to the bottom of the pile.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o277"><a name="80616-0016.htm_para21"><a name="08061642000057">What is more, it seems that adoption panels judge a child to be from a minority ethnic group even when they are mixed race and primarily white. Mr. and Mrs. Allen say that they were repeatedly rejected because of their ethnic background</p>
<a name="80616-0016.htm_brev2"><a name="08061642000095"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;even when a child was only a quarter black, Caribbean or even Irish&#148;.</p>
</ul>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o279"><a name="80616-0016.htm_para23"><a name="08061642000059">Why does this happen? Why are countless children left to be disadvantaged by the care system when there are available suitable adoptive parents? Mr. and Mrs. Allen say that they believe</p>
<a name="80616-0016.htm_brev4"><a name="08061642000097"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;the answer is obvious... one social services director told us categorically that he would rather a black child be brought up in the care system than in a white family.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o280"><a name="80616-0016.htm_para24"><a name="08061642000060">I pose this question to the Minister: is that state of affairs what the Government want?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o281"><a name="80616-0016.htm_para25"><a name="08061642000061">According to the law, the paramount consideration in cases of adoption is the welfare of the child. That is exactly as it should be. It is true that the Adoption and Children Act 2002 requires an adoption agency to give due consideration to the child&#146;s religious persuasion, racial origin and cultural and linguistic background. It also requires an adoption agency to give due consideration to the wishes of the natural parent. But I repeat, according to the law the paramount consideration must be the welfare of the child. So, although factors such as race and cultural background have to be considered, they should not be able to prevent a child from being placed  <br>

with adopters of a different background if that is in the child&#146;s best interests. Yet clearly, far too often, that is what happens.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o282"><a name="80616-0016.htm_para26"><a name="08061642000062">Does the reason for that perhaps lie with the statutory guidance issued by the Government under the 2002 Act? That guidance emphasises the requirements to consider the child&#146;s religious and cultural upbringing, as well as any wishes and feelings that the child&#146;s parents or guardian may have about those matters. Is it perhaps the case that adoption agencies and social services departments are placing too much emphasis on that part of the guidance and not enough on the paramount consideration of the welfare of the child?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o283"><a name="80616-0016.htm_para27"><a name="08061642000063">The answers to those questions seem to me to be of great significance. If social service departments are misinterpreting the law, and misinterpreting or failing to apply the law and the Government&#146;s guidance, that might provide my party&#151;and particularly my hon. Friends on the Front Bench&#151;with a rare opportunity to change things while still in opposition nationally. After all, many&#151;probably most&#151;of the local authorities that exercise political control of their social services departments are now in the hands of the Conservative party. If those departments are getting it wrong, my hon. Friends should be able to use their influence to put the situation right. If, on the other hand, the guidance is wrong, the Government should change it. If, contrary to what seems to be the case, the law is wrong, the law should be changed, and this Bill provides the opportunity to do it.</p>
<a name="08061642000089">
<p>I would very much like the Minister to answer the following questions. Is he satisfied with the current state of affairs on adoption? If not&#151;I hope that he is not satisfied&#151;why does he think that social services departments and adoption agencies are getting it wrong, and what does he propose to do about it? I look forward to his replies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o287"><a name="80616-0016.htm_para31"><a name="08061642000068">Smacking means deliberately hurting children as punishment. It should have no place in a modern, civilised society, especially at the moment when we are trying to put an end to all forms of violence. Parliament must send an unequivocal message that hitting all children is as unacceptable and unlawful as hitting anyone else. This is an equality and human rights issue. Children and young people do not have the same rights and protections as adults, yet are often in far more vulnerable situations.</p>

 I welcome all the steps taken in the Bill, but I think the most important comment that has been made about it is that it represents a radical step change in ambitions. I am sure the Minister will not be surprised to hear that I intend to begin by talking about the ambitions that we have for our children. What has been said today suggests that our ambition is not just to keep them safe and healthy; we want them to be happy, and then, when we see them safe, healthy and happy, we want them to achieve things. We want them to develop their own potential and become fully human beings, fully part of society, and fully achieving. At every step that the Bill takes, we must retain that ambition for the children whom it seeks to support.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o290"><a name="80616-0016.htm_para34"><a name="08061642000072">It is extremely welcome that the Bill places a statutory duty on the Secretary of State to promote the well-being of children in England. That is indeed a radical step change. It represents a monumental difference in the way in which we in the House behave, because if our Secretary of State has that duty, we as Members of Parliament must have a duty to ensure that it is carried out.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o291"><a name="80616-0017.htm_para0"><a name="08061642000073">The Minister will, again, not be surprised to learn that I want to press the ambition for children who are in care and leaving care to have the right of access to full and proper support until they are 21. If it is appropriate for them to stay with a foster carer they should be able  <br>

to do so, but if that is not appropriate they should have alternative proper, effective support. The Bill gives us an opportunity to stretch out and to aim high. An ambition must be seized when the opportunity comes, and we in the House must take the opportunity now to agree that until the age of 21, young people need access to support. The Minister said at the beginning of her speech that most young people do not leave home and stop receiving parental support until the age of 24, so specifying the age of 21 does not strike me as over-ambitious.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o292"><a name="80616-0017.htm_para1"><a name="08061642000074">Members have commented on how poor educational outcomes are among children in care in comparison with other children. Only 12 per cent. of looked-after children achieve five GCSEs or the equivalent, compared with 59 per cent. nationally, and only 6 per cent. of children who were looked after at the age of 16 had entered higher education by the age of 19. In 2006, 35 per cent.&#151;one third&#151;of looked-after pupils did not sit any GSCE examinations or GNVQ equivalents.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o293"><a name="80616-0017.htm_para2"><a name="08061642000075">Some children take a little longer than others to achieve success, perhaps because they have rather more problems to overcome than others. The time when children are sitting GCSEs or A-levels is also the time when those in care are most likely to be leaving it. A quarter of children leave care in their 16th year, at a time when they are sitting exams. Very few children&#151;a tiny fraction of the total&#151; are still in care at the age of 18, but how many are still sitting A-levels when they have reached their 18th birthdays? For most children that is not particularly unusual, but for children in care it means that they will no longer have access to full and proper support from a local authority.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o294"><a name="80616-0017.htm_para3"><a name="08061642000076">Fostering Network has given me the example of a foster parent fostering a young person who arrived as a teenager. He had suffered significant trauma but had managed to deal with it, had settled and was beginning to succeed. This young man became head boy at his school and was studying for A-levels in the hope of going to university. When he turns 18, however, all support from the local authority will cease, at the time when he will be doing his A-levels. In order to provide stability for him, his foster carer is spending almost &#163;20,000 of her own money to convert the loft so that he can stay with her while she fosters other children. That is a phenomenal commitment, but she should not have to do it, and many foster carers could not do it. That story provides an incredibly convincing argument, however, for making sure that young people can access effective support from somebody who is totally committed to their success.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o295"><a name="80616-0017.htm_para4"><a name="08061642000077">It is great that people will have access to advisers, but what about somebody they can phone up at night or at the weekend so that they can tell them about things? That is what makes the real difference when people are looking for support. What about that tiny fraction of people in care who go to university, and who need somewhere to go home to, or someone to ring up when they have a problem? Also, what about those other young people who should be going to university, or on to vocational training or further education? We must make sure that they have access, too. We do not need pilot projects to tell us that people do better if they have got someone backing them up. All Members of this  <br>

House know that people do not make it on their own. We have a duty to make sure that we give these young people access to proper support when they need it, especially when they have had a bad start anyway and they need our intervention more than others.</p>

I thought I should be focusing on them, but then I realised that I was suffering from a lack of ambition, because all these young people should be getting access to support up to the age of 21. They all need the same thing. We must stretch our ambitions, because if we do not, we will not deliver for the more vulnerable children who are in care and who are finding it difficult and do not have people to intervene for them. I ask the Minister to address this matter with serious intent so that we can bring it forward.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o297"><a name="80616-0017.htm_para6"><a name="08061642000079">We should not rely on pilots, but instead act on what we already know and use the evidence that there already is. In 2006, Joseph Rowntree research showed that 36 per cent. of young people reported being homeless at some time in the year after leaving care, and the Rainer Home Alone report found that almost one in six care leavers had unsuitable accommodation. We should give them access up to the age of 21 to someone who can help them get into proper accommodation and do all the things that a mum or dad or friendly relative can do when young people are trying to set themselves up in their own home and work out how to live in an adult world.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o298"><a name="80616-0017.htm_para7"><a name="08061642000080">The Minister will not be surprised that I also wish to bring up the matter of support for children in care who cannot handle it and who have run away. When Lancashire police set up their &#147;mountains into molehills&#148; project, they used some very effective computer systems to track the reports that they were getting about children who had gone missing. They found that they were spending more than &#163;6 million a year on investigating reports and that each report was costing them in the region of &#163;1,000 to investigate, and when they did further analysis they found that the majority of the reports were about young people under 18 and the majority of those were about people in the care of the local authority who were consistently running away. One young girl did so 78 times&#151;a cost of &#163;78,000 in police time that did not benefit her. However, when the police got together with the local authority and the care homes and identified which children were at risk, and started working with the care homes to do something about why they were running away and to deal with that, running away incidents reduced radically. We have had the same finding from a number of different authorities; Leicester police force found exactly the same thing. What they are telling us is that if we work effectively to identify children at risk and then work with care homes to identify why this is happening, we can put it right and prevent these young people from getting involved in all the things that some of them get involved in.

this issue showed that many of those young people were not just running away from something; they were being targeted by predatory adults and running to something. They were being groomed&#151;and these were children in the care of a local authority.</p>

Friend the Member for Stockport (Ann Coffey), who has been working very actively on this issue, by asking the Minister a question. Will he ensure that inspection processes involve reports of instances of running away and of assaults, and that they take proper account of what is going on in care homes and of whether these things are being dealt with effectively?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o300"><a name="80616-0017.htm_para9"><a name="08061642000082">Today, we have had the wonderful launch of the young runaways action plan, which is giving support for all young runaways, but unless we make sure that care homes and their staff understand that they have a key role to play and that it will be supported but also monitored, we will not make the proper change that we can make, if we are ambitious, for children in care.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o301"><a name="80616-0017.htm_para10"><a name="08061642000083">Finally, will my hon. Friend the Minister give some further thought to children in custody? We have had quite a focus on the fact that a child in care is more likely to end up in custody than in university. I have had what is in many ways the privilege of working with some of the people at the young offenders institute in Thorn Cross, in my constituency. I have been really impressed by the dedication of the staff there, who have been working extremely hard to make sure that young offenders in that institute are in the first instance safe, but also have the opportunity to understand why they are there and how they can stay out in future. Those are absolutely crucial things. I would be far happier, as everybody here would, if we could be far more effective, so that young people do not get themselves into that position. However, I want to know how the Bill is going properly to support vulnerable young people in custody, so that they have access to a social worker who is not travelling a long distance and is perhaps unable to get there, but who is there and can develop a relationship with them, and who can be interested in and supportive of them in the long term.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o302"><a name="80616-0017.htm_para11"><a name="08061642000084">I also want to know how we are going to ensure that young offenders have access to the kind of things being done at Thorn Cross, where the Cheshire fire service has a fire cadet programme. Young people learn about social responsibility, meet role models whom they can look up to, and are getting involved in doing good in their local community. It has been a very effective programme. As effective, in many ways, has been the programme from the Halle orchestra, which has been working with young people and involving them in music. When they are in a position to leave the institute, it tries to match them up with a youth orchestra or a band, so that they have a different peer group. Such things are really important in making a difference for young people.</p>

Some of them have never had any opportunity for education before, and they are getting NVQs at the young offender&#146;s institute and then going out into the community and helping voluntary organisations, thereby putting something back in. This is a really important issue and I am raising it so determinedly because we have got to be ambitious to protect the safety of young  <br>

<p><a name="stpa_o310"><a name="80616-0017.htm_para19"><a name="08061645000005">I must say that I enthusiastically endorse what has been said by the hon.

That is not, in any sense, to belittle or dismiss the important improvements in arrangements in relation to independent reviewing officers. Much thought has been given to that subject, it has been open to consultation, Ministers have reflected on the matter, and Lord Adonis conducted himself in the other place with a diligence and breadth of mind that most of us who know him have come to expect from him.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o311"><a name="80616-0017.htm_para20"><a name="08061645000006">I simply put it to the Minister of State that the role of the independent reviewing officer is important, but it is discrete role. The role of the independent visitor is important, but it is a separate function. The role of an independent advocate should be established, valued, supported, extended and made an entitlement for people in care because of its own merits. It seems to me that the significance of the role of the advocate is that he or she would be genuinely separate from, uninfluenced by and independent of the decision-making process that his or her services on behalf of the child or young people could hope to influence.</p>

The argument has already been powerfully made. I think it could be contended quite forcefully&#151;I am not a lawyer; I say that as a matter of some very considerable pride&#151;that article 12 of the United Nations convention on the rights of the child would probably make a potent case in support of the establishment of independent advocacy.

not. I want to underline the fact that children or young people with speech, language or communication difficulties of a significant intensity should be regarded as suffering from a disability every bit as anxiety provoking, debilitating and potentially life or potential limiting as would be a physical impairment or a mental disability. For children who probably know what they want, know what they need, know what their interests are, know what they want to be done for them and know how they wish to contribute to its being done to be unable themselves to articulate it is quite the most breathtakingly frustrating state of affairs. For such children, the right to independent advocacy could make a decisive difference.</p>

My own view&#151;it is shared by some although not by all contributors to the special educational needs debate&#151;is that it would be wise to separate the assessment of need from the funding of provision. Whether or not that is desirable, I put it to right hon. and hon. Members that, if the average child with SEN is in a bit of a difficulty in negotiating with either a recalcitrant or simply a cash-strapped local authority, we should think how much worse it is for a child in care who does not even have the advantage of a parent or parents articulating, advocating, agitating, lobbying and campaigning on his or her behalf.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o315"><a name="80616-0017.htm_para24"><a name="08061645000010">In those circumstances, there is a compelling case for independent advocacy, and I would go further, as did the hon.

Decisions will be made on their behalf. Events are unfolding. Judgments have to be made. Advocates are required.

Friend that in probably any imaginable system some regard will have to be paid to resources. There has to be some limit; it is not possible to satisfy every demand. It seems to me, however, that the difference at the moment is that there is an inbuilt incentive to keep costs down and perhaps in some cases, inadvertently and subliminally, to put the issue of the purse before the requirement of the child or young person.</p>

across the country that, for example, the post should be taken up by the special educational needs co-ordinator. It might be advisable for that to happen, but it should not be assumed as a matter of course. If the SENCO already has an extensive miscellany of responsibilities and rather limited time in which to fulfil them, there might be merit in having somebody else perform that role.</p>

It will require backfilling so that that member of staff can go away and receive the necessary training, advice, instruction and practical experience before coming back to deliver. There is thus a world of difference between the proclamation that such a thing should happen and the observable evidence on the ground that it is happening, but I am sure that the Minister is aware of that. We have to start somewhere and I welcome the inclusion of that measure in the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o319"><a name="80616-0018.htm_para2"><a name="08061645000016">I share the concern that there is a mismatch between the commitment to an entitlement for those going into higher education provided for in clause 21 and the reference in the context of those seeking to go into further education to assistance to enable them to do so. Those words were not chosen accidentally. They clearly denote a difference in terms of the intent and scale of ministerial commitment. Let me be absolutely clear: the Government are right on higher education, and the measure is consistent with the agenda of trying to raise aspiration, to lift young people up and to say that there should not be some sort of artificial ceiling. Of course, historically, the figures for participation in higher education by those in care have been lamentably low. Although they have somewhat improved of late, they remain grossly unsatisfactory. That has been the case under successive Governments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o320"><a name="80616-0018.htm_para3"><a name="08061645000017">I do not knock the commitment that the Government have made. Moreover, I think that the chosen figure of a couple of thousand pounds is not entirely arbitrary. It has been chosen on the basis of the expected debt levels of someone coming from care into higher education and so on and on the financial disincentive that the present arrangements apply. That makes sense, but we are in danger, if we do not amend the Bill, of discriminating against those who want to go into further education, vocational training or apprenticeships. I cannot see any merit in doing so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o321"><a name="80616-0018.htm_para4"><a name="08061645000018">Comment has already been made on the fact that large numbers&#151;by far the majority&#151;of people in care leave before the age of 18. If they are still in care and leave at the age of 19, if memory serves me 30 per cent. enter the not in education, employment or training&#151;or NEET&#151;category. There is a concentration of need among those leaving the system who are uneducated, untrained, unqualified, often historically and currently unwell, and unable effectively to equip themselves to contribute to their own personal fulfilment or the strength of the economy or public services. We ought to be saying, &#147;Let&#146;s support them if they want to go on to further education.&#148; Not to do so constitutes unwarranted, if unintended, discrimination, for the reason that I gave. I put it to the Minister of State and the Under-Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families, the hon. Member for Cardiff, West (Kevin Brennan), that that seems illogical.</p>

funding on the grounds that there will not be that much take-up, so the cost to public funds will not be all that high. That would be an unworthy basis on which to operate, but the Minister is nothing if not worthy, conscientious and dedicated, so I do not think that that can be the reasoning; however, that is how it looks to the cynic. We should make a comparable commitment to those seeking to go on to training, further education or apprenticeships; we will then be applying an equal standard to both categories.</p>

I agree with new clause 7: it seems entirely right that the list of organisations subject to a public duty to promote the welfare of the child or young person should include what was the Border and Immigration Agency and is now the UK Border Agency. If right hon. and hon. Members look at the Children Act 2004, they will see a plethora of organisations that will be subject to a duty to promote the welfare of the child, although their primary purpose is something other than the promotion of that welfare. We are talking about the national health service, the education service, children&#146;s service providers, the Prison Service, the probation service and the police service. To my knowledge, it is no longer argued about any of those that the imposition of that duty would somehow prevent them from fulfilling their primary purpose, or would dilute their effectiveness in seeking to do so. If they can combine their wider responsibilities with the fulfilment of that duty, I see absolutely no reason why the UK Border Agency should not be able to do so.</p>

I ask her not to let the Bill be driven by the preconceptions or apprehensions of the Home Office. I appeal to her to be bold. There is sometimes a concern that one has to appease the red-top tabloids&#151;that the media are obsessed with the level of immigration and that, to some extent, one has to diffuse the tension, allay the anxiety and remove the opportunity to be beaten with the tabloid stick. The Government should be bold about that. There will be cross-party support if the Government accept the Bill as amended in the other place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o325"><a name="80616-0018.htm_para8"><a name="08061645000022">What is more, public opinion on such matters is more sophisticated and enlightened than colleagues sometimes suppose. Yes, people are concerned about uncontrolled immigration, and it is right that that should be addressed, but they are also concerned about the rights, treatment, entitlement and pursuit of the welfare of children. No one is more vulnerable than a child who has been trafficked into the country, or who is a persecuted, timorous, frightened but hopeful asylum seeker. I appeal to the Government to consider the matter. In other respects, they have tightened up on judicial review; if they are worried that it will not be possible to return children to their countries of origin under any circumstances, that fear is not justified. I appeal to the Minister at least not to close the door on the subject, but to consider the merits of cross-party discussions and an agreement to retain the Bill as it is.</p>

sure that we need so many pilots. The Northern Ireland Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety operates a miscellany of schemes, the results of which are clearly observable. There is a patchwork of other such provision in other parts of the country, too. We should not delay for the sake of delay. If we think that there is a reasonable evidence base, let us go with it.

<p><a name="stpa_o327"><a name="80616-0018.htm_para10"><a name="08061645000024">My final point is about the architecture of the Bill. I do not cavil at it, but it carries an implication. As Members will notice if they look at the Bill clause by clause, of the 45 clauses no fewer than 13 provide for secondary legislation such as order-making powers and statutory instruments. One of the two schedules allows for such provision, too. That is sometimes necessary&#151;sometimes it is not&#151;and that is the case in many instances in the Bill. Fair dos&#151;I am content with that&#151;but if substantial parts of the Bill are to be dealt with later by secondary legislation, and we are advised that many of those provisions will be subject to the negative procedure of the House whereby, unless there is a specific request to debate them, they are not debated, there is an obligation on Ministers to try to introduce draft regulations before the Bill completes its passage through the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o328"><a name="80616-0018.htm_para11"><a name="08061645000025">That is an habitual war cry on my part, but the difficulty otherwise is that we are to some extent voting for a pig in a poke. I would like to know more of the positive detail of that secondary legislation. Let us see it. It is a good Bill, and it is under the stewardship of an immensely capable ministerial team. I wish it well, but it can be made a little bit better, and I hope that my comments are taken in the constructive spirit in which they are intended.</p>

He made changes such as placing the new duty on the Secretary of State to promote well-being, and the new duty on local authorities to plan a range of accommodation for those in care; and he agreed to the right to breaks from caring for disabled children. Those were major improvements; I just want more in this Chamber.</p>

I therefore hope that the Bill provides an opportunity to do what they want us to do. The Government have not been inactive for 11 years&#151;in fact, they deserve a lot of praise for what they have done for children in the care system. I remember the Quality Protects initiative; today, we have the brilliant Care Matters agenda; and, of course, there is the Children (Leaving Care) Act 2000. More generally&#151;and it is important to place looked-after children in the context of all children&#151;we have had the excellent Every Child Matters agenda and the children&#146;s plan.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o331"><a name="80616-0018.htm_para14"><a name="08061645000029">At the end of March, the Government, the Association of Directors of Children&#146;s Services and the Local Government Association published an implementation plan called &#147;Care Matters: Time to deliver for children in care&#148;, which provides all the tools and advice that people could possibly need to do a good job, and that brings me to the Bill, which gives them the job to do.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o332"><a name="80616-0018.htm_para15"><a name="08061645000030">For me, the starting point is to avoid the use of care if at all possible in every case. That is not just about early intervention, as we have heard tonight, but about a child-friendly society. It is about eradicating child poverty, and making our communities much more supportive of parents and the difficult work that they do in bringing up children. If care is necessary, we should try to make it involve short-lived interventions that result in the successful return of children to their families. I use the world &#147;family&#148; in the broadest sense of the term, including kinship care. In particular, like other Members, I support those brilliant grandparents who cares not only for their children, when they thought that they had seen the last of them as adults, but for their grandchildren.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o333"><a name="80616-0018.htm_para16"><a name="08061645000031">I detect in clause 36 a helpful little step in the right direction in respect of the entitlement to apply for a residence order, but what is really needed to make care, such as kinship care, work effectively is properly structured support, including the ability of agencies to pay carers for bringing up children. I welcome in clause 24 the slight change in respect of cash payments that can be made to such people, but I am talking about help with the legal costs of getting the residence order and with the social security benefits that are constantly denied to the grandparents but that the parents would have received, and with all the other obstacles that are placed in people&#146;s way when they are doing brilliant work on society&#146;s behalf.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o334"><a name="80616-0018.htm_para17"><a name="08061645000032">There is also no explicit provision for sibling contact.

The National Children&#146;s Bureau reminds us in its briefing&#151;perhaps surprisingly&#151;of the many physical illnesses and conditions that are missed when children entering care are assessed. Those factors convinced me that effort and money must be invested in the physical and mental health care and emotional well-being of looked-after children to ensure sufficiently high standards of care for all looked-after children. On the question of how to achieve that, perhaps we can debate in Committee whether more is needed through the letter of the law, through regulations or through guidance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o338"><a name="80616-0018.htm_para21"><a name="08061645000036">On the question of foster care or residential care, two out of three children who go into public care are fostered. The majority of fostered children return to their own families within a year&#151;clearly, a very successful outcome. However, foster care is not the right solution for all looked-after children; it depends on the assessment of each child&#146;s individual needs. When foster care is the right choice, none the less, there must be an adequate supply of foster carers to meet the demand&#151;that is, not only enough foster carers to meet total demand, but enough to match individual needs. Issues about pay and support for foster carers also need to be addressed if more children are to enjoy positive experiences in foster care placements. Support should encompass a system for investigating allegations against foster carers that is fair to complainants and fair to the foster carers themselves.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o339"><a name="80616-0018.htm_para22"><a name="08061645000037">Some constraints are beyond the control of foster carers, such as local authorities pushing children out of care at 16 and the current legal age limit of 18 for a foster care placement. We politicians must do more to remove those constraints. Children in residential care were often, in their early lives, powerless in their families, so they may depend on their residential care worker to be their best advocate. All social care staff should be given professional development and support to enable them to be the most effective and efficient advocates for the children in their care. Their work must support what is done to intervene in, and help, families, even before children become legally subject to the duties of local authorities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o340"><a name="80616-0018.htm_para23"><a name="08061645000038">It is vital that we make social care work more attractive so that we can get away from the current situation, with which we are all familiar, of a high threshold of intervention in families because of a lack of overall social care capacity. That, in turn, should help to prevent the high turnover that such children often experience.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o341"><a name="80616-0018.htm_para24"><a name="08061645000039">I have been asked to be brief, so I shall make just two additional points. First, many Members have called for the support of advocacy for children, and I very strongly support it. Secondly, it is absolutely terrible that youngsters are taken out of care without preparations for independent living, or taken out of care at 18 and put into a home that is not at all suitable for them. Many then fall into the kind of difficulties that we have heard about, involving all the depressing statistics cited at the beginning of the debate.</p>

Members will be aware that I chair an organisation called Justice for Families, which concerns itself with failures and miscarriages of justice in the family courts. This debate is like &#147;Groundhog Day&#148; in that we are again talking about all the various processes such as kinship caring that we wanted to achieve years ago, but that still do not happen. In essence, that comes down to a failure of accountability. Tomorrow morning, as part of an all-party group of MPs, I will table two new clauses, one of which deals with how people take advice in the family courts and the accountability of the process while maintaining confidentiality. The other deals with how we scrutinise the decision-making process in the family courts. We will not be allowed to attack that particular aspect, which is covered by section 31 of the Children Act 1989. That section is in part 1 of that Act, while parts 2 and 3 are covered by the Bill and can therefore be amended.</p>

Unless we find a mechanism for making all the practitioners&#151;not just the good ones&#151;follow the law, do things the right way, use independent advocates and avoid people perverting the course of justice by threatening to take their money off them, we will be wasting our time producing new statute, because it will be ignored by the worst practitioners. Another problem is that those practitioners are required to follow the Government targets, although I accept that the Government scrapped a lot of those targets from 1 April. The critical issue is one of accountability and following the law. Unless proposals for that are included, we will have all the nice, fine words but things will continue in the same vein.</p>

That will be a great challenge in many cases. Occasionally, I find that 16 and 17-year-olds have been given council tenancies, but these young people do not have the life skills, personal responsibility or discipline to be able to cope with living independently. We need to find other ways of giving them a halfway house between being a child and an adult and giving them the support and back-up of an adult.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o346"><a name="80616-0018.htm_para29"><a name="08061645000046">The other aspect is the requirement to provide respite care for families with children with very special needs. I think particularly of children on the autistic disorder  <br>

That accommodation will have to be tailor made and very specific to the needs of children who do not respond well to change and the unfamiliar, with highly trained staff to look after them so that those families can enjoy their respite without having to worry about whether their children are being looked after properly.</p>

 We have heard throughout the debate agreement on both sides of the House that every child needs a stable, secure and caring environment in which to grow and thrive, never more so than when they are unable to live with their own parents and the duty to care for them falls on to the state.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o348"><a name="80616-0019.htm_para0"><a name="08061645000049">The reasons why children come into care differ, but for two out of three looked-after children the main reason why social services first get involved in a child&#146;s life is abuse or neglect. Such children are already vulnerable, and the support that they are given should provide the stability and security that they need. It is important to note that the majority of children in care are aged between 10 and 15, which is not an easy period of life for many children and certainly not for those subject to the turmoil of going into care.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o349"><a name="80616-0019.htm_para1"><a name="08061645000050">As my hon. Friend the Member for East Worthing and Shoreham (Tim Loughton) has said, we welcome the opportunity that the Bill presents to shape important improvements in the way in which looked-after children are cared for and to help them get the best possible start in life. It is our duty to ensure that the Bill goes as far as possible to address the many failings that hon. Members have referred to in their contributions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o350"><a name="80616-0019.htm_para2"><a name="08061645000051">I join the hon. Member for Stafford (Mr. Kidney) in congratulating the other place on many of the changes already made to the Bill. Government amendments in the other place have helped to clarify the need for an in-built presumption of the promotion of stability in every child&#146;s life, with the child&#146;s family continuing to play a pivotal role wherever possible. Family remains important, not only because family relationships are some of the most important in our lives, but because last year more than 40 per cent. of looked-after children returned to live with their parents. That enduring relationship remains important, and the Government amendments in the other place recognised that more needs to be done in the Bill to spell out the important role of the family in the hierarchy of options that a child has for placement, as set out in clause 8.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o351"><a name="80616-0019.htm_para3"><a name="08061645000052">The clause also highlights the need for local authorities to ensure that placements allow children to live near home, that education is not disrupted and that a child lives with sisters or brothers, if they are also in care.

to continue to raise their aspirations. As the Bill proceeds through Committee, we will seek the Government&#146;s support for further amendments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o352"><a name="80616-0019.htm_para4"><a name="08061645000053">The debate in the other place led to some important amendments, and I pay tribute to the work done by my noble Friend Baroness Morris of Bolton, whose successful amendment of the Bill in the other place has resulted in a clear and robust statutory duty on the Border and Immigration Agency to safeguard and promote the welfare of children who pass through its care by amending the Children Act 2004. A number of other Government amendments were added in response to important concerns expressed by the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee and the Grand Committee. Today&#146;s debate suggests a great deal of scope for the Government to go further.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o353"><a name="80616-0019.htm_para5"><a name="08061645000054">We have heard several important contributions from all parties, but none were more important than that of my hon. Friend the Member for Crewe and Nantwich (Mr. Timpson), who took the opportunity afforded by today&#146;s debate to make his maiden speech. I congratulate him on an outstanding maiden speech; he spoke movingly about his predecessor and her unstinting commitment to this place and her constituents in Crewe and Nantwich. In the best spirit of maiden speeches, he brought to life the vibrant nature of his constituency, of which, as many hon. Members noted, we have first-hand experience. He brought to life its history and its potential, which I am sure will be realised through his hard work and commitment. It was most appropriate that he made his maiden speech on children in care, something of which he and his family have extensive experience. He spoke of some of the 86 children that his family fostered while he was growing up, and I am sure that his contribution has already demonstrated the value that he will bring to this place both from his family life and from his experience as a family lawyer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o354"><a name="80616-0019.htm_para6"><a name="08061645000055">We heard an important contribution from the right hon. Member for North-West Durham (Hilary Armstrong), who pointed out that the Government have made a significant investment in children in care in recent years. In the other place, the noble Lord Adonis confirmed that between 2001 and 2005 &#163;230 million was spent to support children in residential care and &#163;330 million was spent to support children in foster care. As the right hon. Lady pointed out, despite that investment only modest improvements, which do not match the investment, have been made. For example, the proportion of children who get five or more GCSEs has improved by only 3 per cent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o355"><a name="80616-0019.htm_para7"><a name="08061645000056">The right hon. Lady also mentioned the Government&#146;s need to focus on those most in need and her work on social exclusion. I hope that her words resonate with the Under-Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families, the hon. Member for Cardiff, West (Kevin Brennan), who will reply to the debate, because she is right that the Government have not taken the action that is needed to focus on children most in need. I have highlighted that, especially in the context of Sure Start, for which the Government have recognised the need to improve and increase the number of outreach workers. However, there is evidence of worrying cuts.</p>

Friend the Member for East Worthing and Shoreham made a characteristically excellent contribution, which showed his commitment to and long-standing work on the subject. I want to highlight his comments about the widening gap between looked-after children and their peers. Many hon. Members referred to those worrying statistics throughout the debate and the cost that that presents to the state if those children, left without the support they require, enter the offenders&#146; system. Indeed, my hon. Friend pointed out that persistent offenders individually cost the state some &#163;164,000 a year, and perhaps we need to take more account of that cost when we evaluate the importance of the measure.</p>

Members did not mention&#151;the problems that face those who wish to adopt a child in this country and the apparently overwhelming influence of a child&#146;s ethnic background when local authorities judge parents&#146; potential suitability. The House will listen carefully to the Under-Secretary&#146;s response to my right hon. and learned Friend&#146;s contribution, because my right hon. and learned Friend has highlighted an issue about which hon. Members of all parties are deeply concerned.</p>

Friend the Member for Buckingham (John Bercow) spoke with his usual thoughtfulness and eloquence about the additions that he would like to make to the Bill, and he highlighted independent advocacy as one issue that requires further examination. He stressed the unique role that independent advocates play in supporting looked-after children and their value for the more than one in four children in care who also have special educational needs. The hon. Member for Blackpool, North and Fleetwood (Mrs. Humble) also raised that issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o360"><a name="80616-0019.htm_para12"><a name="08061645000063">My hon. Friend the Member for Upminster (Angela Watkinson) raised, at the tail end of the debate, the important issues of accommodation for those leaving care and of respite care. She also mentioned something that clearly requires careful discussion in Committee, namely the challenges that the Bill sets local authorities. Many hon. Members have local authorities that do well in looking after the needs of children in care. My local authority in Hampshire has great experience of kinship care. I learned that that is not available in many parts of the country, but we take it for granted in my part of Hampshire. We need to ensure that local authorities can meet the challenges that the Bill creates for them.</p>

suffer from a mental health problem. I hope that that issue will be taken up either by the Under-Secretary when he closes the debate or in further debate, because only a fraction of those 27,000 children in care aged between five and 17 who have a mental health problem have any hope of receiving the support that they need. Indeed, briefings for this debate indicate that only 10,000 of those children will receive the support that they need from mental health services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o362"><a name="80616-0019.htm_para14"><a name="08061645000065">The Minister for Children, Young People and Families also discussed the importance of closing the inequality gap. I want to pick up on the words that my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Folkestone and Hythe used about the gap that concerns us all on the Conservative Benches&#151;the gap between the words used in debates such as this and the reality that is delivered on the ground. We all want to work together to ensure that that gap closes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o363"><a name="80616-0019.htm_para15"><a name="08061645000066">There were also contributions from the hon. Members for North-East Derbyshire (Natascha Engel), for Warrington, South (Helen Southworth) and for Birmingham, Yardley (John Hemming). Unfortunately, time is short, and I cannot go into great detail about the issues that they covered, but I am sure that they will want to play a full part in Committee and the remaining stages of the Bill.</p>

We will do all that we can to ensure that it is ambitious, to use the words of the hon. Member for North-East Derbyshire, and that it does all that it can to raise our aspirations for what can be achieved for looked-after children. As my hon. Friend the Member for East Worthing and Shoreham said in his opening statement, we will seek to press the Government further in Committee on a number of critical areas to improve the Bill&#146;s impact on the lives of looked-after children in all our constituencies throughout the country and to emphasise the importance of strengthening family contact, because the family is the source of our closest and most meaningful relationships, which is why we want to introduce a presumption of contact between all children in care and their siblings.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o365"><a name="80616-0019.htm_para17"><a name="08061645000068">Because we know how important stability is for children, we want to reduce the bureaucratic burden for social workers, so that there is less turnover in that profession and that, as a result, children receive the continuity of care that they need. Staff turnover among social workers in London is currently 15 per cent. every year, and it is even higher in other parts of the country. That is not only a great cause of concern for the children involved, but a great waste for local authorities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o366"><a name="80616-0019.htm_para18"><a name="08061645000069">Additionally, we want to help children who wish to stay in care until they are 18, and we want to give care leavers a nominated social worker whom they can contact for advice. Most social workers do a remarkable job in the most difficult circumstances. Their profession has undergone a great deal of scrutiny, and some would say that their reputation had been bruised in recent years. That needs to be addressed head-on. As my hon. Friend the Member for East Worthing and Shoreham has said, we want to consider the appointment of a chief social worker, who would be the public face of the profession.</p>

I am sure that all right hon. and hon. Members would like to thank those organisations that spent a considerable time providing us with the briefings that we needed in order to have such a high quality debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o369"><a name="80616-0019.htm_para21"><a name="08061645000072">In conclusion, this debate shows that there is no difficulty in identifying the problems and no shortage of desire to raise the aspirations of those who work with looked-after children. However, over the past decade&#151;and perhaps even before that&#151;there has been a failure to deliver a real change for children who are looked-after. We on this side of the House will work with the Government to help ensure that we make the most of this opportunity, because there is a will among all right hon. and hon.

would provide. It is the job of every professional within that system to support the well-being and development of children and young people as far as they can, not just as far as it applies to their job title. That applies not just to our care system, but right across children&#146;s services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o372"><a name="80616-0019.htm_para24"><a name="08061646000011">In fact, everybody is part of team Every Child Matters. This legislation is a core element of our &#147;Care Matters&#148; agenda, which will support high-quality professionals providing a high standard of service in a world-class system. The aim is to provide children and young people in the care system with those fundamentals that my right hon. Friend the Minister talked about earlier: good-quality parenting, raising aspirations for young people in care, and giving those young people a real voice and, most crucially, stability in their young lives. I am pleased that hon. Members across the House have welcomed many aspects of the Bill in support of those aims: securing local, stable placements as a priority; the centrality of the voice of the child in everything we do; improving care planning; and better support to help young people make the transition into adult life.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o373"><a name="80616-0019.htm_para25"><a name="08061646000012">Members have raised other specific issues during the course of debate, and I will try in the time available to do some justice to them, even if I cannot do full justice to all. The hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham (Tim Loughton) told us about some of the amendments he intends to introduce as the Bill progresses, so we look forward to seeing them. He mentioned a welfare checklist. Of course, section 22 of the Children Act 1989 already sets a framework for local authority decision making. It makes it clear that local authorities have a duty to &#147;safeguard and promote&#148; the child&#146;s welfare; that the local authority must discharge this duty having particular regard to the need to promote the child&#146;s educational achievement; and that the local authority must consult the child and give due consideration to their &#147;wishes and feelings&#148; before taking decisions that affect them, and give due consideration to</p>
<a name="80616-0019.htm_brev0"><a name="08061646000099"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;the child&#146;s religious persuasion, racial origin and cultural and religious background&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o374"><a name="80616-0019.htm_para26"><a name="08061646000013">That is almost entirely analogous in content to the welfare checklist.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o375"><a name="80616-0019.htm_para27"><a name="08061646000014">The hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham also mentioned the proposal to establish a chief social worker. Our approach, set out in the children&#146;s plan, which was published last December and was reinforced in &#147;Building Brighter Futures&#148;, is wide-ranging and systematic in seeking to accelerate change across the whole of the children&#146;s work force. Our ambition for that work force cannot be achieved by central Government or any single partner alone. Furthermore, there is already a work-force infrastructure in place that carries out many of the functions suggested by the report, including the General Social Care Council, the Children&#146;s Workforce Development Council and the Social Care Institute for Excellence. Nevertheless, we look forward to seeing the hon. Gentleman&#146;s proposals.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o376"><a name="80616-0019.htm_para28"><a name="08061646000015">I was surprised that the hon. Gentleman got into the business about adoption targets. I did not realise that he was rowing in that particular river. The only adoption targets, which ended in 2006 and which he will remember had their genesis in the Adoption and Children Act 2002&#151;we both served on the Bill Committee&#151;were on the number already in care and waiting to be placed for adoption, and on speeding up the process. Those targets reflected the Government&#146;s desire to reverse a long-term decline in the number of children already in care who  <br>

 As I have pointed out to the hon. Gentleman on many occasions, there were no financial targets attached to the national adoption targets that we are talking about.

 I am not getting into a personal dialogue with the hon. Gentleman because I need to refer to other hon. Members.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o380"><a name="80616-0020.htm_para1"><a name="08061646000025">If I may, I shall move on to talk about some of the other contributions. My right hon. Friend the Member for North-West Durham (Hilary Armstrong) has great expertise in this area and she showed that this evening. She acknowledged what the Government have done so far and she played a large part in it, particularly in relation to some early intervention projects, which the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham mentioned, although he neglected to mention that many of them were introduced on the Government&#146;s initiative and with Government support centrally.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o381"><a name="80616-0020.htm_para2"><a name="08061646000026">My right hon. Friend also encouraged me to be ambitious about pilots in relation to social pedagogy. I can tell her that we share very strongly her interest in and commitment to social pedagogy, and we will shortly announce the successful tenders for developing social pedagogy pilots in children&#146;s homes in England. More than &#163;1 million is being allocated for those pilots.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o382"><a name="80616-0020.htm_para3"><a name="08061646000027">The hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole (Annette Brooke) made a number of comments in her usual thoughtful way. In particular, she referred to the issue of private fostering. The strengthened notification scheme introduced by the Children Act 2004 has had only two years of operation, so we contend that it has not operated long enough for us to assess it properly. It was also mentioned by the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o383"><a name="80616-0020.htm_para4"><a name="08061646000028">We are not at this stage convinced that a registration scheme would offer safeguards in a way that notification cannot. We believe, as does the British Association for Adoption and Fostering, which works extensively on private fostering arrangements, that we should seek to ensure that the current arrangements are operated effectively and evaluate them more fully before introducing a new registration scheme. I am sure that we will discuss that topic further in Committee.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o384"><a name="80616-0020.htm_para5"><a name="08061646000029">The hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole also raised the issue of variations of rates in care, which I am sure we can also discuss in further detail in Committee. Furthermore, she mentioned the UK Border Agency and the Lords amendment. We have certainly heard the points made by Members of the House and by peers in the other place in relation to that amendment. In the light of that, we will consider our response. I am sure that that is another matter that we shall discuss in Committee.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o385"><a name="80616-0020.htm_para6"><a name="08061646000030">Like other hon. Members, the hon.

Member for Crewe and Nantwich (Mr. Timpson) graced us with his maiden speech, and paid tribute with great eloquence, and I am sure sincerity, to his predecessor. In my ministerial capacity, I received a letter from my late hon. Friend two days after she passed away, which started: &#147;Dear Kevin, Thank you for your response to my recent letter&#148;&#151;I will not mention the subject&#151;&#147;it is totally useless.&#148; That sums her up. The hon. Gentleman also told us with great sincerity about his personal associations with children in care, and spoke effectively and passionately about the recruitment of social workers. I am sure that he will make a great contribution to the House.</p>

Friend the Member for North-East Derbyshire (Natascha Engel) spoke about an issue that is not in the Bill, namely smacking, although she will probably tell me off for calling it that. We changed the law on the matter in 2004, and I must emphasise that in the review from she quoted, the majority of parents did not support a ban on smacking. In the absence of evidence that the law was not working, the Government decided that there was no case to change the law.</p>

Obviously, I cannot comment on the individual circumstances of the case, although I have read those media reports. All I can say is that local authorities, under the law and under the guidance, must find a placement that meets the needs of the child. A child should not be denied the opportunity of a loving family only on the basis of the ethnic background of prospective adopters. The Government&#146;s policy is quite clear: it was set out originally in 1998 in the local authority circular, &#147;Achieving the Right Balance&#148;. It has not changed&#151;the matter was  <br>

It was a great pleasure to be at No. 10 Downing street with her earlier today to launch the action plan for runaway children. With parliamentary colleagues across the House, she has played a huge part in pressing the Government to take action. I congratulate her on that. She spoke movingly of the need to make sure that the transition out of care is properly managed. I spoke to the Fostering Network lobby today on some of the issues raised in her speech, and particularly about the &#147;staying put&#148; pilots, which will enable people in the 10 areas I mentioned today to stay on until at least the age of 21. We will debate in further detail in Committee the reasons why at this stage we need to collect the evidence to get that policy right.</p>

 I am grateful for the opportunity to discuss post office closures with the Minister. I have a strange feeling that this is not the first debate on the subject to which he has responded, either on the Adjournment or in Westminster Hall.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o405"><a name="80616-0020.htm_para26"><a name="08061646000052">Most Members and their constituents, especially in Birmingham, know that few issues arouse the emotions as much as post office closures. I know from my own experience that the implementation of the urban network reinvention programme some years ago was very badly handled. Post office closure programmes have serious implications for our neighbourhoods, not just commercially but socially. When we lose our local post offices it is about far more than services; it is about the local economy, about the viability of our neighbourhoods, and about shopping areas. For example, the Curdale Road post office in Bartley Green in my constituency plays an incredibly important social role.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o406"><a name="80616-0020.htm_para27"><a name="08061646000053">According to recent research undertaken by Help the Aged, 59 per cent. of older people considered local post offices to be essential to their way of life and 61 per cent. of customers in deprived urban areas used their local post offices to access community services, while 36 per cent. went to the post office to meet their friends. Between 2001 and 2005, the proportion of elderly people who used their post offices increased. However, although it is clear that the local post office is part of the community, I accept the need for change. I am not trying to defend the status quo; it is a question of how we can make changes in a sustainable fashion.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o407"><a name="80616-0020.htm_para28"><a name="08061646000054">It is in the nature of the way the House organises its debates that this one is taking place at a rather peculiar time. On 24 June, we in the west midlands will be officially told which of our post offices are to be closed. There will be a six-week consultation period. If I understand the network change programme correctly, it is not a question of the number of branches in a particular geographical region that Post Office Ltd wishes to close, but a question of which branches it intends to close.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o408"><a name="80616-0020.htm_para29"><a name="08061646000055">A Member arguing against the closure of a particular post office might well be asked &#147;If we do not close this one, which one would you like us to close?&#148; I&#151;and, I imagine, other Birmingham Members&#151;would like to present some guidelines on where closures seem to us to be appropriate. There were tremendous flaws in the previous approach to reinvigorating the programme. These flaws had long-term negative impacts in my constituency and others.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o409"><a name="80616-0020.htm_para30"><a name="08061646000056">In 1999, there were 18 post offices in my Edgbaston constituency. Since then, seven of them have closed. I accept that some of the closures were due to the choice of the sub-postmaster, but others were simply decided by the network reinvention programme. Let me offer two local examples. The closure of the post office on Princes corner was due to the fact that no one could be found to take it over. However, the Moor Pool estate example is different. There was a small row of shops, of which the post office and local shop provided the key anchor point. As soon as the post office was closed, the  <br>

local shop became unviable and so did the other shops. To add insult to injury, the Post Office told us that people could always go to Bearwood, which is in the constituency of my right hon. Friend the Member for Warley (Mr. Spellar), but a few months later it closed that. People were then told to go to Harborne high street, where services were not expanded and we had queues going out on to the pavement. In terms of the current process, if we assume that people should go to nearby post offices, I hope that the additional work load and greater flow of consumers created is looked at, so that the remaining post offices can cope with the extra pressure.</p>

 I congratulate my hon. Friend on securing tonight&#146;s debate. May I add to the point she makes about such post offices being able to cope? One of the problems with the access criteria laid down by Post Office Ltd is that they simply measure the distance of customers from post offices, not the density of population or the fact that unsustainable queues in post offices can easily develop. That should certainly be taken into account in densely populated areas such as Birmingham.</p>

<p><a name="st_o338"><a name="08061646000058"><a name="80616-0020.htm_spnew5"><a name="08061646000140"><b>Ms Stuart:</b>
 I am grateful for that point, as it takes me on to another issue of relevance in areas such as my constituency and that of my hon. Friend, which have communities with a disproportionate element of elderly people. While it might look fine on paper to say that 99 per cent. of the population are within 1 mile of a post office, for the elderly and those in residential care homes 1 mile might in fact be quite a long way. Therefore, we need to co-ordinate the programme properly in order to deal with neighbourhoods&#146; specific needs. There are social, as well as economic, implications.</p>

 In my constituency, during the local election campaign the Tory candidate suggested that two post offices would close, which caused extreme anxiety in the community, unnecessarily as it turned out as both post offices are doing well, A postmaster whom I spoke to last week is very angry that a picture of his post office was placed in Opposition literature along with a suggestion that it was under threat, when there was no reason for that.</p>

 My hon. Friend represents a neighbouring constituency, and she is right to say that it is most distressing when something as serious as post office reorganisation, which is necessary, is used as a political football, which it has been in this case.

<notus-date day="16" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>16 Jun 2008 : Column 781</b><br>
role of post offices has changed. As MPs, we know that the way people communicate has changed. People use e-mails and the internet much more, but there is also a wider availability of bank accounts. That is why it is a reality that the post office network has lost some 4 million customers recently, and it is incurring losses of some &#163;3.5 million a week. That is serious money, and as a responsible Government we have to deal with that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o411"><a name="80616-0021.htm_para0"><a name="08061646000064">Even the National Federation of SubPostmasters, as I understand it, accepts that we need to make changes, but they have to be made in a sustainable way. Some people might want to argue that the Government and Post Office Ltd could have been more creative in looking at how new business could be created, be it foreign currency, travel and car insurance, broadband and so on. However, in the light of the re-bidding for the network in 2011, the key thing is how we maintain a network that is sufficiently sustainable for a population such as Birmingham&#146;s and that has the key post offices in place, so that all members of the community who wish to use a post office can do so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o412"><a name="80616-0021.htm_para1"><a name="08061646000065">This Government do not have to be ashamed of their record. Before 1997, post offices were not supported or subsidised at all. Since then, we have invested some &#163;2 billion in the network, and I understand that in the run-up to 2011 there will be another &#163;1.7 billion. This is an annual subsidy of &#163;150 million, so the notion that this is reckless free-marketeering does not stick&#151;we are aware of the social responsibility. However, I am much more concerned that when we come to the re-tendering of the post office card account contract, the structure of the Post Office is such that it is in a state fit to tender for that contract and to supply the best services for our communities. Unless that happens, the 99 per cent. of the population whom we want to be within 1 mile of accessing a post office will not be able to do so. If the Post Office itself does not realise that it has a significant responsibility&#151;if the decisions that it takes in the next few weeks are not responsible ones&#151;it will reorganise itself into oblivion. I do not want that to happen.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o413"><a name="80616-0021.htm_para2"><a name="08061646000066">When the announcement is made on 24 June, after which all our constituents will have a six-week period in which to respond to the proposals, the people concerned should look at the situation responsibly. They should look at whether the remaining post offices are in the right places&#151;where post offices are due for closure, the post boxes and access for people to post their letters should be maintained&#151;and they should look closely at what the alternatives are. I hope that the Post Office accepts that when it suggests that people go to nearby post offices, it needs to look at the capacity and in some cases actually increase it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o414"><a name="80616-0021.htm_para3"><a name="08061646000067">It is in all our interests that a network that has a commercial but also a social benefit is sustainable, that we can maintain it and that it is economically viable, and that the Post Office learns from the mistakes that it made in the first round of the review.

 I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Edgbaston (Ms Stuart) on securing this debate. She is a very strong and effective campaigner for her constituents; indeed, her constituency is not too far from my own, so I know that she works very hard for the people of Birmingham, Edgbaston. I also thank my hon. Friends the Members for Birmingham, Northfield (Richard Burden) and for Birmingham, Selly Oak (Lynne Jones) for their interventions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o415"><a name="80616-0021.htm_para4"><a name="08061646000069">My hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Edgbaston is right to say that this is by no means the first time that the House has debated this issue. I understand that it is of concern to hon. Members in all parts of the House and that it is a difficult issue. This debate is slightly unusual in that normally when hon. Members discuss the issue, they wish to highlight one or two post offices in a particular area plan, but, as she said, the area plan for Birmingham, Coventry and Warwickshire has not yet been published, so we cannot talk about particular post offices in that area. I understand that the plan will be published on 24 June.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o416"><a name="80616-0021.htm_para5"><a name="08061646000070">As a Minister, I do not have a role to play in selecting which post office may stay open or which post office will close as a result of the programme. That is rightly a matter for Post Office Ltd, and the process involves Postwatch, which is the consumer voice in all this, as well as MPs and other local representatives. I may say some more about the role of MPs in a moment or two.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o417"><a name="80616-0021.htm_para6"><a name="08061646000071">This difficult process is driven by three big changes taking place in society, the first of which is a change in lifestyle. I accept what my hon. Friend said about the post offices in her constituency often being used, particularly by elderly people, but I am also aware that post offices are not used by most pensioners to pick up their pension, for example. Eight out of 10 pensioners have their pension paid directly into a bank account&#151;among new retirees the figure is nine out of 10, and it is likely to grow. A lifestyle change in how we receive money and how we do things is part of this process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o418"><a name="80616-0021.htm_para7"><a name="08061646000072">Technology changes are also taking place. A service such as car tax online did not even exist a few years ago&#151;it was not even available. At the beginning of last year, that service was used by about 500,000 people a month and it is now used by about 1 million people a month. Its use has grown that much in just a year, and it means 1 million people a month no longer go to the post office to renew their car tax.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o419"><a name="80616-0021.htm_para8"><a name="08061646000073">The third change is competition. Other networks now bid for work that was traditionally done by the Post Office. For example, the BBC, not the Government, made a decision, as it is free to do, to give the TV licence contract to an alternative network. Hon. Members may have their views about that decision, and I am not criticising it. I am saying that it illustrates the fact that other networks are competing for business traditionally done by the Post Office.</p>

 But what role do the Government have in deciding the future of the Post Office card account, which pays out &#163;27 billion a year?

That decision is in the hands of the Government.</p>

 I understand that the Post Office card account is very important to our post offices. I recently spoke at the annual conference of the National Federation of SubPostmasters, where that point was made very strongly. I hope that my hon. Friend will understand if I do not say too much about that matter tonight, because, legally speaking, the process has to be done by competitive tender and it is out to competitive tender at the moment. The Government are committed to a successor product to the Post Office card account, and the decision on that will be made later this year by my colleagues at the Department for Work and Pensions. I certainly understand its importance; but given that the process must be done properly by competitive tender, I hope that the House will understand why I do not say too much about who should win.

The &#163;1.7 billion to which I have referred a couple of times is not just the annual subsidy for running thousands of post offices that would otherwise be under threat, but includes some funding to deal with the queuing issues that have been raised and to ensure that the migration, as they call it, of business from one office to neighbouring offices can be handled. I understand that it is not merely a numbers game about the number of offices&#151;it is also about the quality of service and that is important.</p>

 When my hon. Friend says that, will he take into account the experience of a number of sub-postmasters? Although funding is theoretically available, accessing it is sometimes quite difficult for small sub-postmasters who operate on fairly narrow margins.  <br>

That might be an area where we might need to have further discussions with Post Office Ltd.</p>

 My hon. Friend makes a good point, but I hope that he recognises that up to &#163;1.7 billion is a significant level of support. As my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Edgbaston said, it is more support than was given by the previous Government, who provided no subsidy at all. I understand that the process is difficult, and that hon. Members will rightly want to make representations about it. I see no contradiction between accepting the overall need for change and making representations about particular post offices.</p>

 I am afraid that I do not think that I have time to give way again.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o431"><a name="80616-0021.htm_para20"><a name="08061646000095">In future, the Government will continue to play our role by providing the subsidy that I have set out. However, the Post Office must play its role by continuing to innovate in new business areas such as foreign currency, insurance and broadband. There is no future in turning the clock back, but there is a future for a healthy, thriving post office network.</p>
