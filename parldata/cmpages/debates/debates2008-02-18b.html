That is where the big problem lies. My hon.

In so far as they have any reservations about their status, which they raised when I visited, we have been able to resolve them by telling the staff that they will remain Crown employees.

 I can certainly supply my right hon. Friend with that information. He is right that there are unacceptable waits in some cases&#151;after all, 38 per cent. of non-resident parents are failing to pay part or all of their maintenance assessment. That is clearly not acceptable, but we are dealing with people who will sometimes go to the most extraordinary lengths to avoid facing up to their clear responsibility, and the agency cannot always do all that it would like in going after them. However, in addition to the improvements to which I have referred, the agency is now taking a record level of enforcement action to go after the non-resident parents who will not pay, with record numbers of charging orders, suspended committal sentences, removals of driving licences and deduction from earnings orders, as well as doing more than ever before to collect arrears.</p>

 We have made considerable progress in tackling poverty.

We cannot measure the life chances of a child who is 10 years old, which is the oldest that they could be if they had spent the whole of their life growing up under this Government. Those figures clearly measure life chances over the past two or three decades. We inherited a significant problem of child poverty; we have cut it by 600,000, and we have measures in place to cut it by another 300,000. The proportion of children in workless households has fallen by 400,000 under this Government. It was rising under the Tories, which damaged children&#146;s life chances, but it is now falling under us. Over the next 20 years, as we are able to judge those children&#146;s life chances, I believe that we will see a significant improvement.</p>

There may well be a certain amount of fraud in those figures, and the sample size is too small anyhow. The figures that are internationally recognised, which relate to those on less than 60 per cent. of median earnings, have shown a fall of 600,000 since 1997, and we have measures in place for another 300,000 to be taken out of poverty.

 I would hesitate, if I were a Conservative, to complain about pensions, given that under the Conservative Government the poorest pensioners were forced to exist on only &#163;69 a week&#151;barely enough, one would have thought, to pay for a bottle at the Bullingdon club. We have done an awful lot to help pensioners, and the number of pensioners living in relative poverty has fallen by more than 1 million since 1997. Just before Christmas, I announced some new proposals to help large numbers of pensioners who are not claiming pension credit or, indeed, the help that they need with council tax at the moment.

Friend the Prime Minister, in May 1997, more than 85,000 18 to 24-year-olds had been claiming jobseeker&#146;s allowance for more than 12 months. That fell last month and it is now fewer than 7,000. My right hon. Friend was absolutely right.</p>

 May I pick the Minister up on his point about the duration of employment of young people? Does he agree that it is scandalous that the proportion of people who have been through the Government&#146;s new deal for young people and still have a job within one year of leaving is less than one half of those people who get a job in the first place? In other words, one out of two lose their job within the first year. Does he agree that that figure urgently needs to be improved?</p>

 I can tell the hon. Gentleman that 750,000 young people have gone into work through the new deal; much of that has been sustained work. That is the reason for the dramatic improvement in unemployment across the economy. He may well have seen the employment figures published last week, which show that more people in the UK are in work than ever before&#151;almost 29.4 million&#151;and that for the first time since June 1975 the number of people claiming unemployment benefits has fallen below 800,000. That is dramatic progress. The new deal for young people is an important part of the explanation for that. Of course we need to go further, and we will do, but employment opportunities today are unprecedented for young people and others. We are determined to make the most of them.</p>

We have said that through Jobcentre Plus and its partners we will ensure that people have the skills and abilities to secure the jobs that are available, the other side of the deal being that employers will give disadvantaged unemployed people a fair crack at those jobs.

 Certainly not. Let me repeat what I told the hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare (John Penrose). The proportion of young people not in education, employment or training is down, not up, and many fewer young people are unemployed for long periods. I also refer the hon. Lady to the employment figures published last week. They showed a rise in the employment rate and a fall in the unemployment rate, a fall in the claimant count in every English region&#151;and in Wales and Scotland&#151;a rise in the number of vacancies, and the fewest redundancies across the economy in the last quarter of last year since records began in 1995.

 I join others in welcoming the Minister to his new post. May I gently suggest that he avoid some of the woes that his predecessors have experienced in trying to suggest that the huge increase in the number of foreign workers is some sort of answer to the deep-seated problem of youth unemployment? Should he not face the fact that the new deal has too often acted as a revolving door taking young people from one period on benefits to another, which is reflected in the statistic that youth unemployment is 13 per cent. higher than it was when the Government took office? Is there not also a connection between that and the 400,000 increase in the number of young people living in poverty since 1997, which means that nearly a third of them are in that position? Is it not time that the Government faced up to those problems, and we saw some fresh thinking?</p>

 I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his welcome, but he needs to look at the figures a little more closely. It is a shame that Opposition Members were not worrying about this group of young people when the Government they supported were doubling the rate of child poverty between 1979 and 1997. He appears in the figures he has cited to have included full-time students, who are certainly in no sense part of a lost generation; they are being prepared for the opportunities ahead. Unemployment is down, the claimant count is down, and the number of young people claiming jobseeker&#146;s allowance for more than 12 months has fallen from 85,000 in May 1997 to fewer than 7,000 today.

Where there is a question whether people are better off in work, Jobcentre Plus advisers can make a calculation to show the financial gains of work, and the better off in work credit will help further.

 With permission, Mr. Speaker, I would like to make a statement on Northern Rock.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o9"><a name="80218-0004.htm_para0"><a name="0802183000155">I hope that the House will understand that it was necessary for me to issue a statement yesterday, ahead of the markets opening, so that trading in Northern Rock shares could be suspended this morning. It was also essential to allow the management of Northern Rock time to tell its employees what was happening so that the bank could open as normal this morning.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o10"><a name="80218-0004.htm_para1"><a name="0802183000156">As I said yesterday, the Government have decided to introduce legislation to take Northern Rock into a period of temporary public ownership. I took this decision after full consultation with the Bank of England and the Financial Services Authority. The draft Bill has been available in the Vote Office and the House of Lords since this morning to provide as much time as possible for right hon. and hon. Members, as well as the other place, to examine its provisions. If the House agrees, the Bill will begin its parliamentary passage tomorrow. I have also arranged for the principal Opposition spokesmen to be briefed by Treasury officials today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o11"><a name="80218-0004.htm_para2"><a name="0802183000157">It is important for savers and depositors to be reassured that their money remains safe and secure. Northern Rock will continue to operate as a bank on a commercial basis, and it is open for business as usual today. The Government guarantee arrangements that I announced last year remain in place and will continue to do so. Borrowers will continue to make their payments in the normal way.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o12"><a name="80218-0004.htm_para3"><a name="0802183000158">I have appointed Ron Sandler as the executive chair. He is in Newcastle today and has had meetings with the company and its employees. The new board and the bank will operate at arm&#146;s length from the Government with commercial autonomy for their decisions. I will publish shortly the framework agreement that will outline how the relationship between the Government and the Northern Rock board will work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o13"><a name="80218-0004.htm_para4"><a name="0802183000159">As I said yesterday, the board&#146;s proposals will also cover the Northern Rock Foundation, which is very important to the north-east. The board will commit to guaranteeing a minimum income of &#163;15 million per year in 2008, 2009 and 2010. That will be paid directly by Northern Rock, as now, and would be a condition of any sale, if it were sold in that time. The new board will be asked to identify a long-term future for the foundation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o14"><a name="80218-0004.htm_para5"><a name="0802183000160">I want to set out the reasons for the decisions that I made and to outline what the new legislation will do. Before that, let me remind the House that last September there was almost universal agreement that the Government were right to intervene to save this bank to stop its problems spreading to the wider banking system. There was also agreement that, ultimately, the long-term future of the bank must lie in the private sector. Even those who advocated nationalisation in the autumn did so on the basis that it could be only a temporary step&#151;a stepping stone&#151;to return the bank to the private sector when market conditions made that possible.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o15"><a name="80218-0004.htm_para6"><a name="0802183000161">Throughout last autumn, and from the start of this year, the Government wanted to test all the options  <br>

and to give the shareholders and the management time to find a solution that was acceptable and that met the three principles that I set out last year: to support financial stability; to protect depositors&#146; money; and to protect the interests of the taxpayer. I said throughout that all options, including a period of temporary public ownership, remained on the table.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o16"><a name="80218-0004.htm_para7"><a name="0802183000162">As the House will know, the Government had two private sector bids to consider. Each was tested against the option of a temporary period of public ownership to see which met our objectives and principles, including best value for the taxpayer. Both proposals involved a degree of risk for taxpayers and a very significant implicit subsidy from the Treasury, involving a payment below market rate to the Government for continuation of our guarantee arrangements and for the financing that we would put in place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o17"><a name="80218-0004.htm_para8"><a name="0802183000163">Each proposal had its pros and cons. The Virgin proposal, for instance, would have brought in a new brand and management. However, the taxpayer would have received a share of the private sector return only if the business&#146;s value to its investors reached at least &#163;2.7 billion. The board&#146;s proposal would have involved a similar level of subsidy, but it had other disadvantages compared with Virgin&#146;s. It would have brought in less new capital, and the business would have depended longer on Government guarantees for new retail deposits. A subsidy on the scale required would not have provided best value for the taxpayer. The private sector rather than the taxpayer would have secured the vast majority of the value created, and that would have been a poor reflection of the balance of risk borne by the two sides. By contrast, under public ownership, the taxpayer will secure the entire benefit and proceeds from the sale of the business in return for bearing the risks during this period of market uncertainty. That is why we made the decision that we did. We made the decision to protect taxpayers having weighed up the various competing considerations. In deciding which was the best option for the taxpayer, it was clear that a temporary period of public ownership was the better option.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o18"><a name="80218-0004.htm_para9"><a name="0802183000164">I will go through the contents of the Bill in more detail on Second Reading tomorrow. We have deliberately drafted it to ensure that a bank can be acquired only in certain tightly defined circumstances, and the power to do so will last for only 12 months. I have already announced a consultation that will lead to permanent legislation to deal with such situations in future. The Bill potentially applies to a range of financial institutions, but I want to make it clear that the Government have no intention at present to use it to bring any institution other than Northern Rock into temporary public ownership.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o19"><a name="80218-0004.htm_para10"><a name="0802183000165">The Bill also provides for appropriate compensation to shareholders. As I explained on 21 January, those provisions are on the basis that all financial assistance provided by the Bank or the Treasury, including guarantee arrangements for depositors, had been withdrawn and that no further financial assistance, apart from ordinary market assistance from the Bank, would be provided to the deposit taker. I believe that that is fair both to shareholders and to the taxpayer. The Bill makes provision for transfer of the bank or parts of it to the private sector.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o20"><a name="80218-0004.htm_para11"><a name="0802183000166">I remind the House that following the problems that started in the United States last summer, Northern  <br>

Rock was unable to raise the billions of pounds that it needed to stay in business. We were right to save the bank and to do everything we possibly could to find a private sector buyer on terms acceptable to the taxpayer. Because of current market conditions, we are now right to take over the bank on a temporary basis, because that is what is in the best interest of the taxpayer. There were choices to be made. We could have let the bank go under, but the risks to the wider financial system, for savers and for the general public were not acceptable. Having made the decision to save the bank, maintain financial stability and protect savers, we are now taking this decision to protect the taxpayer. I commend this statement to the House.</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o24"><a name="80218-0004.htm_para15"><a name="0802183000171">That was the phrase that he himself used last month in the House when he argued against nationalisation. Nationalisation means that the taxpayer&#146;s risk has doubled to &#163;110 billion, or &#163;3,500 for every family in Britain. Every family in Britain will now own the high street bank that wrote more mortgages at the top of the housing market than any other. Every time a home owner fails to meet a mortgage payment, every family in the country will bear the cost. That is what this nationalisation means.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o25"><a name="80218-0004.htm_para16"><a name="08051438000001">Can the Chancellor tell us about the state of the &#163;100 billion mortgage book that he wants the taxpayer to own? How many bad loans are there? The credit rating agencies now say that the losses are rising at Northern Rock. Is that true? Before we debate the Bill tomorrow, we are entitled to a full statement of the financial position of the company that we are being asked to buy. We are entitled to see the advice from Goldman Sachs that we have all paid for.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o26"><a name="80218-0004.htm_para17"><a name="0802183000172">Secondly, will the Chancellor agree that it is totally unacceptable for Northern Rock to continue with business as usual? This is now a Government bank; it can borrow and lend more cheaply than any of its high street competitors. Indeed, today it is still offering some of the best savings deals out there&#151;it is still offering the 125 per cent. mortgages that it wrote last year. That is politically and economically unacceptable. Nationalisation can never mean business as usual. The Chancellor said in his statement that the management would be at &#147;arm&#146;s length&#148;. Why is there nothing in the Bill to prevent political interference?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o27"><a name="80218-0004.htm_para18"><a name="0802183000173">Thirdly, will the Chancellor confirm that he is actually introducing unprecedented, sweeping, draconian powers that will let him nationalise any other bank or deposit-taking institution in Britain by ministerial fiat? <i> [Interruption.]</i> The Lord Chancellor should pay attention; he keeps talking about strengthening the powers of Parliament, but he is about to give the Chancellor of the Exchequer the power to nationalise any bank in Britain without coming to Parliament&#151;not even Michael Foot dreamed of that. It will create further uncertainty in financial markets and do further damage to Britain&#146;s reputation. If the Chancellor is giving himself those sweeping powers only to get round parliamentary procedures for hybrid Bills, he should give himself them for a week or a month, not for a whole year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o28"><a name="80218-0004.htm_para19"><a name="0802183000174">The Chancellor had opportunities to avoid the disaster of nationalisation last autumn, and he missed them. He has the opportunity now to avoid the disaster of nationalisation by opting instead for a reconstruction led by the Bank of England, and he will not take it. It would mean &#163;55 billion less exposure for the taxpayer, and none of this farce of business as usual; it would be like the approach that the Chancellor himself recommends for future bank rescues. But instead, the Prime Minister and his Chancellor have dithered their way to disaster. Now what they call the &#147;temporary nationalisation&#148; could, in the words of Ron Sandler, &#147;last years&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o29"><a name="80218-0004.htm_para20"><a name="0802183000175">In uncertain economic times, the British people have a right to expect decisive and strong leadership from their Government. Instead, this Chancellor has given us weakness and indecision, with humiliating reversals over capital gains tax, then non-domiciles and now Northern Rock. He has taken Britain back to the 1970s and the failed policies of Labour&#146;s past. We can safely say that he will never recover his reputation for competence. He is now politically a dead man walking and if the Prime Minister could make a decision, he would move him. What matters to the rest of us is that the British economy and its reputation abroad recovers from the Chancellor&#146;s disastrous time at the Treasury. Nationalising a high street bank is not the way to begin, and we will oppose it tomorrow.</p>

Last September, he and the Leader of the Opposition said that they wholeheartedly supported what we had done and that they recognised we were right to take the action that we did to stop the problem spreading into the wider financial system.

They were in favour of administration, despite the fact that that could have provoked a fire sale with a huge loss to the taxpayer. They said they were against nationalisation, yet two days later the Leader of the Opposition said yes, he would have to consider all the options, including nationalisation.

Given the arm&#146;s length management that will operate under Ron Sandler, no doubt the Committee will want to receive regular updates from him and his colleagues to ensure for ourselves that accountability is the key here.

He seems to imply that it would be better for the bank to go bust rather than to allow it to trade and get through the difficulties that it faces. We will be in some difficulty if we go down the road of holding the management team to account for every single thing that they do. I am sure that the Select Committee will want to know about the business plan and want to discuss these things, but it is important that the management team gets to operate at arm&#146;s length from the Government and gets on with running the company, because that is the best way of ensuring that it can be restructured and refocused and can then be returned to the private sector when it is appropriate and right to do so.</p>

tempted to say, &#147;I could have told you so&#148;, but this is too important for that. I will content myself simply with making this comment: when the Chancellor receives a large multi-million-pound invoice from Goldman Sachs for its financial advice, could he perhaps return it politely with a little note saying that he received rather higher quality advice free of charge from me and the Liberal Democrats?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o34"><a name="80218-0004.htm_para25"><a name="0802183000184">The Conservative spokesman talked about the dark satanic socialism of the 1970s, but will the Chancellor confirm that the last time a private bank was nationalised in Britain was in 1994, when the last Conservative Government acquired National Mortgage bank, paying its owners a total of &#163;1? And was not the last major bank nationalisation in the western world undertaken by that loony left-wing Trotskyite President Ronald Reagan, when he acquired Continental Illinois bank, which was subsequently returned at a profit to the American taxpayer by the Clinton Administration?</p>

Until today, the Conservatives had no alternative. I think that they are now suggesting public administration under a publicly owned Bank of England. What is that but nationalisation in all but name? The hon. Member for Tatton (Mr. Osborne) is so determined to keep one foot on either side of the fence dividing the public and private sector that he is in imminent danger of being castrated by the serrated edge.</p>

What sort of undertakings did he give to Sir Richard Branson and others to pay their fees for private bids? When will he commission a fully independent audit through the Bank of England to establish the quality of the assets&#151;the loan book for which this enormous sum of public money has been advanced? When will there be democratic scrutiny of the new business model, which could involve contraction or expansion of the bank? I hope that the changes will put an end to the extreme loans to which the hon. Member for Tatton rightly referred, which lent more than the value of property.</p>

 I agree with a lot of what the hon. Gentleman says.

He will remember what happened in the 1970s because I seem to recall that he was in the Labour party then. He is also absolutely right in his description of the Conservatives&#146; policy. Their policy is nationalisation. It involves nationalisation, but the hon. Member for Tatton (Mr. Osborne) has the gall to say that he is going to oppose the Bill that will bring that about. The only way he could deliver his policy&#151;in as much as it is understandable and that it will last for the next day or so&#151;would be to nationalise, so it seems extremely odd that he intends to oppose the legislation tomorrow.</p>

On the business model, as I said earlier, Ron Sandler and his team will introduce a model after they have had a chance to consider the options available to them. That will have to be endorsed by the Government, because it has to be cleared by the Commission under the normal state aid rules. Once we have taken that action, assuming that Parliament agrees to it in the next day or so, I believe that there is a good chance that we can help Northern Rock to get through this period, and that seems infinitely better than the Tory options of either bankrupting it or finding some other pretty ill-defined destination for it, which make no sense to me whatsoever.</p>

 Listening to media reports this morning, it seemed as though the Conservative party was dead set on destroying the great northern institution of Northern Rock, and was prepared to see its assassination in its bitter opposition to nationalisation. However, it now seems that we are hearing different things for different audiences. I can tell my right hon. Friend that people in the north-east, and particularly the bank&#146;s staff, will welcome the announcement of the establishment of a framework agreement. He will understand the considerable anxiety among the population at large in the north-east, particularly those staff. May I press him to undertake early publication of a business plan so that stability is brought to the business at the earliest possible date?</p>

 I am grateful to my hon. Friend, who rightly sets out his concern for the future of Northern Rock and for the people who work there. I hope that the business plan can be produced as quickly as possible, but I want to give the management team time to work out a plan that actually stands up. It is better to take time to get these things right, rather than rush into something, which is what the Tories have been suggesting over the past few weeks. It is time to get a properly worked up business plan. I am grateful to my hon. Friend for his comments about the Northern Rock Foundation, which supports many organisations in the north-east. That is an important step.</p>

 The Chancellor will recall that I supported his guaranteeing deposits last autumn, although he did it three or four days too late. However, it seemed to me and most other people that the only case for nationalisation was through an orderly run-down of the bank, with the sale of the loan book, as and when the markets permitted, to get decent value for the taxpayer. If it is genuinely business as usual and if the bank is to remain open and take deposits, why should not every sane saver in this country rush to take their savings out of other banks and saving institutions to put them into the only institution that offers competitive rates of interest, fully backed up by  <br>

 I knew who the right hon. and learned Gentleman was, even if he was taken aback. He appears to support precisely what I propose: that we give the bank time to reorganise and refocus. However, I do not agree with his proposition that the bank should simply be run down. The management team needs the opportunity to restructure and refocus the bank because the market conditions have changed. On its operation in the marketplace, the state aid rules exist to ensure that it cannot abuse its position, but it is in the general interest of stability and of taxpayers to have an opportunity to work things through. If we followed the course of action that the Conservative party advocates, the taxpayer would lose substantial amounts.</p>

 Is my right hon. Friend&#146;s intention with nationalisation to grow on a successful business in the public sector or is it simply the beginning of a slow, lingering death for the business?

 Let me put it this way: we had a choice of accepting one of the two bids on the table from the Virgin consortium and from the board. However, when we examined those two bids and judged them against the option of public ownership for a temporary period, they did not stack up in value for money terms. It would have been wrong of me to make a proposal that involved significant subsidy and that, as the figures clearly showed, was not the best option. We must at all times look after three things: the financial stability of the system, security for depositors and savers, and value for taxpayers. That is why I reached the decision at the weekend that I have announced today.</p>

I cannot give my hon. Friend the answer today because, as I said, the management needs time to do that. However, the alternative of accepting a bid that was not good value would have been wrong, and the suggestion from the Conservative party simply to bankrupt the bank would have been a profound mistake.</p>

 The Chancellor is perfectly right to refer to the sub-prime mortgage crisis in the United States and the ongoing difficulties in the financial markets. Against that background over the past five months, has he not ensured financial stability, prevented contagion, defended the interests not only of the taxpayer but of Northern Rock&#146;s depositors and savers, and provided guarantees that have not been called upon? Given that fact, will he ensure that temporary ownership is also prudent ownership and does not fall within the time scales of our 24-hour news media?</p>

 As I have told the House, if we had not intervened to save the bank last September and if it had gone down, there would have been a substantial risk of the problems that it had faced and the difficulties caused by its collapse affecting the rest of the banking system. We therefore intervened and we were right to do so, and as I have said, at that time we were supported in all parts of the House. I fully accept that the Conservative party moved from that position subsequently. In relation to the savers and depositors, we were right, too, to issue those guarantees, because we wanted to ensure that they would not lose their money. We have been successful in that, too. The third element is to ensure that we do the right thing by the taxpayers of this country. That is why I have made the proposals that I have made today&#151;precisely to ensure that the taxpayer&#146;s interests are protected.</p>

 It is not just the people&#146;s bank that people are concerned about; it is the people&#146;s debt.

Will that amount now also include subordinated debt, which also runs to some billions? He said that the FSA regulates Northern Rock, but is he content with that? The FSA is required to produce a risk analysis of building societies every six months, but where was it? Did it tell the Treasury of its concerns about the massive over-reliance on the wholesale market?

 As has been well documented, the FSA accepts that it should have taken action last year when it became aware that there were problems in relation to the bank. However, I remind the House that, as the Treasury Committee found, the primary responsibility for running Northern Rock lay with the directors. They got themselves into a position from which they could carry on trading only by securing access to billions of pounds of funds from the financial markets. When that became difficult and then impossible in September, they had no alternative but to go to the Bank of England. The primary responsibility for Northern Rock, as for any other bank, must therefore lie with its directors.</p>

provisions. The tests that have to be passed before a bank can be nationalised are quite high. There will have to be a substantial, serious threat to financial stability, or funding must have been given that has been underwritten by the Treasury, as with Northern Rock. The test that will be applied to any financial institution that is getting into difficulty is simply this: does it present a systemic risk to the system as a whole? If it does, there will be a case for Bank of England intervention; if it does not, that will not be the case.

However, if we take the opposite view of removing the guarantees and stopping it trading or offering products&#151;I am not sure that the hon. Member for Ryedale (Mr. Greenway) was advocating that&#151;we might as well put Northern Rock into administration, which would result in a significant loss to taxpayers. I cannot believe that that is his position.</p>

 My hon. Friend is right. Along with other hon. Members who represent north-eastern constituents, he rightly expresses concern about the bank and its employees. I very much hope that in the next few weeks, Ron Sandler and his team will continue to have the discussions that they started today with management and employees to see what can be done in restructuring the business to ensure that it has a future.

 As I said in reply to the hon. Member for Ryedale (Mr. Greenway), it would be a profound mistake to remove the guarantees that we have put in place. Those guarantees ensure the stability of the bank. They also protect individual savers. Removing them is not the right thing to do. I fully understand the concern that the bank should be allowed to continue to trade, but that it should not do so unfairly. The whole point of state aid rules is to ensure that that does not happen. That is certainly our intention, as much as, I am sure, it will be the intention of the Commission.</p>

 First, may I say to the Chancellor that he has been wise to take his time before arriving at this momentous decision? That is absolutely right. People will see it as a common-sense response to a difficult position. However, does he recall, in the days before demutualisation, that the bank was a sound building society, operating a good business model with significant reserves that were squandered on a pay-out at demutualisation? Does he accept that rather than rushing into another decision, which the Conservatives would like, to return it immediately to the market, further consideration should be given to the company&#146;s mutualisation so that we return to the sanity of the days when building societies gave proper mortgages to people who required them for good purposes?</p>

We gave them that time. We had two bids.

 I do not think anyone would maintain that the foundation&#146;s prospects have been affected by the difficulties in Northern Rock, which funded all its activities. On any view, the amount that Northern Rock was able to pay into it was going to decrease. We all recognise that it supports a great many activities in the north-east; I wanted to ensure that it had a considerable income, and although the &#163;15 million is less than it was receiving, it is a substantial annual contribution. I did what I could to deal with that particular problem. As for the hon. Gentleman&#146;s other question about the foundation, the legislation will make the necessary provision.</p>

Should he vote for the Conservatives, who would have let the bank sink with all the consequences for shareholders and employees alike?

 Probably, the correct answer is the last one. Naturally we are all concerned about all those who experience a fall in the value of shares they have bought, but there is no getting away from the basic problem: these were shares in a bank whose business model was entirely dependent on the ability to raise large sums of money. Last summer, when the problem began in the international financial markets, the company had no fallback position, and it would have gone bust at that time if we had not intervened. That, I am afraid, is the stark reality, as I know my hon. Friend recognises. Today we are trying to ensure that we do the right thing by the taxpayers, while also helping the company to restructure and refocus its activities.</p>

 In his hat trick of humiliating statements, the Chancellor has told us that he is accepting the proposal in order to protect taxpayers. If that is the case, what independent assessment has the Treasury undertaken of the quality of the loan book? A year ago Northern Rock was writing mortgage business at two and a half times its market share, at a time of unprecedented house price inflation. It is highly likely that a large proportion of those mortgages will turn sour. Is the Chancellor relying entirely on the FSA&#146;s assurances that the bank is solvent, or has he bothered to do a bit of independent checking himself?</p>

I am aware that a second day of debate may be provided for there, but it is important that if there are amendments, we have the time to examine them and deal with them properly.

 Why does the Leader of the House not take the House properly into account? Why not let us have the Second Reading of the Bill tomorrow and the remaining stages the day after? We cannot table amendments until after Second Reading. It is important that the Bill is properly considered&#151;I speak as one who is not fundamentally opposed to it&#151;and therefore all that the Leader of the House has to do is have a slightly more radical reshaping of the next few parliamentary days, perhaps into the beginning of next week. We could have the Second Reading tomorrow, with a vote at 10 o&#146;clock, and the remaining stages the day after. I commend that proposition to the Leader of the House.</p>

 The House will understand that the Bill needs to be considered in this House and in the House of Lords. We have to be sure that we do not prolong any uncertainty and that we come to a swift conclusion. Of course, I have taken into account how the Bill should be dealt with in the House. We want proper scrutiny as well as an outcome that takes place as expeditiously as possible. However, the hon. Gentleman will know that it is not unprecedented in such situations for a Bill to be dealt with in this way. I have a list of Bills&#151;it is far to long for me to read out to the House&#151;that the House was asked to consider in one day because of the circumstances that arose. The hon. Gentleman will be aware that that is the case. The way in which we are proceeding is necessary and it is not unprecedented.</p>

 The Leader of the House has made it quite clear that she will allow debate only tomorrow and she has refused to answer the question of whether the debate will go beyond 10 o&#146;clock. Her manner, supported by the Chief Whip&#146;s body language, makes it quite clear that debate will not be allowed to go beyond 10 o&#146;clock&#151;only, as far as I can see, because the Chief Whip wants to allow the Labour party to go home at 10 o&#146;clock tomorrow evening.</p>

 The right hon. and learned Gentleman has been in this House long enough to know that on occasions the Government can ask the House to act decisively when action is needed in respect of a certain situation once we decide that we want to ensure that the uncertainty is as short as possible and that we will bring in a Bill that will give the Government powers to act. He will know that tomorrow will involve the Bill&#146;s Second Reading and its consideration in Committee. We will discuss the powers that will be taken by the Government.

 On a point of order, Madam Deputy Speaker. May I seek your guidance on a point of clarification about the exchange that just took place on the tabling of amendments to the Bill? The Leader of the House did not answer the question about when it would be possible to table amendments to the Bill. Normally, amendments can be tabled only after Second Reading has been completed. Tomorrow, we will consider a business motion and then Second Reading. At what time will it be possible for hon. Members to table amendments to the Bill for consideration in Committee?</p>

Would it therefore be possible, from your point of view as Chair, to allow the House to be suspended for half an hour or however long it takes&#151;as has happened on many occasions in the past&#151;while we get our acts together and know what we are about to do to this important Bill?</p>

&#147;public authority&#148;, which has become somewhat restricted, far more so than originally intended, and is consequently an extremely important issue. My Committee has published two reports in recent years on the meaning of the term &#147;public authority&#148; in section 6 of the Human Rights Act. That section requires public authorities to act in a way that is compatible with the convention rights set out in the schedule to the Act. The definition of the term &#147;public authority&#148; includes</p>
<a name="80218-0007.htm_brev2"><a name="0802183000405"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;any person certain of whose functions are functions of a public nature.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o80"><a name="80218-0007.htm_para19"><a name="0802183000309">What constitutes a function of a public nature is not further defined in the Human Rights Act. When the issue was discussed during the passage through Parliament of the then Human Rights Bill, it was clearly understood that that provision was intended to cover private sector providers of publicly funded services&#151;public services that had been contracted out to the private sector or wholly privatised, for example.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o81"><a name="80218-0007.htm_para20"><a name="0802183000310">A series of court cases, starting with the so-called Leonard Cheshire case and culminating in the judgment by the Law Lords in the YL case in June 2007, has narrowed the scope of the Human Rights Act as originally intended, particularly in relation to care homes. The YL case concerned the eviction from a private sector care home of an elderly and frail old lady whose care was paid for by Birmingham city council. By a majority of three to two, the Law Lords ruled that the person concerned could not bring an action against the care home under the Human Rights Act, over the infringement of her rights under article 8 of the convention&#151;the right to respect for her private life and home. They said that her claim lay solely against the local authority that had funded her care. The 1998 Act therefore does not apply to private bodies, and the Law Lords found that that included private care homes, even for publicly funded residents.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o82"><a name="80218-0007.htm_para21"><a name="0802183000311">In our March 2007 report on this subject, we concluded that there was a strong case for a separate interpretative Act that would clarify the meaning of the phrase &#147;functions of a public nature&#148; in the Human Rights Act. The outcome of the YL judgment has served only to reinforce our concerns and emphasise the need for the Government to act urgently, to reinstate the originally intended scope of the Human Rights Act. That is especially the case given that the Government&#146;s strategy of seeking a positive judgment in a higher court has manifestly failed to deliver the desired outcome.</p>

During its Second Reading debate in June 2007, the then Minister, who is now the Solicitor-General, said that the Government were &#147;committed to taking action&#148; that year.

they have not moved quickly to clarify the scope of the Human Rights Act. Instead, they propose to bring forward a consultation on the issue as part of the Green Paper on a possible British Bill of Rights and responsibilities. We have been told that the Green Paper will be published in the first half of this year, so it seems pretty clear that concrete proposals will not emerge from the consultation exercise before the next general election&#151;no matter when that happens to be.</p>

 I want to reinforce my hon. Friend&#146;s point, with which I totally agree. It is almost 10 years to the day since the then Home Secretary, my right hon. Friend the Member for Blackburn (Mr. Straw), said that &#147;public authorities&#148; should extend to private providers fulfilling public functions. Some 10 years on from that commitment, it is time for us to act accordingly.</p>

 I think that everyone believed that that was the case until Leonard Cheshire put a question mark over it and the YL case put a lid on it. It is only since last June that we have become significantly aware of how serious the problem is and how urgent it is that we resolve it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o85"><a name="80218-0008.htm_para1"><a name="0802183000316">My Committee&#146;s preference remains for the scope of the Human Rights Act to be clarified by means of a separate Act dealing solely with the wider issue of the meaning of &#147;public authority&#148;. That would have the benefit of dealing with the problem of scope across the board, rather than on a piecemeal basis. It would help other vulnerable groups that are deprived of protection by the ruling, the implications of which are very broad. Such people would include tenants of housing associations and social housing, and children under special educational needs statements whose needs are met in independent schools. It would also ensure that the law in this area was consistent throughout the United Kingdom. I have brought forward my private Member&#146;s Bill again in this Session, and I urge Ministers not to delay in tackling what are, I accept, a complex range of issues.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o86"><a name="80218-0008.htm_para2"><a name="0802183000317">In the absence of a general solution to the problem, however, my Committee supports an interim solution for the health and social care sector, given the urgency of the issue. In our report of last summer on older people in health care and the services provided to them, we found that 21 per cent. of care homes still did not meet basic minimum standards. We set out a catalogue of abuse, neglect, carelessness, lack of privacy, dignity and confidentiality, and downright discrimination against the elderly. The elderly would be protected from all those things by the Human Rights Act, but given the implications of the YL case, those in private sector homes have no such protection under the Act.</p>

Friend the Member for Luton, North (Kelvin Hopkins) moved an amendment in the Public Bill Committee that would have defined all providers of health and social care as public authorities for the purposes of the Human Rights Act. The amendment had the support of the Equality and Human Rights Commission and most of the non-governmental organisations. My Committee is sympathetic in principle to the substance of the proposal. The provision of  <br>

health and social care is subject to a stringent regulatory regime that involves registration, supervision and inspection. We agree in principle that that should be sufficient to attract the protection of the Human Rights Act. We are left with an anomaly of two elderly residents in the same care home: one would be protected because she was being funded by the local authority, but the other would not be protected because her assets were more than &#163;21,500. Such a situation was pointed out by Help the Aged in its briefing for today&#146;s debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o88"><a name="80218-0008.htm_para4"><a name="0802183000319">Such an amendment, however, would extend the protection of the Human Rights Act to self-funders and would go well beyond what Parliament intended when it passed the Human Rights Act. It would raise wider questions about rights&#151;something that has become known as &#147;horizontality&#148; in human rights jargon. We believe that such an issue&#151;the question of whether private individuals can enforce their human rights against other private individuals or companies that are not public authorities&#151;should be considered as part of the wider debate on the Bill of Rights. Most people do not realise that the Human Rights Act applies to public bodies, not the private sector generally. There is a strong case for horizontality, but the original Human Rights Act did not provide for that. We are simply trying to restore the position to what it was before the Leonard Cheshire and YL cases.</p>

 Is it not a problem arising from privatisation that people not only find themselves in the private sector but have their Human Rights Act coverage removed as well?</p>

 Yes, that is a consequence of the YL case. During a Liaison Committee sitting, I put that point to the former Prime Minister. He said that such a situation would be severely anomalous, and that people with publicly funded places in the private sector ought to be protected by the Act, as not protecting them would militate against contracting out and privatisation as ways to deliver public services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o89"><a name="80218-0008.htm_para5"><a name="0802183000322">Our other concern about the broad amendment moved by my hon. Friend the Member for Luton, North to encompass self-funders in the health and social care sector is that it would do little to fix the problem for other vulnerable groups such as those whom I have described, and might support the false impression that nothing further needs to be done to rectify the anomaly. New clause 1 proposes restoring, for the health and social care sector pure and simple, the Human Rights Act&#146;s original intention, which is that the Act should cover private-sector providers of publicly funded services, under arrangements made pursuant to statutory powers. I hope that the Minister will consider carefully the new clause and its purpose. I hope that he will accept it, but if he is unwilling to do so, I urge him to tell the House today that he will undertake to introduce his own amendments to achieve the same effect in the other place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o90"><a name="80218-0008.htm_para6"><a name="0802183000323">The other new clauses and amendments that I have tabled are intended to implement the recommendations in our report, &#147;The Human Rights of Older People in Healthcare&#148;, published last summer. We described how the use of human rights can be a powerful lever to improve the quality of services, as well as guaranteeing in their delivery basic concepts such as dignity and  <br>

respect for the elderly in hospitals and care homes. As I said, the report gave graphic evidence of abuse and showed that many homes are not compliant with existing regulations. We said that the care standards regulations should require care homes to respect residents&#146; human rights. The regulations governing the operation of health and social care providers, which deal with matters including staff training and the handling of complaints, require that the health, safety and welfare of service users be secured. We recommended that users&#146; human rights should also be central to the operation of health and social care providers, and amendments Nos. 3 and 4 are designed to achieve that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o91"><a name="80218-0008.htm_para7"><a name="0802183000324">We recommended that the new Care Quality Commission should adopt a human rights framework to underpin and inform its work and make it more effective in fulfilling its statutory duties. We were disappointed that the Government&#146;s reply to our report did not address that issue adequately. New clause 2 and amendments Nos. 5 to 7 would ensure that the protection and promotion of human rights are central to the new commission&#146;s performance of its functions. If the Minister cannot accept the amendments, I should be interested to hear why he thinks our proposals are unnecessary. Help the Aged has said clearly that its main concern is the YL loophole. Notwithstanding that, it believes that the CQC can and should promote and protect human rights through its own work, saying:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o97"><a name="80218-0008.htm_para13"><a name="0802183000330">There are three problems with that. First, putting the human rights of health and social care users at the heart of the commission&#146;s work is not equivalent to specifying the precise work programme; it is more fundamental. Secondly, compliance with the Human Rights Act is a legal requirement, not simply something that the Government can expect to happen. Our concern is to ensure that human rights influence the work of the new commission across the board and are not seen simply as a tick-box compliance exercise.</p>

all its work. We regret that the Department of Health failed to address that point. It simply restated the current position&#151;that the Act is seen as just another statute applicable to public bodies and demanding compliance, rather than as the culture change that we recommended in last summer&#146;s report on the human rights of the elderly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o101"><a name="80218-0008.htm_para17"><a name="0802183000334">That is crucial. Without clear and accessible information about how human rights apply in hospitals and care homes, service users will not be in a position to challenge how they are treated or to know how to seek redress.

<p><a name="stpa_o102"><a name="80218-0008.htm_para18"><a name="0802183000335">We have all seen the signs in public buildings saying that staff are entitled to be treated with dignity and respect.

That, however, should be part of the information process. A lot of hospitals, including those in my constituency, give leaflets to people as they arrive about how they can expect to be treated, but not about their rights in respect of how they will be treated. Such information is essential if people are to be able to enforce those rights. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o103"><a name="80218-0008.htm_para19"><a name="0802183000336">We also recommended that in undertaking its work, the new commission should take into account the provision of advocacy services.

I urge the Government to accept in principle that the Bill should be amended to reapply the 1998 Act to publicly funded residents of private sector care homes. I also urge him to consider seriously our other amendments, all of which are intended to protect the rights of extremely vulnerable people in the health and social care sectors.</p>

 We are debating one of the enduring themes of the Bill. In Committee, Members on both sides made several attempts to beef up its human rights aspects. Most of us were concerned about the fact that 90 per cent. of care homes are run by the private and voluntary sector and are therefore not covered by the Human Rights Act 1998. That was never Parliament&#146;s intention when the legislation was introduced, but case law and decisions in the courts have brought us to where we are today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o107"><a name="80218-0008.htm_para23"><a name="0802183000341">It is right and proper that we try to amend that, but there is also a wider problem that probably cannot be dealt with in this Bill. We need to think of ways to avoid a situation whereby people can sit side by side in the same private nursing home with different rights because one person is funding their own care and the other is having it paid for by the state. The Minister has been genuinely sympathetic as regards this state of affairs, and it may be easier to deal with it in stages. However, it is worth pointing out that it has been allowed to exist for far too long. We missed an opportunity with the Equality Act 2006, when several amendments were tabled, and the private Member&#146;s Bill promoted by the hon. Member for Hendon (Mr. Dismore) never saw the light of day. We would not be doing our duty if we were to allow yet another opportunity to slip by. If we leave it all to a consultation as part of a Green Paper on a possible British Bill of Rights, that may be too little, too late.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o108"><a name="80218-0008.htm_para24"><a name="0802183000342">It is helpful that the Joint Committee on Human Rights has considered the Bill in such detail. I thank hon. Members for tabling the amendments, because they give us a chance to debate the issue once more. In the summary of its report, the Committee says:</p>

If the Minister considered clause 4(3)(b) in detail and perhaps providing for associated facilities after transport, that might be a way in which to tackle some of my concerns and those of others about the matter.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o119"><a name="80218-0009.htm_para2"><a name="0802183000354">If the Minister could clarify the issue, it would give me some sense of security that depots and staff rooms associated with private ambulance services would be included in the regulated activity and taken into account in the registration process so that we could deal with unhygienic facilities, if necessary. Much legislation relates to health and safety at work and there is a procedure for considering the health and safety at work aspects of the measure. However, when we deal with the most vulnerable people in our constituencies, it is essential that we have all the necessary support. I implore the Minister to give some comfort about section 6 of the Human Rights Act and facilities associated with the private transport provision of non-emergency ambulance services.</p>

 I am pleased to support the amendments, which my hon. Friend the Member for Hendon (Mr. Dismore) proposed so competently and ably.

However, I believe that we should find a way to ensure that all residents of care homes are covered by the Human Rights Act. At the moment, if one is in a  <br>

care home that is privatised, or moved from a public to a private care home, one is removed from coverage of the Human Rights Act, and that is unacceptable. Even if the Government tabled amendments along the lines suggested by my hon. Friend the Member for Hendon, the self-funders would still not be covered. I have a possible solution, which I will urge on the Minister later, but I will not spring that surprise on him just yet.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o121"><a name="80218-0009.htm_para4"><a name="0802183000357">The problems arise from two fundamental factors, about which I was not happy when they occurred. The first is the privatisation of care homes. If they had stayed in the public sector and all care homes were in the public sector, there would not be a problem. The second is means-testing funding. If all funding were public, without means-testing, there would not be a problem. I urge the Government to reconsider the recommendations of the royal commission on long term care for the elderly that all care home residents should be publicly funded out of taxation&#151;progressive taxation at that. There would be no problem with coverage by the Human Rights Act if the Government ensured that all residents of care homes were publicly funded. When the royal commission produced its recommendations, it estimated the cost to the Exchequer at &#163;1 billion a year. That is not much money in the great scheme of things&#151;it is the equivalent of one third of a penny on the standard rate. I have spoken to many people, in meetings and privately, and asked whether anyone would object to the equivalent of a third of a penny extra taxation to pay for long-term care for everyone, including us. Many of us, because we will live longer and are much healthier than we were, will probably finish up in care towards the end of our lives. Indeed, some people might even choose to enter long-term residential care, which should also be an option, rather than having to enter it because of ill health or infirmity. If we could all be assured that, whatever happened, we would be guaranteed long-term care at the end of our lives that was properly funded by the state, we would all be greatly relieved. Indeed, I have heard no one object to that proposition in all my conversations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o122"><a name="80218-0009.htm_para5"><a name="0802183000358">The other issue is the privatisation of care homes. Personally, I was deeply opposed to the privatisation of care homes and opposed the effective privatisation of care in my constituency, encountering some difficulties with the local authority at the time. Nevertheless, the changes went ahead, under pressure from the Government and through the use of legislative and financial means to press the authority to move care into the private sector. In effect, that is how things happened&#151;there are still some public care homes, but as the hon. Member for Romsey (Sandra Gidley), speaking for the Liberal Democrats, pointed out, 90 per cent. of care is now in the voluntary and private sectors. That is a matter of concern.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o123"><a name="80218-0009.htm_para6"><a name="0802183000359">I believe profoundly in the public service ethos&#151;the idea that when people work in care, they do so not for profit, but to care for their fellow human beings, out of a commitment to their interests. If care is in the public sector, that is indeed what happens. One of the care homes in my constituency that closed down was in the middle of a large community from which people went into residential care. The home was staffed by people from that community who were long-term workers there and was democratically accountable to the local authority. That was the ideal situation, yet the home was closed and the care moved into the private sector.</p>

In the longer term, I hope that the Government will look to public ownership once again and make long-term care part of the overall health provision envisaged by everyone from Nye Bevan onwards, based on the principle of universality so well expressed by Beveridge, Bevan and many other socialists of that time, but perhaps put most brilliantly by Professor Richard Titmuss, who influenced me in my youth in setting out the case for universal provision.</p>

The Public Bill Committee drew on the JCHR&#146;s work, particularly its 18th report of the previous Session entitled &#147;The Human Rights of Older People in Healthcare&#148;, HC 378. It is important to note that although the Committee was most exercised by the eviction of individuals from care homes, the Government are presiding over a wide range of human rights failings in our health and social care sectors.</p>

The first involves resourcing the ombudsman, who is facing an elevenfold increase in work load, yet none of the costs of that increase have been reflected in the impact assessments for the Bill. The second involves monitoring trends. With the Healthcare Commission losing its complaints function, how can we be sure that the early warning signals will be picked up by the regulator? I dare say that we all remember the tremendous work of the community health councils, which were able to use the collective wisdom of all that they had been able to achieve through their inspections and access to hospitals through programmes such as Bedwatch. We discussed that at length when the Government announced that they were axing the community health councils but then had to postpone their abolition and give them a stay of execution for a year. Those functions now appear to be at risk again. I hope that the Minister will address that point specifically.</p>

It seems to us that the right place for a thorough going over of that was in Committee, but that was rejected during the course of our deliberations. It is in Committee, Madam Deputy Speaker, that it is appropriate to go through really intense and detailed scrutiny of these provisions, which provide complex material to interweave and interleave into existing legislation. Having an appropriate debate on these amendments now depended on having a proper Committee stage as a matter of principle. In the absence of any such debate and of the bringing forward of the Bill of Rights in advance, our present debate becomes difficult and it is not easy to form a clear opinion of how the provisions will work.</p>

 As has already been said, this group of amendments deals with a number of matters raised in the legislative scrutiny report of the Joint Committee on Human Rights, which was published earlier this month. It has provided a very helpful human rights perspective to the Bill and I would like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the Committee&#146;s diligent and important work under the chairmanship of my hon.

We agree with the principle behind the Joint Committee&#146;s proposed amendments, but we do not see the need to inscribe everything in primary legislation. I understand that proposing a large number of amendments in this way represents a new approach for the Joint Committee, but in this instance I am not sure that it is the most effective way to proceed. Where the Government are giving undertakings or are already pursuing a particular policy, I hope that the Committee will accept those undertakings rather than pursue the course of specifying every last detail directly in the legislation.</p>

We heard a great deal in the evidence presented to the Committee and in the Committee&#146;s own deliberations about the case for bringing private and voluntary sector health and social care providers within the scope of the Human Rights Act 1998. I said, and I repeat, that I am sympathetic to the intention of dealing with publicly funded care, be it health or adult social care, that is behind the new clause. I thank my hon. Friend and his Committee for setting out the issues so clearly. As I hope I made clear in Committee in response to a number of proposed amendments, including those tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Luton, North (Kelvin Hopkins), the Government are firmly committed to amending the Human Rights Act to ensure that all publicly arranged care provided by the independent sector is covered by it. We have agreed with the Ministry of Justice that it would be appropriate to use the Health and Social Care Bill to strengthen regulatory powers to ensure that the Care Quality Commission can enforce regulatory requirements in line with the spirit of the European convention on human rights.</p>

Regulations under clause 16 will set out specific requirements that will be in line with the spirit of the European convention on human rights, but are relevant to the provision of health and social care services.

We agree that it is important that people have information on their rights and entitlements so that they can make informed decisions about their care and treatment, but the amendment is not necessary to achieve that. The Government have already distributed guidance and a toolkit on human rights and health care to the NHS, and that is available to the public. The Human Rights Act makes it unlawful for the Care Quality Commission, or any NHS body or local authority, as public authorities, to act in a way that is incompatible with the convention right. It is therefore for the courts to ensure that they comply. Of course, other bodies, such as the Equality and Human Rights Commission, have a leading role in that.</p>

The Government recognise the importance of good advocacy services. Section 12 of the Health and Social Care Act 2001 gives the Secretary of State for Health a duty to arrange the provision of independent advocacy services for those who make complaints about the NHS, and we established the Independent Complaints Advocacy Service to support patients and members of the public wishing to complain about their NHS care or treatment. In the context of social care, we intend to provide equal access to advocacy alongside the new complaints arrangements. We are still examining the details of how that can best be achieved.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o153"><a name="80218-0010.htm_para7"><a name="0802183000391">While the commission will encourage the provision of good advocacy services through its review functions and by monitoring the adequacy of complaints processes operated by service providers, we do not consider that that should be central to its role. It would therefore be inappropriate for us to include it in the list of the matters to which it must have regard as a matter of course when carrying out its functions.</p>

The standards will provide a practical set of benchmarks for different services. The new clause sets out a number of topics to be covered by standards under clause 41, relating to the rights of patients and service users. We intend to hold wide-ranging discussions and full consultation with patients and clinicians on the details of the standards, because we want to ensure that they deliver real improvements in care. We feel that it would be inappropriate to set out the details in the Bill in advance of that consultation; indeed, I am not convinced that such standards should be in primary legislation at all, as it will be necessary to refine them frequently.</p>

health care-acquired infections&#151;or health care-associated infections, depending on which of the Government&#146;s definitions one chooses to take. New clause 15 would provide for a code of practice on malnutrition and is drafted in the same terms as clause 17, which provides for a code of practice relating to health care-acquired infections.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o167"><a name="80218-0010.htm_para21"><a name="08021816000020">The context of the new clause and amendment is necessarily fixed within the area of health care-acquired infection. The Government have put in the Bill the need for regulations about health care-associated infections, as they call them, notably methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and clostridium difficile, and a code of practice on preventing them. While that is laudable, I fear that it will do little to dent the Government&#146;s ongoing failure on health care-associated infections unless proper infection control measures are put in place in the code.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o168"><a name="80218-0010.htm_para22"><a name="08021816000021">Although health care-associated infections are falling, the rate is still way off track to meet the Government&#146;s 2004 target of halving MRSA rates by March 2008. The Secretary of State for Health has contradicted the Prime Minister&#146;s promise of screening for C. difficile; bed occupancy is up; deep cleaning is a gimmick with no new money attached; there is no decent search-and-destroy strategy; and Government promises on isolation wards are still being broken. I am sure, moreover, that the House was pretty disgusted by the Health Secretary&#146;s posturing promise that he would prevent a payout to the chief executive of Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells NHS Trust, considering that, on 24 January&#151;just a few days ago&#151;we discovered not only that the Secretary of State never had the power to do that, but that the chief executive received &#163;75,000 of taxpayers&#146; money for her failure. That is the context in which malnutrition is so important.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o169"><a name="80218-0010.htm_para23"><a name="08021816000022">As we know, according to the Government&#146;s own figures in &#147;Clean, safe care: reducing infections and saving lives&#148;, published on 8 January, MRSA affected about 6,000 people in 2006-07 and C. difficile about 56,000. By contrast, in 2006-07 no fewer than 139,127 patients were discharged from hospital in a state of malnourishment. The issue is not just about malnourishment; it is also a human rights&#151;we have just discussed human rights&#151;issue. The Joint Committee on Human Rights, in its recent report, &#147;The Human Rights of Older People in Healthcare&#148;, noted that malnutrition and dehydration in care settings breached articles 2, 3 and 8 of the European convention on human rights. Figures cited in the Department of Health&#146;s own nutrition action plan show that the cost of under-nutrition is estimated at &#163;7.3 billion a year, and a recent <i> British Medical Journal</i> study reported that about 20 per cent. of patients in hospital&#151;one in five&#151;are malnourished.</p>

1997. There is little evidence that the Government have either the will or the conviction to tackle the problem. Since the new year, they have failed to take the opportunities afforded by the publication of vital signs indicators for primary care trusts, of responses to the payment by results consultation, and of the Bill to demonstrate their intention to do so. Of the 83 vital signs targets, none relates to malnutrition. It has been pointed out to the Department that the lack of recognition of support services, such as those on nutrition, in PBR acts as a barrier to the commissioning of effective care pathways.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o172"><a name="80218-0010.htm_para26"><a name="08021816000025">Most damning was the voting down in Committee of an amendment that would have put the importance of tackling under-nutrition on the same statutory footing as tackling hospital-acquired infections. Clearly, therefore, the Government see under-nutrition as a peripheral rather than central issue in respect of both health and social care and human rights. The new clause and amendment give the House an opportunity to make a genuine addition and improvement.</p>

He said no more than that he hoped that that would happen. That seems a wholly insufficient and inadequate response to what is patently a major issue, given evidence that was based wholly on the Government&#146;s own information and statistics, and which was published in parliamentary answers. Unless we hear from the Minister an important and new voice on the matter, it will be important for us to register our concern.

It was based on a survey of prospective in-patients at a Dundee hospital and it said that more than 40 per cent. of acute admission patients are undernourished and 75 per cent. of patients lose weight during their hospital admission. That is a worrying statistic. The article goes on to discuss some of the reasons for that and we must also bear in mind that patients are not moving around and burning off energy.</p>

Since 1997, more people going into hospital are malnourished, either because is their usual state or because it is part of their illness. Not only do more people come out more malnourished or undernourished than when they went in, but the numbers of those who go in malnourished have grown compared with 10 years ago. The incidence of malnourishment as a phenomenon has increased over that period, which is why it is so crucial that the issue is added to the Bill.

<p><a name="stpa_o177"><a name="80218-0011.htm_para2"><a name="08021816000033">In 2005, BAPEN published an economic analysis of the cost of disease-related malnutrition in the UK. The total cost was estimated to be &#163;7.3 billion, with approximately &#163;3.8 billion incurred in hospital and &#163;2.8 billion in long-term facilities. I would have assumed that the Government were keen to address that avoidable cost by putting in place some simple measures. We have all seen the programmes with undercover filming in geriatric wards and nursing homes, in which people are not helped to eat or given inappropriate food. Tackling the problem, and ensuring that there is a clear code of behaviour, would also address some of the human rights aspects of the issue. As the hon. Gentleman rightly pointed out, this is a human rights issue, because many elderly people are not getting the care and attention they deserve, however many dignity strategies the Government introduce.</p>

There is little detail behind the amendments, but they are well intentioned. I hope that they will find some favour with the Government, because the problem is real and avoidable. There are no targets to address it and it is too often overlooked.</p>

 I wish to contribute briefly to this debate. Traces of minerals and vitamins have been shown, even in the last week, to be of crucial importance in the onset and development of Alzheimer&#146;s and of dementia in general. I urge the Minister to pursue that research because it could make a tremendous difference not only to the lives of millions of people who might not develop dementia if they have the right diet and vitamin and mineral intake, but to those who already have the disease, because it could be prevented from developing further.</p>

It should require that a patient&#146;s particular medical condition is taken into account when balancing their nutrition. If people have suffered serious bone damage, it is important that they get certain vitamins and minerals, such as calcium phosphorus and vitamin D, to enable the growth of new bone. Of course, those vitamins and minerals are also important for healthy people, to try to offset osteoporosis and other problems.</p>

condition. I do not suggest that we want the professionals to have to tick lots of boxes on a piece of paper, because it could become so bureaucratic as to lose its purpose, but I hope that the Minister will be receptive to the firm plea from both sides of the House that a code of practice is included in the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o182"><a name="80218-0011.htm_para7"><a name="08021816000044">The issue is not just the food, or even just the quantity, although it is important to monitor significant weight loss in people in residential and nursing homes or in-patients. That can tell a professional that something serious is going on. Also, particularly with elderly people, it is important to ensure that the code of practice identifies what we expect of the home or the hospital in assisting people, who might otherwise be unable to accept what is on the menu, to eat. Of course, that will start to involve assistance with eating and, as we all appreciate, that involves staff time, which is often rare in hospital wards.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o183"><a name="80218-0011.htm_para8"><a name="08021816000045">In Committee, I mentioned the difficulty of dealing with elderly people in trauma wards who often cannot hold their knife and fork, or even a spoon, and who need somebody to sit with them and help them eat. If the Minister is prepared to be helpful on this point, I hope that the code of practice will consider not only the food and nutrients but what is done to assist people in getting that intake of food. Sometimes, such help is about listening and observing more than anything else. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o184"><a name="80218-0011.htm_para9"><a name="08021816000046">In my experience of having elderly relatives in hospital, some at the end of their lives, when I have seen best practice&#151;and I have&#151;it has been extremely good. I am thinking particularly about my mother during her last weeks in the excellent Wokingham hospital. As she was unable to take solids, her food was mashed and later pureed. A lot of thought went into what consistency the food should be that she would be able to eat. In contrast, other relatives in other hospitals did not have that experience. It was extremely distressing. As a family&#151;in this country&#151;we felt that we had to work a rota to ensure that elderly, frail relatives were fed at mealtimes in hospital.</p>

 My hon. Friend is giving moving evidence, which is an accurate observation that has, I am sure, been shared by many here and outside this place. She will be the first to accept that however important it is for family members, when they exist, to take part in a rota, an adjustment is needed in the expectations placed on nurses. They ought to be given the time to do the difficult task of getting the appropriate types of food into the mouths of those who are most vulnerable and unable to help themselves, and that use of their time should be valued. At the moment, many of the other targets drive nurses away from feeling that they have the time to do that.</p>

 That is obviously right. Families who have a loved one in hospital or sick want to do their best for them. I am not saying for one moment that relatives do not want to help, willingly, at mealtimes and other such times. However, there is a difference between the relative who sits by the bed and helps to deliver the meal to the patient and the family who feel that they have to be there at lunchtime and in the evening just to ensure that the patients gets some food. There is a fear that if families do not organise that  <br>

As MPs, we have to deal with such casework from time to time and it is distressing to have to deal with cases that involve people who have not received help and support on nutrition and feeding, particularly when they become frail and vulnerable. As we get an older population, more people do not have any close friends or relatives. In those cases, it is important that the residential care home, the nursing home or the hospital ward not only protects people&#146;s human rights but has a code of conduct that is in force and inspected to ensure that such cases occur fewer times, not more. The trend is going the wrong way. The Minister is a compassionate man. If he wants to show that compassion during any part of the Bill, now is the time.</p>

I had grave doubts about telling people, &#147;You must stop infecting people as they enter your hospital.&#148; I do not think that any hospital intends to infect people. I do not want to tell doctors and nurses to wash their hands between going from patient to patient. That is a difficulty. If we are now to start telling the people who are running our health service, &#147;You must start feeding patients,&#148; something is dramatically wrong. If we are to start telling residential homes that they must start feeding their clients, that is wrong.</p>

If the Minister is going to add more to the Bill, he should be careful. Anything left off will be deemed unimportant because of its omission. I acknowledge every sentiment about the problem of malnutrition in our hospitals and residential homes, but I ask the Minister, please, to be careful before he starts telling those organisations what meals they need to have and what vitamins they should put in their food.

To identify and deal with that risk, we have introduced protected meal times. We are putting particular emphasis on the screening that has been advocated by a number of hon.

Indeed, Opposition Members referred to the Age Concern report, &#147;Hungry to be Heard&#148;, and they will be pleased to learn that Gordon Lishman, the director of Age Concern who is responsible for pioneering work in the field of nutrition, has agreed to chair the national action plan delivery board.</p>

importance of including regard for the patient experience as one of the NHS&#146;s five main priorities. If there is one thing that comes up time and again in consultations and when hon. Members talk to their constituents about their experience as patients, the quality of food is very high on the list, as well as issues such as how people are treated by staff and receptionists. It is very important that, by including the issue in the five main priorities that the Government have given to the health service, we will see further improvements. Indeed, I held a meeting last week to find out how we could best spread the really good practice that hon. Members are aware of happening throughout the country. I recently visited Cornwall, where the local hospitals are doing an excellent job in serving, I believe, 80 per cent. of locally bought produce, fresh from local farmers, butchers, dairy farmers and fishermen. That is going down very well with patients there, and it is improving recovery rates.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o196"><a name="80218-0011.htm_para21"><a name="08021816000062">I want to deal with the claim made by the hon. Member for Eddisbury (Mr. O'Brien) both here and in Committee about patients allegedly being discharged with malnutrition. He made that claim, both generally and in Committee, in reference to my local excellent hospital. It surprised me, and it also surprised the chief executive of the Royal Devon and Exeter hospital. It might be based on a misunderstanding of the definition of episodes. If he will bear with me, it is important that this is put on the record, as the allegations are quite serious.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o197"><a name="80218-0011.htm_para22"><a name="08021816000063">For the purpose of the hospital episode statistics, a patient&#146;s stay in hospital is referred to as a spell and each period under the care of one consultant is known as a episode. So a patient who is under the care of several consultants during the spell in hospital has several episodes. Someone under the care of only one consultant throughout the stay has only one episode. For the purpose of the statistics from which the hon. Gentleman draws his allegations, the first episode is known as the patient admission episode and the last episode is known as the discharge episode.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o198"><a name="80218-0011.htm_para23"><a name="08021816000064">If someone has only one episode in hospital and if they remain under the care of only one consultant during their stay in hospital, their patient admission episode and their discharge episode would be the same. So someone admitted, for example, for the treatment of a nosebleed would have &#147;nosebleed&#148; recorded as their admission episode and their discharge episode. That does not mean that they leave hospital with a bleeding nose. Similarly, someone whose final treatment episode is registered as being for malnutrition does not leave hospital with malnutrition, as the hon. Gentleman suggested earlier. They are not discharged with malnutrition.</p>

It might be part of a more serious condition for which they are being treated or operated on, and it is diagnosed only when they are recovering from the more serious condition for which they are being treated or operated on. That explains why their final treatment episode might be for malnutrition, when their initial treatment was not. Hence the allegation made by the hon.

when recovering from a serious operation, a patients loses their appetite, so their final treatment in hospital is for malnutrition, but that does not mean that they are discharged with malnutrition. So I hope that that helps to clear up that point.</p>

I am sorry if I have not managed to do it with more clarity. A better phrase for episode is what one is being treated for during a particular period of one&#146;s stay in hospital. As I am trying to say, someone may be treated for a range of different things while they are in hospital. What they are treated for at the end of their stay in hospital might be different from what they were admitted to hospital for. I simply tried to clear up the misunderstanding that has arisen as a result of how the hon.

<p><a name="st_o221"><a name="08021816000071"><a name="80218-0012.htm_spnew5"><a name="08021816000571"><b>Mr. Bradshaw:</b>
 Anyone who has fairly followed my record in this place will know that I always try to answer questions succinctly. Perhaps I tried to answer the hon. Gentleman&#146;s written questions too succinctly. If I had given a little bit more detail, as I have given the House today, he might not have been led to make the claim that he made in Committee and during this debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o200"><a name="80218-0012.htm_para1"><a name="08021816000072">The hon. Gentleman asked why we were making separate provision for health care-acquired infections yet not giving nutrition the same level of importance. The separate provision for health care-associated infections is already in existing legislation. We already have the code of conduct that Parliament approved during the introduction of the code of practice as part of the National Health Service Act 2006. That provides a framework on how services can prevent and control health care-associated infections and has been well received in the field. It would not make sense to remove that vital guide for tracking infections. May I take the hon. Gentleman to task for accusing the Government of failing to get infection rates down? He will know that since we were in Committee, we have reported a 40 per cent. decrease in MRSA since 2003-04 and a 16 per cent. decrease in C. diff in the past year alone.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o201"><a name="80218-0012.htm_para2"><a name="08021816000073">We do not desire areas such as nutrition to be neglected. Indeed, in everything that I have said about the subject both in the Chamber and in Committee, I have reconfirmed the importance that should be placed on nutrition. We have acknowledged throughout our debates on the Bill that the commission is best placed to set the specific criteria by which providers are assessed for compliance with registration requirements. However, I have said before, and I will say again, that we intend that registration requirements will make reference to nutrition. The Committee was shown examples of how they might look and copies were placed in the Library. Hon. Members will be aware that we will issue consultation on the issue shortly. In that spirit, I invite the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the motion.</p>

<p><a name="st_o222"><a name="08021816000074"><a name="80218-0012.htm_spnew6"><a name="08021816000572"><b>Mr. O'Brien:</b>
 I listened very carefully to the Minister. Interestingly, the hon. Member for Tamworth (Mr. Jenkins) unwittingly put his finger on the fact that although health care-associated infections are mentioned in the Bill, malnutrition is not. He suggested that it would be dangerous to add anything more to the Bill. However, malnutrition affects 137,000 people, whereas 6,000 are affected by MRSA, for example. If we want to demonstrate that addressing malnutrition is of equal importance, we will want a reference to it in the Bill. On that basis, I urge my colleagues to join me in the Lobby in support of new clause 15.</p>

 Amendments Nos. 62 to 64 and 143 are Government amendments, so I shall speak to them first. Amendments Nos. 62 and 65 are significant and will be of particular interest to the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o205"><a name="80218-0012.htm_para6"><a name="08021823000008">On amendment No. 62, clause 2 ensures that the commission must have regard in everything it does to the public&#146;s views on the services that fall within its remit, and to their levels of satisfaction with those services. The clause received a great deal of attention when the Bill was considered in Committee. User and carer involvement in the commission&#146;s work was also a recurring theme, and hon. Members from both main Opposition parties tabled amendments on that issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o206"><a name="80218-0012.htm_para7"><a name="08021823000009">As I have made clear on a number of occasions, the Government believe that involving and listening to users, patients, their carers and the public will be a central responsibility for the new commission. The Bill already requires the commission to appoint an advisory committee, and we will expect the commission actively to involve patients and service users as well as others with an interest, such as service providers and commissioners.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o207"><a name="80218-0012.htm_para8"><a name="08021823000010">There will be a wide range of bodies with an interest in a particular issue or representing particular groups,  <br>

<notus-date day="18" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><b>18 Feb 2008 : Column 78</b><br>
and we want to ensure that the commission hears their views. For that reason, Government amendment No. 62 proposes to make it explicit that a duty to have regard to the views of the public includes views expressed by representative bodies on behalf of members of the public. That requires the commission to engage with those acting on behalf of members of the public; that might include local involvement networks, charities or other representative groups. I hope that hon. Members will recognise that the proposed measures are a valuable addition to the Bill that will address their concerns and indeed go further, and I hope that they can accept the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o208"><a name="80218-0012.htm_para9"><a name="08021823000011">Amendments Nos. 63, 64, 66, 67 and 143 are minor technical amendments designed to ensure consistency in drafting with the Care Standards Act 2000, which will continue to apply to children&#146;s services and services in Wales. Amendment No. 65 is another significant amendment. When we considered the Bill in Committee, the hon. Member for Romsey (Sandra Gidley) tabled an amendment to oblige the commission to publish its inspection reports. I said that I would be happy to consider the matter, and amendment No. 65 is our response to that commitment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o209"><a name="80218-0012.htm_para10"><a name="08021823000012">Clause 57 requires the commission to produce a report when it undertakes an inspection and to send a copy to the provider or manager in question. As it stands, the clause allows the commission to choose whether to publish the report. As I said in Committee, there is no explicit duty on the current commission to publish reports either, although it normally makes them available online. However, I made it clear that I agree absolutely that the public should have access to the commission&#146;s inspection findings. Having had the opportunity to review the drafting, I am happy to introduce amendment No. 65, which will oblige the commission to publish its inspection reports. I trust that hon. Members will feel able to accept the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o210"><a name="80218-0012.htm_para11"><a name="08021823000013">Amendment No. 68 is a consequential amendment that relates to section 134(6) of the Mental Health Act 1983. It will update a reference to section 121 of that Act. It is necessary because the relevant part of section 121 will be replaced, through schedule 3 to the Bill, by proposed new clause 134A. Amendments Nos. 69 to 74 are minor consequential amendments, necessitated by the Bill, to the list in schedule 5.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o211"><a name="80218-0012.htm_para12"><a name="08021823000014">I turn to amendment No. 142, the only Opposition amendment in the group. It seeks to allow the Secretary of State to specify in regulations specific circumstances in which the Care Quality Commission would be required to carry out additional inspections; such regulations could be made only after consultation with the commission itself. As I said in Committee, I understand the intention behind the amendment&#151;that is, to allow an ability to set specific triggers for the commission to carry out additional inspections. However, clause 57 already allows regulations to prescribe important aspects of inspection if necessary; there is no need to be more prescriptive.</p>

It will therefore not be for the Secretary of State, but for the commission, on the basis of its intelligence, to determine the appropriate triggers for inspections over and above what is set out in regulations. I invite the hon. Member for Romsey (Sandra Gidley) not to press the amendment.</p>

 We are discussing Government amendment No. 62 and the ensuing ones in the group; again, we have a host of Government amendments. Some are concessions that have arisen from Committee, but the question remains about why they had to appear at this late stage.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o213"><a name="80218-0013.htm_para1"><a name="08021823000017">In amendment No. 62, the Government are making an important concession on patient and public involvement in health. The Government promised a number of times in Committee to revisit the issue on Report. The drafting of the amendment is, to say the least, disappointingly unambitious. I am concerned that the amendment will open the door for any group that claims to speak on behalf of members of the public to harangue the new commission. We will return to the issue when we discuss the next grouping of amendments, but why are the Government fighting so shy of putting LINks&#151;the bodies that they have created&#151;into the Bill? Surely that is not because they have no confidence in the bodies themselves. Is it that, as the hon. Member for Tamworth (Mr. Jenkins) pointed out in Committee, the Government are worried that the bodies will be disbanded in the near future, following hard on the heels of the community health councils and the forums?</p>

Can the Minister guarantee that the status quo will not change?</p>

Clause 64 is entitled &#147;Avoidance of unreasonable burdens in exercise of regulatory powers&#148;. We have proposed that when the CQC increases regulation, an affirmative resolution should be brought before the House. We found that the Government were most resistant to that idea; as I have placed that on the record, I hope that the matter will be taken up with alacrity and fierce argument in another place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o216"><a name="80218-0013.htm_para4"><a name="08021823000020">The amendments on the CQC go hardly any way towards addressing the many and deep concerns expressed by the Committee and a number of third-party organisations; the letter published in today&#146;s issue of <i> The Guardian</i> testifies to that. It seems to suggest that the Government have lost the confidence of a lot of members of the voluntary sector. There is still no mention of carers among the skeletal functions of the CQC, listed in clause 2. I say &#147;skeletal&#148;, because for the most part this is skeleton or portmanteau legislation&#151;the body is to be added later, by regulations. That is most noticeable in clause 2, which establishes no overarching function. Indeed, the advertisement for the chair of the commission, already online despite the fact that the Bill has not been passed by either House, states that one of the role&#146;s responsibilities will be developing plans for  <br>

To ameliorate the problem, we have sought a separate reference board of commissioners and an executive board to run the commission. Despite the Minister&#146;s contention that the CQC is to be free to establish its own direction, the Government have not left space in the legislation for it to establish the most effective system of corporate governance. Furthermore, there are real concerns that the Government are playing politics with the merger, and ultimately with the well-being of patients and service users, through the prevention of special reviews until after 2010&#151;that is, after what will be an increasingly rocky election period for a failing Government and a dithering Prime Minister. We will seek to overturn the issue in another place to prevent that politicking from influencing the important substance of the Bill.</p>

The Government seem unable to get the issue right. What guarantees can the Minister give that they will not scrap this in three years&#146; time?</p>

The Care Standards Act 2000 created a single England-wide National Care Standards Commission, which was launched in 2002&#151;17 days later, the Government announced that it was to be abolished. The Health and Social Care (Community Health and Standards) Act 2003 created the Commission for Social Care Inspection, which was launched in 2004, incorporating the social care responsibilities of the National Care Standards Commission, the work of the Department of Health social services inspectorate and the SSI-Audit Commission joint review team. In 2004, the Government&#146;s arm&#146;s length body review ruled out a merger with the Healthcare Commission. In his 2005 Budget statement, the then Chancellor announced the merger that we are debating today. Need I say more? Can the Government guarantee that all the work that we are putting in today will not be scrapped within three years?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o220"><a name="80218-0013.htm_para8"><a name="08021823000024">This scandalous provision remains in the Bill. It forces the CQC to have regard to such aspects of Government policy as the Secretary of State may direct; as such, it totally undermines the independence of the body. The Healthcare Commission has put on record its concerns about the timing of the legislation and that the costs will be high and the distraction considerable. It was disappointing therefore that the Government chose not to include the cost of the merger with wind-up costs of &#163;140 million in any risk assessment.</p>

Furthermore, parts of the cost savings are due to the commission losing the responsibility for complaints handling. That will be  <br>

 When I first read Government amendment No. 62, I thought it a good idea. However, I had a cynical afterthought&#151;I wondered whether it was a spoiling amendment for the LINks amendments tabled by the Conservatives. On the face of it, amendment No. 62 seems to address some of the many concerns raised in Committee about there being an insufficient patient and public voice in the new commission. However, I am not sure that the insertion of the words &#147;or on behalf of&#148; has been fully thought through. They are rather vague. It is not clear, for example, who decides who should speak on behalf of whom.</p>

Are we talking about bodies that have a constitution so that it is clear on whose behalf they speak, or advocacy services that may speak on behalf of the individual? Where is the protection for an individual who does not want anybody speaking on their behalf? Some mental health groups are very particular about their views on things, and I can envisage problems where other people might purport to speak on their behalf. I am a little confused by the vagueness and wonder whether any further clarity is yet to come.</p>

However, there is a problem where an inspection is due within a prescribed period but there may be factors that would alert people to the need for an inspection to be done more rapidly. There may be risk factors that could, particularly in a care home, lead to the quality of care deteriorating rapidly where a provider had previously been rated &#147;good&#148; and placed on a three-year inspection cycle. Those could include a change of ownership of the provider&#151;we have all seen cases of nursing homes where that has been evident&#151;or a change of registered manager, which can have a huge impact.

something as simple as staff turnover, sudden increases in which often indicate that something else is going wrong. If there is to be an automatic three-year inspection cycle, there must be an early warning system. We would not want to go back to a situation where there had to be a number of complaints before somebody realised that there was cause for concern.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o226"><a name="80218-0013.htm_para14"><a name="08021823000031">The Government have said that the principles of inspection for the CQC will be &#147;proportionate&#148; and &#147;risk based&#148; with a view to lightening the burden of regulation for health and social care providers. We would all agree with that general sentiment. However, the new inspection methodology is much more reliant on paper-based reviews and providers assessing themselves. I have occasionally had that concern in relation to CSCI. Sometimes, the first person who is asked to provide a report when there is a complaint is the manager of the care home whom the report is against, and of course people will try to present themselves in the best light possible. There are concerns that the moves towards light-touch regulation could have significant implications for public and staff safety, at a time when the Government are trying to encourage more private providers into the market.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o227"><a name="80218-0013.htm_para15"><a name="08021823000032">The Minister said that it will all be okay, but he has a job of reassurance to do. As the hon. Member for Eddisbury (Mr. O'Brien) highlighted, the budget that the new commission will operate with will be 40 per cent. less than what the previous regulators had, so it may be driven by budget imperatives rather than what is best for users of health and social care services. A recent survey of Unison members working for the CSCI found that 76 per cent. believe that the new inspection methodology does not provide a robust assessment of risk to service users. A common belief was that the reduced inspection programme could lead to staffing cuts, and fewer inspectors are less likely to impose enforcement requirements because there will not be enough time to follow them up.</p>

 My hon. Friend the Minister may know that I have been to visit the Minister with responsibility for care homes with a delegation from Unison, and we expressed concern about the risk-based approach to inspection. I know that my hon. Friend gave assurances about this in Committee, but there are ongoing concerns. If, in time, there are cases of care homes where the lighter-touch inspection has led to a lowering of standards of care, or the sense that they will no longer be visited so frequently and therefore do not need to perform quite so well, that could eventually lead back to the Government&#146;s door. My hon. Friend is conscientious and concerned about these matters, but this could come back to haunt the Government unless it works.

 I welcome the fact that the hon. Member for Eddisbury (Mr. O'Brien) recognises amendment No. 62 as an important concession, but it was not clear from his comments whether he was criticising us for going too far or not going far enough. I am not likely to get that clarification at the moment, as he is not here. The hon. Member for Romsey (Sandra Gidley) put her finger on it when she gave an example of how sensitive some patient and user groups are about organisations claiming to speak on their behalf. That is why we have broadened this out significantly to include groups who speak on people&#146;s behalf, not just a single organisation, although I specifically referred to LINks. I urge hon. Members on both sides of the House to give LINks a chance before writing them off.</p>

If, as I hope, there is still a Labour Government in three years&#146; time, I can give him that assurance. There was a general recognition in Committee that the Bill finishes the job that we began several years ago. In fact, as we discussed at some length, some Liberal Democrats urged this integration on us at the time of the last reorganisation of the regulatory system, but we felt that the timing was not right and that it made sense to allow the existing regulatory bodies to settle down and do their job&#151;and they have done a very good job. Even from the bodies that face abolition, there was a recognition of the desirability of the principle of integration.

I will not suggest, therefore, that those amendments show more of the contempt that many, including me, have accused the Labour Government of showing in their treatment of the patient voice in England. They scrapped community health councils, which I was very involved with.

As I said, that process began with the abolition of CHCs. We are disappointed that the Government have not used the opportunity offered by this Bill to steal our policy of creating HealthWatch, a national consumer voice for patients. HealthWatch would provide support to patients at a national level and leadership to LINks at a local level. It would incorporate the functions of the independent complaints advisory body; make representations to the NHS board on such things as the closure of NHS services; and, subject to consultation, it would have a statutory right over guidelines issued nationally concerning the care NHS patients should receive and over decisions that affect how NHS care is provided in an area. Hopefully, the Government will support us  <br>

when we introduce our NHS autonomy and accountability Bill. That would be welcome, and consistent with what the Government are purportedly seeking to achieve.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o253"><a name="80218-0014.htm_para7"><a name="08021823000064">Now that the Government amendments have been accepted, I am concerned that the door is open for any group that claims to speak on behalf of members of the public to harangue the new commission, or engage it in some difficult dialogue. We also note that there is no duty to consult, only the weak phrase &#147;have regard to&#148;. That weakness is repeated in relation to other organisations mentioned in the Bill. The hon. Member for Luton, North, who has studied the matter carefully, pointed out in Committee that clause 103, which deals with the OHPA, is entitled &#147;Duty to consult&#148; and contains the phrase &#147;seek the views of&#148;&#151;two very different things. A similar wording is used with regard to the CHRE. The title of clause 112 talks of a duty to consult, but again we find the phrase &#147;seek the views of&#148; in the text of the clause.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o254"><a name="80218-0014.htm_para8"><a name="08021823000065">Our amendments would beef up the consultation carried out by such bodies by including LINks. I commend the amendments standing in my name and those of my right hon. and hon. Friends, and Members from the Labour and Liberal Democrat Benches. This is a genuine cross-party approach to the matter, so I hope that the Government will feel persuaded.</p>

<p><a name="st_o233"><a name="08021823000066"><a name="80218-0014.htm_spnew0"><a name="08021823000563"><b>Kelvin Hopkins:</b>
 I have agreed to attach my name to the amendments, alongside that of my hon. Friend the Member for North-West Leicestershire, because Members in my party have been concerned about the strength of patient representation for some time, and it is right that those concerns are raised from time to time so that the Government are made aware of them. The abolition of community health councils and the switch to the patient and public involvement forums&#151;and now to LINks&#151;show that the Government are concerned about patient representation, but I am not sure whether they want to strengthen it, or have had pressure put on them to weaken it in some way.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o255"><a name="80218-0014.htm_para9"><a name="08021823000067">I know that the then health authority perceived the community health council in my area to be a nuisance. The primary care trust has regarded the patient and public involvement forum in our area, especially its chair, as a nuisance. However, patients&#146; representatives should be a nuisance. If they make a lot of noise, perhaps there is a basis for what they are doing. I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister and the Government will reconsider giving a role to LINks in the way in which the amendments suggest. Perhaps they will table their own amendments if the ones that we are considering are defeated.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o256"><a name="80218-0014.htm_para10"><a name="08021823000068">I repeat a point that I have made several times about local authority democratic accountability. When most long-term care homes were in the public sector, there was recourse to local councillors and local democratic representation. With privatisation and subsequent institutional reform, that local democratic accountability was lost. Indeed, many families now come to their Members of Parliament&#151;more than one constituent has approached me&#151;about problems with care homes. There should be a stronger role for patient representation and I hope that that view can be accommodated in the Bill before it receives Royal Assent.</p>

to be, and are to deliver all that the Government claim, why does the Minister not accept the amendments, which would strengthen the role of LINks? Are the Government not 100 per cent. convinced that LINks will prove an effective system?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o257"><a name="80218-0014.htm_para11"><a name="08021823000070">The Select Committee on Health looked into LINks and public and patient involvement, and it was apparent that, despite the expertise of the range of experts who came to speak to us, there was no clear idea about the final structure of LINks and how they would work in practice, or even what their functions would be. There was disappointment that some of the functions of the old CHCs were missing. That could be explained by the mantra that we want local solutions and that they will be different in different areas. I subscribe to that point of view to some extent. However, I was struck by the uncertainty about how LINks would work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o258"><a name="80218-0014.htm_para12"><a name="08021823000071">In the next couple of years, while the networks find their way, it could be said that we face a democratic deficit. Perhaps the Minister can reassure us that our concerns about how LINks will work are unfounded and that they genuinely are the best thing since sliced bread. If they are, there is no reason for not accepting the amendments.</p>

<p><a name="st_o235"><a name="08021823000072"><a name="80218-0014.htm_spnew2"><a name="08021823000565"><b>Mr. Bradshaw:</b>
 The amendments lead us into territory that is familiar to those of us who sat through the Committee proceedings: the role of local involvement networks. The amendments again try to put LINks on the face of the Bill, in the provisions for the Care Quality Commission, the Council for Healthcare Regulatory Excellence and the Office of the Health Professions Adjudicator. Let me first deal with amendments Nos. 131 and 136.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o259"><a name="80218-0014.htm_para13"><a name="08021823000073">As we specified in the previous debate and in Committee, we all want the Care Quality Commission to have a clear duty to engage with and be responsive to interested parties. I was therefore pleased to move Government amendment No. 62 to clarify the issue. In Committee, we discussed hon. Members&#146; desire for the CQC, the CHRE and the OHPA to be independent. However, the amendments would prescribe the bodies to which those independent organisations should pay regard. That is not a sensible way to proceed. Government amendment No. 62 makes it clear that the CQC should have regard to the views of organisations that represent patients. As the hon. Member for Romsey (Sandra Gidley) said earlier, there may be specialist care investigations&#151;for example, organisations might want to pay regard to the users of mental health services or other specialist groups. We do not believe that limiting the groups to which they should pay regard to LINks is sensible. That does not mean that we do not have confidence in LINks&#151;we have every confidence that they will do an excellent job and we expect the CQC to work closely with them.</p>

<p><a name="st_o236"><a name="08021823000074"><a name="80218-0014.htm_spnew3"><a name="08021823000566"><b>Sandra Gidley:</b>
 The Minister has demonstrated why the concept seems so nebulous. Some people argue that all the groups to which he said that due regard might be paid would have a feeding-in mechanism through LINks. Does he now claim that that is not the case?</p>

<p><a name="st_o237"><a name="08021823000075"><a name="80218-0014.htm_spnew4"><a name="08021823000567"><b>Mr. Bradshaw:</b>
 No. They may well do that and I hope that they will. I do not intend to extend the debate to become one of those that we held at length when  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="18 Feb 2008">

<notus-date day="18" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><b>18 Feb 2008 : Column 88</b><br>
LINks were established. The hon. Lady made a good point earlier that some patients and some patient and user organisations sometimes resent other organisations speaking on their behalf. We do not want to prescribe that the CQC should pay regard only to LINks, and not to other patient and user organisations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o260"><a name="80218-0014.htm_para14"><a name="08021823000076">Although Government amendment No. 62 was tabled in the same spirit as amendment No. 131, it has the distinct advantage of leaving the door open for other representative groups and for leaving it to the independent commission to determine for itself the most effective way in which to engage appropriate groups. Given the amendment that we have just accepted, we believe that amendment No. 131 and consequential amendment No. 136 are unnecessary.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o261"><a name="80218-0014.htm_para15"><a name="08021823000077">Amendments Nos. 132, 133, 134 and 135 would insert into clauses 103 and 112 a duty on the Council for Healthcare Regulatory Excellence and the Office of the Health Professions Adjudicator to seek the views from time to time of LINks in addition to other bodies. Amendment No. 137 is simply a consequential amendment to define &#147;Local Involvement Network&#148; in clause 122. Under the Bill as drafted, the CHRE and the OHPA are both required to consult public and representative bodies on exercising their functions. We believe that those independent bodies are best placed to decide from which other bodies they should seek views.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o262"><a name="80218-0014.htm_para16"><a name="08021823000078">Indeed, the council has already embarked on a programme of work, which will lead to the implementation of a patient and public strategy. That is being designed to ensure that the council can fulfil the proposed statutory function of becoming an authoritative voice for patients.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o263"><a name="80218-0014.htm_para17"><a name="08021823000079">I reiterate what I said in Committee about arrangements between LINks and the CQC. Although we want to encourage strong relationships between LINks and their key stakeholders, including the CQC, the CHRE and the OHPA, we do not believe that it is appropriate to dictate to those statutory and independent bodies the way in which they should involve LINks in inspections or consultations. I hope that, given our discussion, the hon. Member for Eddisbury (Mr. O'Brien) will withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="st_o238"><a name="08021823000080"><a name="80218-0014.htm_spnew5"><a name="08021823000568"><b>Mr. Stephen O'Brien:</b>
 Obviously, I listened carefully to the Minister&#146;s arguments, which are not unfamiliar to those of us who had the pleasure of serving in Committee.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o264"><a name="80218-0014.htm_para18"><a name="08021823000081">There is a need to recognise the theme of a long absence of understanding the issue at stake. When community health councils were axed, they were regarded by some as a nuisance, which probably means that they were doing their job. Some were not very good, but the vast majority were perceived as doing a good job. They were seen to be independent and therefore to be trusted by people who needed help when they felt most vulnerable and needed to have their hand held when charting their way through the confusing and labyrinthine process of NHS complaints.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o265"><a name="80218-0014.htm_para19"><a name="08021823000082">LINks are the ultimate successor bodies that we are now faced with. If we could feel that they were being given the necessary importance by being included in the Bill, it would seem that the Government were at last addressing the grave concern that so many of us have about the lack of importance and independence given to representing patients and their concerns, particularly  <br>

when things are going wrong with the NHS. Most often, those who have a concern about the NHS have a continuing need of it and are most anxious not to get offside with the very people from whom they think they need an immediate and expert public service. Taking the opportunity to demonstrate how much they are committed to patient and public involvement in that way would be the proper manner in which the Government could reflect that commitment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o266"><a name="80218-0014.htm_para20"><a name="08021823000083">The Government now have a real opportunity to pick up a policy that they have been urged to adopt, but which they again seem to be resisting, and which we have articulated at length elsewhere and now in a draft Bill&#151;I hope that I will be able to persuade the Minister and his colleagues to support the NHS accountability and autonomy Bill, in which we have a designed patient and public involvement system through HealthWatch, a good model that, despite the Minister&#146;s disparaging so far, I hope will be picked up.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o267"><a name="80218-0014.htm_para21"><a name="08021823000084">It is vital to recognise&#151;not least because the amendment was not just tabled by the official Opposition, but co-sponsored by Government Members and the Liberal Democrats&#146; spokesman&#151;that the House now has an opportunity to vote, with a heavy heart and some displeasure, against the Government for not seeking to pick up on a sensible, measured and appropriate way of handling such an essential issue. This is an opportunity to ensure that that is well understood in the Bill, and I shall therefore press my amendment to a Division.</p>

 The amendments will allow the Office of the Health Professions Adjudicator to appoint and use legally qualified chairs for panels hearing fitness to practise cases. The Bill as introduced provided for chairs to be chosen from either the lay or professional lists, with the panel having a legal assessor to advise on points of law. However, I thought that the evidence given to the Committee by Lady Justice Smith and the General Medical Council warranted further thought. Lady Justice Smith said that</p>
<a name="80218-0015.htm_brev1"><a name="08021827000105"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;there are many reasons why I think that we should have a legally qualified chair, the main one being that to do the job well requires legal expertise&#148;.</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o287"><a name="80218-0015.htm_para18"><a name="08021827000042">I therefore agreed in Committee to give careful consideration to that issue, with a view to bringing something back now. That is what these Government amendments represent, and I think that they are a good example of how the evidence-giving process is adding value to the system of parliamentary scrutiny.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o288"><a name="80218-0015.htm_para19"><a name="08021827000043">Essentially, the amendments require the OHPA to keep a list of chairs, which will include legally qualified chairs as well as lay and professional chairs. The OHPA will then have the flexibility to set out in rules when it will use legally qualified chairs. I am very clear that it would not be right for the Government to impose   <br>


<meta name="Date" content="18 Feb 2008">

legally qualified chairs for every case that the OHPA hears, when this is a relatively untried and untested route in this arena. Instead, the amendment gives the OHPA the option of using legally qualified chairs for as many cases as it thinks it appropriate. For example, the OHPA may set out in rules that all cases involving a high number of witnesses or likely to be particularly lengthy should have a legally qualified chair. However, the rules may also set out that in all cases where the health of the practitioner is the central issue, a lay or professional chair should be used.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o289"><a name="80218-0015.htm_para20"><a name="08021827000044">The essential point is that, although I agree that legally qualified chairs should be available to the OHPA, we do not think it right for the Government to prescribe exactly what kind of chair should be used in which circumstances. I would regard it as particularly inappropriate to require the OHPA to use legally qualified chairs in every case before they had been properly trialled and a decision made in the light of practical experience. I hope that Opposition Members will support the amendments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o290"><a name="80218-0015.htm_para21"><a name="08021827000045">Let me deal now with Opposition amendments Nos. 75, 82 to 85, 87, 89 and 90. I hope that the hon. Members who tabled those amendments will agree that the Government amendments very much achieve the same objective and so will feel content not to press their amendments. Amendment No. 85 appears to be designed to ensure that all panels should have a legally qualified chair in all cases. I apologise if I have misunderstood the purpose of the amendment, but it seems to be at cross purposes with amendment No. 82. I do not propose to detain the House by rehearsing my reasons for opposing the amendment, because I have already set out in speaking to the Government amendments why I do not believe it is right to impose legally qualified chairs in all cases.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o291"><a name="80218-0015.htm_para22"><a name="08021827000046">Amendments Nos. 75 and 87 would set in stone the requirement for legal chairs to have a 10-year general qualification, which is the same requirement as the General Medical Council currently uses for its legal assessors. However, the General Optical Council requirement for its legal assessors is a five-year general qualification. I am concerned about prescribing a narrow requirement on the face of the Bill, especially when I have tasked the &#147;Tackling Concerns Nationally&#148; working group under the chairmanship of Sir Ian Kennedy to consider the introduction of legal chairs and other such details. Ultimately, we believe that it should be for the OHPA to decide how best to run its fitness to practise panels within the framework set by Parliament, taking into account the recommendations of the working group. Rules covering the detail will be laid before Parliament and will be subject to the negative resolution procedure.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o292"><a name="80218-0015.htm_para23"><a name="08021827000047">Amendments Nos. 89 and 90 would require all health profession regulators using the civil standard of proof to have legal chairs or at least legal assessors in all cases. I remind the House that the majority of these regulators already use the civil standard. I am sure that Opposition Members do not want to push the whole swathe of regulators into the unknown. If the evidence pointed in such a direction, powers under section 60 of the Health Act 1999 could be used after appropriate consultation. As hon. Members are no doubt aware, a  <br>

section 60 order will be subject to the affirmative resolution procedure. On that basis, I hope that the Opposition will not press their amendments.</p>

 This group includes Government amendments as well as those tabled by my hon. Friends and by me. The amendments arose as a result of the evidence-taking sessions. As the Minister pointed out, they help to reinforce the value and benefit of such sessions. I welcome the beginnings of an important concession by the Government to the strength of our arguments on legally qualified chairs. I remind the House that the Committee divided on this matter in order to hold the Government&#146;s feet to the fire during the sitting.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o293"><a name="80218-0015.htm_para24"><a name="08021827000049">I shall not go over the arguments again at length, as they were covered more than adequately in the <i> Hansard</i> of Committee proceedings from column 372 onwards. However, the provisions on legally qualified chairs arose from recommendation 79 of the fifth report of Lady Justice Smith&#151;then Dame Janet Smith&#151;on the Shipman inquiry. She said:</p>
<a name="80218-0015.htm_brev3"><a name="08021827000107"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;In the event that the GMC retains control of the adjudication stage, it should appoint a number of legally qualified chairmen who should, as an experiment or pilot, preside over more complex FTP panel hearings. The results of the pilot scheme should be scrutinised to see whether there are benefits, whether in terms of the improved conduct of hearings, more consistent outcomes, improved reasons and/or fewer appeals.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o294"><a name="80218-0015.htm_para25"><a name="08021827000050">All hon. Members felt that there was extraordinarily impressive and persuasive oral evidence relating to effective chairmanship, speed of proceedings, a higher standard of reasoned decision and an ability to deal with the complexities of the civil standard of proof. That evidence can be seen in column 37 of the <i> Official Report </i>of Committee proceedings.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o295"><a name="80218-0015.htm_para26"><a name="08021827000051">It will not have escaped the notice of the House that one aspect of introducing the civil standard of proof in the hearings is the complexity of its administration as a matter of adjudication and law, not least in ensuring that justice is done and seen to be done. As I shall try to explain, it has variability within it, unlike what we used to call the criminal standard of proof, of being &#147;beyond all reasonable doubt&#148;, or as is more common nowadays, the standard of being &#147;sure&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o296"><a name="80218-0015.htm_para27"><a name="08021827000052">I am pleased that the Government have introduced proposals for a list including legally qualified persons. The Minister has outlined that point in speaking to Government amendment No. 23, which was a response, as he knows, to the demands we made in Committee at column 374 of <i> Hansard</i>. Nevertheless, I have to say that our amendments Nos. 82, 83 and 84 are a neater way of delivering what he has sought to achieve in Government amendment No. 23. That amendment is intended to supplant, from the Government&#146;s perspective, our amendments Nos. 82 to 84, so I believe that we should see these as a coupled set of arguments. I am pleased that the Government amendment was designed to draw on the arguments made in Committee, as reflected in the amendments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o297"><a name="80218-0015.htm_para28"><a name="08021827000053">A number of concerns remain, however, particularly about the application of the civil standard of proof, the speed of proceedings and the definition of &#147;legally qualified&#148;. On the standard of proof, the Bill moves fitness to practise panels away from the criminal and  <br>

towards the civil standard of proof. In layman&#146;s terms, it is a move from &#147;beyond reasonable doubt&#148; or being &#147;sure&#148; to a balance of probabilities. We debated that point in Committee, as is shown in column 395, but unresolved issues remain and it is right for us to bring them up again on Report.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o298"><a name="80218-0015.htm_para29"><a name="08021827000054">There seem to be good reasons for the use of the civil standard and few differences between the parties arose in Committee. Indeed, Opposition Members supported the Government, but we remain concerned about the lack of piloting, particularly with regard to doctors. That problem still needs to be dealt with. I hope those reflecting on the Bill as it goes to the other place will give that issue some further urgent and important consideration.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o299"><a name="80218-0015.htm_para30"><a name="08021827000055">The concern arises because a statutory application of the civil standard results in a common law interpretation on a sliding scale that is difficult to reflect on the statute book. Consequently, a doctor before a panel faces an ever-rising hurdle in attempting to clear his or her name. The civil standard of proof will not be applied uniformly across the board&#151;a very important point made by Lady Justice Smith in her evidence at column 38. This issue is important not just for the doctor, but for those sitting on the panels. They must have a clear understanding at the outset of what standard of proof on the balance of probabilities actually means on a sliding scale. Until they know the evidence, they cannot be sure of the standard of proof against which the truth must be tested. That is critical in the ultimate case where someone&#146;s livelihood is threatened and their fitness to practise questioned. There is a burden on adjudicators to ensure that their decisions are just and fair, made in a properly conducted way and, above all, not capable of being contested too easily by appeal. People must feel that the system is proper and fair to both parties when these very serious issues come before these panels.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o300"><a name="80218-0015.htm_para31"><a name="08021827000056">Another reason Lady Justice Smith gave for the use of legally qualified chairs was that it enabled hearings to be dispatched more quickly. We are all interested in securing efficiency and speed in such things, without causing any prejudice to the application of justice. She said:</p>
<a name="80218-0015.htm_brev4"><a name="08021827000108"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Legally qualified people who appear in front of such tribunals are capable of running rings around the tribunal if no one on the panel is legally qualified.&#148;<i> &#151;&#151;[Official Report, Health and Social Care Public Bill Committee, </i>8 January 2008; c. 37.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o301"><a name="80218-0015.htm_para32"><a name="08021827000057">The GMC, which has lobbied against the universal application of legally qualified chairs, has failed to answer that point&#151;something to which she also referred. She went on to say that while it is true that the broad quality of judgments currently made is indeed high&#151;I am in no way seeking to criticise the GMC for the conduct of its hearings and how it has trained people&#151;it would be better for all concerned if panels could be conducted no less thoroughly but more efficiently.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o302"><a name="80218-0015.htm_para33"><a name="08021827000058">It is with the issues of speed, efficiency and the application of the civil standard of proof in mind that we tabled amendment No. 85, which would make all fitness to practise panels subject to a legally qualified chair. Interestingly, to add substance to that point, page 4 of a document supplied by the Government themselves on 7 February in relation to professional  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="18 Feb 2008">

<notus-date day="18" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><b>18 Feb 2008 : Column 98</b><br>
regulation shows the cost of a three-person panel with a legally qualified chair for some fitness to practise cases and the cost of a three-person panel with a legal assessor for the remainder. Where legal chairs are used in 10 per cent. of fitness to practise cases, the estimate is &#163;2.565 million. If they are used in 25 per cent. of fitness to practise cases, the estimate is &#163;2.489 million, and it comes down to &#163;2.374 million if they are used in 50 per cent. of such cases. That helpful Department of Health document implies that if we used legal chairs in 100 per cent. of such cases, it would have the same trend in saving money and, as Lady Justice Smith would argue, in the increased dispatch, speed and efficiency of the cases. Therefore, the Department of Health itself has already laid out a good taxpayer value-for-money point on how it would be more efficient to use legally qualified chairs in all cases.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o303"><a name="80218-0015.htm_para34"><a name="08021827000059">I am disappointed that the Government are unwilling to define &#147;legally qualified&#148; in their amendment No. 30. Amendment No. 75 would help us to have that definition, and links to amendment No. 85, which would ensure that there is a qualified chair for all such cases. The Bill is in many regards a portmanteau Bill, with many of its powers devolved to rules and regulations. More than a quarter of the clauses relate to secondary legislation. It is perverse to leave to regulation what could easily be prescribed on the face of the Bill under the proper scrutiny of the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o304"><a name="80218-0015.htm_para35"><a name="08021827000060">The Bill contains a definition of &#147;legally qualified&#148; in paragraph 6 of schedule 6. Lady Justice Smith noted and commended that definition in oral evidence, at column 39. In Committee, my hon. Friend the Member for Rugby and Kenilworth (Jeremy Wright), who is not in the Chamber but has been assiduous in his attendance of our proceedings, made the excellent point that a legally qualified chairman would need not only legal experience but judicial experience. It is important to reflect on that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o305"><a name="80218-0015.htm_para36"><a name="08021827000061">Having taken considerable advice, I had hoped that as Government amendment No. 23 went some way to making a concession on the grounds that we have advanced, I would not have to oppose it. However, I wanted to put amendment No. 85 to the vote, because what it contains is right and many outside this place would like to see it tested. Unfortunately, I am told, on the advice of the Clerks, that I cannot do that, which is much to be regretted. Procedure has overwhelmed what is a fair point, which should be available for testing. However, having put that difficulty on the record, I hope that it will be seen by those in another place who are exercised by such things. Many of them regard themselves as legally qualified and as having judicial experience. They will think that it is important to envisage how these significant proceedings will work, because they could be vital to protect patients and the public.</p>

I have not practised for 19 years, but I did practise in the City of London for a number of years. I have no judicial experience, but I had considerable arbitration experience, which is of a judicial nature. What is interesting is that not only has one of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s colleagues sat on one of the GMC panels, but so has one of mine. My colleague is legally qualified; the other is not. That is not to say that either has done the job any worse than the other. On the contrary, they both did it well.</p>

 I do not want to enter into a dialogue. What matters is that plenty of people in another place will be very exercised by this issue, given that Lady Justice Smith gave important and compelling evidence in a most reasoned way. When we heard her evidence, hon. Members on both sides of the Committee were at one in thinking that it was impressive and compelling. She advanced the idea that there should be legally qualified chairs for the bodies. That is why it is important that we give the issue an airing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o306"><a name="80218-0016.htm_para0"><a name="08021827000066">Procedure does not enable us to vote separately on Government amendment No. 23 and amendment No. 85. Amendment No. 23 is only a partial solution. What it sets out is not mandatory; it simply says that there will be legally qualified persons on a list from which the chairman can be chosen. Amendment No. 85 would have made that mandatory. It would have given earnest to what Lady Justice Smith appeared to be advising in oral evidence, for which all Committee members were present. I therefore recognise that I have to place on the record, with my best efforts, a signal to those who will consider the Bill in another place. I know that this sort of issue has exercised them greatly in the past, and rightly so. I would be surprised if we do not have to deal with it again when the Bill comes back to the House with Lords amendments. I very much hope that it will be given a proper airing in the other place, and I expect them to find a way to achieve what procedurally I have not been allowed to do.</p>

I hope that that places on the record our position and that another place will achieve what we have not been able to achieve so far.</p>

 Most of what I want to say has been covered by the Minister and the hon. Member for Eddisbury (Mr. O'Brien). We have an interesting example of how the new evidence sessions have been useful. I cannot recall a single submission from the great and good in Second Reading briefings or the like on legally qualified chairs.

I think that that is right, because, as others have pointed out&#151;Lady Justice Smith has been quoted at length&#151;there are good reasons why legal chairs could make a difference. The costs bear that out as well. However, I was also quite taken with the Government&#146;s argument that a legally qualified chair may not be necessary in every case. What I do not think we teased out in enough detail in Committee is where the bar might be set. The document referred to by the hon. Member for Eddisbury gives costings for 20 per cent., 25 per cent. and 50 per cent.&#151;</p>

 I am not, as yet, entirely convinced that legal chairs are needed in 100 per cent. of cases. However, I think it a shame that the House&#146;s procedures prevent us from voting on both options, and I am fairly sure that the issue will arise again in another place.</p>

Amendment No. 23 is unlikely to be put to the vote because there is no opposition to it, but if it had been, I might well have supported it. If the matter returns to us, it would be helpful to be given a little more detail about what might and might not be considered appropriate for a legal chair. I appreciate that to an extent that may be in the hands of the profession and the OHPA, but when we are trying to pass legislation, a lack of clarity about the outcome is not always helpful.</p>

 As I am sure the House knows, the General Medical Council is a registered charity. Over time, other health regulators that may also be charities will come under the auspices of the OHPA, and will be required to pay a fee to that body. All registered charities have duties in relation to how they spend their income, and the GMC and other regulators are no exception, but the Bill contains provisions that directly affect the way in which the GMC should spend a significant proportion of its income, while leaving it little if any discretion in respect of how it does so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o327"><a name="80218-0016.htm_para21"><a name="08021827000094">Given that the OHPA&#146;s duties will mirror functions that already sit within the charitable body, the funding of a non-departmental public body such as the OHPA&#151;whose purpose is to uphold the standards of a health profession&#151;is clearly unlikely to fall outside the charitable remit. However, it would seem wrong to place a burden on the GMC or another regulator that might have the potential to jeopardise its charitable status without making it clear that that was not Parliament&#146;s intention.</p>

 As one who worked in the health service and had to deal with the GMC, I am astonished by the hon. Gentleman&#146;s argument. Surely he is not suggesting that, after Shipman, we should not change the rules.</p>

 I am not sure how closely the hon. Gentleman has been following the debate. He ought to know that, as has been repeatedly put on record, we have strongly supported a change in the rules. I am a little perplexed about how the question could even have entered his mind, but perhaps he has not been able to follow the Bill&#146;s progress as closely as his question might have merited. We have not voted against the Bill, and we welcome the changes. What I am talking about is charitable status, which I hope is deeply important to the hon. Gentleman. If the GMC is not a charitable body, there will be a series of consequences.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o328"><a name="80218-0016.htm_para22"><a name="08021827000097">Let me proceed with my argument. It may help to clarify any confusion that may have arisen in the hon. Gentleman&#146;s mind. The Government may argue that we should not bind the hands of the Charity Commission, a body that operates independently of Ministers, but there are clear precedents for such action in other legislation. For example, further and higher education corporations are designated charities under section 41 of the Teaching and Higher Education Act 1998, and common investment funds are classed as charities under section 24 of the Charities Act 1993. Amendment No. 81 is intended to prevent the operation of fees from introducing any ambiguity into the designation of the GMC as a registered charity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o329"><a name="80218-0016.htm_para23"><a name="08021827000098">As the Liberal Democrats tabled amendment No. 2, it will be for a Liberal Democrat Member to speak to it. The others are Government amendments. While most of them appear to be tidying-up measures, amendment No. 48 appears to disqualify hon. Members from sitting on OHPA adjudication panels. I do not believe that involvement with the GMC is prohibited by membership of the House of Commons, and I should be grateful if the Minister could explain what changes the Government  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="18 Feb 2008">

intend. If the answer is not satisfactory, I dare say that the matter will be pursued in another place, but, as the Minister must be aware, some Members are currently involved in the adjudication processes of the GMC.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o330"><a name="80218-0016.htm_para24"><a name="08021827000099">We also need to tackle the issue of the costs of the OHPA. I thank the Minister for furnishing us with the report on the costs that we had requested, although I was disappointed that we did not receive it before the Committee stage. I hope that he will be able to provide the independent report by financial advisers engaged by the GMC, which was supposed to be available at the end of January and which is mentioned in column 365 of the record of our Committee proceedings.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o331"><a name="80218-0016.htm_para25"><a name="08021827000100">The Government report divides the costs into three groups: set-up and transition costs for the GMC, other costs to be paid by the Department, and adjudication and running costs. The set-up costs, the Government finally reveal, will be about &#163;3 million to &#163;4 million over two years, but they are to be &#147;further refined&#148;. The other costs, such as those of High Court referrals or big cases, have not been estimated, and I should be grateful if the Minister could identify the nature of that liability. The adjudication costs are not expected to exceed the current GMC costs of around &#163;11.5 million. The running costs are not identified, which is odd, but the paper does identify a probable increase of between &#163;20 and &#163;30 per registrant per year. That would increase the General Medical Council registration to more than &#163;400 and that of the General Optical Council to almost &#163;200. A full GMC registration on the medical register is to rise to &#163;390 a year with effect from April this year, having been frozen at &#163;290 since 2002, and GOC registration stands at &#163;169 per annum. It also suggests running costs for the OHPA of about &#163;6 million per annum&#151;I hope that the Minister will be able to confirm that figure.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o332"><a name="80218-0016.htm_para26"><a name="08021827000101">We remain deeply unsatisfied about the independence of the OHPA. We have searched Government amendments for where the Minister might give assurances about the independence of its decision making, but as the organisation is created the Department will needlessly still have its hands all over its finances. That is neither necessary nor desirable. Concerns remain over the civil standard of proof, which we discussed earlier and the Government failed to address. We were also looking for permanent legally qualified chairs, but we have now assented to a different situation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o333"><a name="80218-0016.htm_para27"><a name="08021827000102">The Government must recognise that as the Bill progresses a full response is required on professional regulation and the impact that the practice of defensive medicine might have on our NHS, particularly financially&#151;I hope there will be time to provide that when the Bill is considered in another place. I am sure that the Minister recalls that this was one of the areas of greatest contention during oral evidence sessions, and I think all Members were concerned about the BMA presenting the idea that the new regime would create over-defensiveness. I do not wish to be too critical&#151;those giving that evidence must have thought that they were making representations on behalf of their members&#151;but we need to bottom out what has been expressed on behalf of doctors about the impact of what is going on in terms of defensive medicine because we do not want that, and I do not believe it is likely to be a trend or a consequence; I would not be able to support the Bill if I did. Although I do not  <br>

believe that to be the case, it is important to take such representations seriously and address them, rather than simply dismiss them out of hand. If necessary, we might have to appeal, through the BMA, to make sure that doctors are reassured that they need not be over-concerned about that. I have been getting the impression that the Minister might feel that that is a worthwhile point, which is good.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o334"><a name="80218-0016.htm_para28"><a name="08021827000103">The Government amendments on professional regulation would give the power through secondary legislation to impose a lay majority on the regulatory bodies.

 I shall start by speaking to Liberal Democrat amendment No. 2, which would make it a duty of the Council for Healthcare Regulatory Excellence to commission independent advice and information services to assist members of the public who have concerns about the fitness to practise of a health professional. One decision that might have to be made would be whether to report a concern to a regulatory body. If the decision was to go ahead with that, there would be a duty to provide help in reporting the concerns in an effective way, and if the matter were dealt with by the OHPA there would be a duty to support the member of the public through the process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o336"><a name="80218-0016.htm_para30"><a name="08021831000016">There is currently no service to inform members of the public of where to report concerns about health professionals or to help them do so. That is a great problem. Let us take the Shipman case as an example. The people who were directly affected by Shipman were not in a position to complain, but his mode of operation might have been slightly different and those who might have had concerns because they felt they were being targeted in some way would have been members of one of the most vulnerable groups in society. Many people who have reached the age of 60 do have the time and ability to deal with such things, but some of them, especially if they are not well and life is a bit of an effort, find it difficult to discover in our complicated society where they should go to get the help they need. There is therefore a feeling that many problems are not brought forward because people do not know how to do that; advice is patchy, and no support is available.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o337"><a name="80218-0016.htm_para31"><a name="08021831000017">Many stakeholders believe that this need should be met. There would have to be a cap on the system because we would not want there to be an open invitation for everybody to take advice, but provided that certain criteria are met this could provide a useful way of enabling people who would not otherwise bring complaints to bring them early, so that problems are nipped in the bud. This duty would be compatible with the CHRE&#146;s overall duty to serve patients and the public and promote excellence in health professional regulators.</p>

body should have that status, and I am interested to know what charitable works it performs, although that is a side issue. I have listened carefully to the comments of the hon.

 It may be helpful if I clarify that there are precedents elsewhere whereby, when a fee is exchanged of a substantial amount of a body&#146;s income, it is effectively a cost recovery or could even be regarded as a professional commercial transaction, because fees are paid for membership. It has not necessarily been as clear as it might have been that a body in that position can retain charitable status. In the case of other bodies, it has been felt necessary to specify that in the relevant legislation, to ensure that there is no danger to their charitable status. I feel that the GMC deserves to have equal assurance and equal respect paid to it.</p>

 Amendment No. 81 would provide that neither the making of fees regulations by the Secretary of State nor the payment of a fee to OHPA would affect the charitable status of the regulatory body. I hope to be able to reassure the hon. Member for Eddisbury (Mr. O'Brien). I can go into detail about what justifies the GMC&#146;s charitable status if the hon. Member for Romsey (Sandra Gidley) really wants me to, but perhaps I had better write to her. We are advised that it will not be affected. My officials have been in contact with the Charity Commission, which has indicated that the key issue is a body&#146;s charitable purpose. A requirement in law to make a payment to another body would not of itself cause a body to lose its charitable status, although it could be a relevant factor in assessing its purpose and whether it is for public benefit.

and other members of the public. That will allow the CHRE to promote and provide independent advice along the lines suggested in amendment No. 2, and to encompass the sentiment behind the amendment. We do not want to be too prescriptive regarding how the CHRE should carry out that objective, because it is important that it work in consultation with patients and the public to determine how best it can achieve it.

Although we have feedback about the group of patients involved and the provision for them, what can my hon.

 There are already mechanisms in place, as I am sure my hon. Friend would acknowledge, and it is important that they are sustained. I would encourage all patients and members of the public who have complaints to make to inform themselves of the formal complaints procedure and, if necessary, to escalate that. I also think that more could be done by health care providers to advertise and publicise the existence of complaints procedures. All too often, people are still not aware of their right to complain, where to go or how to escalate their complaints. The new Care Quality Commission and the other independent bodies that we are establishing in the Bill will need to address that as a priority. I hope that that reassures my hon. Friend.</p>

 I beg to move, That the Bill be now read the Third time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o378"><a name="80218-0018.htm_para23"><a name="08021831000068">I would like to begin by thanking hon. Members for their contributions in scrutinising and improving this Bill both in Committee and on the Floor of the House today. I think that the Bill benefited from the evidence-giving process&#151;a young but positive reform of the procedures of this House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o379"><a name="80218-0018.htm_para24"><a name="08021831000069">We are not here discussing one of the more controversial or hotly politically contested Bills. In fact, our deliberations have shown a broad consensus of support for the main provisions of the Bill&#151;the integration of the way we regulate health, including mental health and social care, and the modernisation of the way we regulate the medical professions. Central to this Bill is the aim of assuring safety and quality of care for all patients and service users.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o380"><a name="80218-0018.htm_para25"><a name="08021831000070">The establishment of a new independent, integrated regulator with enhanced powers to succeed the three existing bodies&#151;the new Care Quality Commission&#151;is both timely and right. Patients and service users expect  <br>

a comprehensive and seamless system of regulation that focuses on the quality and safety of services, rather than their setting.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o381"><a name="80218-0018.htm_para26"><a name="08021831000071">The Care Quality Commission will bring several improvements. First, it will bring a joined-up system of regulation for health and adult social care, and I emphasise the importance that we expect the new regulator to place on both areas. That joined-up approach has been welcomed by both sides of the House. Secondly, it will extend regulation to the provision of NHS services for the first time ever. Thirdly, the set of new enforcement and sanction powers, which were again broadly welcomed from both sides of the House, will enable the new commission to deal with unsafe practices, such as poor standards of cleanliness and hygiene. Finally, the commission will allow a flexible and proportionate approach to regulation. The Mental Health Act Commission&#146;s existing functions will be set, with some enhancement of the core of the new regulator&#146;s work. All hon. Members who have spoken have stressed the importance of the regulator&#146;s freedom to carry out its functions in the way that it sees fit, through arrangements that encourage its independence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o382"><a name="80218-0018.htm_para27"><a name="08021831000072">During our discussions on the Care Quality Commission we listened to the views expressed by Members on both sides of the House and, as we discussed earlier, we made a number of changes. We have clarified that the Care Quality Commission must have regard to those who represent the views of the public. We also listened to the points raised by the hon. Member for Romsey (Sandra Gidley), among others, about the need for the commission to publish its reports. That has always been the Government&#146;s intention, but we are happy to have put that beyond doubt by clarifying it further on the face of the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o383"><a name="80218-0018.htm_para28"><a name="08021831000073">As I mentioned earlier, we also intend to address the issue of the application of the Human Rights Act 1998 to health and social care when the Bill reaches the other place. On the regulation of health and social care professions, we have also listened carefully to the representations made, not least to those made by Lady Justice Smith, whose original reports on the Shipman murders helped to inform many of the changes that the Bill will bring about. We have tabled and agreed an amendment just now on the issue of legally qualified chairs for hearings of the new independent adjudicator. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o384"><a name="80218-0018.htm_para29"><a name="08021831000074">Of course, we fully scrutinised the parts of the Bill that we have not discussed today in Committee, including the health protection elements and the health in pregnancy grant. I am sure that those issues will be scrutinised carefully in another place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o385"><a name="80218-0018.htm_para30"><a name="08021831000075">By reforming health and social care regulation, and by introducing tough new sanctions as well as reforming professional regulation, the Bill puts safety and quality at the heart of the health and social care system.

 This portmanteau Bill is incredibly wide ranging in content and it leaves vast amounts to secondary legislation&#151;both things cause concern to the House in terms of proper parliamentary scrutiny.

points in another place. However, as the Minister rightly observed, the broad thrust of the Bill is right, even if it is not necessarily timely. That makes getting the detail correct even more important.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o386"><a name="80218-0018.htm_para31"><a name="08021837000002">We have sought many improvements, and we will no doubt seek more as the Bill goes on its way. We were grateful for the 12 sittings in Committee, which included some long sittings in order to bring proceedings to a close. We were able to time that almost to the minute so that both sides felt that the Committee had offered adequate consideration. That was the first time that I have been involved in a Committee of which that could be said.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o387"><a name="80218-0018.htm_para32"><a name="08021837000003">It was disappointing that the Government did not accept our full witness list for oral evidence, but both sides of the House will agree that that was a useful procedure for the Committee. I dare say that the model will be looked at further&#151;it is yet to be perfected. It is important that the witness list is not just a list of the Government&#146;s bidding&#151;it was not in our case.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o388"><a name="80218-0018.htm_para33"><a name="08021837000004">I pay tribute to my colleagues in the Committee, and not only to those on the Front Bench. My hon. Friend the Member for Guildford (Anne Milton) guided us through many parts of the Bill during the Committee. Those on the Benches behind me, including my hon. Friend the Member for Tiverton and Honiton (Angela Browning)&#151;[Hon. Members: &#147;Where are they?&#148;] My hon. Friends might not have expected Third Reading to begin at this hour and are not yet in their places, but they have certainly been in evidence for a great deal of the debate and have added a great deal of thought and sensitivity to our deliberations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o389"><a name="80218-0018.htm_para34"><a name="08021837000005">It was important to have the presence of my hon. Friend the Member for Preseli Pembrokeshire (Mr. Crabb) in Committee. Despite the Bill&#146;s significant ramifications for the devolved Administrations, he was the only MP in the Committee whose seat is in a devolved Administration. I also pay tribute to the way in which the Committee was chaired and to all the Clerks.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o390"><a name="80218-0018.htm_para35"><a name="08021837000006">We have won two important Government concessions. We are grateful for the fact that the Minister has if not bowed, then at least nodded to the force of our arguments on, first, the inclusion of a strong patient voice in the CQC. Despite our best efforts, the Government will not include LINks&#151;local involvement networks&#151;in the Bill. No doubt such efforts will continue in another place, and we urge the Government to reconsider. We are also glad that there is now scope for legally qualified chairs and that they will be piloted. However, we remain concerned, particularly given the application of the civil standard of proof, that their role should be universal. Again, I am sure that that debate will be continued in another place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o391"><a name="80218-0018.htm_para36"><a name="08021837000007">We have not been able to change the Government&#146;s mind on a number of issues. Obviously those issues will be pursued, particularly those that I raised earlier on Report in relation to HealthWatch. A clear function is required for the CQC, particularly given the concerns about its proposed governance structure. That is not merely a cosmetic legislative issue. The House has an opportunity&#151;indeed, I think that it has an obligation&#151;to send a very clear message to the new commission about what the House expects it to achieve, particularly given, as was agreed, the achievements of the bodies that it will succeed and especially as they were just getting into their stride in a way that was adding value.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o392"><a name="80218-0018.htm_para37"><a name="08021837000008">Independence and the complaints process remain concerns, as do the reviews and the general ability to give opinions on the basis of the evidence that has been gained and on the basis that visits must be properly maintained, particularly in relation to those who are detained under the mental health Acts.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o393"><a name="80218-0018.htm_para38"><a name="08021837000009">We have had useful debates on the extent to which human rights and a rights-based approach should be at the core of health and social care in particular. Again, such debates will continue, as will the discussion of malnutrition and the extent of professional regulation, which we have only just discussed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o394"><a name="80218-0018.htm_para39"><a name="08021837000010">Public health measures have not featured in today&#146;s discussions, although they have been scrutinised with care and determination by my hon. Friend the Member for Guildford. That needs to be placed on record. Although we broadly welcome such measures towards appropriate legislation to deal with modern-day contingencies, we and others, including the organisation Liberty, remain concerned about the length and reporting of detention under such powers. We hope that the Government will introduce in another place the relevant draft regulations and examples of instances where such legislation might be necessary and that there will be an opportunity to discuss the amendments that we were unable to touch on today. The Government may well want to reflect on those issues, and we might need to consider them again if they come back as Lords amendments, even Government Lords amendments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o395"><a name="80218-0018.htm_para40"><a name="08021837000011">The health in pregnancy grant is another area that we have not touched on today. It is therefore appropriate to use Third Reading to highlight the grant, which was discussed at length in Committee. It is an important part of the Bill. Indeed, the Government have made much of what they are seeking to do with the health in pregnancy grant. Unfortunately, although we used an extensive series of arguments, backed by evidence, we never managed to get the Government to accept that there was a better way to approach the benefits that are sought with the grant. Ours is a different way from that proposed by the Government. I encourage hon. Members to read column 455 of the report of the proceedings in Committee. Quite rightly, it would be inappropriate to repeat those arguments now, but the Government need to put more thought into the grant, because the evidence base does not support what the Prime Minister and the Government are pursuing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o396"><a name="80218-0019.htm_para0"><a name="08021837000012">Most telling was the Minister&#146;s admission that the nutritional benefits of a cash payment are better in early pregnancy&#151;we entirely agree with that, of course&#151;although the Prime Minister, then the Chancellor, announced at the outset that support was needed in the last months of pregnancy, on the basis that nutrition is most important then. Not only was the Prime Minister wrong, but answers to parliamentary questions suggest that the Minister was initially wrong as well. The change made during the proceedings in Committee was a fair reflection of the evidence. All of us who have looked at the issue carefully&#151;particularly women, who are the ones most affected by such issues&#151;recognise that, when focused on the health of the to-be-born child, the most important time for nutrition to be right is both pre-conception and in the  <br>

I hope that many of our debates will flag up the areas on which those preparing for such scrutiny will need to focus their attention. I also hope that the arguments that we have tried to make will help their deliberations.</p>

The proposed CHRE membership is far too small for the council effectively to reflect the diversity and breadth of views in a sector employing 2 million people and stretching across four countries.

<p><a name="stpa_o414"><a name="80218-0019.htm_para18"><a name="08021837000032">I should like to conclude by talking generally about the Care Quality Commission. The Liberal Democrats supported the principle of the commission three years ago. As the Minister said earlier, we were asking the Government, &#147;Why do you not do this now?&#148; Both the Healthcare Commission and the Commission for Social Care Inspection are starting to perform well. Although I support the principle of joined-up administration and regulation, there are genuine concerns about how the transition should be handled. In the changeover, we should not lose the efficiency and effectiveness of the two organisations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o415"><a name="80218-0019.htm_para19"><a name="08021837000033">We already know that the transition costs are likely to be &#163;140 million. What concerns me more is the massive disruption to the two organisations and the staff involved. At this point, it is pertinent to reflect on Ian Kennedy&#146;s statement for the Public Bill Committee:</p>
<a name="80218-0019.htm_brev2"><a name="08021837000041"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;What we will see will be a period of flux: senior staff will need to be recruited and then appoint others; managers will be organising &#145;away-days&#146; and locked in meetings over organisational design and conditions of employment, instead of meeting the accelerating demands and expectations of patients. Morale in existing organisations will be increasingly hard to sustain. Good members of staff are already leaving, taking with them the knowledge that it has taken three years to develop.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o416"><a name="80218-0019.htm_para20"><a name="08021837000034">The issue is a concern to us all. The memory of the organisation of PCTs is still fresh: there was a period of stasis in many areas, while people, rightly, fretted about their jobs and reorganised. That put a halt to some parts of what the Government were trying to achieve.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o417"><a name="80218-0019.htm_para21"><a name="08021837000035">We must not make the same mistake with this reorganisation. Much has yet to be decided by secondary legislation, so there is still great uncertainty. All the people who work in the field and are likely to work for the new commission need as much certainty as possible as early in the process as possible. To deny that certainty would have a knock-on effect on patients and the public.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o418"><a name="80218-0019.htm_para22"><a name="08021837000036">It is probably worth reminding the House of Ian Kennedy&#146;s concluding remarks:</p>

There will be continued scrutiny in the other place, and we may yet see aspects of the Bill come back. I give a cautious welcome to the Bill but seek reassurances that some of these concerns will be addressed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o422"><a name="80218-0019.htm_para26"><a name="08021840000017">A positive, informative and impressive piece of evidence came from Dame Janet Smith, who spoke about the need for legally qualified chairs to help in the restoration of public confidence in the procedure for making complaints about doctors. She made a powerful case. I am pleased that my hon. Friend the Minister recognised that there was a case to be made, as we all did in Committee. I was saddened slightly by a recent article in one of the national newspapers from the GMC that seemed to be still arguing against the reform process. That is a bit of a hangover from the GMC&#146;s previous position. It has recognised that reform is necessary, but it is slightly unhelpful that it is still clinging on to former glories as that reform moves on.</p>

I welcome that grant, and from listening to the evidence, it seemed that one could make a case for giving the grant to help a prospective mother at any stage of pregnancy. The Minister gave evidence, which I found credible and persuasive, that that stage should be located at the point set out in the Bill. Prospective mothers will know that they will benefit from the health in pregnancy grant at the 26-week stage, and by accessing the grant, they can access help and information about diet and other factors. That is a good thing and it will help less prepared mothers to look after their children. Once the grant becomes well known, mothers will know that they can get money at that time, and take it into account for their budget during the entire pregnancy. That deals with the point&#151;and the criticism&#151;that it could be done at some other time. In some ways, it does not matter when the money arrives as long as the prospective mother knows that it is coming. It helps to spread the load.</p>

 I thank Mr. Speaker for granting me the debate. The case that I am raising relates to an individual constituent, Mrs. Susan Hurrell, who I believe has been the victim of a major injustice at the hands of Scottish Provident. I do so with her agreement and the issue is not subject to any form of legal proceedings. I shall briefly explain the unfortunate series of events that led up to the debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o437"><a name="80218-0020.htm_para10"><a name="08021840000448">Mrs. Hurrell came to see me at my Friday surgery in January 2007. I was so concerned by what she told me that, in an attempt to resolve the issue, I wrote to Scottish Provident, offering to meet its representatives. Unfortunately, for reasons best known to themselves, they chose not to take up that offer. Since my initial letter of January 2007, numerous additional letters from my constituent and from me have not brought about a satisfactory and just resolution. Unfortunately, referring the case to the ombudsman also failed to bring about the desired result.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o438"><a name="80218-0020.htm_para11"><a name="08021840000449">In October 2003, Mr. and Mrs. Hurrell took out a life assurance mortgage policy. Sadly, some 14 months later, in December 2004, Mrs. Hurrell was diagnosed as being terminally ill with stage 3 category C ovarian cancer. She was told that she had only a few months to live. Once my constituent and her husband had come to terms with the shock of that, they contacted Scottish Provident by telephone to inform them of Mrs. Hurrell&#146;s medical condition and to request a claim form. Their first telephone contact with Scottish Provident was made in December 2004, and they were extremely surprised to be informed that they did not have terminal illness cover and that it would not be possible for them to make a claim except in the event of death. They were both devastated by that advice, as they were convinced that the cover was an important part of the policy. I am sure that that undoubtedly added to the worry and distress that they were already suffering.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o439"><a name="80218-0020.htm_para12"><a name="08021840000450">A few weeks later, in January 2005, Mr. Hurrell telephoned Scottish Provident to check that the information he had been given was correct. They were again advised that it was not possible for them to make a claim as they did not have terminal illness cover. It is worth noting at this juncture that the telephone calls made in both December 2004 and January 2005 were made well within the 13-week claim period allowed to submit a claim. If Scottish Provident had accepted at that stage that Mrs. Hurrell had terminal illness cover, the claim could have been submitted, considered and determined. In the words of Mrs. Hurrell:</p>
<a name="80218-0020.htm_brev6"><a name="08021840000480"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;As Scottish Provident is a reputable company, we took this advice as correct and did not question it further.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o440"><a name="80218-0020.htm_para13"><a name="08021840000451">Mrs. Hurrell underwent emergency surgery and a heavy course of chemotherapy. Against all the medical odds, she survived and, although very ill, is alive today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o441"><a name="80218-0020.htm_para14"><a name="08021840000452">Some 20 months after Mrs. Hurrell was diagnosed as being terminally ill, she and her husband received a letter from their mortgage company about the renewal of their mortgage protection plan. Mrs. Hurrell contacted the company, advising it that she would require a quotation without her name on the policy. Understandably, she  <br>

was asked why she did not want her name to be on it. When she explained her circumstances, the staff member at the mortgage company was surprised and, having checked the policy, advised her that she was indeed covered for terminal illness and should contact Scottish Provident immediately.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o442"><a name="80218-0020.htm_para15"><a name="08021840000453">On 19 September 2006, Mrs. Hurrell rang Scottish Provident about the advice given in December 2004 and January 2005. The lady to whom she spoke was extremely apologetic about the advice, and said that she would send a claim form without delay. She then asked Mrs. Hurrell when she had been diagnosed. Having given the date of the diagnosis, Mrs. Hurrell was told, &#147;Sorry, you are too late. You had to die within the first 12 months.&#148; Apart from anything else, that was a terribly callous statement. However on 23 September 2006, Mrs. Hurrell received a letter from Scottish Provident apologising for the incorrect advice and confirming that terminal illness cover was included in death benefit. Enclosed in the letter was a claim form and a request that it be returned along with the original policy document. If the claim could then proceed, Scottish Provident would contact the relevant doctors.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o443"><a name="80218-0020.htm_para16"><a name="08021840000454">After numerous letters from Scottish Provident indicating that it was awaiting a response from Mrs. Hurrell&#146;s consultant, a further letter arrived on 5 January 2007 notifying Mrs. Hurrell of the failed outcome of her terminal illness claim. It stated:</p>
<a name="80218-0020.htm_brev7"><a name="08021840000481"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Our definition of terminal illness against which your claim was assessed requires that life expectancy is no greater than twelve months.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o444"><a name="80218-0020.htm_para17"><a name="08021840000455">It is also worth noting that Mr. Naik, a consultant gynaecologist and oncologist based at Queen Elizabeth hospital in Gateshead, had written to Scottish Provident on 27 November 2006 stating:</p>
<a name="80218-0020.htm_brev8"><a name="08021840000482"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;I can confirm that when Mrs. Hurrell originally presented to us with her diagnosis of ovarian cancer she was in a desperate condition requiring emergency surgery, following which she had a number of severe complications. Her life expectancy at that time was certainly less than twelve months&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o445"><a name="80218-0020.htm_para18"><a name="08021840000456">To me it is abundantly clear that when she made the initial contact with Scottish Provident in December 2004 and January 2005, Susan&#146;s condition was such that she met the requirements of the policy: that is, life expectancy was no greater than 12 months. Consequently, in my opinion she should have been paid in full.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o446"><a name="80218-0020.htm_para19"><a name="08021840000457">Susan wrote complaining about the decision, and received a response on 23 January 2007 telling her that she had not informed the company within the required 13-week period, and that the medical information did not support her claim. Given that Scottish Provident had written to her four months earlier apologising for the fact that she had been given incorrect advice about terminal illness cover, it seems strange that it should now say that she had not informed it within 13 weeks. In fact, she had informed it twice. The letter from Mr. Naik, her consultant, was devastatingly clear: she would not survive for 12 months. How can the company possibly claim that there is no medical evidence to support the claim?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o447"><a name="80218-0020.htm_para20"><a name="08021840000458">The chief medical officer for Scottish Provident said that, in any event, the company would have waited to discover the outcome of the surgery and chemotherapy before deciding whether to meet the claim. Surely the main reason for taking out terminal illness cover is to enable people to put their finances in order before they  <br>

die, and payment should consequently be made as soon as the prognosis of life expectancy of less than 12 months has been delivered. If it was normal practice to defer an assessment of terminal illness until after the response to chemotherapy was known, the company was in effect waiting for a person to die within the 12 months before paying out. Why on earth then are people paying the extra for terminal illness cover? If the company is delaying claims of that nature by more than 12 months, it is doing so deliberately to deny customers their rightful payments. It would be interesting to know how often Scottish Provident has applied that practice, and how many claimants have been denied terminal illness payments as a result. It is worth noting also that the basis of Mrs. Hurrell&#146;s claim was the medical assessment of Mr. Naik, who is an eminent consultant. The basis of Scottish Provident&#146;s case is not what it did, but what it said it might have done at the time; it is based purely on hindsight. If the claim had been accepted, Mr. and Mrs. Hurrell would have been entitled to receive a lump sum benefit of &#163;60,000. Instead, she was offered &#163;150 for her distress and inconvenience.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o448"><a name="80218-0020.htm_para21"><a name="08021840000459">Subsequently, Mrs. Hurrell sought the assistance of the financial services ombudsman. Unfortunately, that was without success, as the adjudicator concluded that she could not recommend that the complaint be upheld. As part of her findings, the adjudicator stated:</p>


<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080218/debtext/80218-0021.htm"/>


<a name="80218-0021.htm_brev0"><a name="08021840000483"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;I believe that it would have been reasonable for Scottish Mutual to await your response to treatment at the time&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o449"><a name="80218-0021.htm_para0"><a name="08021840000460">I am both bitterly disappointed and amazed at that finding. In my view, to defer an assessment of terminal illness until after treatment is contrary to Scottish Provident&#146;s own stipulation, which states that someone must be suffering from a terminal illness with a life expectancy of less than 12 months as diagnosed by the attending consultant. It is my view that Scottish Provident, backed by the ombudsman, is deliberately breaking the rule and spirit of its own policy, as nowhere does it state it must wait and see.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o450"><a name="80218-0021.htm_para1"><a name="08021840000461">The UK insurance industry is the largest in Europe and the third largest in the world. I am not suggesting that this case in any way reflects on an industry that rightly prides itself on the quality of its products. I hope that this case is a rarity and no one else has had to suffer what Mrs. Hurrell has gone through.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o451"><a name="80218-0021.htm_para2"><a name="08021840000462">Scottish Provident is the brand name of Scottish Mutual Assurance Ltd. On its website it describes itself as one the leading providers of life, terminal illness, income protection and unemployment cover. It states that it has a track record that can be trusted, concluding with the statement that since 1996 it has consistently paid out on claims. This certainly is not the case for Mrs. Hurrell. Frankly, the company has behaved disgracefully by first misinforming Mr. and Mrs. Hurrell that they were not covered&#151;it did that not once, but twice&#151;and then refusing to pay what was an entirely legitimate claim and offering an insulting &#163;150 for her distress and inconvenience, instead of paying out the &#163;60,000 she was entitled to.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o452"><a name="80218-0021.htm_para3"><a name="08021840000463">Mrs. Hurrell&#146;s situation is not good. The disease returned some months ago and she has been very ill. This has been an extremely traumatic period for Mrs. Hurrell and I cannot help but believe that the anxiety, distress and pressure that she has had to deal with as a result of the dispute with Scottish Provident  <br>

will have had a detrimental effect on her health. When Mr. and Mrs. Hurrell took out the terminal illness cover, they will have hoped that it was a claim they would never have to make. Sadly, that proved not to be the case. It appears as if Scottish Provident has been determined to prevent this claim from being successful. However, even at this 11th hour I hope that Scottish Provident will take positive action to resolve this claim in favour of Mrs. Hurrell. I also request that my hon. Friend examines the regulations pertaining to insurance companies with a view to ensuring that there is greater clarity and protection for customers and preventing insurance companies from taking advantage of the often ambiguous wording of their policies. Mr. and Mrs. Hurrell did everything responsibly, including ensuring that they had adequate insurance cover. I ask my hon. Friend the Minister to join me in calling on Scottish Provident to pay Mr. and Mrs. Hurrell, even at this late date, the full amount of the policy that they are entitled to.</p>

 I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Wansbeck (Mr. Murphy) on securing this debate on an extremely important and particular case&#151;he outlined it in great detail&#151;that also gives rise to general issues regarding the way that insurance is regulated.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o453"><a name="80218-0021.htm_para4"><a name="08021840000465">I want to start by saying how sorry I am to hear of Mrs. Hurrell&#146;s illness, which on its own must have made the past few years incredibly difficult. I am sure that the frustrations, which my hon. Friend has outlined, with her insurance policy and with the Financial Ombudsman Service have only added to her distress. I certainly hope that the company has been listening extremely carefully to my hon. Friend tonight.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o454"><a name="80218-0021.htm_para5"><a name="08021840000466">What happened to Mrs. Hurrell demonstrates that although insurance is a hugely important product that can provide customers with peace of mind as well as financial protection, it can also be complex. It is important that all customers know what they are buying, and that they are appropriately informed by the professional services that the insurance industry brings to bear on products that it has sold. This is one reason why the Government replaced the confusing collection of financial service regulators, complaint adjudicators and compensation schemes that we inherited in 1997 with the Financial Services Authority, the financial services compensation scheme and the Financial Ombudsman Service.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o455"><a name="80218-0021.htm_para6"><a name="08021840000467">The FSA is now responsible for the regulation of the insurance industry and has laid down detailed rules on all aspects of the conduct of business of regulated firms. In a constantly evolving market, however, as my hon. Friend demonstrated, rules-based regulation can often lag behind new products or circumstances. That is why the FSA is moving toward more principle-based regulation, instead of specifying detailed processes to be performed. This means being clear about the required regulatory outcomes, and then using supervision and enforcement to ensure that they are achieved. The new, simplified conduct-of-business rules that the FSA published in November, and for the insurance sector specifically in January, take this approach. That does not mean that the rules have been relaxed, however. The FSA also took the opportunity to require firms to take reasonable  <br>

steps to establish that customers would be eligible to make a claim under a particular policy, and to ensure better standards of disclosure, so that consumers can make more informed decisions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o456"><a name="80218-0021.htm_para7"><a name="08021840000468">This approach is also reinforced by the general principle that firms must treat customers fairly. Obviously, firms should be doing that already, and I will leave it for others to judge what has happened in this instance, but by the end of the year, firms will have to be able to demonstrate to themselves and to the FSA that they are consistently treating their customers fairly. In particular, they will need to demonstrate that customers are provided with clear information and kept appropriately informed before, during and after the point of sale, and that any advice is suitable and takes account of their circumstances. Again, whether this has been achieved in this very difficult instance is for other people to judge.</p>

I think it best, given the information that my hon. Friend has put before the House tonight, if I invite him to write to me with more details and specific dates. I will certainly refer this case to Hector Sants, the FSA&#146;s chief executive,  <br>

I also want to write to the Association of British Insurers&#146; director-general, drawing attention to this case and asking him to take Mrs. Hurrell&#146;s experience into account when the industry reviews, in the 12-month period to 2009, the definition of &#147;terminal illness&#148; that is used across the whole insurance industry, to see whether changes can be made that might make the definition more understandable for everybody concerned.</p>
