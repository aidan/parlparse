<h4 align=center>The Secretary of State was asked&#151;</h4>

<a name="41021-01_sbhd0"><h4 align=center>Fly-tipping</h4>


<p>1. <a name="41021-01_wqn0"><b> Dr. Julian Lewis  (New Forest, East)</b> 
 (Con): What assessment she has made of the impact of fly-tipping on <i>(a)</i> local authorities and <i>(b)</i> businesses.  [192818]
</p>


<p><a name="41021-01_spmin0"><b>The Minister for Rural Affairs and Local Environmental Quality  (Alun Michael): </b> 
 The Environment Agency estimates that fly-tipping costs public authorities and landowners between &#163;100 million and &#163;150 million a year.
</p>





<p><a name="41021-01_spnew0"><b> Dr. Lewis: </b> 
 The shadow Secretary of State said that a Conservative Government would make fly-tipping an arrestable offence. Will the Government do likewise, or are they once again all talk and no action?
</p>





<p><a name="41021-01_spnew1"><b> Alun Michael: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman should apply that description to his party, given the sound and fury that we hear from it, with little positive to note. The Government have acted to strengthen the powers available to local authorities, including, under the Anti-social Behaviour Act 2003, the ability to stop, search and seize vehicles suspected of fly-tipping. That enables action to be taken on the spot. We are also taking steps to increase the penalties. It is easy for Opposition Members to come up with absurd suggestions when they know that they will not be in power for many years to come.
</p>





<p><a name="41021-01_spnew2"><b> Mr. David Drew  (Stroud)</b> 
 (Lab/Co-op): As much as action depends on the ability of local authorities and business to respond, the key influence on them will be the consumer or, more specifically, people living in the local area, and I commend Mrs. Elizabeth Hall of Harescombe in my constituency, who has led a community action against fly-tippers. Can we be assured that when the community gets together and makes its points, all the agencies will respond to it, especially the Environment Agency, which has promised to deliver but has yet to do so?
</p>





<p><a name="41021-01_spnew3"><b> Alun Michael: </b> 
 We have put in place the Flycatcher scheme, which provides information. In the coming months, we will provide for the first time a national picture of the extent of the problem.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>21 Oct 2004 : Column 1002</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="41021-01_para0">
My hon. Friend is right that information enabling the authorities to catch those who are guilty of fly-tipping, especially those who do it repeatedly and who make a profit out of it by not properly disposing of the by-product of their business, is one step that needs to be taken. The measures that we have put in place in antisocial behaviour legislation enable action to be taken. If individuals are caught fly-tipping, exchanging information and using our system to ensure that we catch those who are doing it persistently, while ensuring that fines are applied to them and that they are imprisoned if appropriate, is the way forward.
</p>





<p><a name="41021-01_spnew4"><b> Mr. Peter Luff  (Mid-Worcestershire)</b> 
 (Con): The Minister may know from letters that I have written to his Department that I have a particularly sharp fly-tipping problem in the Bredicot and Spetchley areas of my constituency on the edge of Worcester city. Will he use any opportunity he has to remind rural police forces of the need to give a priority to such a situation, and also, within the proper limits of his powers, to encourage magistrates and others to hand down draconian sentences as part of the considerable powers that they have available?
</p>





<p><a name="41021-01_spnew5"><b> Alun Michael: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman is right to point to the powers available to magistrates, and we encourage them to take environmental offences seriously. Much work is being done with the Magistrates Association to increase awareness of the impact of environmental offences on local communities.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41021-01_para1">
As for police priorities, I suspect that the hon. Gentleman, like many others, has a number of things that he wants regarded as priorities. We are trying to improve the way in which the Environment Agency, local authorities and others work together to tackle such offences.
</p>





<p><a name="41021-01_spnew6"><b> Ms Joan Walley  (Stoke-on-Trent, North)</b> 
 (Lab): Will my right hon. Friend send out a strong message to North Staffordshire that we will not tolerate fly-tipping? Will he hold talks with the Environment Agency to see whether we could be a pilot area for a targeted carrot-and-stick approach that improves public awareness of whether we are dealing properly with waste while making it clear to those who do not do so that we will come down on them like a ton of bricks? <i>[Laughter.]</i>
</p>





<p><a name="41021-01_spnew7"><b> Alun Michael: </b> 
 I am happy to give my hon. Friend that assurance. Unlike Opposition Members, who are all noise and sound and fury, we are tackling the problems, and we want them tackled in every area. If she has suggestions about extra activities that could be piloted, I would be interested to hear from her and her councillors about ideas that would help to enhance even further the steps that the Government are taking.
</p>




<a name="41021-01_sbhd1"><h4 align=center>Waste Management</h4>


<p>3. <a name="41021-01_wqn1"><b> Mr Andrew Mackay  (Bracknell)</b> 
 (Con): If she will make a statement on the Government&#039;s waste management policy.  [192821]
</p>


<p><a name="41021-01_spmin1"><b>The Minister for the Environment and Agri-environment  (Mr. Elliot Morley): </b> 
 The Government&#039;s strategy on waste is set out in &quot;Waste Strategy 2000&quot;, 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>21 Oct 2004 : Column 1003</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>published in May 2000. The Government outlined further plans in May 2003 in response to the Prime Minister&#039;s strategy unit report, &quot;Waste not, want not&quot;. The Government are committed to reviewing their strategy on waste in 2005.
</p>





<p><a name="41021-01_spnew8"><b> Mr. Mackay: </b> 
 Is not the simple truth that the Government have signed up to a number of EU directives with great gusto, which means that there are 4 million tonnes of hazardous waste in the United Kingdom with nowhere to go? Is that not a disgrace?
</p>





<p><a name="41021-01_spnew9"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 If it were true, it would be, but of course it is not. The Government are committed to moving to a sustainable method of waste disposal and treatment. That entails minimising the amount of waste going into landfill, which is not sustainable in the long term. There is enough capacity to deal with hazardous waste in this country, and I am glad to say that the latest figures show that the amount going into landfill has declined appreciably.
</p>





<p><a name="41021-01_spnew10"><b> Ms Julia Drown  (South Swindon)</b> 
 (Lab): I and many on Swindon borough council are keen to help achieve the Government&#039;s recycling targets. In terms of pounds per tonne recycled, the council does very well, but a number of its bids to increase waste recycling still further have been refused by the Government. Will my hon. Friend have a word with his officials to see whether they could discuss with the council what more could be done to recycle more in Swindon, which might involve more Government support for projects?
</p>





<p><a name="41021-01_spnew11"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 The Government have made more than &#163;100 million available to local councils in the past year to encourage the introduction of more recycling facilities. The Government are always willing to talk to local authorities that have not been successful in a particular bid. The amount of money made available through the environment and cultural services block for waste treatment and disposal has been increased for all local authorities, but we are willing to give individual feedback to assist local authorities with future bids.
</p>





<p><a name="41021-01_spnew12"><b> Miss Anne McIntosh  (Vale of York)</b> 
 (Con): I pay tribute to the Minister&#039;s knowledge and experience, but he has failed in his first duty, which is to be prepared. He has had years of warning that, under the new EU landfill directive, co-disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous waste is no longer possible. It is absolutely true that there are 4 million tonnes of hazardous waste this year with nowhere to go. What message does that give industry and the waste management industry, which have not been given sufficient time to prepare?
</p>





<p><a name="41021-01_spnew13"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 I am sorry that the Opposition seem to have convinced themselves that there is some kind of hazardous waste mountain. There is not. There are not 4 million tonnes of hazardous waste with nowhere to go. The great predicted crisis has not happened. The facilities are adequate. The bulk of hazardous waste&#151;about 60 per cent.&#151;is contaminated soil. There is much more treatment on site now, which is what we wanted to encourage. The hon. Lady should be congratulating the Government on reducing the amount of hazardous 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>21 Oct 2004 : Column 1004</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>waste going into landfill and increasing the amount that is remediated, treated and reduced in a much more sustainable way.
</p>





<p><a name="41021-01_spnew14"><b> Andrew Bennett  (Denton and Reddish)</b> 
 (Lab): Can my hon. Friend explain the logic of the Government signing up to EU directives on the end use of motor cars and other electrical goods, yet not requiring drinks manufacturers to take back their cans and bottles?
</p>





<p><a name="41021-01_spnew15"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 There has been a big increase in the number of cans and bottles being recycled. The recycled material from cans, particularly aluminium cans, fetches extremely good prices at present. We want to see more of that. Producer obligations do apply to packaging, but the bulk of bottles and cans are bought by consumers through retail outlets, so we have to consider ways of encouraging recycling through domestic waste. I am glad to say that the recycling rate nationally has increased from 6 per cent. in 1997 to an estimated 18 per cent. currently.
</p>





<p><a name="41021-01_spnew16"><b> Norman Baker  (Lewes)</b> 
 (LD): Is it not a disgrace that, in round figures, we recycle 0 per cent. of household batteries, whereas the EU directive will require us to recycle 44 per cent., and the only site in the country for recycling such batteries, which is in Bristol, is being decommissioned? What is the Government&#039;s strategy for ensuring that we meet the EU target of 44 per cent., or will we have a battery mountain, along with the fridge mountain and the car mountain?
</p>





<p><a name="41021-01_spnew17"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 With respect, the Liberal Democrats are working hard on some kind of mountain. The battery mountain is a smallish one. In relation to the overall waste streams, it is a very small part. That is not to say that it is not important. We want to see more recycling of batteries. Car batteries have a high recycling rate in this country, but for domestic batteries&#151;small batteries&#151;it is true that the figures are low. Facilities are being established in the UK. The hon. Gentleman will have seen recent parliamentary answers from me on the subject. We want to encourage a greater rate of household battery recycling, and we will do that as part of the increase in recycling that is taking place all over the country.
</p>





<p><a name="41021-01_spnew18"><b> Jonathan Shaw  (Chatham and Aylesford)</b> 
 (Lab): My hon. Friend rightly said that he wants to encourage recycling. Does he agree with the paper industry that the quality of recycling is important, particularly when it involves doorstep collection? We have seen increases in weight, but we want to see increases in quality so that the paper industry can use the product to benefit itself and UK plc.
</p>





<p><a name="41021-01_spnew19"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 I know that my hon. Friend has close connections with the paper industry and is a strong advocate for it. I am glad to say that 100 per cent. of all newsprint in this country is now recycled, which is a significant achievement. Local authorities are aware that quality is important in collecting paper for recycling, which has not always been the case, because paper has in the past been inadvertently contaminated. We have drawn the issue to the attention of local authorities, which can maximise the sum that they get for paper by maintaining quality.

<a name="41021-02_sbhd0"><h4 align=center>Fallen Stock</h4>


<p>4. <a name="41021-02_wqn0"><b> Nick Harvey  (North Devon)</b> 
 (LD): What assessment she has made of the impact of the delay in the introduction of the national fallen stock collection scheme.  [192822]
</p>


<p><a name="41021-02_spmin0"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs  (Mr. Ben Bradshaw): </b> 
 None. My officials and the board of the National Fallen Stock Company have concentrated their time and resources on getting the scheme right and getting it started. I am pleased to announce to the House today that the scheme will begin on 22 November.
</p>





<p><a name="41021-02_spnew0"><b> Nick Harvey: </b> 
 I welcome that announcement and hope that the scheme will actually happen this time. The National Fallen Stock Company has given biosecurity advice to both collectors and farmers. What is the legal status of that advice to farmers, how will it be enforced and how will remote areas in which cover is inadequate be regulated?
</p>





<p><a name="41021-02_spnew1"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman must wait for the announcement of the details of the fallen stock scheme before he gets a full answer, and I shall write to him about it. The rules must be enforced, because biosecurity is important and is high on the list of farmers&#039; concerns. The National Fallen Stock Company is confident that the national network of collectors will cover even remote parts of the country, which should not pose too much of a biosecurity problem.
</p>





<p><a name="41021-02_spnew2"><b> David Taylor  (North-West Leicestershire)</b> 
 (Lab/Co-op): I congratulate the Minister on the time, effort and ingenuity that he and his officials have put into the scheme. Rather than listening to the continual carping from Opposition parties who claim to speak for farmers, let us listen to the National Farmers Union. Does the Minister agree with NFU vice-president, Meurig Raymond, who said:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;There is a real opportunity to make this scheme work for farmers . . . The scheme should provide farmers with a cost effective mechanism for complying with EU regulations, which will form part of the . . . rules for the new single farm payment scheme starting next year&quot;?</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>





<p><a name="41021-02_spnew3"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is right. We sometimes lose sight of the fact that the Government are putting in &#163;20 million of taxpayers&#039; money to subsidise the scheme, which is supported by the NFU and run by the industry with an NFU representative as the chairman of the board.
</p>





<p><a name="41021-02_spnew4"><b> Andrew George  (St. Ives)</b> 
 (LD): Arrangements for fallen stock collection are, of course, part of the Government&#039;s efforts to deal with biosecurity. This morning, I saw a distressing video from Northumberland trading standards, filmed four days after the foot and mouth outbreak began in 2001, of Bobby Waugh&#039;s Burnside farm. Has the Minister seen that video&#151;I know that his Department has it&#151;and if so, does he agree that it provides ample justification for reopening Dr. Iain Anderson&#039;s inquiry into the causes and lessons of the foot and mouth outbreak?
</p>





<p><a name="41021-02_spnew5"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 I have not seen the video and do not agree with the premise of the hon. Gentleman&#039;s 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>21 Oct 2004 : Column 1006</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>question. I understand that the video contains nothing new and have been told that all the details in it were given to the Anderson inquiry. Dr. Anderson himself has said that his decisions and recommendations would have been exactly the same, and the video formed part of Bobby Waugh&#039;s trial.
</p>





<p><a name="41021-02_spnew6"><b> Mr. James Gray  (North Wiltshire)</b> 
 (Con): Does the Minister recall Environment, Food and Rural Affairs questions on 22 July, when he claimed that the NFU supported his view that hunt kennels play what he described as a &quot;small role&quot; in the collection of fallen stock? Has he seen this letter from the NFU, which states:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;I was not entirely surprised to hear the minister&#039;s remarks yesterday as he has form on this! He misrepresented the views of Michael Seals, the chairman of the fallen stock collection scheme, on the same subject at Defra PQs on May 20.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">Let me assure you that at no point has the NFU said that the part played by the hunt kennels in stock disposal is &#039;small&#039; or &#039;insignificant&#039;. On the contrary . . . I suspect the politics of this is that as a fully paid-up hunt banner the minister does not want to be seen&quot;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>





<p><a name="41021-02_spnew7"><b> Mr. Speaker: </b> 
 Order. Will the hon. Gentleman sit down? Front Benchers are privileged and are sometimes called before Back Benchers; do not abuse the privilege. If the Minister can answer, fine; if not, we will move on.
</p>





<p><a name="41021-02_spnew8"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 I cannot comment on the letter, Mr. Speaker, because the hon. Gentleman did not have the courtesy to include it when he wrote to me about the issue.
</p>




<a name="41021-02_sbhd1"><h4 align=center>Energy Crops</h4>


<p>5. <a name="41021-02_wqn1"><b> Dr. Alan Whitehead  (Southampton, Test)</b> 
 (Lab): What plans she has to support the development of energy crops.  [192824]
</p>


<p><a name="41021-02_spmin1"><b>The Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs  (Margaret Beckett): </b> 
 A new biomass study team will work with stakeholders to identify barriers to developing bioenergy and ways in which to overcome them. Other studies will consider economic issues and renewable heat. Aid is available to plant energy crops and to develop supply chains and end users for heat and power generation.
</p>





<p><a name="41021-02_spnew9"><b> Dr. Whitehead: </b> 
 I am encouraged by the progress that has been made on research and the beginning of funding for increased production of such crops.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41021-02_para0">
Does my right hon. Friend accept that there are multiple benefits to agriculture, industry and the environment in the effective deployment of energy crops in fuel and in biomass power generation? Does she recognise that there remains a considerable problem of &quot;Who goes first?&quot; between the development of biomass-based power stations and the obtaining of long-term secure energy crops to fuel them? Will her Department work closely with the Department of Trade and Industry to facilitate the resolution of that problem?
</p>





<p><a name="41021-02_spnew10"><b> Margaret Beckett: </b> 
 I accept and understand what my hon. Friend says about the mixture of advantages and the concern that we are not yet getting the balance right. 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>21 Oct 2004 : Column 1007</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>That is why we set up the taskforce, which should be able to identify the remaining barriers and give sound advice on how to remove them.
</p>





<p><a name="41021-02_spnew11"><b> Mr. Michael Jack  (Fylde)</b> 
 (Con): The Secretary of State will be aware that sugar beet producers are worried about their future in the light of the proposed reforms to the EU sugar beet regime. One way of dealing with that would be to have a UK bioethanol industry. Will she therefore think about expanding the remit of the group that is considering biomass under the chairmanship of Sir Ben Gill to allow it to consider the barriers to a bioethanol and a biodiesel industry in this country? That is particularly relevant at a time when fuel security is uppermost in our minds.
</p>





<p><a name="41021-02_spnew12"><b> Margaret Beckett: </b> 
 The right hon. Gentleman makes an interesting point, which I take entirely. There is widespread understanding of the potential benefits of bioethanol and biodiesel. His suggestion might overly widen the scope of the study headed by Sir Ben Gill; if so, I undertake to consider whether there are other ways in which we might pursue it.
</p>





<p><a name="41021-02_spnew13"><b> Mr. David Kidney  (Stafford)</b> 
 (Lab): My right hon. Friend&#039;s Department has generously grant-aided a consortium of farmers and other business people in Stafford to produce energy crops, such that by next year more than 1,000 hectares of land in Staffordshire will be planted with miscanthus. The technology to do the conversion is in place, as is the first end user, but the project is in doubt because of an inability to secure a contract for the supply of renewable energy for a length of time and at a price that will be guaranteed to make the contract viable. Does she agree that until this industry is well established there is a role for Government in helping to ensure a guaranteed minimum length of time and price for the renewable energy that is produced?
</p>





<p><a name="41021-02_spnew14"><b> Margaret Beckett: </b> 
 I am grateful to my hon. Friend for his kind support for what the Government are already doing. I certainly accept that from time to time there are steps that we can take. We continually look at ways in which we can overcome some of these problems. He will know that a variety of grants and scheme proposals are available to deal with problems to do with the supply chain and so on. I cannot undertake that the Government will step in to deal with every one of these issues, because we are all trying to stimulate an effective market for such produce. However, I undertake to continue to consider the points that my hon. Friend raises and to consider further what we can do to assist and support.
</p>





<p><a name="41021-02_spnew15"><b> Mr. Michael Weir  (Angus)</b> 
 (SNP): As well as help with the production end of fuel, will the Secretary of State consider help at the other end? For example, wood could be an important biofuel, particularly in Scotland. Perth and Kinross council, which looked into including biofuel as an option in a new school project, found that the cost of such boilers is four times greater than that of other boilers. It would be a great help if grants were available to local authorities considering such projects to enable them to include biofuel as an option. Will she examine that with the devolved Administrations?
</p>





<p><a name="41021-02_spnew16"><b> Margaret Beckett: </b> 
 Of course, we are always willing to consider ideas and proposals that emerge, particularly 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>21 Oct 2004 : Column 1008</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>from hon. Members. Various grants and schemes are already available that may be able to assist the hon. Gentleman&#039;s local authority. Certainly, I undertake to consult the Scottish Executive about that in the way that he asks.
</p>





<p><a name="41021-02_spnew17"><b> Mr. Bob Blizzard  (Waveney)</b> 
 (Lab): On my right hon. Friend&#039;s visits to East Anglia, she will have noticed the vast fields of rapeseed there. Those fields could be the new environmentally friendly oilfields of the country if we could convert rapeseed oil into biodiesel. Despite the cut in duty by the Treasury, that is still not economically viable. Can she tell us where we need to go with this issue if we are not to waste this valuable sustainable resource, which has the potential to provide valuable income for farmers?
</p>





<p><a name="41021-02_spnew18"><b> Margaret Beckett: </b> 
 I take my hon. Friend&#039;s point entirely, and I know, as he says, that the potential of UK-grown oilseed rape is being considered. He will know that the balance of duty is currently examined in terms of the environmental benefit that could be gained from such a duty cut. That relationship is established. I know that my Treasury colleagues are as ever willing to consider the issue, but they are anxious to ensure that we get the right outcome in terms of stimulating UK development rather than merely sucking in imports.
</p>





<p><a name="41021-02_spnew19"><b> Mr. Tim Yeo  (South Suffolk)</b> 
 (Con): On that last point, while recognising that the current biofuel duty reductions are helpful, does the Secretary of State accept that if biofuels are to make a real contribution to cutting carbon dioxide emissions and be a significant alternative crop for farmers, further duty cuts are needed? If she has difficulty in persuading the Treasury about that, she might like to point out that this is one area in which lower duty is likely to lead to higher revenue.
</p>





<p><a name="41021-02_spnew20"><b> Margaret Beckett: </b> 
 I am always grateful for suggestions as to how to put a better case to the Treasury. I take on board the hon. Gentleman&#039;s point. We continue to keep under review what the level of duty currently is or should be. Of course, whether further duty cuts would assist is not the only issue&#151;there are other options, such as capital grants, enhanced capital allowances and a biofuels obligation, and in the not-too-distant future, we will be required to set targets under the EU biofuels directive. However, I welcome the recognition on both sides of the House that this is an important area.

<p>7. <a name="41021-03_wqn0"><b> Angela Watkinson  (Upminster)</b> 
 (Con): How many landfill sites are licensed to accept hazardous waste.  [192826]
</p>


<p><a name="41021-03_spmin0"><b>The Minister for the Environment and Agri-environment  (Mr. Elliot Morley): </b> 
 Currently, 34 landfills in England and Wales are licensed to take hazardous waste. In addition, applications for 29 new facilities are under consideration.
</p>





<p><a name="41021-03_spnew0"><b> Angela Watkinson: </b> 
 I thank the Minister for that response, but in his response to my right hon. Friend the Member for Bracknell (Mr. Mackay) he protested that 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>21 Oct 2004 : Column 1009</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>there is no hazardous waste mountain. When he considers that in every shed in every garden in the country, and in every cupboard under the stairs in every home in the country, there will be several tins of half-used household paint, which is now categorised as hazardous, is he not being a tad complacent?
</p>





<p><a name="41021-03_spnew1"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 Only if there were 4 million tonnes under somebody&#039;s stairs&#151;I would be a bit worried about that; it would be a cause for concern. The fact is that paint has been classed as hazardous for some time&#151;that is not particularly new. On my frequent travels round the country to landfill sites and rubbish tips, in which I take a great interest, I am pleased to see that most local authorities have provided good facilities for the safe disposal of items such as household paint.
</p>





<p><a name="41021-03_spnew2"><b> Mr. Colin Pickthall  (West Lancashire)</b> 
 (Lab): My hon. Friend will be aware of the recent Environment Agency report showing from research that within a radius of 2 km from a hazardous waste site, recorded birth defects are 7 per cent. higher than in the rest of the population. I have some personal interest in that question, as I live within 1 km of such a site.

The findings are well known. For the first time, the Government have pulled together all the known scientific studies of the health effects of all forms of waste disposal. As my hon. Friend says, one study reveals a higher incidence of birth defects around not just hazardous landfill sites but landfill sites in general. There is, however, no scientific evidence linking that directly with the sites; a number of other factors may be involved&#151;socio-economic factors, for example.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41021-03_para1">
The study found that the overall risks of waste disposal were small in comparison with the everyday risks of life. All forms of waste disposal involve risk, and landfill, which is sometimes seen as a fairly benign form of disposal, nevertheless has risks associated with it.

I know he will understand, though, when I say that using the arguments he suggests may not work entirely to our advantage, certainly during a transitional period. Although qualified majority voting will apply, any proposals must carry a majority in the Council.

</p>





<p><a name="41021-03_spnew11"><b> Margaret Beckett: </b> 
 My hon. Friend makes an interesting point and we are certainly encouraging that. There has been much discussion about the options open to those who presently grow sugar beet for the kind of factory that he describes. For some farmers, diversification into other crops will be the best answer; for others, it will be a question of exploring what use they can make of the kind of crops that they grow now. I welcome the constructive, sensible debate that is taking place on this issue. Most people recognise that change is bound to come and are considering how the change can be most beneficial. The report that the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Select Committee recently produced made a very positive contribution to that debate, which will certainly continue for some months yet.

 My hon. Friend makes an interesting point. There is general recognition and acceptance of the considerable problems that the much-needed reform in the sugar regime would bring to the ACP countries and some others, and there is a wish to address those issues. The UK attaches particular importance to the need for transitional measures. I take her point about the fair trade implications, but even at existing prices&#151;which are now around three times world levels&#151;the ACP producers and, indeed, some others are already in difficulty. So it is not simply a matter of there being difficulties if reforms took place; there are difficulties now. This is something that we have to take into account as we pursue reform, as I hope that we will.

 All statutory compensation due to farmers for animals slaughtered during the 2001 foot and mouth outbreak has been paid. However, 20 outstanding claims for increased compensation are being considered. In addition, the Department has 26 other claims from farmers relating to the outbreak.

 I am most grateful to the Minister for his reply, particularly given the fact that, back in November 2001, the then Financial Secretary to the Treasury, the hon. Member for Bolton, West (Ruth Kelly), in an answer to me said:
</p>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;Agriculture has been given a high priority&quot;,</p>

</p>

<p>
<a name="41021-04_para1">
Yet here we are, some years later, but not everybody has been compensated. Not all the agrimonetary compensation has been called down. Is it therefore perhaps worth understanding why farmers in the south-west simply do not understand why the Government will not hold a full inquiry into the ravages inflicted by foot and mouth, and why they are extremely nervous that, were such an occurrence to happen again, the Government would still be unprepared?
</p>





<p><a name="41021-04_spnew1"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 I am not sure whether that question really hung together. As I said in my original answer, all the statutory compensation has been paid. Out of thousands of cases, a tiny handful have not been settled, some because the farmers have let them lie dormant for a while, some because they are being disputed. The hon. Gentleman needs to be reminded that, were it not for the hard work of my officials, we would have lost nearly &#163;800 million to the taxpayer through overpayment in cases involving fraudulent or inflated claims.
</p>





<p><a name="41021-04_spnew2"><b> Mr. James Paice  (South-East Cambridgeshire)</b> 
 (Con): It is astonishing if no Minister has seen the video that shows the failings of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food in respect of the inspections at Burnside farm. Despite the fact that that video and Mr. Dring&#039;s report were not shown to the Anderson inquiry, the Anderson report made it clear that, to keep illegal meat imports out of the country, DEFRA should be given responsibility for co-ordinating all activities, including improving surveillance and adopting best practice from import regimes elsewhere. Does the Minister really believe that, in trying to deal with an outbreak that cost perhaps &#163;3 billion last time and which could cost a lot more next time&#151;indeed, if human disease is brought in through illegal meat imports, it could cost lives as well&#151;four extra sniffer dogs and a refusal to use X-ray equipment for searching baggage is a satisfactory response to the Anderson recommendations?
</p>





<p><a name="41021-04_spnew3"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 The Conservatives continue with their historic attempt to deflect blame for the foot and mouth outbreak away from where it belongs&#151;with the farmer who was responsible for illegal and irresponsible practices, and who was prosecuted for them&#151;and towards MAFF, as it was then called, and the people 

<br>&nbsp;<br>

Compensation for foot and mouth is but one example of DEFRA&#039;s failure in its dealings with that outbreak. One of the first things that this Government did was to launch the Phillips inquiry into BSE, which cost the taxpayer millions of pounds. Why will they not now grant a similar inquiry with a full remit to examine every aspect of the way in which they badly handled the foot and mouth crisis?
</p>





<p><a name="41021-04_spnew5"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman&#039;s party refused to have any inquiry at all into BSE when in government, so it is rich for him, given that we have had several inquiries into foot and mouth, now to demand another. Has he spoken to the shadow Treasury spokesman about an extra spending commitment?

 It is fair to point out that farm-gate prices in August were at 18.43p per litre, which was 0.01p higher than in July.

 The hon. Gentleman knows that the industry is bound to change as a result of reform of the common agricultural policy.

I am told that net farm income for hill farmers in the less favoured areas is some &#163;12,000 a year, and one cannot easily keep body and soul together on such an income. What are the Government doing to boost the incomes of people on the hills who look after our famous landscapes in, for example, the Pennines? What steps are the Government taking to encourage young people into hill farming, given that the average age of hill farmers is close to 60?

<p><a name="41021-05_spnew15"><b> Alun Michael: </b> 
 I share my hon. Friend&#039;s concern about the future for hill farmers, but it is fair to point out that provisional figures for net farm incomes in the English less favoured area suggests that they are some 20 per cent. above those of 2003. The hill farm allowance has provided dedicated support to upland farmers since 2001 and, in 2004, payments totalling &#163;34.5 million were made to hill farmers in England.

There is concern that, although there are incentives to use biofuels and biomass for electricity generation, there is no incentive if it is purely substitution for heat.

<p><a name="41021-05_spnew19"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 I understand the hon. Gentleman&#039;s point, although the issue is more difficult in relation to heat than in terms of power.

Such issues have been put to us, particularly in relation to the national allocation plan and the way in which we allocate carbon credits, and we are giving them careful consideration.

Will the right hon. Gentleman consider adding two reforms to next Tuesday&#039;s business? Almost a year ago, the European Scrutiny Committee asked him to change Standing Orders to allow it to deliberate in public.

Finally, may we have a statement on the British grand prix? This country is the home of international motor racing. Mr. Ecclestone says that the grand prix has been cancelled.

It would be very sad indeed for the nation if the event were lost.

<p><a name="41021-06_spnew2"><b> Mr. Hain: </b> 
 As an enthusiastic Formula 1 fan, I completely agree with the hon. Gentleman and the hon. Member for Banbury (Tony Baldry), in whose constituency Silverstone is sited, that it would be disastrous for British motor sport if the British grand prix were struck off the Formula 1 calendar. My right hon. Friend the Minister for Sport and Tourism has been working tirelessly with motor sport&#039;s authorities. However, I can say from personal knowledge that the politics of Formula 1 is even more difficult than the politics of the House. The internal difficulties in Formula 1 are legendary, but I hope that they will not stand in the way of the British grand prix at Silverstone being reinstated for next year. I thank the hon. Member for North-East Hertfordshire (Mr. Heald) for raising the matter.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41021-06_para21">
We have listened to all representations made on programming, including that of the Procedure Committee, and have proposed a sensible approach. We have adopted several proposals that were suggested. Hon. Members will have the chance to debate the matter next week.

I understand and agree with the concern about Sessional Orders and the situation in Parliament square expressed by the hon. Gentleman, other hon. Members and, indeed, Mr. Speaker himself.

Gentleman should support the new European constitutional treaty because, for the first time, it would allow Parliament to vet any new proposal from the European Commission, which would be a big advance for democracy. Given the cause that he argued from the Dispatch Box a moment or two ago, he should back the Government in giving Parliament much greater powers on new European proposals.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41021-06_para24">
The hon. Gentleman asked about the Osmotherly rules. I addressed the Liaison Committee the other day, and we had a good sitting during which I was questioned rigorously and gave my views. I stated that the Government will now embrace the presumption that requests from a Select Committee for Ministers or civil servants, including special advisers, to appear before it will be agreed to, subject to Ministers having the final decision. I should have thought that the hon. Gentleman would welcome that. There is no need for a sub-committee. The House is paralysed by &quot;committee-itis&quot;, and that it not a criticism of Select Committees&#151;<i>[Laughter.]</i> There is a proliferation of sub-committees and one can never find out who is making decisions. I am a great fan of Select Committees&#151;I made that clear the other day&#151;but I am not a fan of setting up more sub-committees instead of resolving matters in the usual way.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41021-06_para25">
I understand the hon. Gentleman&#039;s point about a debate on the middle east, about which we are all anxious. The Prime Minister has said that immediately after the American elections in early November&#151;10 or so days away&#151;he will try to get an urgent reactivation of the middle east peace negotiations.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41021-06_para26">
There is a clear political disagreement about the north-east referendum, although not about its rules, which are absolutely clear and must be adhered to. The truth is that the Conservatives do not want the north-east of England to have a strong voice for its regional interests. They want to see it stuck in the past, while next-door Scotland has its own national voice, while Wales has its own national voice through its Assembly and while London has its own national voice. The Conservatives wish to deny the north-east the chance to get its own national voice. Anyone who campaigns in the referendum, including Ministers such as me, must abide by the rules.
</p>





<p><a name="41021-06_spnew3"><b> Mr. Paul Tyler  (North Cornwall) (LD):</b> 
 The Leader of the House just said that he is a great fan of Select Committees. May I remind him that the Procedure Committee is a Select Committee with all-party representation and that it has a Government majority? Its report on programming therefore has the support of all parties represented on the Committee. Will he assure us that, as this is a House matter, it will be subject to a free vote? There have been occasions when Government Whips have been seen to steer hon. Members into a particular Lobby. Can we be sure that there will be a free vote for Government Members?

Another Select Committee that I hope the Leader of the House takes even more seriously, as he chairs it, is the Modernisation Committee, which produced an excellent report earlier this year. I hope that he can now tell us that progress is being made. May I remind him

<b>21 Oct 2004 : Column 1024</b>

<a name="41021-06_para28">
Does the Leader of the House accept that the role of the media in interpreting what happens within this building is extremely important, because many of our constituents learn what happens and how we operate from the media? The problem with the media today is that many people do not seem to understand the role of a Member of Parliament. In his discussions on this section of the report, will he emphasise the need for transparency and freedom of information in respect of editors and their role in public life? For example, perhaps he should suggest that they publish their salaries and expenses, the full cost of their offices and staff and how they would run two offices and two homes that are 250 miles apart. A bit of comparison would be useful for our constituents and for readers and viewers. Is the Leader of the House prepared to have those discussions? Does he think that they would be helpful, enabling us to understand what editors do, just as our electors understand better what we do?

 I am sympathetic to the hon. Gentleman&#039;s points, as he will understand. On the question of progress on the Modernisation Committee&#039;s report &quot;Connecting Parliament with the Public&quot;, I receive monthly reports from the Clerk&#039;s Department on the progress that is being made in all these important areas. We want to make sure that Westminster and this House are user-friendly. I know that the hon. Gentleman is an enthusiastic supporter of that. We also have a progress meeting next week on the proposals for a visitors centre, which is different from the reception facility, to which the House has already agreed.
</p>

<a name="41021-07_para0">
I am a fan of Select Committees. It is important that they hold Ministers to account. Ministers in this Government have appeared before Select Committees more than Ministers in any other Government since Select Committees were first established. That is part of the Government&#039;s greater accountability to the House of Commons. For example, my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister has made more statements to the House than Mr. Major or Mrs. Thatcher made in the equivalent periods. He also appears before the Liaison Committee, which never happened before.

<a name="41021-07_para1">
Of course there will be a free vote on the Procedure Committee issues and the question of programming. We need to keep it in perspective. We have an honest difference of opinion, and we might as well just accept it. The hon. Gentleman, along with members of the official Opposition, seems to be saying that he wants to go back to the old days of all-night sittings and filibustering. We have introduced a sensible approach to programming, which was called for before we came to power and was broadly endorsed by Conservative Members under the previous Administration. When programming works well, it is in the interests of the House because both in Committee and on the Floor of the House it allows hon. Members to focus on the issues that they want to focus on rather than listening to filibusters. Where programming does not work well&#151;there are instances of that&#151;it is usually the responsibility of those involved

Will he find time for an early debate on such an important subject&#151;not only breast cancer but the work that is going on in all cancer services&#151;so that the people whom we represent have a truer picture of what is happening?

<p><a name="41021-07_spnew2"><b> Mr. Hain: </b> 
 I did indeed see the photograph&#151;it was an excellent way for women Members of Parliament to raise the profile of an important subject. In the past decade, British women have experienced the biggest decrease in the world of deaths from breast cancer, and that is welcome. Under the Government, 99.6 per cent. of women whom GPs refer urgently with suspected breast cancer to a consultant are seen within two weeks. We are making rapid progress but a serious problem remains and my hon. Friend is right to raise it.

 May we have an early debate on the proposed security arrangements for this place?

</p>





<p><a name="41021-07_spnew4"><b> Mr. Hain: </b> 
 Mr. Speaker has ruled on whether security matters should be debated on the Floor of the House and we must bear that in mind. As a member of the House of Commons Commission, I can say that some of the press speculation and spin in the past week could not be further from the truth. The Government have no proposal to trample over the sovereign independence of the House of Commons or the House of Lords.

The Joint Committee on Security and the House of Commons Commission agree that they want to establish a proper security co-ordinator for the Palace, which is one building for the purposes of security. We need a proper, professional modern approach, with the police and the security service having constant operational lines to whoever fills the new position. However, ultimately the holder of the new post should be answerable and accountable to Mr. Speaker in the Commons and the Chairman of Committees in the Lords.

 The Leader of the House will remember the point of order that I made last week about the troubles in Parliament square&#151;not on the question of the permanent demonstration that has been alluded to today, which does indeed require primary legislation, but on the abusive, antisocial behaviour not only of the permanent demonstrator but of visiting demonstrators who fill the square with amplified noise, which can only serve to spoil the amenity for visitors and imperil the security of the House by distracting the police and security guards who are trying to protect us. I asked whether he would pick up the phone and ask the police why they are not taking action in respect of that noise, which they would take if it were occurring elsewhere. Has he made that call? If he has not, may I suggest that he ring 0207&#150;321 7501 and ask to speak to Superintendent Peter Terry? If he does not do that, I will, and I hope that many colleagues will do so and that, in the unlikely event that the politically correct media report this, members of the public will do so as well.

 May we have a debate on violent video games next week? My right hon. Friend will know that I have raised in the House the case of Stefan Pakeerah, the Leicester schoolboy who was murdered by a friend who was obsessed with the game Manhunt. Next Friday, the makers of that video will release a new version of Grand Theft Auto that is said to be even more violent than the previous game. May we have a statement or a debate, or some kind of ministerial action before that new game is released?
</p>





<p><a name="41021-08_spnew4"><b> Mr. Hain: </b> 
 I share my hon. Friend&#039;s amazement about such videos, which are monitored by the authorities, both the police and the Government. No doubt his points will have been noted because they are very serious.

 Will the Leader of the House confirm that there have been ongoing discussions about a proposal to extend the remuneration of Chairmen of Select Committees to include members of the Chairmen&#039;s Panel and other officers? Can he give any further information on that subject?
</p>





<p><a name="41021-08_spnew6"><b> Mr. Hain: </b> 
 I reassure the hon. Lady that we have, in fact, agreed to ask the Senior Salaries Review Body to consider the remuneration arrangements of members of the Chairmen&#039;s Panel. The Chairman of Ways and Means has made representations to me. Obviously, it is a matter for the SSRB&#151;an independent body that sets all our pay and allowance conditions in the House. It is important that people remember that we do not set our own levels; they are recommended by an independent report. I hope that the SSRB will consider that request sympathetically. I am personally sympathetic to it because the hon. Members who serve on the Chairmen&#039;s Panel do a very good job, which is often not properly acknowledged, and the Chairman of Ways and Means has come up with a good proposal, which I personally support, although it is for the SSRB to make a recommendation.

 I appreciate that a defence debate will be held in a few moments, but is there not a case for a separate statement on the four Upholder class submarines, which the Royal Navy decommissioned a decade ago, that were sold to Canada? My right hon. Friend will know that one of those submarines, HMCS Chicoutimi, caught fire, with loss of life&#151;sparks as big as golf balls ricocheted down the submarine&#151;and that an inquiry has been set up by our sister House of Commons in Ottawa, where the incident is causing huge concern and tremendous controversy and press comment.

 The fact that the Cabinet discussed this morning the redeployment of the Black Watch in Iraq clearly shows the importance of the issue and that, ultimately, a political decision is involved. If the Cabinet can have a political debate about the redeployment of the Black Watch in Iraq, why cannot the House of Commons?
</p>





<p><a name="41021-08_spnew10"><b> Mr. Hain: </b> 
 The Secretary of State for Defence will come to the House in a matter of minutes to answer any question that the hon. Lady might want to put to him, if time allows. Those issues should be raised with the Secretary of State for Defence in the proper fashion. He is coming to the House to make a statement at the earliest opportunity following the Cabinet meeting today, and I should have thought that she welcomed that.

 Last week, my right hon. Friend indicated that he would consider the suggestion that the House might debate the House of Commons Commission&#039;s annual report. Has he had an opportunity to consider that suggestion in the past week? If not, when will he be able to do so? Will he consider scheduling an annual debate on the publication of each annual report? Will he perhaps put that at the back of the estimable calendar that he has introduced today?
</p>





<p><a name="41021-08_spnew12"><b> Mr. Hain: </b> 
 I am not sure that it would be sensible to put such a debate in the calendar because of the nature of arranging business. However, having consulted informally with Mr. Speaker, I will provide time for a debate on the annual report of the House of Commons Commission, as requested by the hon. Member for North Cornwall (Mr. Tyler). There is universal support for that, including from the shadow Leader of the House. The report is a fine one, which I would say as I am a member of the Commission. It shows the important work that the Commission undertakes and will provide us with an opportunity to debate all sorts of matters that come under its remit.

 Will the Leader of the House find time for a statement on business rates to be made by a Minister from the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister? The Government have recognised the problem with small businesses and are considering a discount scheme. However, the businesses in my area are concerned that they have come up with the wrong solution. In particular, the National Farmers Union argues that its rates are increasing by &#163;1,000 and it is struggling to employ another person. If it could be part of a discount scheme, it would employ someone else, as would other businesses.

 The Leader of the House, in various parties over the decades, has campaigned effectively on libertarian issues, including in the &#039;80s on the level of the UK prison population.

Does he not believe that the time is right for a full debate on penal policy, not least because in the past few days Martin Narey, the new chief of the National Offender Management Service, has threatened the Prison Officers Association with prison privatisation?

 I am not sure that that description is accurate, but no doubt my hon. Friend will pursue it. I think he will welcome the fact that the publication of the latest quarterly report from the British crime survey shows that the risk of being a victim of crime is the lowest since the survey began under the Conservatives in 1981&#151;in other words, for more than 20 years. Crime in England and Wales has fallen 7 per cent. Violent crime is down by 6 per cent. and violence involving any injuries has dropped by 12 per cent. There has been a 10 per cent. fall in the use of handguns, and firearm offences show a 15 per cent. drop in fatal injuries. There are still big problems, including gun crime, but we are making incredible progress compared with where we were years ago.

Even if he will not change his mind at this stage on his response to it and the motions that he has tabled, will he guarantee that the matter will be decided on a genuinely free vote?

 I agree that the Bill is vital to the interests of people with disabilities.

It is therefore with great disappointment that we discovered that the Opposition in the House of Lords are trying to block its early progress. It is not for me to go into the usual channels&#039; negotiations, but we made a proposal that would have allowed early progress on the Bill, and that has not been supported.

The opportunity of getting the council tax payer to fund the difference is not available because of capping.

 It may come to that, but let us see what happens in the meantime. The hon. Gentleman may have other opportunities to raise the matter. I know he has always been a big supporter of the British grand prix in every respect, not just because it is in his constituency. The Government have provided quite a lot of funding for Silverstone, both for the new road that has transformed the previously chaotic traffic arrangements around there, and to support the development of high performance engineering in the area around Silverstone.

 As the hon. Gentleman will understand, there has been a long-standing problem relating to the finances of the pension fund for the police. That has complicated the funding decisions that have to be made. He is right, as a Member of Parliament, to raise the matter in respect of his local area, and I understand that. But he ought to draw the attention of the House and his constituents to the fact that within two years of a Conservative Government taking power, a massive multi-billion pound cut is planned in Home Office budgets, including police funding.

<p><a name="41021-10_spmin0"><b>The Secretary of State for Defence  (Mr. Geoffrey Hoon): </b> 
 With permission, Mr. Speaker, I would like to make a further statement about the deployment of UK forces in Iraq.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41021-10_para0">
On Monday I explained to the House that the UK military had received, and was evaluating, a request from the US military command in Iraq for assistance that would involve UK land forces operating outside the Multi-National Division (South-East) area, in support of a combined Iraqi/US force.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41021-10_para1">
A reconnaissance team from MND(SE) deployed to the area in question earlier this week and has now reported back to the chiefs of staff. The team provided information on a number of issues including logistics, the length of the potential operation, the likely tasks, activity levels in the area, the force levels required, and the command and control arrangements. After careful evaluation, the chiefs of staff have advised me that UK forces are able to undertake the proposed operation, that there is a compelling military operational justification for doing so and that it entails a militarily acceptable level of risk for UK forces. Based on this military advice, the Government have decided that we should accept the US request for assistance.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41021-10_para2">
I emphasise again that this was a military request, and has been considered and accepted on operational grounds after a thorough military evaluation by the chiefs of staff. As I said on Monday, and as the Prime Minister said yesterday to the House, this deployment is a vital part of the process of creating the right conditions for the Iraqi elections to take place in January.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41021-10_para3">
We share with the Iraqi Interim Government and with our coalition partners a common goal of creating a secure and stable Iraq, where men, women and children in towns such as Falluja can feel safe from foreign terrorists, from the kidnappers who murdered Ken Bigley and from other criminals. Crucially, Iraqi Prime Minister Allawi and the Interim Iraqi Government want to establish sufficient security for elections to be able to take place in January. Recent successful operations by Iraqi security forces and coalition forces in Tal Afar, Samarra and on the outskirts of Falluja have been undertaken to restore areas under the control of militants and terrorists to the authority of the Iraqi Interim Government. As a direct result, the political process there is now moving ahead.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41021-10_para4">
We cannot consider the current UK area of responsibility in isolation. What goes on in the rest of Iraq affects southern Iraq and affects UK troops wherever they are based. We must therefore consider our contribution in the context of the overall security situation right across Iraq. This means that a UK armoured battle group consisting of the 1st Battalion the Black Watch and supporting units will deploy to an area within Multi-National Force (West) to relieve a US unit for other tasks. They will be deploying with the necessary combat support services such as signallers, engineers and medics, resulting in a total deployment of around 850 personnel. This deployment will be for a very limited and specified period of time, lasting weeks rather than months.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>21 Oct 2004 : Column 1036</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="41021-10_para5">
I cannot give the House further details about the location, duration or specifics of the mission. I know that hon. Members on all sides will understand that to do so would risk the operational security of the mission and potentially the safety of our forces. Speculation from many quarters so far has not been helpful. I emphasise that there are no plans to send a further 1,300 troops to Iraq, as suggested this morning.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41021-10_para6">
Concerns have been expressed about UK forces coming under US command and about their rules of engagement. The arrangements for this deployment are that the force will remain under the operational command of General Rollo, the UK General Officer Commanding Multi-National Division (South-East).
</p>

<p>
<a name="41021-10_para7">
On a day-to-day basis, the Black Watch will, of course, have to co-ordinate its activity with the US chain of command in the locality, but any changes in the mission or the tasking would have to be referred back to General Rollo. As with all UK operations, our forces will operate at all times under UK rules of engagement, which will provide proper protection for our forces, as they have done throughout our operations in MND(SE).
</p>

<p>
<a name="41021-10_para8">
It is not unusual for UK and US forces to work alongside each other&#151;they have successfully done so not only in Iraq, with US forces often providing logistical support for our own forces and therefore reducing the number of troops and assets that we need in theatre, but in operations all over the world. Indeed, in Bosnia, about 22,000 US troops operated under UK command. As I said in my statement on Monday, UK forces in Iraq work alongside forces from Italy, Denmark, Poland, the Netherlands, Japan and other countries on a daily basis. That is an effective and practical way to ensure coherence both in our own area and with those areas that surround it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41021-10_para9">
There has also been speculation as to why there is a need for this UK force to backfill for a US unit, when there are around 130,000 US troops in Iraq. The armoured battle group brings important qualities of extensive training, experience, and hard-edged combat capability. It is not the case, as is often implied, that there are 130,000 US troops that could take on that task. In fact, less than one third of US forces in Iraq have the requisite combat capability, and of those even fewer have the armoured capability that is needed.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41021-10_para10">
Specialised armoured forces are already highly committed across Iraq, which is about four fifths the size of France. The chiefs of staff have further concluded therefore that the provision of a UK battle group to that new mission would be a significant contribution to and would materially increase the effect of the continuing operations to maintain pressure on the terrorists before the January elections.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41021-10_para11">
On Monday, hon. Members raised the question of whether that deployment will leave sufficient forces to deal with contingencies in our own area of responsibility in the south. The roulement of British forces currently under way includes an armoured infantry battle group of the 1st Battalion Scots Guards with their own Warrior armoured vehicles, which will fulfil the divisional reserve role currently undertaken by the Black Watch. That will result in General Rollo temporarily having an extra armoured battle group under his command, which will provide a robust force 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>21 Oct 2004 : Column 1037</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>capable of dealing with any contingencies. It is also worth remembering that the other UK forces in MND(SE) will continue to carry out their tasks in the professional and effective manner that has become so apparent to the people of Basra and the surrounding area&#151;they restore power, water and basic facilities and support the Iraqi authorities in ensuring a robust level of security.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41021-10_para12">
The deployment is limited in scope, time and space, and it does not represent a permanent significant additional commitment of forces. The overall trend in the numbers deployed in Iraq remains down, from the peak of 46,000 during the war-fighting phase to around 8,500 today. That overall downward trend is expected to continue as we continue to train Iraqi security forces to take over from UK forces, as has happened, for example, in Amarah in Maysan province.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41021-10_para13">
The Government remain totally committed to the Iraqi Interim Government and the need to hold free elections in January. We also remain committed to protecting innocent Iraqis, dealing with terrorists, kidnappers and criminals, training and equipping Iraqi forces so that they can take our place providing security, and seeing a democratic Government in Iraq who will take their rightful place in the international community and who will deliver prosperity and a secure future for the Iraqi people. That should unite both sides of the House, and it is right that the United Kingdom should contribute to those objectives. The deployment of the Black Watch will emphasise to the Iraqi people that the UK will continue to contribute to the coalition and see the task through.

 The House will be relieved that the Secretary of State has finally moved to end the unnecessary and unacceptable confusion of the past few days and announced the Government&#039;s decision on this important matter. As I made plain in my response to his statement on Monday, Conservative Members fully support the coalition as it seeks to bring democracy, stability and freedom to Iraq and preserve Iraq&#039;s territorial integrity. We agree that we should do what we can to contribute to that strategic objective.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41021-11_para0">
In the light of what the Secretary of State has told the House today, and having heard that the deployment has the support of the chiefs of staff following reconnaissance reports that the proposed mission is both feasible and fully within the capabilities of the Black Watch battle group, Conservative Members support the deployment on the basis that it is a necessary operational military contribution to the coalition&#039;s efforts to bring peace and stability to Iraq ahead of the January elections.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41021-11_para1">
I will, if I may Mr. Speaker, press the Secretary of State, in the light of this decision, on a number of the points that I made to him on Monday. First, will he clarify his rather complicated assurances on the rules of engagement? Will he again confirm that the rules of engagement are indeed robust enough to cope with the change of area, mission and task?
</p>

<p>
<a name="41021-11_para2">
Secondly, will he assure the House that troops about to face the enemy will not have their essential confidence undermined by the possibility of a commanding officer&#039;s legal judgments being subsequently overruled, as has recently been the case?

<a name="41021-11_para3">
Thirdly, bearing it in mind that, as the Prime Minister said yesterday, we are about to enter a period of increased activity in Iraq, will the Secretary of State confirm that there is likely to be a surge requirement for extra troops to Iraq ahead of the Iraqi elections in January? If so, where will those troops come from?
</p>

<p>
<a name="41021-11_para4">
Fourthly, does the Secretary of State anticipate deploying the over-the-horizon assets that he holds in Cyprus? Is he satisfied as to the arrangements both for command and control and for air cover? Fifthly, will he say whether troops currently serving in Iraq will have their tour extended? Finally, are there any additional plans for further redeployment of British troops outside MND(SE)?
</p>

<p>
<a name="41021-11_para5">
No doubt the Secretary of State will wish at his earliest convenience to apologise to the families of the Black Watch battle group for the exceptionally shabby way in which he has treated them.

<p>
<a name="41021-11_para6">
The House and the nation can be supremely confident that the Black Watch, the Royal Highland Regiment, which bears the distinction of Baghdad 1917 as one of its battle honours, will carry out its task with all the fortitude, discipline and courage that we would expect from one of the finest regiments in the British Army. To them and to all the supporting arms who go with them in the battle group, we wish God speed.

 I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman, who has finally and rather belatedly made the Conservative party&#039;s position on the deployment clear.

</p>

<p>
<a name="41021-11_para7">
I suspect that the hon. Gentleman prepared his questions before he heard my statement. I have already repeated the point about rules of engagement, which he has come very close to suggesting should be published&#151;he denied such requests when he was Minister for the Armed Forces&#151;and I am delighted to repeat again that our armed forces will have robust rules of engagement. The rules of engagement have been sufficient to protect them in their operations in MND(SE), and that will continue to be the case as far as this deployment is concerned. Every hon.

Liberal Democrat Members did not support the war in Iraq, but we accept that we have a responsibility to the people of Iraq.

Both the Secretary of State and the Prime Minister have said that the security situation in Iraq could get worse in the short term due to Ramadan, any US attack on Falluja, and the run-up to the January elections. So is now a good time to move 850 battle-trained members of the Black Watch, with its Warrior armoured vehicles, some 350 miles away from supporting the remaining British troops in the south?

 Is the leader of the Liberal Democrats seriously suggesting, as he appears to be, that every time British forces in a theatre of operation are redeployed there needs to be a debate and a vote on it? Is he seriously suggesting that, across the wide range of deployments that British forces make, that kind of political opportunism would serve them well? We know full well from the Liberal Democrats that their policy 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>21 Oct 2004 : Column 1040</b>

Given the current situation in Iraq, are the Liberal Democrats seriously saying to the families of people like Ken Bigley that they would not take action against terrorists and take the necessary action to see democratic elections taking place in Iraq? Do they or do they not want free and democratic elections in Iraq? If not, they should say so, because their policies lead directly to that conclusion.
</p>

<p>

 With the handover of sovereignty to the Iraqi Interim Government, all the operations that I have described to the House and, indeed, this deployment and this operation, will have to be with the consent of that sovereign Government of Iraq.

 As one who agrees with the decision that has been taken and has every confidence in the ability of the Black Watch, may I press the Secretary of State on one point? If, when it returns at Christmas, there is a need for other troops to take its place, have contingency plans been made for that?
</p>





<p><a name="41021-12_spnew1"><b> Mr. Hoon: </b> 
 As I sought to explain to the House in the course of my statement, the fact that the Black Watch will be going north and will in turn be replaced in position by the Scots Guards means that once it has been able to return home before Christmas we will be back to the steady state of forces that we currently have in MND(SE), so there will not be a significant change in the total numbers operating in the south.
</p>





<p><a name="41021-12_spnew2"><b> Geraint Davies  (Croydon, Central) (Lab):</b> 
 Many colleagues would delay action for a couple of weeks beyond the US election. I do not want President Bush re-elected, but with every day that passes terrorists in Falluja are killing Iraqi people and taking UK hostages, and there will be more and more Bigleys. Does my right hon. Friend agree that if there is a military imperative to act we should do it now, not sacrifice UK and Iraqi lives just because we do not like George Bush?
</p>





<p><a name="41021-12_spnew3"><b> Mr. Hoon: </b> 
 I agree with my hon.

<p><a name="41021-12_spnew4"><b> Mr. David Trimble  (Upper Bann) (UUP):</b> 
 I understand the pressures that have been brought to bear on the Secretary of State with regard to making this statement, but I wonder whether it was the wise thing to do. He emphasised that the decision was taken purely on the basis of operational considerations. Such decisions and movements are bound to take place from time to time when we have allies working on a joint operation, as has happened elsewhere. Can the Secretary of State tell us what policy issues are relevant, because it is those, not operational matters, with which this House should be concerned?
</p>





<p><a name="41021-12_spnew5"><b> Mr. Hoon: </b> 
 I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman, who always approaches military questions in the light of very considerable personal knowledge and experience. As he knows, such deployments are made clearly to reflect a policy background, which I stated to the House&#151;it is the importance of removing the terrorist threat to the people of Iraq and of allowing free democratic elections to take place on schedule in January, as has always been our policy.

 As the Member for Dunfermline, which is the Black Watch&#039;s largest recruitment area, I had hoped, as had many of its families, that it would not be committed to an even more dangerous aspect of its current operations, especially as our US allies, despite having 121,000 more in their armed forces than we do, seem incapable or unwilling to deal with the situation. What commitment can the Secretary of State give to assure us that all the vital support and equipment will be provided and that those soldiers will return to their homes for Christmas?
</p>





<p><a name="41021-12_spnew7"><b> Mr. Hoon: </b> 
 I have set out the reason for this deployment. I am absolutely confident that the Black Watch and all those, including our US allies, who will work so hard to ensure that the deployment is able to take place will do so successfully and satisfactorily.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41021-12_para0">
I am sorry that my hon. Friend expresses those views about the United States, which will be engaged in the deployment. I have explained to the House in some detail why this particular capability is necessary in order to allow wider operations against terrorists and kidnappers to take place.

 Is it not the case that the US forces place considerably greater reliance on the use of offensive air power against urban terrorist targets than we do, and that time and again, most regrettably, so-called precision US air strikes have resulted in significant Iraqi civilian casualties, including women and children? Assuming that that pattern continues, what assessment has the Secretary of State made of the risk that not only the Black Watch, but British forces generally, may, quite unjustifiably, be associated in the Iraqi public mind with having caused significant civilian casualties?
</p>





<p><a name="41021-12_spnew9"><b> Mr. Hoon: </b> 
 I do not accept the logic of the right hon. Gentleman&#039;s argument, not least because the capability of modern precision-guided weapons is now such that they can be precisely targeted in a way that he does not give credit for. The question also concerns whether it is right to try to deal with terrorists. I assure him that Iraqi

<b>21 Oct 2004 : Column 1042</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>public opinion wants the threats to security in Iraq and to the Iraqi people dealt with just as badly as the United States or the United Kingdom does. If he reflects on what he said, I am sure that he will realise that the sorts of terrorists operating in places such as Falluja are killing far more Iraqis than they are killing coalition forces. That is why the Interim Government are so determined to see them dealt with.

<p><a name="41021-12_spnew10"><b> Mr. Eric Joyce  (Falkirk, West) (Lab):</b> 
 In view of the tawdry and rather irresponsible comments to the effect that Black Watch families have not been properly briefed up to now, will the Secretary of State confirm that they have been properly briefed and that that will continue?

<p><a name="41021-12_spnew12"><b> Mr. George Osborne  (Tatton) (Con):</b> 
 Of course we must see the job through in Iraq, but is it not unfair to ask regiments such as the Black Watch, or my local regiment, the Cheshires, to serve with such bravery and distinction in Iraq, and then face them with abolition on their return?
</p>





<p><a name="41021-12_spnew13"><b> Mr. Hoon: </b> 
 It is not a question of abolition; the hon. Gentleman knows full well that it is a reorganisation. We will have the opportunity to debate that in a few minutes, but there has been a long process of reorganising infantry battalions throughout the history of the British Army.

 In the light of my right hon. Friend&#039;s remarkable statement that only a third of US troops are combat-capable, would he agree with the US chiefs of staff when they warned Donald Rumsfeld that he was not sending enough US troops to Iraq in the first place? What assurances has he received from the US in return for this redeployment that, this time, it will listen to us as good and reliable allies when we advise it to minimise civilian casualties in Falluja, especially since, as a result of today&#039;s decision, we are much more likely to be held responsible for those casualties?
</p>





<p><a name="41021-12_spnew15"><b> Mr. Hoon: </b> 
 My right hon. Friend and I worked closely together on Iraq and have discussed on many occasions the organisation of our armed forces. He knows full well that in any force there are front-line combat forces and support forces. That was my point, which is self-evident, as I am sure he would accept. Inevitably, a certain proportion of the US forces deployed in Iraq will be front-line combat forces, and a smaller proportion still will be armoured capable. That is why this particular deployment is necessary.

 The hon.

We will debate that issue in the debate that follows. Consistent with the recommendation of the Scottish colonels, for example, what we are looking to preserve is the identity of single battalion regiments within a larger amalgamated structure.

Apart from a theme of cynicism about timing&#151;which I do not share, but which I believe must be understood and responded to&#151;which runs through virtually all those messages, the single major theme is a concern about the impact on civilian casualties of an assault on Falluja.

 I am grateful to my hon. Friend for making that point. I emphasise to the House, to her and to her constituents that considerable efforts are always made in any operation to minimise civilian casualties. At the same time, we must all face up to the fact that in Falluja, determined, ruthless, fanatical terrorists must be dealt with. They have to be dealt with in a way that is militarily effective and has regard to the safety and security of the forces carrying out those operations.

 There will be a distinct chill felt in the homes of forces families across Tayside, Fife and beyond as the significance of this statement is assessed.

<p><a name="41021-13_spnew2"><b> Mr. Hoon: </b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>about the rationale behind this release of American forces. I am still not clear exactly what tasks the Americans will be able to carry out once we provide this alleviation. The Secretary of State must understand that part of the problem is the lack of confidence that what he says, in relation to what the Brits will do in minimising civilian and other casualties, will be true in American deployments. We need some explanation of what the Americans will do once we assist them in doing it.
</p>





<p><a name="41021-13_spnew4"><b> Mr. Hoon: </b> 
 May I make two points clear to my hon. Friend? First, whatever operations follow will be combined operations, involving Iraqi forces, led by an Iraqi decision-making process, but with support from US forces. Those will be consistent with the sorts of operations that I have already described to the House&#151;operations to deal with centres of terrorism and areas that are outside the control of the Interim Government and providing a base from which terrorists can attack innocent Iraqi civilians and other innocent civilians operating in Iraq. Secondly, if we do not deal with those secure bases, it is much more difficult to see a secure, stable future for Iraq, and very difficult to see how democratic elections can safely be held.

 Is the Secretary of State aware that someone does not have to be a lover of Saddam Hussein to be against this deployment and against the war? We are mirroring the views of millions of people in Britain, and of people in his constituency and mine. That is valid reason enough. Does he not think that it is slightly ionic that the American President and his Vice-President, who both refused to face the muck and bullets in Vietnam, are now calling on British forces to bail them out?

 My hon. Friend and I have regular discussions on all manner of issues. I say to him&#151;and to the Liberal Democrats, although they may not like it&#151;that the issue is that there is a difficult situation in Iraq. No one is in any doubt about that. There is significant terrorism in Iraq, and a sovereign Interim Government struggling to establish peace, freedom and democracy for their people. The issue that my hon.

 Can the Secretary of State tell us who will replace the Black Watch in the American sector when that regiment returns to Britain? Will it be replaced by British or American troops&#151;especially if the Americans get bogged down in Falluja?
</p>





<p><a name="41021-13_spnew18"><b> Mr. Hoon: </b> 
 I have made it absolutely clear that the request is for a deployment limited in time. At the end of that limited period, assuming that operations have been completed in Falluja, it will be a question of whether it is necessary to occupy that area or whether it is possible to take the area at risk. That is a matter for the Americans; it is not a matter for us.

<p><a name="41021-13_spnew20"><b> Mr. Hoon: </b> 
 As I made clear on Monday and again today, this is about ensuring that pockets of resistance in places such as Falluja are dealt with, in order to reduce the terrorist threat to the Iraqi people and to coalition forces&#151;and, of course, to ensure that progress is made not just in rebuilding Iraq, but in giving the Iraqi people an opportunity to participate in democratic elections.

That cost will be borne in part by our political party, but also&#151;perhaps more important in the big scheme of things&#151;by the standing of this country abroad if the civilians deaths that we fear turn out to be on the scale that people are worried about.

 If it is the case that only 40,000 American troops have the requisite combat capability, does the Secretary of State agree that the additional deployment only amounts to an extra 2 per cent.? Can he explain why he considers it to be a significant contribution?
</p>





<p><a name="41021-14_spnew5"><b> Mr. Hoon: </b> 
 As I have tried to explain, this is an armoured capability. The request is for us to replace a relocating similarly armoured US capability so that it can be free&#151;along with other forces, including significant contingents of Iraqi forces&#151;to continue operations of the kind that are being conducted in places such as Samarra. The hon. Gentleman suggests that it is a modest contribution, and indeed it is; nevertheless, it is a vital contribution and one requested of us by an ally.

<p><a name="41021-14_spnew6"><b> Glenda Jackson  (Hampstead and Highgate) (Lab):</b> 
 Is it not the case that the present policy, which this deployment of British troops will reinforce, has been a total and unmitigated failure? Far from eradicating terrorist centres, it has encouraged actions by terrorists and insurgents. Is it not also the case that it is impossible to guarantee that the minimum number of civilians will be killed in the all-out attack on Falluja? Surely the best thing that a British Government could do to support and protect the Iraqi people is to argue strongly to the American Government that they must, sooner rather than later, change their policy&#151;and change it dramatically.

<p><a name="41021-14_spnew7"><b> Mr. Hoon: </b> 
 The difficulty I have with my hon. Friend&#039;s observations is that they take no account of the appalling terrorist attacks that are occurring throughout Iraq and affecting the Iraqi people more than anyone else. While I can subscribe to many of the principles that my hon. Friend has enunciated&#151;we certainly do not want to target civilians, and in any event we are not allowed to do so legally&#151;it is important for her to bring to the House not only the criticisms that she makes in such an articulate way, but some suggestions as to what we should do to deal with the terrorist threat that exists in Iraq today.

 Given the record-breaking speed with which the military and political decision-making machine operated this week&#151;and, indeed, the incredibly short time that the recce group has had in which to reconnoitre the operation in Iraq&#151;what guarantee can the Secretary of State give us that the same will not happen in future? There will be a request from the Americans for our troops to operate somewhere else, there will be a record-breaking decision to allow that, and we will end up with the severe mission creep mentioned by the hon.

 Like my hon. Friend the Member for Bolsover (Mr. Skinner), I have received calls on this issue over the weekend from constituency party members and from members of the public. We went into something of a tailspin over the weekend, with all the furore in the press. Ultimately, however, if this action is necessary, it is necessary; and if it is right, it is right. If the Black Watch have a pivotal role to play in securing the future democracy of Iraq and the holding of elections in January, we should praise that role, let them go in there and get on with the task, and get them home to their families in time for Christmas.

Will any of them be from the Colchester garrison? Bearing it in mind that I represent the garrison town of Colchester and that I am proud of the troops I represent, will the Secretary of State reflect on whether his criticism that I did not back British troops was fair?

Does he support taking robust action to deal with terrorism? Does he support the deployment of British forces to achieve that?

He will be aware that there is massive disquiet in the middle east not only about the events leading to the overthrow of Saddam but about America&#039;s approach to winning the peace. Is he also aware that concern about Britain&#039;s closeness to the United States has so far been tempered by an awareness that we understand things a bit better and have a rather more sensitive approach than that of the United States? Does he understand that this deployment will undermine that distinction in the middle east, and that that will undermine our ability to be a force for good and for sanity in that part of the

 My right hon. Friend referred in his statement to the training of Iraqi security personnel. I have pressed his colleagues on this point before, because I am anxious to see Britain play a role in raising the standards of such personnel. That will help us to develop a systematic, organised exit strategy from this conflict. Will my right hon.

<p><a name="41021-15_spnew1"><b> Mr. Hoon: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is right to link the question of training, reconstruction and the prospect of democratic elections in Iraq to an exit strategy, because that is an exit strategy. The more training we can conduct of police, security forces and the new Iraqi army, the more opportunities there will be for those people to replace units of the British Army and, indeed, of other coalition forces. As I explained in my statement, that is precisely what has happened in al-Amarah, where British forces were constantly confronted by attacks throughout the summer. Now, they have been replaced by significant contingents of the new Iraqi army, and I am pleased to say that the situation there is much calmer.

</p>





<p><a name="41021-15_spnew5"><b> Mr. Hoon: </b>

<p><a name="41021-15_spnew6"><b> Sir Robert Smith  (West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine) (LD):</b> 
 In his answer to the right hon. Member for Tonbridge and Malling (Sir John Stanley), the Secretary of State placed great faith in the accuracy of modern air weapons. However, most of our constituents will still be concerned that, whatever the quality of the weaponry, innocent civilians are being killed in Iraq. There is particular concern when children are killed there. As he has said, what happens in the rest of Iraq affects the sector that British troops are in. He must therefore seriously address the point that the operations to control the insurgency have to be carried out in such a way that civilian casualties are kept to a minimum, even if that involves a greater risk to the American forces.
</p>





<p><a name="41021-15_spnew7"><b> Mr. Hoon: </b> 
 That is precisely the legal rubric under which British forces operate.
</p>





<p><a name="41021-15_spnew8"><b> Mr. Neil Gerrard  (Walthamstow) (Lab):</b> 
 It is clear, is it not, that what this is about is the facilitating of a massive American assault on Falluja? Many of us are deeply sceptical about the assurances that civilian casualties will be minimised, because they simply do not fit with what we have seen over the past year from the US forces, or with the number of Iraqi civilian casualties that there have already been. It is impossible to go into a town such as Falluja with bombs and heavy armour without causing casualties among innocent civilians on a significant scale. We will be blamed for that, because of this deployment.

<br>&nbsp;<br>there is not a solely military solution to the problem of insurgency in Iraq. It is necessary to deal with foreign fighters and the likes of Zarqawi and his supporters in a vigorous way. There are increasing signs, even in places such as Falluja, that the local Sunni population in such cities are sick and tired of the suffering that they are experiencing at the hands of terrorists. I made the point the other day to the Iraqi Vice-President, who was visiting London, that alongside a determined military operation to deal with terrorists, there must also be a political operation to deal with those people who ultimately are citizens of Iraq and who need to participate in a political process and in the restoration of their country.

 I am extremely grateful for the opportunity to open today&#039;s debate on defence in the world. The British armed forces, and the civil servants who support them, make a huge contribution to international efforts to improve security around the world. More than 9,000 servicemen and women are currently deployed in the Gulf region, and there are significant deployments in Bosnia, Kosovo, Afghanistan and Cyprus.
</p>

It is not just on major operations that our armed forces make a valuable contribution; we also have training teams and advisers providing support to partners and allies across the world. Let us not forget the important contribution that our armed forces make in the Falklands Islands, Gibraltar and Cyprus.

<p>
<a name="41021-15_para1">
We owe our armed forces a debt of gratitude, and I know that the House will wish to join me in again paying tribute to the bravery and professionalism of our servicemen and women, and to their contribution to creating a better world. Nowhere is that more evident than in Iraq, where the armed forces are focused on training and supporting the Iraqi security forces. We must continue to help Iraq to develop the necessary capabilities and capacity to be able to protect its security and stability. This is of particular importance in the light of the forthcoming elections in January.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41021-15_para2">
We know that the Iraqi security forces are enthusiastic, but they require command and leadership training, as well as basic weapons-handling skills. Prime Minister Allawi is aware of that, and he recognises the need to accelerate the process and to deliver results on security and crime. We are committed to supporting him and his Government, which is why the armed forces are providing essential training for the police and the coastal and border defence forces, as well as for the new Iraqi army and air force. Military advisers are also working with our Iraqi partners on a number of national security committees. Based on current planning, all major elements of the Iraqi security forces, particularly those designed for counter-insurgency, will be fully manned, trained and equipped by 1 July 2005. Three battalions of the regular army&#151;about 2,250 personnel&#151;are already operational, and we expect that all 18 battalions, involving about 27,000 personnel, will be in place by February 2005.

The Iraqi national guard is being trained and expanded to take over guard and patrol duties. Its 40 battalions&#151;consisting of some 36,500 personnel&#151;now have the capability to conduct significant operations. They are routinely undertaking a wide range of duties, such as fixed site security, route and convoy security, patrols, and cordons and checkpoints. In addition, some 89,000 Iraqi police are on duty in Iraq. Altogether, more than 200,000 Iraqis are now providing security in that country.

While it is clear that we are making good progress, we accept that there is still some way to go.

We will continue to work with the Iraqi Interim Government and with our coalition partners to achieve our common goal of a stable and secure Iraq. It is for that reason that I announced our agreement to the United States&#039; request that United Kingdom land forces operate outside Multi-National Division (South-East) in support of a combined Iraqi-US force. Together, we will work to increase the pressure on, and deal with, those terrorists and insurgents who are trying to prevent the rebuilding of Iraq, and who threaten the holding of free elections in January.

<br>&nbsp;<br>join the Euro-Atlantic community. NATO has played a vital role in moving the region towards this more stable state, and the United Kingdom has played its part this process. Success can be seen from the fact that NATO force levels in Bosnia have reduced from the original level of 60,000 troops to some 7,000. In Kosovo, NATO troop levels have been reduced from the 1999 figure of 55,000 to 17,500. NATO has decided to terminate its stabilisation force mission in Bosnia. That is the right decision for Bosnia, which is ready to take its next steps toward self-sustaining peace and stability.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41021-16_para4">
The EU will support Bosnia in taking those steps. The EU mission, which takes over in Bosnia on 2 December, will include a robust military element at initially similar figures to those currently in SFOR. The EU mission will take on the main peace stabilisation role in Bosnia, working in support of the mission implementation plan of the office of High Representative Lord Ashdown. The residual NATO headquarters will concentrate on defence reform and partnership for peace, and will also carry out, together with the EU, certain operational tasks such as support to the International Criminal Tribunal for Yugoslavia. The UK will lead the first military element of the EU mission and provide the force commander, Major-General David Leakey. The NATO-EU partnership will be good for Bosnia and will help it further along the road towards membership of the EU and NATO.

 The Secretary of State will be aware that the Defence Committee was in Bosnia and Kosovo earlier this year. I would be grateful for his reassurance on one issue that worried us at that time. With the transition in Bosnia from NATO to EU responsibility, can we be absolutely certain that there will be no national caveats that will impair the effectiveness of the force? If difficulties arise in the future, will we be able to deal with them adequately? Can my right hon. Friend also reassure me on the situation in Kosovo, which is still rather worrying? Do we have enough forces in theatre to be able to cope if it erupts again?
</p>





<p><a name="41021-16_spnew11"><b> Mr. Hoon: </b> 
 I can reassure my hon. Friend that we will have sufficient forces, either in theatre or available at sufficiently short notice&#151;as with recent disturbances in Kosovo&#151;to be on the scene fast enough to make a difference. That has always been an aspect of our approach. I am grateful to my hon. Friend for his interest in the Balkans. There is a risk, as I specifically said in my speech, of overlooking the significant progress made in Bosnia. It is crucial for Bosnia to develop for itself the ability to organise its political and military structures in order to take advantage of membership of international organisations.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41021-16_para5">
The EU mission in Bosnia will be by far the largest military mission under EU leadership. It will also be the most extensive test of the Berlin-plus arrangements agreed at the Nice summit, which provide for the EU to call in NATO assets to sustain its missions. The United Kingdom believes that that mission will be an important milestone in proving the capability of EU defence and security policy that complements rather than competes with NATO.

However, despite progress, the Balkans region remains volatile, as my hon. Friend the Member for Ilford, South (Mike Gapes) said.

</p>





<p><a name="41021-16_spnew13"><b> Mr. Hoon: </b> 
 I am grateful to my hon. Friend for his interest. Operations in the Balkans generally, and specifically in Kosovo, require a mixed force of highly trained military forces together with&#151;as far as the policing aspect is concerned&#151;rather more of the gendarmerie than is generally available in the UK. Some of our police officers are trained to use firearms, but that is not the tradition or the generality of our police forces. In the transition from circumstances where military forces are required to those where they are not, the role of the gendarmerie has been key. It may well be that the decision that I have to deal with is the result of other countries being prepared to provide a capability that we do not have in large numbers ourselves. Nevertheless, I will certainly take the matter up with my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary. If necessary, I shall write to my hon. Friend in due course.

The strategic defence review provided a solid foundation and last year&#039;s defence White Paper called for even more flexible and rapidly deployable armed forces&#151;armed forces that make the most of platforms and people across the full range of military effect from peacekeeping to war fighting, and armed forces that complement the skills of other Government Departments and agencies to tackle more effectively the causes of instability in the world.

<a name="41021-17_para2">
Our experience of the types of operation in which we have been engaged since the end of the cold war, together with our assessment of the security environment, show that, on a routine basis, we should plan to support three concurrent operations of small and medium scale, at least one of which is an enduring peace support operation. At those levels, we will maintain a broad spectrum of capabilities to allow our armed forces to conduct limited national operations or, as is more likely to be the case, to enable us to be the lead or framework nation for coalition operations.

The continued strength of the Alliance depends on delivering when and where it matters. NATO must maintain its willingness to react flexibly beyond its borders and to deter and disrupt threats before they reach us. It must keep up the pace of its transformation to ensure that it can provide modern structures and forces that are ready to deliver the right military responses. That means capabilities that harness technology and exploit information to enable us to act quickly, accurately and decisively. It also means improved mechanisms for generating such forces with a strengthened commitment from our allies to providing them.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41021-17_para5">
Against that background, we are working with our EU partners to improve European military capabilities. As the new constitutional treaty makes explicit for the first time, NATO remains &quot;the foundation&quot; of our collective defence. Our aim is to develop European military forces that enhance NATO as well as the EU. The EU battle groups initiative will establish coherent force packages of very rapidly deployable troops, trained and evaluated to agreed standards. Open and transparent liaison will ensure that those battle groups are fully compatible with the NATO response force and by driving the development of the right capabilities by our EU allies, the battle groups concept will be central to our efforts to manage overstretch. European defence will therefore complement NATO. The EU can bring together a range of crisis management responses&#151;diplomatic, military, civilian, judicial and economic. Its new civilian-military cell is an example of that potential. Such capabilities will fill crucial gaps in the mechanisms now available for handling the current complex security environment.

<a name="41021-18_para4">
The restructuring will provide the Army with a better balanced mix of capabilities, from tanks and artillery at the heavy end through to enhanced medium- and light-weight capabilities, to increase the deployability of our land forces. These lighter forces are essential if we are to combine speed of deployment with protection and firepower.

<b>21 Oct 2004 : Column 1061</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="41021-18_para5">
The key element however is the restructuring of the infantry, made possible by progress towards a lasting peace in Northern Ireland. Here, we have been able to reduce by four the number of infantry battalions continuously available for the Province. In practice, the commitment is for 16 battalions, as a result of the requirement to rotate battalions through this task with 24-month tour intervals.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41021-18_para6">
By reducing the number of infantry battalions by four, the manpower released will be redistributed across the Army, to develop more robust and resilient unit establishments within the infantry and to bolster the most heavily committed specialists, such as logisticians, engineers, signallers and intelligence staff. The phasing out of the historic practice of infantry arms plotting&#151;under which whole units are required to move location and re-role every few years&#151;will also further increase the efficiency and availability of Army resources.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41021-18_para7">
However, that requires us to move individuals between battalions for career development, and to increase breadth of experience. In order to preserve the regimental system and the unquestioned value that it brings, that argues for a future infantry structure based on large regiments of two or more battalions. Those who support the end of arms plotting&#151;and from time to time I hear from people who do&#151;must explain how they would do it if they were not to adopt the approach that we have proposed. On that matter, I have heard nothing at all from Opposition Front-Bench Members.

 In a moment. Since the White Paper&#039;s publication last year, the phrase that I have heard most from civilians pontificating about it is the importance of having &quot;boots on the ground&quot;. They are right, of course, but the changes that we are introducing will ensure that we have more forces available for operations, while at the same time reducing the burden of operational commitments for both our people and their families.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41021-18_para8">
The changes will mean a new structure for the infantry. We will preserve the strengths of the regimental system, at the same time as providing a more modern structure. The service chiefs and I are determined that the Army should be a modern organisation, capable of adapting to the challenges of the future.
</p>





<p><a name="41021-18_spnew15"><b> Mr. Francois: </b> 
 It is surely a mistake to reduce the Regular Army by four infantry battalions. When people ask for British troops to be deployed around the world, it is primarily an infantry battalion that they ask for. Is it not significant that the US&#151;the most powerful military power on earth&#151;asked for an infantry battalion when it needed reinforcements? The request was not for signallers or logisticians: it was for British infantry. If the US Army recognises the importance of British infantry battalions, why does not the MOD?
</p>





<p><a name="41021-18_spnew16"><b> Mr. Hoon: </b> 
 Because, as I said in my earlier statement, we will also be deploying signallers and logisticians to

<br>&nbsp;<br>support the infantry that we supply. The hon. Gentleman generally approaches these matters thoughtfully and with an open mind. I invite him to consider the issue that the Government have faced, which is no different from the issue that a previous, Conservative Government faced. In fact, we have reached the same conclusion: if we want to deploy in several operations around the world, the key enablers of those deployments are the people we have been discussing&#151;signallers, logisticians, engineers and intelligence personnel. Those are the people who have been most stretched during recent operations.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41021-18_para9">
One answer&#151;I hear it sometimes from Opposition Front Benchers&#151;is that we should not take on so many operations. When I ask which operations we should refuse to take on, I am usually met with silence. Assuming that we have to take on the operations, we have to provide the right support. The Army recognises that we need to augment the people who are most stretched, and we can do that only by using our existing resources more efficiently.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41021-18_para10">
If an opportunity is created by a draw-down in Northern Ireland to improve the balance of our Army, it is sensible to take it, rather than to consider the issue in terms of boots on the ground or regimental history. We must ask what is best for the current structure of the Army, what is best for the future and how we achieve those requirements. We have reached the same answer as the Conservative Government did in &quot;Options for Change&quot;&#151;a reduction in the number of infantry battalions, but an increase in the number of enablers. That is all that we are doing.
</p>





<p><a name="41021-18_spnew17"><b> Mr. Francois: </b> 
 I thank the Secretary of State for allowing me a second bite at the cherry. The mistake that he makes is to assume that it is a zero-sum game and that the Army has to be a fixed size, and that therefore, he has to rebalance between infantry and supporting arms. In fact, the way to solve the problem&#151;although it would not be easy&#151;would be to retain those four battalions and address directly the retention issues that cause people to leave the regular Army. If fewer people left, we would have sufficient soldiers to retain the four regular battalions and provide the extra logistic units that we need. That is the way to solve the problem. The Secretary of State knows that I and many of my hon. Friends have been talking about the importance of retention for many years. His approach would be a mistake.

<p><a name="41021-19_spnew0"><b> Mr. Hoon: </b> 
 We are directing our attention to the question of retention, which is an important issue. We have also been remarkably successful recently in recruitment, so that the Army has grown. However, we have to plan not only for this year and next, but for the strategic environment that we have to face for decades to come. That means having the right kinds of structures. For example, the armed forces are facing up to a significant demographic change. They have to recruit competitively among a reducing number of 16, 17 and 18-year-olds and that inevitably means that they have to consider the right mix. We also need to provide our forces with the right training and capabilities to equip them for the job that they do for us today and for opportunities in the future in the civilian job market. The kinds of skills and capabilities that I am describing, 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>21 Oct 2004 : Column 1063</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>such as those associated with technology and modern forms of communication, mean that our people are highly prized when they leave the armed forces for civilian employment.
</p>





<p><a name="41021-19_spnew1"><b> Mr. Luke: </b> 
 My right hon. Friend mentioned the issue of larger regiments. In Scotland, the changes would mean a super-large regiment, with five or six Scottish regiments&#151;depending on the conclusions of the review of the colonels&#151;joining into one organisation. What is the benefit of that compared with the traditional structure: a Scottish division with six regiments that could keep their local and national identities, which are so closely identified with the national spirit of Scotland?
</p>





<p><a name="41021-19_spnew2"><b> Mr. Hoon: </b> 
 There is a simple, short and&#151;I hope&#151;compelling answer to my hon. Friend&#039;s question. We intend to end arms plotting, which is the traditional practice of moving regiments around the country, so that every two years entire regiments, together with their families, are required to move, sometimes from one end of the country to the other and sometimes to re-role&#151;to train for many months&#151;which means that they are no longer available. What we are proposing will provide much greater stability. My hon. Friend rightly values the local connection and our proposals will provide a much better local connection with the new, larger regiments. They will have to be larger, because a single battalion regiment would be fixed in a single place, without the opportunity for career development and change that a larger structure will provide.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41021-19_para0">
I hope that my hon. Friend is persuaded by that argument, because it will be of huge benefit to the men and women who serve, as well as their families. If he is not, I should point out that the new structure is the existing structure of large parts of the present Army. We have already moved to a larger regiment structure. Indeed, that was proposed by the Conservative Government, who unfortunately did not see it through. I suspect that they were afraid of complaints from their older and bolder Members in the Tory shires. The Army strongly supports the new structure and the Army Board recommends it.

 The Secretary of State has been generous in giving way and I am grateful to him. Will he accept that there is cross-party opposition to the disbandment of the King&#039;s Own Scottish Borderers, the Royal Scots and the other Scottish regiments? We now learn that the Scottish council of colonels has recommended not only that they should lose their regimental status, but that the KSOB and the Royal Scots should be further amalgamated into a single battalion. Will the Secretary of State accept the importance of tradition and identity and quash that ludicrous idea?

<p><a name="41021-19_spnew5"><b> Mr. Greenway: </b> 
 I am listening very carefully to the Secretary of State&#039;s remarks, and I have two comments to make. First, the historic link between some of the regiments and their local communities is hugely valuable to the British Army. I asked the Prime Minister a question a few weeks and I was able to point out that many people believe that those links are what make the British Army the envy of the world, especially in its peacekeeping role. Secondly, the Secretary of State&#039;s answers today seem to suggest that he has made up his mind. When will he make a formal announcement about what is to happen, to end the speculation? Can we be certain that we will retain the three Yorkshire cap badges that we now have?
</p>





<p><a name="41021-19_spnew6"><b> Mr. Hoon: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman makes his point well and rightly emphasises the historic connections between regiments and local communities. However, under arms plotting, regiments are not necessarily based in their historic localities. Part of the new structure will allow predictability for families. The hon. Member for Rayleigh (Mr. Francois) mentioned retention, but one of the most damaging influences on retention, especially for modern families, is the practice of moving every two years. These days, wives&#151;it is mostly wives&#151;have jobs and children go to local schools. Families have all sorts of connections with their communities. It is incredibly damaging to retention to require families to move every two years because of arms plotting. These proposals will overcome that, and the regional structure that might then develop will strengthen the local connection that the hon. Member for Ryedale (Mr. Greenway) praises. It will also provide a greater degree of predictability for the families who, instead of having to move every two years, will be able to establish roots in an area. I hope that that will provide enormous benefits and is a sufficient explanation.

On the Secretary of State&#039;s points about the great single regiments&#151;the infantry regiments&#151;I hope that he truly understands the links between those regiments; indeed, he must, because the Worcestershire and Sherwood Foresters recruit in his area. It is interesting that the Black Watch, which is to take part in a major deployment outside its area, has 265 years of loyal service to the Crown, and the impact on the regiment of the changes that have been announced has been an unhappy one&#151;deeply imbued as it is with a sense of its identity, traditions and ethos.

As a great trading nation, we have global, commercial and strategic interests to protect.

Those threats should not be considered in isolation, as separate entities and unrelated challenges. A rogue state may support international terrorism. A terrorist could seek to obtain illegal weapons of mass destruction and would, given the opportunity, certainly use them. The role of our armed forces in projecting power and defending our values is beyond price and is perhaps the most golden and valuable asset that our country holds in trust. It is against that scenario that the armed forces have to plan and operate.

<a name="41021-19_para11">
Indeed, the Government accept that, over the past seven years, the definition and range of Britain&#039;s interests has widened beyond even that foretold in the strategic defence review, as the Secretary of State regularly says, and as a result, the military tasks demanded of our armed forces have become more and more intensive. Thus, certain proposals in the future capabilities paper seem quite astonishing.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41021-19_para12">
The recent defence White Paper represents a shift away from an emphasis on numbers of platforms, as the Secretary of State said, and of people to a new emphasis on effects and outcomes&#151;nobody can say that is not important&#151;and exploitation of the opportunities presented by new technologies and network-enabled capability. Its central theme is rebalancing and transformation. We recognise the importance of both. However, what is sometimes defined as America&#039;s new way of war, which includes such concepts as effects-based operations and network-centric warfare, should not be allowed to cloud the fact that although new technologies can certainly be crucial assets at a tactical level, they must not be confused with ensuring that our armed forces have sufficient manpower and equipment to carry out their tasks.

<a name="41021-19_para13">
It is our judgment that the Government are moving away from the proper balance required between manpower and technology. The Secretary of State&#039;s theory, expounded in his statement in July, that measuring capability in our armed forces by the number of units or platforms in their possession will no longer be significant&#151;a statement he has broadly repeated this afternoon&#151;is plain wrong.

As I was saying, I find myself in profound but respectful disagreement with the Secretary of State on the question of numbers. Despite the Treasury&#039;s insistence, numbers remain, in my view, the crucial issue. Which plane, which ship or which brigade can be in two places at once?

That remains our position.

If, due to a disappointing judgment by the electorate, we were unfortunately not in a position to undo what had been done, we would not be able to carry that out, but if the amalgamations had not taken place, they would not take place under us.

Can the Black Watch really be in both Basra and Iskandariya?

The Secretary of State should have learned the lesson that numbers matter, especially numbers in the infantry. At a time when there is a considerable danger of terrorism at home and abroad and major military deployments overseas, there can be no military logic or sense in cutting infantry or manpower numbers. It makes no sense to Conservative Members to reduce the number of regular soldiers given that the Army has to be constantly reinforced on operations by an increasing number of our remarkable Territorial Army soldiers&#151;they deserve huge credit, as do their employers.

We are in favour of scrapping the arms plot, and we certainly agree unequivocally that there is a need to rebalance so that we can meet the demands of likely operations.

<br>&nbsp;<br>people remain unprotected from missile attack. There are rogue states developing such missiles. We therefore believe that the UK should work closely with the United States to enable us to share in that protection. What is the Secretary of State&#039;s view?
</p>





<p><a name="41021-21_spnew2"><b> Mr. Keetch: </b> 
 The shadow Secretary of State is rightly asking the Government a number of important questions and I, too, hope that we will get some answers. Perhaps he could state the Conservative party&#039;s position. Would he accept the stationing of US interceptors on British soil in Mid-Sussex or anywhere else, assuming that those interceptors were designed to prevent an attack on the American homeland but would not cover the British homeland?
</p>





<p><a name="41021-21_spnew3"><b> Mr. Soames: </b> 
 There would clearly be no question of their going to Mid-Sussex, not least because we have a major international airport just outside and it might not be a desperately good idea for time-keeping. This is a serious matter. Our view&#151;my hon. Friend the Member for Ryedale (Mr. Greenway) has made it plain&#151;is that we need to know what the options are. We are not party to these things any more than the hon. Gentleman is. These are important decisions. Quite apart from the knockaround of party politics, these are fundamental decisions, as are the onerous decisions that the Secretary of State will shortly have to take on Trident. We are entitled to know, and certainly the constituents of my hon. Friend are entitled to know, what is the Government&#039;s intention, what is involved in the MOU and how the Secretary of State intends to move it forward.
</p>





<p><a name="41021-21_spnew4"><b> Mr. Greenway: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is right to say that it is an important matter. He refers to party political knockaround. I can tell him that the Liberal Democrats on North Yorkshire county council have tabled a motion for their meeting next week, and doubtless the matter will be discussed. That is why we want to get as much information as we can ahead of that meeting. People are genuinely concerned across all parties.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41021-21_para3">
Does my hon. Friend agree personally that it would be sheer lunacy to locate missiles and radar on the same base? Ought we not to consider, if we need antiballistic missiles, siting them at sea rather than on the mainland?
</p>





<p><a name="41021-21_spnew5"><b> Mr. Soames: </b> 
 I have always subscribed to the saying that one should not put all one&#039;s baskets in one egg. It is unlikely that that would be a sensible view. My view of the Liberal Democrats is that they are always tabling motions. If I were my hon. Friend, I would not tangle with the people on the North York Moors national park committee. I think they know what they are talking about. The stand that my hon. Friend is taking is correct. People are entitled to know what is involved, what decisions need to be taken and what the implications are for them.

I shall turn to NATO and the European Union and then I will stop banging on; I apologise for taking so long. I have often expressed in the House my concerns about NATO and our anxieties for it. We attach huge importance to it, as does the Secretary of State.

<br>&nbsp;<br>into separate defence structures within the European Union and outside NATO contributes to that process. Furthermore, the EU is now preparing to take over the main military responsibilities in Bosnia and Herzegovina from NATO by the end of 2004. That will create no additional or different military capabilities.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41021-21_para5">
Indeed, some forces in Bosnia will remain under NATO command. The overall commander of the EU mission is NATO&#039;s Supreme Allied Commander Europe; the over-the-horizon back-up forces will be NATO&#039;s. NATO retains the responsibility for Kosovo. What added value do complicated military arrangements, which are designed purely to involve the EU, bring to the situation? Do not they further deeply complicate an already difficult problem?
</p>

<p>
<a name="41021-21_para6">
In Brussels, the EU has established its military staff with a developing operational planning capability. That has led to the creation of NATO liaison arrangements in the EU military staff and a complementary EU presence at Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe. That is a circular and, in our view, inadvisable and unnecessary process. What is the justification for the institutional tangle? After all, all soldiers and anyone to do with military operations know that simplicity must be the key. NATO struggled to find extra troops to provide security in the recent elections in Afghanistan and eventually fell short of its target.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41021-21_para7">
Six months ago, NATO seriously contemplated taking overall responsibility for military operations in Iraq but it has ended up sending a small number of soldiers on a training mission. Are not the Government truly concerned that, while the EU defence project gathers momentum, many European allies remain unwilling to enhance their defence capabilities? They show reluctance to engage in robust military operations and appear to have diminishing enthusiasm for the NATO alliance.
</p>





<p><a name="41021-21_spnew6"><b> Mr. Hoon: </b> 
 I believe that the hon. Gentleman was a Minister when his Prime Minister, John Major, signed the Maastricht treaty, which contained a specific provision that called for the development of an EU defence policy. Did he support the policy at the time or did he have his fingers crossed?
</p>





<p><a name="41021-21_spnew7"><b> Mr. Soames: </b> 
 I believe that we all signed up to the policy; the wiring diagram presents the problem. The Secretary of State knows that well because he is at the centre of the matter. He is a good European and he wants to do the right thing by NATO and the EU, as I do. We are not currently doing the right thing by either of them. We must put that right. The complications of confusing EU and NATO operations are serious. There are, of course, honourable exceptions, but are not the Government worried about the EU&#039;s diversion of attention from the genuine security problems that it faces?

</p>

<p>
<a name="41021-21_para10">
I am delighted that the Defence Committee report has been tagged on to the debate. We are discussing defence, which is the responsibility not only of the Ministry of Defence. Joined-up government is supposed to mean, and largely does mean, the involvement of a whole spectrum of Departments, and even policing and the private sector in considering acts of terrorism.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41021-21_para11">
It is inevitable that the debate will be dominated by Iraq. The decision to deploy is clearly important and has excited a great deal of comment. The Defence Committee has invited the Secretary of State to give evidence. I hope that that will happen soon and that he will elucidate the Government&#039;s intentions even further. I say in advance that I am persuaded of the argument for deploying troops but I would have been nervous if our troops were to be deployed with the Americans in attacking Falluja.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41021-21_para12">
Many people have argued over the years that the Americans are never prepared to take casualties, yet they have taken more than 1,000. We who say that Britain is prepared to take casualties and that our troops are superior now argue that we should not put our soldiers in harm&#039;s way. Perhaps we can try to accept that being in the Army is a dangerous occupation. We must not throw people needlessly into an environment that replicates the Somme; that has not happened. The position in Baghdad clearly will be more complicated and dangerous than Basra province, but the decision was made because it was necessary.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41021-21_para13">
In deploying our forces, we should ensure that they have the proper training and proper support from the United States. I suspect that there is no &quot;A to Z&quot; of Basra, or, indeed, any city in Iraq. Since the soldiers do not know their way around and are in a new environment, they will need support. I want them to be well prepared and politics should not insist that they are projected north immediately. There must be proper preparation because they are not, as some might argue, undertaking the same operation in another area. The operation is different and we must do all that we can&#151;I am sure that the Ministry of Defence and the military leadership will do that&#151;to reduce the risk to our armed forces as far as is humanly, militarily and politically possible.

I do not like people who deprecate the Liberal Democrats because they did not support the war. They want our armed forces to be retained in Basra. I rejoice in the Liberal Democrats&#039; support for British armed forces anywhere in the region. That is a step forward and I am happy with that limited support.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41021-21_para16">
Those who are prepared for our armed forces to be deployed further north in an environment of greater risk will have a nervous few months. It is argued that the decision is a military matter. It is, but we fought hard in this country to secure civilian control over the military and we have done that. The idea that the military make decisions is fantasy. They can advise but, ultimately, a politician&#151;the Secretary of State, the Prime Minister or a Cabinet Committee&#151;rejects or accepts the recommendation. We should be honest and say that it is a political-military decision because the military cannot operate in a political vacuum. Their role is to deliver the military contribution to wider, cross-governmental strategy, to paraphrase the defence White Paper.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41021-21_para17">
It is fair to say that the military advice was strong. We need to send a small force, and the troops chosen are well trained and highly motivated. Members of the Black Watch are among the best troops in the British Army and probably any army. Our best wishes must go to our armed forces, any of the alliance armed forces and the Iraqi people, who are facing appalling dangers in the present environment.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41021-21_para18">
The defence White Paper does not seem lengthy, but it is a good document. The Defence Committee produced a report that has been tagged to the debate, and generally speaking, we agree with most of the White Paper. I like the threat assessment, which is realistic. Perhaps a few things were left out that should have been part of that assessment. The Government are absolutely right in saying how they need to develop our equipment programme. I have one or two comments on procurement to make, perhaps in the next debate on defence. However, the Government are right to try to plan to deal with what warfare will be like in the next decade, rather than thinking about the last war and viewing the next fight as merely an extrapolation of the experienced gained on an earlier occasion, as Governments and the military have tended to do in the past. I am afraid that history reveals that that is not a very sensible way for politicians or the military to proceed.

The point that I would make to the hon.

The idea that I have been nice to Defence Ministers is a matter of amusement to me and, I am sure, to the Minister of State.

In the Committee report, we considered two themes that run through the White Paper.

We are concerned about the procurement process and the failures in procurement that the National Audit Office regularly details.

I will take no advice from the Conservatives on how to cut regiments, having gone through the process of &quot;Options for Change&quot; and written a book on how my regiment&#151;the Staffords&#151;survived the Conservative Government.

It is bonkers to eliminate regiments. It must not be done, and surely it is within the wit and the intelligence of the Ministry of Defence to say yes to our request. I sense that the Secretary of State is moving towards retaining a regimental tradition that goes beyond allowing regiments just to produce a magazine and have a cap badge to having something that is identifiably and seriously regimental, within the framework of a broader organisation. If that can be done, some of the criticism will be reduced.

 I asked the Ministry of Defence to tell me the regiments and the units to which the Army&#039;s decision makers belong.

</p>

<p>
<a name="41021-23_para0">
I shall be brief. Although I am not subject to time constraints, I want others to speak. It is clear that the level of insurgency in Iraq is increasing by the day. That underlines what we and others in the House said about the number of troops in Iraq immediately after the so-called victory last May and the number that continue to be there. As the Chairman of the Defence Committee said, we supported the presence of British troops in our sector and we will continue to do so. However, until there are more troops from other nations&#151;not from Britain and America&#151;and particularly from Muslim nations taking part in the policing and patrolling of that country, we will not be able to demonstrate adequately to the people of Iraq that it is not a force of occupation, but a force of liberation designed to help their country succeed.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41021-23_para1">
That is why the Government and the United States Government have an awesome responsibility to do whatever they can to try and secure troops from other nations. They also have an awesome responsibility, as other hon. Members have said, to conduct operations in Iraq in a sensible way. I draw to the attention of the House a report on the BBC a few hours ago, according to which the symbolic head of the Association of Muslim Scholars said that if an attack on Falluja by the US or others were carried out as many in the House suspect it would be, he would boycott the elections to be held in January.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41021-23_para2">
I hope that such a boycott will not happen. I hope that the elections will be successful because they are essential for building a prosperous and democratic Iraq, to which we all sign up. In the attack on Falluja it behoves US forces to act in such a way as to minimise civilian casualties as far as possible, as we would do with our forces. We must ensure that the Americans try to do that as well.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41021-23_para3">
There has been huge cross-party support for the action in Afghanistan. Few in the House objected to it. The Taliban regime had to be removed and military action was necessary. One of my concerns about going into Iraq was that we had not sorted out Afghanistan before we did so. Now drug production levels in Afghanistan are higher than when the Taliban were in power. Of course, Britain is doing its bit and the deployment of more GR7 Harriers mentioned by the Secretary of State is to be welcomed, but we must ensure that that society is stable before we engage in other activities among other nations.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41021-23_para4">
I find it astonishing that because of their domestic legislation, some NATO troops stationed in Afghanistan will not take part in activities to destroy drug fields in an attempt to stop the drug trade. Those NATO members&#151;they know who they are&#151;should look at the internal security of their own nations, which are scourged by drugs. If they are not prepared to do something about the problem in Afghanistan, they need to rethink their policy.

<p><a name="41021-23_spnew3"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman made a point about the Liberal Democrat party&#039;s view. I accept that my party contains different views on different issues, but he was trying to suggest that the Liberal Democrat party takes a collective view. The hon. Member for Richmond Park (Dr. Tonge) indicated that she supports the hon. Member for Shrewsbury and Atcham (Mr. Marsden), and we should take a straw poll to see how many other Liberal Democrat Members support him.
</p>





<p><a name="41021-23_spnew4"><b> Mr. Keetch: </b> 
 Of course, three or four Liberal Democrat Members did not support the Afghan campaign, but the majority of the parliamentary party, the majority at our conference and the leadership and spokesmen at that time supported that action. It ill behoves a Labour Minister to criticise members of his own party who do not support individual military actions. The vast majority of Labour party members in Hereford, such as there are, supported me, not him, in the case of Iraq at least.
</p>





<p><a name="41021-23_spnew5"><b> Dr. Julian Lewis: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman is making a good speech and holding the attention of the House. While we are on the subject of Liberal Democrat defence policy, what is official Liberal Democrat defence policy on the future of the nuclear deterrent? Is it not right that the Liberals would not replace the strategic nuclear deterrent when Trident becomes obsolete?
</p>





<p><a name="41021-23_spnew6"><b> Mr. Keetch: </b> 
 It is funny that the hon. Gentleman asked me that question because I expected it to come from a Labour Member, but I am happy to deal with it. The Liberal Democrats support the retention of an independent British nuclear deterrent. That does not necessarily commit us to replacing Trident with a submarine-launched deterrent system, because there is an important discussion to be had about the kind of nuclear deterrent that is appropriate for Britain after Trident&#151;personally, I do not think that it is a submarine-launched ballistic missile deterrent. Our policy document, &quot;Defending Democracy&quot;, which was produced at the beginning of last year, stated that we retain the principle of an independent British nuclear deterrent.

 I will shield myself behind the view taken by successive Ministers. When I sit on the Government Front Bench, the hon. Gentleman can ask me the question and I will tell him under which circumstances I would do so.

<a name="41021-23_para5">
I shall move on to a number of other areas of NATO deployment. I certainly endorse the Secretary of State&#039;s remarks about the situation in the Balkans, and particularly in Kosovo. The situation in Kosovo is not secure. We went into Kosovo to stop one part of the population committing genocide against the other. Many of us now suspect that the other part of that population is now similarly committing genocide. NATO forces must be seen to be even-handed in Kosovo, and they must protect both sides of the community. For example, German forces were criticised on the ground that their response to rioting in Mitrovica and other places earlier this year was not even-handed.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41021-23_para6">
Perhaps the Minister will pay attention to this question about NATO members because I would like him to address it in his winding-up speech. We have a commitment to emerging NATO states. In particular, I draw the Minister&#039;s attention to a commitment that the Government do not appear to have fulfilled, which concerns the Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. NATO agreed to rotate a flight of three aircraft based at an air base in Lithuania, and the royal Belgian air force took up the commitment with three F-16s. The RAF was supposed to replace that flight, but it told the Lithuanian Government and the other Baltic state Governments that it was unable to do so for operational reasons, so the Danes had to go in. I hope that the Minister will clarify the position in his winding-up speech.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41021-23_para7">
We have responsibilities throughout the world. Hon. Members have mentioned the Falkland Islands, on which I endorse what has been said, but I shall say a word about our dependent territories in the Caribbean. The Royal Navy&#039;s presence in the Caribbean used to be called WIGS&#151;the West Indies guard ship&#151;and some of us who have served on the armed forces parliamentary scheme were lucky enough to spend time there.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41021-23_para8">
We saw the benefits of a West Indies guard ship only this summer when HMS Richmond, commanded by Mike McCartain, and Royal Fleet Auxiliary Wave Ruler were able to provide extremely important humanitarian help to the people of the Cayman Islands. We have a commitment to those places, and in that instance the Royal Navy was extremely useful.

The troops in our armed forces are the best kit and equipment that we possess. I entirely endorse what the Chairman of the Select Committee on Defence said about the proposed changes to the regimental structure, particularly in Scotland. Of course arms plotting should go, for the good welfare and family reasons for which we have argued for some time. However, that does not necessarily mean having to get rid of the regional identities of many of the regiments that are under threat.

There is something of an internal crisis among our armed forces personnel. A few months ago, the MOD issued its internal survey for 2004, which asks members

In response to the question, &quot;Does the MOD look after its personnel?&quot;, of 1,634 members of the armed forces&#151;a 42 per cent. response rate&#151;only 3 per cent. strongly agreed that the MOD looks after its own personnel, while 32 per cent. somewhat agreed and 62 per cent. did not know, did not care or did not believe it. The MOD needs to resolve that crisis.

On Gurkhas, although I welcome the recent announcement that they will have the right of citizenship in this country, why is that being limited to those who have left the service since 1997? They have served this nation very well. They took 23,000 casualties in two world wars. They have won 26 Victoria crosses. Indeed, of the 15 surviving VC holders, four are Gurkhas, yet under the Government&#039;s proposals none would qualify for British citizenship. That should be reconsidered.

<a name="41021-23_para13">
The Secretary of State had some fun with Liberal Democrat policies on procurement in his Labour party conference speech, and claimed that the British armed forces should, at all costs and all times, buy British equipment. However, he is not supported by members of his armed forces, who were questioned about that for the MOD survey. When they were asked whether they were well equipped, 19 per cent. thought that they were and 41 per cent. thought that they were not. When they were asked, &quot;Should we always buy British?&quot;&#151;the issue on which the Secretary of State criticised our policies&#151;21 per cent. supported the view of the Secretary of State and 58 per cent. supported the view of the Liberal Democrats.

We wholeheartedly support the carriers, but they must be considered in terms of the MARS&#151;military afloat reach and sustainability&#151;programme for the replacement of the Royal Fleet Auxiliary ships.

<p><a name="41021-24_spnew0"><b> Mr. Keetch: </b> 
 May I therefore refer to two other areas of defence in the world, Madam Deputy Speaker?
</p>

<p>
<a name="41021-24_para0">
First, on the question of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, it is clear that a number of states are going down the path of possibly procuring weapons of mass destruction. We need only consider Iran, for example, which has at least a dozen sites working in this field and 11,000 people working in that industry&#151;the

<br>&nbsp;<br>same as the Manhattan project, which first developed atomic weapons. There will be no full disclosure to the United Nations: Iran has great missile technology and it has already tested the Shahab 3 to a range of 1,300 km. Unfortunately, it is the view of many of us that the next intention of the United States Government is to move to deal with that problem by military means. I hope that the Minister will confirm in his wind-up that there are no plans for Britain to participate in any US-led strikes on Iran. Can he say whether there have been discussions about that?
</p>

<p>
<a name="41021-24_para1">
Finally, the real threat to us is international terrorism. Our adventures in Iraq have taken valuable time and resources that could have been used to fight international terrorists. While it is easy to put up a screen as some sort of defence, rather like the Maginot line or the national missile defence programme proposed by the Americans, the reality is that the ongoing campaign against terrorism can only be won in the hearts and minds of the people of this world, and will not be fought primarily through the use of force.
</p>





<p><a name="41021-24_spnew1"><b> Dr. Jenny Tonge  (Richmond Park) (LD):</b> 
 Does my hon. Friend agree that one of the things that we can do to fight terrorism in the world is to make progress in the middle east peace process?
</p>





<p><a name="41021-24_spnew2"><b> Mr. Keetch: </b> 
 Indeed; I was moving on to that in terms of my reference to the Maginot line.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41021-24_para2">
One of the other great illusions of current policy is the building of the Israeli wall. I have seen the wall&#151;as my hon. Friend the Member for Richmond Park (Dr. Tonge) knows, I visited Israel and Palestine recently&#151;and while I understand that building a wall might somehow make people feel safer, history has proven that building walls gives a false sense of security, as was demonstrated by the Maginot line. Building a wall on other people&#039;s land is even more wrong.

In this nation, we are fortunate to have armed forces who have served us for many years. Those of us who were not privileged enough to serve in the armed forces have always regarded their distinction with pride. Those who have been privileged to serve, such as the shadow Defence Secretary, perhaps know better than some of us about some of their abilities. One thing that we all share, however, whether we have served or not, is a belief that we must do better by our armed forces, as they deserve more of our support.

In my lifetime, there have been two great Labour Members of Parliament for Hartlepool. I have the honour of succeeding Peter Mandelson, who put Hartlepool on the political map and who played a major role in the revival of the town, both as a Member of the House and as a member of the Labour Government. To the town, he brought vision, determination and great ability. Working with a forward-looking and pragmatic Labour council, he played a major part in slowing and halting Hartlepool&#039;s decline and then establishing and promoting its renaissance.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41021-24_para6">
There are many stories of my predecessor&#151;too many to mention here. However, I will tell one: when asked what item he would rescue from his house in the event of a fire, he replied that he would rescue his Hartlepool United football scarf.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41021-24_para7">
I share his devotion to my local football team, and wish the club every success. I also wish Peter Mandelson a long and successful career as a European Commissioner. I am confident that he will remember his former parliamentary constituency when drafting policies in his role as Trade Commissioner.

I was born during Ted Leadbitter&#039;s time as Member of Parliament for Hartlepool. Ted served the town for 28 years. In paying tribute to him, I can do no better than quote Walter Gill, who said in his &quot;The Hartlepool Story&quot;

While researching this speech, I read the maiden speeches of my two immediate predecessors. What is striking is how they both&#151;30 years apart&#151;concentrate on the problems of unemployment and the social problems caused by economic neglect. Peter Mandelson referred in his maiden speech to apprenticeships being axed, young school leavers failing to find training places and the local training and enterprise council having its training budget for 1992&#150;93 cut by 20 per cent.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41021-24_para11">
When I was growing up in Hartlepool in the late 1980s, unemployment was over 25 per cent., and considered a price worth paying by a Government who saw unemployment as a cure for the disease rather than the disease itself. Under this Labour Government, unemployment in Hartlepool has fallen dramatically to 5 per cent. There are more people in work in the town than ever before. Youth unemployment has been cut by three quarters, thanks to the new deal.

When I was canvassing in the recent by-election, no one said to me that they could not find a job or secure a training place.

A large number of Members travelled up to Hartlepool to campaign in the by-election. Labour Members, certainly, have commented to me that Hartlepool had a vibrancy, and said how great the people are. Members were sustained during the by-election by mince and dumplings in the Cozy Cafe and fish and chips in Seaton Carew at Don Bee&#039;s, had the best pint there is&#151;Cameron&#039;s Strongarm&#151;at the Causeway pub, and at night sampled excellent cuisine at the town&#039;s many restaurants, such as the Lotus Garden, Krimo&#039;s and Cafe India.

I hope that all Members came away with a sense of industry, pride and strength in the Hartlepool character&#151;and, I might add, of how cheeky we are. The town did, after all, elect the local football mascot&#151;H&#039;angus the Monkey&#151;as its first executive mayor, and some people in the town expressed disappointment that the mayor did not take office and attend meetings wearing the monkey suit. I also remember hearing about Tom Burlison, a strong union official who now sits in another place and who used to play for Hartlepool United. Tom was explaining a particularly tight wage settlement with the management to the union lads when a voice chirped up from the back: &quot;Aye, and you weren&#039;t much good at football, either.&quot;

The Hartlepool people&#151;with our indefinable mix of politeness and irreverence, nostalgia about our heritage and ambition for the future, and concern about family and society with unique individuality&#151;are what I love most about the town, and it is Hartlepool people who provide me with the best memories of the by-election campaign and who will ensure the town moves from strength to strength.

There are people like Bob and Roni Farrow and Alex Sedgwick, who play an instrumental role in the Belle Vue community and sports centre, making sure that &#163;54 million of new deal for communities&#039; money is delivered to the people in the estates.

Then there are primary school teachers like Dave Dobson at Kingsley, Margaret Bousfield at Fens&#151;my old school, and the school that my kids attend&#151;and Andy Brown at West View, who have worked hard to ensure that Hartlepool&#039;s key stage 1 and 2 figures are the fastest-improving set of results in the entire country. There are people like Tony Sutcliffe at Hartlepool college of further education and Dorothy Lownds at Hartlepool sixth-form college, who have provided excellent post-16 education in the town and who have enabled more Hartlepool people than ever before to take vocational qualifications or to go to university.

The need for us to consider defence matters has perhaps never been more pressing than it has been in the period since the collapse of the Soviet Union. We face a disparate and hugely varied array of threats that is almost unprecedented in post-war history. Yet the Secretary of State told me on 15 September 2004 that he could not understand anyone making the point about overstretch. If we add to that the Prime Minister&#039;s commitment to our African unity force, and the Government&#039;s proposals to reduce the number of armed troops through the amalgamation of regiments, we begin to see that our troops&#151;who are among the most professional in the world, if not the most professional&#151;are perhaps not being treated in the way they deserve.

We were informed by the press&#151;not by the Secretary of State for Defence or the Prime Minister&#151;that a decision had apparently already been taken last week to redeploy 650 Black Watch troops to the central region of Iraq. The Secretary of State has told us today that those troops will not be taking their heavy armour. We have not been given a specific answer as to who will provide air cover, logistics and communications support. If they are to take only their Warrior trucks, what sort of a force are they? Are they a heavy armour force, and who will supply the air cover, logistics and communications support? Given the possibility of a serious incident&#151;these troops are going into a more dangerous area&#151;we and the general public deserve to know the answers to those questions.

What will the Government do to the Black Watch, following their valiant service in Iraq?

We should note the unsurprising risk of a yawning time gap between the mothballing of our aircraft carriers and the hoped-for introduction into service, by 2012 at the earliest, of their replacement. There is also the risk that the Government will fall into the traps created by their failed smart procurement programme. As we have heard today, both the Chief of the Defence Staff and the Chief of the Naval Staff are worried about our ability to carry out wholly autonomous operations in future. In stark contrast, we Conservatives have an effective and broadly welcomed policy. This country&#039;s armed forces are among the best trained in the world and we owe them a great deal.

On Iraq, in September 2002&#151;well before the war&#151;I made a speech in this House in which I said that I doubted whether there was anything new in the dossier, or whether there were any weapons of mass destruction. In November 2002, I called for a comprehensive plan of reconstruction and renewal for Iraq. Indeed, it is this issue that demonstrates one of the Government&#039;s biggest culpabilities. Before they took this country to war in Iraq, they did not have a clue how to reconstruct the peace, and that reconstruction is still going on at a very slow pace. We need, for example, to ensure that the infrastructure&#151;the sewerage, lights and power&#151;is improved, so that everybody&#039;s daily life is improved. Only in that way will the Iraqi people feel more likely to support a democratic government.

Furthermore, if the people of Iraq are to be reassured that we are not occupiers but peacekeepers, we must build a more broadly based peacekeeping force.

If we can build a much broader consensus with the Arab world, we will face the threat of world terrorism with a much more positive view. In that connection, I support the Prime Minister&#039;s efforts to secure a Palestinian peace initiative. I hope that one of his first actions following the election of the next American President will be to telephone him not only to congratulate him, but to say that now we must seize the initiative in order to bring about a middle east peace settlement. The entire middle east is in a very fragile state. Not only is Iraq, whose oil reserves in the south we have done so much to guard, fragile; the situation in Saudi Arabia is very fragile, and there is a particularly difficult and emerging situation in Iran, Iraq&#039;s neighbour.

We know that Iran has been building up its armed forces and its nuclear capability, so it is vital in any peace reconstruction effort&#151;particularly if we are eventually to withdraw our troops from Iraq&#151;that we build better relations with Iran. We must find a way, working with our allies and through a broad-based coalition&#151;including the French, Germans, Russians and Chinese&#151;to exert diplomatic pressure on Iran to allow the International Atomic Energy Agency full and open access to Iran&#039;s nuclear programme.

Iran is currently the second biggest exporter of oil in the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries cartel, and we must find a way of gaining an assurance that its desire for nuclear power is purely to supplement its locally abundant energy force. To date, Iran&#039;s somewhat dangerous behaviour and failure adequately to fill in the gaps in its report to the IAEA has been the result of a number of domestic factors. Most prominent among those has been the influence of Iran&#039;s religious and political supreme leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, who has consistently, if gradually, increased the power of the conservative factions within his country&#039;s governing elite. We must build better relations with Iran.

I hope that the deployment of an extra 650 troops into the central and more dangerous part of Iraq is not a prelude to deeper involvement in the general morass of Iraq. We must try to build a democratic Iraq, but it will be very difficult indeed to achieve that. Perhaps a federated structure granting some degree of autonomy to the different parts of Iraq may be the way forward. Our Government must work hard if we are to avoid being embroiled in another Vietnam situation. Above all, we must have some idea of an exit strategy, which relies on having strong Iraqi leadership&#151;including strong police forces and armed forces&#151;so that Iraq can be all the more stable in future.

 When I participated in last year&#039;s debate on defence, I mentioned that there seemed to be a reluctance to debate the whole issue of nuclear weapons. In retrospect, I suppose that I have been proven wrong, because for the past 12 months we have spent many hours in the Chamber debating nuclear weapons. Sadly, the nuclear weapons that we debated were the mythical Iraqi nuclear weapons of mass destruction.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41021-25_para12">
It was obvious from the Secretary of State&#039;s opening speech that there is still a great reluctance to debate, or even mention, nuclear weapons. I do not think that he mentioned them on a single occasion in his speech. We should debate that subject. We should debate our own nuclear weapons. We should debate Trident, which has been dubbed the &#163;15 billion mass killer. We should debate the tens of thousands of nuclear weapons deployed by the US and Russia.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41021-25_para13">
We should also debate the 200 nuclear weapons deployed by Israel. We should never forget Mordecai Vanunu, who spent 16 years of his life telling and protesting the truth about Israel&#039;s nuclear weapons while all those around him were lying. Although he has been released from one form of imprisonment, he is now faced with another&#151;being unable to leave Israel.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41021-25_para14">
I make no apologies for returning to the question of nuclear weapons today. It was interesting to hear the Secretary of State&#039;s admission, on previous occasions in response to my questioning, that he was willing to press the nuclear button. He has said that he would be willing to be involved in what would be the greatest act of murder ever committed in the history of this beautiful planet of ours. However, he remains reluctant, and still refuses, to mention the sort of circumstances in which he would be prepared to use nuclear weapons. He still refuses to tell the House who the enemy is, against whom those nuclear weapons are directed, and against whom they would be used.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41021-25_para15">
The Government&#039;s latest attempt to justify nuclear weapons and weapons of mass destruction appeared in their response to a question tabled by my right hon. Friend the Member for Llanelli (Denzil Davies). The Minister for Europe stated:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;Under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty . . . five states&#151;the United Kingdom, the United States, France, Russia and China&#151;are legally entitled to possess nuclear weapons.&quot;&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 1 September 2004; Vol. 424, c. 689W.]</p>

<b>21 Oct 2004 : Column 1090</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="41021-25_para16">
The problem is that that statement is untrue. The Minister conflated the definition of a nuclear weapon state under the NPT with its legality. The NPT, however, is clear on this matter: article 9, paragraph 3, states:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;For the purpose of this Treaty, a Nuclear Weapon State is one which has manufactured and exploded a nuclear weapon or other nuclear explosive devices prior to 1 January, 1967.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="41021-25_para17">
That defines what constitutes a nuclear weapon state, but it does not make legal our continued possession of nuclear WMD. In fact, as Ministers well know, the NPT explicitly requires our nuclear WMD to be negotiated away. Most independent observers will agree that we have failed to carry out that obligation.

 That is a common myth put forward by unilateral nuclear disarmers. Article 6 does not require us to get rid of our nuclear weapons unless or until there is a global agreement by all countries to get rid of all nuclear weapons.
</p>





<p><a name="41021-26_spnew1"><b> Llew Smith: </b> 
 By sheer coincidence, I happen to have the relevant passage from article 6 of the NPT. It states:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;Each of the Parties to the Treaty undertakes to pursue negotiations in good faith on effective measures relating to cessation of the nuclear arms race at an early date and to nuclear disarmament, and on a treaty on general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control.&quot;</p>

 That means the whole world.
</p>





<p><a name="41021-26_spnew3"><b> Llew Smith: </b> 
 I have set out what article 6 states, and I shall now elaborate on that. By refusing to negotiate away our nuclear weapons, this country remains in breach of UN resolutions dating back to 1968, yet Iraq was illegally invaded on the pretext that it was in breach of UN resolutions since 1991.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41021-26_para0">
Next spring, the NPT comes up for review at the UN. It is certain that many nations will rightly press the nuclear weapon states to explain their inaction in respect of carrying out nuclear disarmament, given that two members of the UN Security Council&#151;the UK and the US, which bristle with their own nuclear WMD&#151;prosecuted an invasion of Iraq to disarm that country of nuclear weapons that it never possessed.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41021-26_para1">
Not only does the UK not participate in nuclear disarmament, but Ministers plan to escalate the nuclear arms race. They intend to extend for another 10 years the bilateral agreement with the US that allowed the purchase of Trident and continued nuclear weapons co-operation with the Americans. I objected to that in early-day motion 1407, which I tabled on 24 June and which deals with the US-UK mutual defence agreement renewal and the NPT.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41021-26_para2">
International lawyers at Matrix chambers in London have examined the text of the 1958 US-UK mutual defence agreement, in relation to the text of the NPT that was drawn up 10 years later. In a recent report, they concluded that the bilateral nuclear pact with the US was a breach of the NPT, and thus confirmed what many of us have argued for many a long year.
</p>

As I have pointed out before, the Trident nuclear weapons of mass destruction system was bought from the United States and its warheads were tested in the United States, which also provides targeting technology

 I very much agree, and I would elaborate on that point if time allowed.

<a name="41021-26_para4">
Having invaded Iraq, the US now threatens its neighbour, Iran, over its atomic aspirations. However, as a detailed article on nuclear proliferation in the <i>Financial Times</i> on 9 September pointed out, doubts persist over Iran&#039;s true intentions regarding its nuclear programme. Inspections have not brought proof that the Iranian regime has military intentions. John Bolton, who is President Bush&#039;s hawkish under-secretary of state for arms control and security, said:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;The Bush administration is reinventing the non-proliferation regime it inherited, crafting policies to fill gaping holes, reinforcing earlier patchwork fixes, assembling allies, creating precedents and changing perceived realities and stilted legal thinking.

He concluded:

It is clear that despite it being illegal under the UN charter, the US is prepared to implement regime change wherever and whenever it chooses.

I wish him a long and successful career in this place.

So said Sir Max Hastings, during an after-dinner speech recently. He went on to say that Britain was not yet at that stage. However, our armed forces, especially the infantry, are being asked to do more and more at a time when the Government are intent on reducing that highly overstretched arm by 10 per cent.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41021-26_para11">
Our debate is entitled &quot;Defence in the World&quot;. We have heard about Britain&#039;s unique position in its commitment to the UN Security Council, NATO, the EU, the Commonwealth and the G8, but we should take this opportunity to debate a more thorough review of where Britain should be in relation to defence in the world: whether we concentrate on being policemen and peacekeepers; whether we can be a reactive as well as proactive force; whether we should get involved in pre-emptive strikes and regime changes. Might our close ally, the United States, be growing too reliant on us and be asking us to do too much?
</p>

<p>
<a name="41021-26_para12">
We have not intellectually and thoroughly thought through the world post the cold war era&#151;the fact that armies are no longer conventional, the real and everyday concern about proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and, as the Secretary of State said earlier, the proliferation of weak and failing states, with all that results from that. We continue to spend vast amounts on equipment in our determination to keep up with our American allies, with an expensive air force and a costly carrier fleet. At the end of the exercise, unless we are careful, we shall have an enormous amount of expensive equipment but no one to operate it.

I am grateful to my constituent, General Sir John Waters, a former General Officer Commanding in Northern Ireland, for bringing to my attention the speech from which I quoted earlier. In the post-Falklands era, it was Sir John who came up with the maxim that defence policy has to deal with probabilities, not possibilities, adding, &quot;You never can tell.&quot; That is fine, but what we know&#151;what we can tell&#151;is that we shall always need troops on the ground. What we know is that those troops must be highly trained and professional, and that our regimental system, developed over centuries, is the best proven system in the world to

Today, we heard from the Secretary of State about the surge requirement in the run-up to the elections in Iraq. There are Members on both sides of the House who regard the deployment of the Black Watch as mission creep, although I think that that is questionable. However, I question the Prime Minister&#039;s wisdom in promising at Question Time yesterday that the Black Watch would be home by Christmas. Home to what exactly?
</p>

<p>
<a name="41021-26_para15">
My constituent, Major Duncan Bengough, late of the Black Watch, has raised with me time and time again the threat to his old regiment. Having read through the submissions that I have received I am in agreement with much that he says. I leave it to Scottish Members to argue the case more forcefully, as I am sure they will, but surely the key point is that the creation of a large regiment, such as the proposed Royal Regiment of Scotland, would inevitably mean the end of the existing small regiments. I am concerned that the Chief of the General Staff apparently has a relaxed view about the realignment of infantry battalions, not least as regards my old regiment, the Grenadier Guards.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41021-26_para16">
I want to spend the remaining time allocated to me arguing the case for the Devonshire and Dorset Regiment. The regiment, and its predicament, has attracted much attention in my constituency and the west country in general, not least from the Conservative spokesman in Teignbridge, Stanley Johnson, who has mounted an excellent campaign and has proved to be an assiduous campaigner on the regiment&#039;s behalf. Neither Stanley Johnson nor I can understand the irony that a Government who are keen to push a regional agenda, with regional assemblies and regionalisation, simultaneously fail to appreciate the strong and logical regional aspects of county regiments in terms of both history and recruitment. The Devonshire and Dorset Regiment enjoys the freedom of 15 towns, cities and boroughs across the two counties and two more towns are queuing to grant it freedom.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41021-26_para17">
I shall not get involved this afternoon in what I think would be the best option if a merger were to take place, but I know what is desirable and what is not. There might be an opportunity to bring the men of Devon and Dorset together with their fellow west country men of Somerset and Cornwall in the Light Infantry. That suggestion would have much merit and would create the opportunity to form a new and regionally distinct regiment from Wales, the midlands, the west and the south-west in an equitable and balanced way.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41021-26_para18">
Our county regiment faces a critical time. If regiments such as the Devonshire and Dorset Regiment lose their long and deep associations with counties, and the associations that counties have with them, they risk being irreversibly damaged. Some 85 per cent. of the regiment&#039;s recruits come from, or live in, the two counties, or were educated there or have another close association with them. If the regimental identity were lost or submerged in a wider entity, the long-term viability of the unit would be put into question, irrespective of the cosmetic solutions proposed.

When we discuss geopolitical matters, as we tend to in the House, and talk about the threat of international terrorism and the proliferation of nuclear, biological and chemical weapons, we do so in the knowledge that we will have to face up to and deal with that sooner rather than later. However, the bottom line is that unless we have faith in our existing infantry battalions and the regimental system, and unless we can show that we care about their past and future, we will place them in an invidious position. It is worth considering that as we send the Black Watch into a new sphere in Iraq, so that those who serve in it realise that we are thinking about them and those in other local regiments. They should know that their regiments will not necessarily be merged or disbanded on their return. We need to put our faith in them, and show good faith in them, when asking them to do jobs that many of us would be incapable of doing.

I have to say that we used to say the same thing when we were in opposition. Although it is plausible and gets one out of the difficulties of having to make the hard decisions that confront Governments, the Conservative Front-Bench spokesman did not say whether the new money would be spent once the savings had been made or before.

Had that speech been made 10 years ago, or indeed when I at the same age made my maiden speech in 1983, he would have had to speak of the scourge of unemployment and the effect that it was having on our constituencies. The fact that he did not have to do so reflects great credit on the achievements of our Government since 1997.

<a name="41021-27_para6">
In the debate we are taking a strategic look at our armed services in the world. I accept that the Secretary of State concentrated his remarks on the Army and the situation in Iraq; it could not have been otherwise. However, he did not refer to our strategic nuclear deterrent, although others have referred to it. I remember arguing the case for and against the Trident programme with the hon. Member for Mid-Sussex (Mr. Soames) as it was being embarked on some 20 years ago. The hon. Gentleman thought that it was a good thing and would defend the country; I thought it was a waste of money then and I have to say that I still think it is a waste of money. Whatever the Trident programme has done to our country, it has most certainly consumed a large amount of money, duplicating a capacity that NATO already had. We should have spent the money on supplementing the conventional forces that are available to NATO. It is the case for conventional defence within that strategic framework that I really want to make. Before I do so, may I endorse something that another Opposition Member said about the middle east peace process?
</p>

<p>
<a name="41021-27_para7">
I believe passionately that we must engage with that process and bring others to do that, too. I mean that generally, but also specifically with regard to the United States of America. If anyone can drive the process forward, the United States Government can. To those who complain about American engagement in the middle east, I gently say that American isolationism would be far worse and mean that we could not make progress.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41021-27_para8">
I support the Government&#039;s approach and I especially welcome the renewed naval programme. Now that the costs of building Trident have been met, we can have a naval programme, which sits in the context of what we hope to achieve in the world. It has been well thought through. The carrier programme and the landing ship logistics are right. It is also essential to renew the fleet auxiliaries because some of the ships are 30 years old and older. Renewal was delayed because the money was spent on Trident and there were other, more pressing needs for it. However, it cannot be delayed for long. If we are to play an out-of-region role that relies on ships, the ships must be resupplied, refuelled and re-equipped.

The programme is so ambitious that it will require all the capacity that is currently available in the United Kingdom. In work load peaks next year and the following year, we will need something like twice our current engineering capacity. After that, as the carrier programme comes on stream, we will need approximately two and a half times our current productive capacity to provide the carriers for the Royal Navy.

I urge my Front-Bench colleagues to take a close interest in the public policy issues that surround the important matters that we are considering and ensure that we have an industrial strategy that does more than assume that individual bits of equipment can be bought as if they were regular items that are purchased off the shelf. The huge capital programme needs careful thought and management. I urge a co-operative rather than a confrontational or competitive approach to the industry.

 This is the first time that I have taken part in a defence debate and I have thoroughly enjoyed it. I greatly enjoyed the excellent maiden speech of our new colleague, the hon. Member for Hartlepool (Iain Wright). I do not know if he is especially keen to emulate the colourful career of his immediate predecessor, but he strikes me as the sort of chap who knows the difference between his guacamole and his mushy peas.

I shall confine my remarks to my local regiment, the Black Watch. Our debate is about defence in the world and, after the Secretary of State&#039;s statement, it appears that the regiment will undertake much more of that particular task. The Black Watch was founded in my constituency in a little town called Aberfeldy on the banks of the Tay almost 300 years ago. My constituents therefore have a great association with the regiment.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41021-27_para15">
My constituency is one of the major recruiting areas for the Black Watch. Of course, it goes without saying that there is a great admiration and respect for the most difficult task that they do on behalf of all of us

<br>&nbsp;<br>throughout the United Kingdom. I need not tell the Minister that a great chill will go through forces&#039; homes tonight across Tayside and Fife when the implications of what has been suggested in the statement are worked out later this evening.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41021-27_para16">
There has been a lot of talk about the Black Watch this week. In fact, we cannot escape from it&#151;every time that we turn on a television set or read a newspaper, there is analysis of what the role of the Black Watch will be, where the troops may or may not be deployed and what sort of task they may or may not be asked to perform. At last, thankfully, after a week of speculation, the Secretary of State has had the guts to come to the House and tell it to us straight. We should be grateful to him for that at least.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41021-27_para17">
It has now been confirmed that the Black Watch will be deployed to the American sector. That significantly raises the stakes and our involvement in the Iraq conflict, and it raises questions about what sort of task the Black Watch will be asked to do. To take that decision without the full authority of the House on a substantive debate and vote is entirely wrong. The public expect us to take such a vote; it is what they think we do. When we significantly escalate our involvement in the Iraq war, I am sure that the public would like to think that the House would have a proper debate and vote at the end of the day.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41021-27_para18">
My first and probably only concern is for the brave young men whom we are asking to perform that new and dangerous task. Those young men will now be put at greater risk, but for what? My heart also goes out to the families who have been waiting for news and confirmation of that redeployment for the past week. I want to echo some of the remarks made in the earlier statement. The way that the Government have dealt with the redeployment has been nothing short of scandalous. Forces&#039; families have been waiting anxiously for news about the redeployment, but the Government have used spin and prevaricated on the issue. We all knew what would happen. I knew last Friday night, when I was contacted by the media on several occasions and asked for my response to the redeployment. If the media knew on Friday and Saturday night, someone must have told them&#151;they do not get these things from fresh air&#151;and what I heard on Friday night was almost entirely accurate given what we heard today.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41021-27_para19">
We heard the Secretary of State&#039;s non-statement on Monday, which was significant for only one thing: he let the cat out the bag in response to the hon. Member for Richmond Park (Dr. Tonge). The alarm bells started to ring for me several weeks ago, when forces&#039; families were phoning my office and talking about a further deployment and a further tour of duty for the Black Watch. There were all sorts of sinister rumours then about the Black Watch being deployed to Falluja or central Baghdad, but, thankfully, that has not happened. When I raised those issues, the Ministry of Defence reassured me that nothing was planned for the Black Watch and that its troops would be home in time. Such faith was put into those reassurances that we organised a homecoming parade for the Black Watch in Perth in the next few weeks. It now looks as though we will have to put away the bunting and flags for a few weeks.

When the Prime Minister rose to his feet yesterday and said that the Black Watch will be home for Christmas, that was a pledge, and we will hold him to that promise. I was disappointed that nothing was mentioned in the statement about when the Black Watch would return. I was also disappointed that no clarification was given: the Secretary of State did not say unequivocally that that would happen. <i>[Interruption.]</i> Does the Minister of State want to intervene?

 In fairness to the Secretary of State, he indicated that he agreed with the Prime Minister that the Black Watch would be home by Christmas.

<p><a name="41021-28_spnew1"><b> Pete Wishart: </b> 
 We will see. The bunting and flags have been put away now, but we will wait with great interest to see the Black Watch come home. If one regiment deserves to come home for Christmas, it is most definitely the Black Watch. Regardless of what the Secretary of State says and his reassurances, morale is now an issue in the Black Watch. The Secretary of State may be reassured by speaking to self-selected officers in Iraq, but hon. Members deal with the families. We have to respond to the telephone calls to our offices from anxious parents who wonder what on earth is going on. We have to try to find the answers on their behalf.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41021-28_para0">
I have detected a darkening of mood since the call was made placing the Black Watch on notice to move. The regiment has already done two tours of duty in Iraq and been away for four Christmases. It is now being deployed to the most dangerous of theatres, but those who serve in it will perform their task with their customary professionalism and high standards. Regardless of what some of them may feel about the politics of the job, they will get the job done, and they will do it well.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41021-28_para1">
It is impossible to consider the redeployment without a cursory glance at the politics. For me, the decision has politics written all over it. I have great difficulty with the military case for redeploying the Black Watch to the American sector. It has been said many times that there is an overwhelming number of American forces in Iraq. America is the last world superpower. If it does not have enough forces, it should bring more across from the States. Why is it that 650 Scottish infantrymen have to go there to back up the Americans in the American sector? What on earth are they going into? A mess of the Americans making. It is a military quagmire because of the razed-earth policy&#151;the shoot-on-sight policy. They will experience real difficulties and I feel sorry for those people who will be asked to perform this most dangerous of tasks.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41021-28_para2">
The soldiers of the Black Watch will once again put their necks on the line for the Government. They will do that with their high standards and professionalism, but they will also do it with heavy hearts, not because of what they have been asked to do militarily&#151;they will follow orders and ensure that the job is done&#151;but because while they do the Government&#039;s bidding abroad, they have been stabbed in the back at home by a Government who are determined to amalgamate them out of existence.
</p>

I reaffirm my support for the campaign to save our regiments. I do not need to tell the Minister that there is overwhelming hostility to his plans to amalgamate them

Members get the petition board out and head down to town centres to get signatures, we are met with hostility and indifference, but not in this campaign. People are queuing up to sign. A little town called Alyth in my constituency has fewer than 3,000 people. I will present a petition next week from that town with 2,000 signatures in favour of saving our regiments.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41021-28_para4">
The people of Scotland have run a vocal and affectionate campaign. What is it about the way in which we organise our regiments that has attracted such affection? It might have something to do with tradition. People might like the way that they do things and enjoy and appreciate the links with the community. I think it is more than that, however. People have the confidence and reassurance that our armed forces are the best in world. They are the best not because of accident but because of design&#151;how they are structured into regiments. That is why they have such significant support from people all over Scotland. Our armed forces are the envy of the world and the way in which the regimental system works is the envy of many armed forces throughout the world. We tinker with that loyalty, determination and comradeship at our peril.
</p>

<a name="41021-28_para5">
On Saturday afternoon we will all come together again to reaffirm our support for the regiments in the city of the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. Luke). We will try once again to rally the troops to save our regiments. That will be cross-party and involve representatives from the Opposition parties and Labour, who will be there to put the case for saving the regiments. However, I am disappointed by the attitude of the Conservatives. I listened to them at their conference. On Monday, the Leader of the Opposition said that they would definitely reverse any decision to abolish any Scottish regiment. On Tuesday, the shadow Defence Secretary, the hon. Member for Mid-Sussex (Mr. Soames), said that any reversal of the decision would be impossible. On Wednesday, there was a clarifying statement saying that they may be inclined to save some of the regiments given the right timeline, situation and conditions. The public are looking for better and more wholehearted support from the Conservatives.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41021-28_para6">
I do not support the war. I never have and never will. I want the Black Watch home. They have been away far too long. What we are asking them to do is a step too far. I want an exit strategy. I do not want any more of these brave young men placed in the dangers that they face today. We must have solutions. Our solution is simple: replace the coalition forces with coalition of forces from Muslim countries. It should seem not like a coalition of occupation, but like a real force for change and democracy in Iraq. The situation is getting worse. We are entering into a quagmire. Let us stop digging and start looking for solutions.

The war was wrong. It was undertaken under false pretences. There were no weapons of mass destruction. We were not greeted as liberators. Because of that false assumption, there was no proper plan to make the country safe post-war. It has not made the middle east safer or the Israel-Palestine conflict less virulent. No link has been proven between Saddam&#039;s Iraq and al-Qaeda&#151;they detested each other. A police state was turned into a failed state, making it more amenable for terrorists to operate in. As regards the war on terror, it was the wrong target. President Mubarak of Eygpt warned:

Apart from the continuation of an arms embargo, I did not support economic sanctions. Some have argued that they worked. Certainly there were no WMDs.

Bush senior wrote in his book that in the Gulf war he did not push beyond Basra further into Iraq to Baghdad because there was no viable exit strategy and American troops would become occupiers in a bitterly hostile land.

<p>
<a name="41021-28_para12">
The mass graves testify to the appalling nature of the Saddam regime, but they were a joint venture with the Reagan Administration. That Administration set out to weaken the Islamic revolution in Iran. It used Saddam as a client to initiate war. It supplied him with weapons, radar and targeting equipment and even facilitated the supply of chemical weapons from German sources. After the 1991 Gulf war, the Bush senior Administration, having exhorted Saddam&#039;s opponents to rise up, suddenly realised that many of them were Shi&#039;as&#151;likely allies of Iran&#151;and refused them access to Saddam&#039;s weapons, but allowed his troops to come through their lines to perpetrate the slaughter of the Shi&#039;as and thereby maintain him in power.

Many people believe the war on Iraq was driven by greed for oil, and I agree, but there are two commentaries that are worth putting on the record in Parliament.

In a flawed assessment of good and evil, the American Administration has afforded itself superiority above the law. These commentaries point to a false perception of superiority in the US and UK, justifying war even when it is contrary to international law and opinion.

<p>
<a name="41021-28_para19">
The vast majority of UK troops in Iraq do a difficult and courageous job, but they have been misused in a bad cause. Their presence with the US troops is the very basis of insecurity. Deemed to be foreign troops occupying Iraq, they generate resistance in the form of a national war of liberation. The US does not plan to leave. It wants its hands on the oil reserves and leverage over neighbouring Arab states, so the insecurity and killing will not end.

There has been no serious effort at reconstruction or rebuilding Iraq for the people. Recently I pressed the case for a small amount of assistance to help the Karbala eye clinic get going in Basra, in the British sphere of influence.

Reparations continue to bleed Iraq of its much-needed resources well after the fall of Saddam. They go to Kuwait and the big corporations, which have far less right to the money than impoverished Iraqis. We now know, thanks to Naomi Klein in <i>The Guardian</i>, that President Bush&#039;s envoy, James Baker, was playing a double game, officially calling for debt relief, but privately, on behalf of the Carlisle Group, promising to maintain the flow of money to Kuwait in exchange for a big payout. That amounted to extortion on the part of the Kuwaitis and theft from the Iraqis.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41021-28_para23">
The UN has been misused in this process. The Foreign Secretary claimed credit for the latest UN resolution, which allows the reparations to continue without being explicit. He cannot have been aware of the Baker role, so he must have been duped. Those reparations are unacceptable. As in the case of Germany after the first world war, they contribute to economic impoverishment and further conflict.

The Abu Ghraib prison scandal continues to have implications, and not only for the United States. The Minister himself acknowledged that UK soldiers have been involved in the administration of Iraqi prisoners and has named two UK intelligence officers, Colonel Chris Terrington and Colonel Campbell James, who he says were &quot;embedded within&quot; the US unit responsible for the interrogations of Iraqi prisoners. It can be argued that, as with business, the legal principle of joint and several liability should apply. The Prime Minister, on behalf of the UK Government, claims credit for the removal of Saddam. In that case, we cannot properly disclaim responsibility for what the coalition forces do overall.

<a name="41021-28_para26">
Many deaths in custody have occurred, a number of which have been at the hands of British forces, and numerous cases are under investigation. The right-wing press in this country is applying pressure to stop the justice process. It points out that the war was illegal in the first place, but the law against wrongdoers must apply. Human rights for Iraqis must apply too, and it is dismaying to see the Government contesting that in the British courts.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41021-28_para27">
The proposed January elections in Iraq are a fig leaf for the Bush election campaign. Elections are, of course, desirable, but they are impractical in current circumstances&#151;I think that that will be acknowledged as soon as the US election is over. The Interim Government are a puppet Government with little support. Shi&#039;as form 60 per cent. of the population, and Ayotollah Sistani is the leader of the vast majority of them. Government should be handed over to him, without elections if necessary, with the agreement that he ensures that Kurds, Sunnis, and Moqtada al-Sadr are represented in his Administration and that proper elections will be held as soon as practical. For that to work, a commitment should be made for the troops to leave.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41021-28_para28">
The Prime Minister chose power&#151;the Bush regime in the US&#151;rather than the 2 million-person march of Britons against the war, who represented majority opinion in this country. That was his interpretation of the national interest. Almost certainly the decision to stand with Bush was made well in advance of the war itself. The justifications have fallen apart and we are left with &quot;we got rid of Saddam.&quot; Well, we got rid of 40,000 others too. The UN Secretary-General has indicated his opinion that the war was illegal. There are many other dictators like Saddam, some of whom are worse than him, but they have not been targeted in that way. The Prime Minister told the House that Saddam could stay if he complied with UN resolution 1441, so getting rid of him was not, as we are supposed to accept, a purpose in itself.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41021-28_para29">
I am running short of time, but I want to make this point: our troops who have been killed are victims of messy, unreasonable politics of ingratiation with the inflexible dogmatist in the White House, whose war on terror is unfocused and costly. Even if he is re-elected, our troops need not continue to die for his mistakes, and I will continue to support the campaign to bring them home at an early opportunity. That is not cutting and running; that is facing up to our responsibility to bring about a solution. No solution is possible while foreign troops, UK and US, occupy Iraq&#151;

My hon. Friend the shadow Secretary of State said some kinds words about my time as a member of his Front-Bench defence team.

That is not what the First Sea Lord believes. He has said that we are piling risk on risk by taking these measures.

Former Royal Navy Captain Ian Jenkins, the Conservative prospective parliamentary candidate for Yeovil, has expressed to me his concern that the future of the royal naval air service base at Yeovilton, and that of people from Yeovil who work there, may be at risk partly as a result of the calculated risk that the Government are taking.

First, the establishment of civil institutions; secondly, the setting up of a force to protect them; thirdly, the maintenance of high military morale, which is not helped by corrosive criticism in the press and elsewhere; fourthly, the maintenance of strong political will; fifthly, and above all, victory in the battle of ideas.

Last night, there was an intriguing programme on the BBC. Its thesis, which I do not entirely accept, was that some of the conflict that went on in the cold war years, and is now going on in the post-cold war years, can be traced back to the ideas of extreme fundamentalism that had their generation in Egypt in the period under Sadat and the ideas of extreme neo-conservatism that, it was alleged, had their generation in America in the period under Ronald Reagan. The only ideas that were not really touched on were those of Soviet communism, which in my opinion also had rather a lot to do with the matter.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41021-29_para9">
But the key point about which that programme was almost certainly correct was that the reason why people are able to get political results&#151;whether they be terrorists mobilising people to join their cause, Soviet communists mobilising people to support their cause, or neo-conservatives mobilising people to back their cause&#151;is that they have an idea. We must have victory in the battle of ideas.

I do not believe that the Government are doing enough to win the battle of ideas in representing to the country what is at stake in Iraq. Earlier this week, the Vice-President of Iraq was here, and I asked him whether the identity of most of the suicide bombers was known, and whether most of them were foreign insurgents. He answered yes to both those questions. Why is a better counter-propaganda information operation not under way to bring out such key facts so that people can see what is really at stake? If we do not win the battle of ideas, we do not win the hearts and minds, and if we do not win the hearts and minds, all the troops in the world will not be able to succeed.

<p><a name="41021-29_spnew1"><b> Mr. Clive Soley  (Ealing, Acton and Shepherd&#039;s Bush) (Lab):</b> 
 I join others in congratulating my hon. Friend the Member for Hartlepool (Iain Wright) on a compelling and convincing speech. I want to comment on Iraq, particularly in the context of the remarkable achievements of our troops over the years in peacekeeping and war prevention. I mention that particularly because, in December, we will get Kofi Annan&#039;s high-level report on the problem of failing states and brutal dictatorships that destabilise their region. Unless we learn to have a sophisticated defence approach to this problem, we will find ourselves in the same situation again and again for much of the rest of this century. It is the key issue facing us and the rest of the world.

I do not believe for one moment&#151;I almost could not believe my ears when people started arguing it&#151;that the deployment of less than 1,000 British troops in Iraq would somehow or other affect the outcome of the

<br>&nbsp;<br>United States election. We might have affected the outcome of the United States election when we sacked Washington in 1812, or when we deployed the Royal Navy to end the slave trade, but this issue will not even be reported in the United States. The reason for that should trouble us; the United States is in an insular mood and is not paying that sort of attention to the world outside. That is one of our problems in engaging with and keeping the United States engaged on wider issues than just the military actions that are necessary from time to time.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41021-29_para12">
There is an underlying fear about this deployment that we must address, and which I ask our Government to address; first, that we might be losing control of the situation in Iraq and secondly, that the United States troops are not as good at peacekeeping and war prevention as some of ours. The movement of the Black Watch is one of quality troops with quality training, who not only can fight effectively but have a track record in peacekeeping. There is a problem for the United States, not because it does not have any troops who are good at peacekeeping and war prevention&#151;it does&#151;but because it does not have sufficient of them, and above all, because it does not have them in sufficient numbers in Iraq.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41021-29_para13">
The big problems that we are faced with now are down to a couple of basic mistakes. The first was the disbanding of the Iraqi police and army, which the British and Americans had never done before. The second is the lack of effective troop numbers, particularly peacekeeping troops, which is why we are losing the battle for hearts and minds, to which the hon. Member for New Forest, East (Dr. Lewis) has just referred, in a couple of key areas of Iraq but not all over Iraq.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41021-29_para14">
In my area, I have not only a Territorial Army regiment but probably more Arabs in my constituency than almost any other Member; possibly more than any. The Arab Labour group is established in my constituency, and is not only fast growing in numbers but fast growing in influence, which I welcome. The Arab-Jewish forum, which I set up as a result of my discussions with Arabs in my area, is being successful.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41021-29_para15">
Iraqis in particular will tell those who talk to them, very clearly, that although they were divided among themselves on the issue of the war&#151;like those in the rest of our country&#151;they all wanted rid of Saddam Hussein. <i>[Interruption.]</i> The Liberal Democrats should listen to this, because the Iraqis had a different approach from the one that they suggest. They asked, &quot;Why can&#039;t you send the SAS in to kill Saddam?&quot; That would of course have been illegal, but if it could have been done, it would have been morally preferable. It could not have been done, but I want the Liberal Democrats to understand that Arab opinion is much more divided than they give it credit for.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41021-29_para16">
Why is it that so many British and American troops could be deployed in Arab countries without any major trouble? Why could I&#151;with, if I remember rightly, a Liberal Democrat&#151;fly over Syria a couple of months before the war in an RAF plane, with the full co-operation of the Syrians? The answer is very simple; they were scared witless by Saddam Hussein. That is why the Arab countries were prepared to go along with it and why there were no riots in the streets of many Arab countries.

<a name="41021-29_para17">
One of my Iraqi constituents told me the other day that the advantage that the British have is that we have the brains to deal with this as a peacekeeping operation as well as a war-fighting operation. He said that the problem we had was that the Americans had the muscle. The United States must get better at war prevention.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41021-29_para18">
I make no bones about the fact that we must deal with Falluja. If we want an open, free society in Iraq, as the vast majority of Iraqis and other Arabs do, Falluja cannot be allowed to continue as it is now. It has become a hotbed of support for Saddam Hussein and for the terrorists. That is why I have no problem saying that we must co-operate fully with the United States in deploying our forces to achieve the desired outcome.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41021-29_para19">
Earlier I spoke of Kofi Annan and his all-important high-level panel that would report in December. As Arabs&#151;at least in my constituency&#151;understand, if we can secure a stable and open society in a place like Iraq, it will spread to other areas. More importantly, we shall have a chance of dealing with the poison at the heart of the middle east; the lack of an agreement on Palestine and Israel. Some Members on both sides of the House have said that we ought to deal with that, but we could not have dealt with it when Saddam Hussein was there. As my right hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, East and Wallsend (Mr. Brown) pointed out, we cannot deal with it without the United States being fully engaged.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41021-29_para20">
By deploying our troops as part of a coalition that has now been recognised by the United Nations in order to bring stability to Iraq, we create the chance of a stable middle east. It may not seem like that now, but the people who are fighting us in Falluja and a few other areas are not there to win a stable, open and modernised society for the Arab people; they are there to stop that happening. We need to be crystal clear about this. We need to see the process through. Whatever our thoughts about the war may have been originally&#151;and I could argue about that&#151;we must see it through, for the sake of the Palestinians, for the sake of the Israelis and for the sake of a more stable and prosperous middle east. That is perfectly possible, but it will not be possible if we walk away, and if we do not behave like a responsible member of a coalition delivering that outcome.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41021-29_para21">
We can carry out our post-mortems over what went wrong at what time, who did what and who did not do what. However, our troops are doing a magnificent job, not just in war-fighting but in peacekeeping and war prevention. If we do not see this through, in a couple of months all the efforts of our opponents will succeed. They are also the opponents of a vast majority of the Arab people, as is recognised by my Arab constituents, and they want to defeat us.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41021-29_para22">
So anything that says that we should stand in the way of the sensible deployment of our troops simply plays into their hands. This is not intentional; I know that the Liberals are not saying that they want Saddam Hussein back. Of course they are not. Unless we recognise, however, that this is an ongoing struggle and that it is going to become particularly intense in the next couple of months, we shall lose something that is far more important to the people of that whole region than it is to us in this House or in this country. We owe it to the people of the middle east to settle the problems of that region after so many years; the world needs that to

 When our young men and women join our armed forces, they recognise that, at some point, they might have to put their lives on the line. That does not apply only to those on the front line, because modern warfare and weaponry mean that anyone wearing the uniform, as well as civilians, could get caught up in what is happening. We need to pay tribute to all the young men and women who sign up    to serve in Her Majesty&#039;s&#151;not the Labour Government&#039;s&#151;armed forces.

The amount of correspondence, telephone calls and e-mails that I have received on this matter in the past 24 hours tells me that the perception out there is that the decision to deploy the Black Watch in Iraq has more to do with the presidential election in the United States than with the Iraqi elections or with peace. The Labour Government need to take that message very seriously; they ignore it at their peril.

I find it somewhat disturbing that, having asked the question three times, no Defence Minister can tell me in how many countries around the world Her Majesty&#039;s armed forces are serving, and have served in the past year.

May I suggest that when the British armed forces are doing so much around the world, as the Minister so eloquently acknowledges, this is not the time to be talking about reducing the size of the British Army?

It is therefore possible to have regional regiments while retaining the community identity.

 We have had a long and interesting afternoon, beginning with the Secretary of State&#039;s statement on the deployment of troops in Iraq. That has been followed by a good debate, in which colleagues from all parts of the House have spoken with passion and knowledge about defence matters. However, it is fair to say that Iraq has been with us like a giant elephant sitting in the room, and the problem, particularly for the Government, is that it is not going to go away.

There are honourable divisions not only between but within political parties. I want to make it clear from the beginning that I do not believe that just because somebody opposed the war, they are in no way capable of supporting our armed forces.

My hon. Friend the Member for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown) made some powerful points about commitments and capabilities. In particular, it emerged that the Black Watch battlegroup will be moving to the north without any heavy armour or UK air support. It would be interesting to know from the Minister what any support will consist of, and whether the American assets in the coalition will provide it.

We should consider the difference between the divisions that exist in the House today, and which existed in respect of previous conflicts in which we have been involved.

Someone sitting in a barracks somewhere in the UK or serving in Iraq who may be listening to our debates&#151;we know that on Monday troops were watching the Secretary of State&#039;s statement in real time&#151;may well be bewildered, to say the least, by the differences of opinion that we have expressed here. They reflect, of course, differences in our society, but it is up to the Government, more than anyone else, to express a clear, understandable strategy and to keep to it. I am afraid to say&#151;I say it with regret&#151;that they have been unable to do so. The muddle over the battlegroup was not just due to the fact that the media have been exploiting it or the Opposition commenting on it. It was a Government-made muddle. If we talk to people in the Black Watch and their families, it becomes easy to appreciate that.

I would like to touch briefly on a few points. Ninety years ago today, the UK was involved in expeditionary warfare as part of another coalition. We sent a British expeditionary force as a junior partner to the French to participate in a short, sharp war in Europe. The then Prime Minister, Asquith, said that the conflict would be over by Christmas. It was assumed that it would be a war of manoeuvre rather than a war of attrition. History does not repeat itself; as Balfour said, &quot;Historians repeat each other&quot;. However, although the circumstances and context have changed, the issues have not.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41021-30_para15">
The first issue for us to resolve is the political-military interface. Whatever the arguments about the British Government&#039;s decision to send a battlegroup at the request of the American military, it is, of course, not purely a military decision. The ultimate decision has to be political. I would like to say, though, that the Government&#039;s real problem is that a large part of British public opinion&#151;and a large number of their own Back 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>21 Oct 2004 : Column 1110</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Benchers&#151;do not believe them. The reason that they do not believe them&#151;this is a tragedy for the UK Government in general and it will apply to the next Government&#151;is that trust has been undermined. That, in turn, has an impact on public opinion and on our troops.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41021-30_para16">
Another 1914 reality is coalition politics and the fact that a junior member of a coalition frequently has to conform to the political direction and the military ethos of the major partner. As the Government spelled out very clearly in &quot;Delivering Security in a Changing World&quot;, they were aware of the
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;assumption that the most complex large scale operations will only be conducted as part of a US-led coalition.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="41021-30_para17">
The Government continued:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;Our primary goal is to maximise our ability to influence at all levels the planning, execution and management of the operation and its aftermath, in support of our wider security policy objectives.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="41021-30_para18">
I have to put it to the House that many people on both sides of the House, and also the general public, really wonder about what influence we actually have over the United States. I accept the fact that, given that we are a junior member of the coalition, many of the decisions will ultimately be made by the senior partner. However, there remains a real question in our minds about whether&#151;even at the Prime Minister&#039;s level in his relations with the President&#151;we have any influence at all on the overall strategy and whether Lieutenant-General John McColl, an able and experienced general, has much influence at the strategic operational level. That problem has been reflected in the sort of questions and worries that have been expressed by hon. Members in the debate, of which, I have to say, the Secretary of State has been rather too dismissive at times.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41021-30_para19">
The next matter to be borne in mind when it comes to the relationship between 1914 and today is the question of attrition and whether we have left that whole world behind. Interestingly, last year&#039;s defence White Paper argued that we should
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;develop our military capabilities so that we can provide as wide as possible a range of options to fulfil operational objectives without necessarily resorting to traditional attritional warfare.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="41021-30_para20">
The word &quot;manoeuvre&quot; sounds wonderful&#151;fast and loose, and as though the other side does not get time to fight and there are no casualties. However, the present conflict in Iraq is attritional at both the political and military levels. The result will be that we will have to put in more resources and that we may have to suffer more casualties. We may not be able to escape that. To Opposition Members, it seems that the rebalancing of our armed forces proposed by Ministers&#151;and there is no doubt that that will mean cuts, regardless of whether the platforms involved are obsolete or not&#151;will risk a reduction in short-term capabilities. In the longer term, many of the systems that Ministers wish to introduce will not be in place for five, six or seven years. That is a very serious risk.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41021-30_para21">
Whatever the rights and wrongs of the Secretary of State&#039;s arguments about large regiments and about doing away with arms plotting, most people outside the House believe that it is totally crazy to think about sending the Black Watch into the firing line only to bring its members back in time for that regiment&#039;s disbandment parade.

<p>
<a name="41021-30_para22">
The question of logistics represents another parallel between 1914 and today. The Secretary of State was right to emphasise the importance of logistics in modern warfare. However, as my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Sussex (Mr. Soames) and others pointed out, it is somewhat incredible to claim that personnel from four disbanded infantry regiments will automatically move into posts as logisticians, military policemen and intelligence staff. I simply do not think that that is likely to happen, but the theme running through every House of Commons or Public Accounts Committee report for the past seven years under this Government has been that there has been a massive failure in logistics, whether that be in logistical organisation or the introduction of computers.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41021-30_para23">
I do not underestimate the serious problems involved in moving from an expeditionary force that takes all its logistics with it to one that uses the sort of just-in-time logistics that are required today. However, it seems to me&#151;and to many in today&#039;s British Army&#151;that we still rely too much on an approach that inevitably will lead to logistics being just too late.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41021-30_para24">
The Secretary of State must sort out that problem&#151;and he must do so not in four or five years, but in six months to a year. Many military commanders have told many hon. Members that, at times, we will get very close to operational failure. If that happens, the Secretary of State may find that he has to defend it at the Dispatch Box.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41021-30_para25">
This debate about defence in the world has been dominated by Iraq. The first message that we need to send out is that although there are divisions in this House and within political parties about the policies that should be adopted in respect of Iraq, we support our armed forces and their families, and what they are going to do for us in the next six months to a year. Secondly, as my hon. Friend the Member for New Forest, East said, we must make it clear that we expect a better articulation by the Government of their policy and vision for Iraq. Thirdly, the Secretary of State&#151;who, with his usual courtesy, has been talking throughout most of my speech&#151;must ensure that he does not become known as &quot;complacent Hoon&quot; in the history books.

 In opening this debate, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State highlighted the invaluable contribution of our armed forces in helping to make this a better and more secure world. In recent times, they have served with distinction, often with civilian colleagues, in Iraq, Afghanistan, the Balkans, and west and central Africa. Despite the wide-ranging views that we have heard this afternoon, one thing is abundantly clear: the whole House is at one in admiring the skill, dedication and sheer professionalism of our servicemen and women. Everyone who has contributed has made that point, and rightly so. We owe all our servicemen and women a debt of gratitude, and our thoughts are with the families of those who have given their lives.

As my right hon. Friend said, the White Paper that we published in December last year set out our assessment of the security environment and identified the three key challenges that face us in the world. The first is international terrorism, which presents an immediate and very real threat. There may be a range of views as to how we should respond to that threat, but what is not for debate is the fact that the threat exists and the barbarism of the individuals and groups involved.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41021-31_para1">
The second key challenge is the recognition that the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery, as well as the illegal trade in their associated technology, cannot do other than pose a further threat to global security. It is naive in the extreme, and dangerous, to ignore that reality. The third is the challenge presented by failed and failing states. Those states, characterised by political mismanagement, endemic corruption, economic collapse, and ethnic and religious tensions, have the potential to create desperate humanitarian crises, as well as providing bases and recruiting grounds for terrorism. We should not forget that it was the failed state of Afghanistan that harboured those who carried out the evil attacks on Washington and New York on 11 September 2001.

<a name="41021-31_para2">
In July this year, our White Paper set out the future capabilities and reformed force structure that we need to meet the changes in the security environment and threats that we now face. We are determined that we shall continue to have armed forces of the right size and shape, and with the right equipment, to meet the challenges of the future. That is a considerable challenge, but it is a challenge that this Government are determined to rise to. The defence budget is increasing by &#163;3.7 billion over the next three years. That is the longest period of sustained growth in defence spending for more than 20 years. We are committed to investment that takes forward the much-needed modernisation of our armed forces.

I have made it consistently clear that no British personnel were involved in, or had knowledge of, the abuses at Abu Ghraib. I wish that my hon. Friend would take more care before peddling such allegations, which are not based on any fact. From my experience as a Northern Ireland Minister, I know that when names of serving officers, soldiers and other personnel are bandied around so carelessly&#151;even when the allegations are refuted&#151;their lives can be put at risk. Some care is necessary. The facts were reported in <i>Hansard</i> in a response to the hon. Member for East Carmarthen and Dinefwr (Adam Price) on 14 September. I ask my hon. Friend not to repeat his remarks.

The hon. Gentleman made a number of points. He recognised the need for reorganisation and transformation of the armed forces. So he should. None of the armed forces of our NATO allies has not gone through such reorganisation and transformation. His record, when he served in the last Conservative Government was, of course, the contraction and amalgamation of regiments&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i> Regiments were amalgamated during his tenure. I shall not go into details&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i> Okay. the Highlanders Regiment was formed through amalgamation with the Queen&#039;s Own Highlanders. The Royal Gloucestershire, Berkshire and Wiltshire Regiment was formed from the amalgamation of the Gloucestershire Regiment and the Duke of Edinburgh&#039;s Royal Regiment. The fleet was reduced in size; the number of submarines fell from 18 to 10&#151;45 per cent. The number of frigates fell from 22 to 19, and the number of naval personnel was cut by 10,000. During the 1992 to 1997 Tory Government, the number of RAF squadrons fell by 15 per cent.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41021-31_para8">
The hon. Gentleman mentioned funding and gave us a great presentation to show that the Secretary of State did not understand budgets and could not explain them very well. However, I know how well my right hon. Friend understands all those things, so I did not recognise the description. I think it is more attributable to the hon. Gentleman. He glibly said that there would be a &#163;1.1 billion cut from other Departments, but he did not tell us which ones. He just plucked the figure of &#163;1.1 billion out of the air. He went on to say that &#163;1.6 billion would come from defence efficiency, forgetting that we have already embarked on a &#163;2.8 billion efficiency programme. He was thus telling us, in effect, that the amount would be &#163;4.4 billion.

The hon. Gentleman must tell us what he intends to cut. I head several Ministry of Defence committees dealing with the major transformation of the Defence Logistics Organisation.

Gentleman about the transformation process, but I can tell him now how difficult it is. The minute we announce any change

<br>&nbsp;<br>whatever, his hon. Friends oppose it&#151;it does not matter what we seek to do or whether it is for greater efficiency&#151;and I suspect that his &#163;1.6 billion cuts would be treated in the same way. His speech did not add up to much of a commitment on defence spending.

Let me deal with the Liberals, whom I find it increasingly difficult to take seriously on defence matters. They are prepared to exploit the anti-war sentiment in the country for short-term political advantage. They are unclear about what they want our troops in Iraq to do&#151;they never spell it out, as yesterday&#039;s exchanges at Prime Minister&#039;s questions proved. The hon.

The leader of the Liberal Democrats, the right hon.

 The hon. Gentleman is correct about that.

 Of course I do not think that at all. I respect those people&#039;s opinion, but I ask a party that purports to be a possible party of government&#151;no matter how far it is from that eventuality&#151;to think seriously about the way in which it has flip-flopped on the issue. It took a firm view on Operation Desert Fox because it had a specific purpose and was consistent with UN Security Council resolutions. However, we then had five more years of the problem during which Saddam Hussein continued to reject and ignore Security Council resolutions, but because the Liberal Democrats identified an anti-war sentiment, they started to exploit it for political purposes. That is why I disagree fundamentally with the hon. Gentleman and his party.

<p><i>Motion made, and Question proposed</i>, That this House do now adjourn.&#151;<i>[Jim Fitzpatrick.]</i>

<a name="41021-32_time0"><h5>6 pm</h5>
</p>





<p><a name="41021-32_spnew8"><b> Mr. John Bercow  (Buckingham):</b> 
 I welcome the chance to raise the issue of child trafficking. In this Session of Parliament, there have been 10 parliamentary questions in the House of Commons on this subject and one truly excellent Adjournment debate initiated by the hon. Member for Northampton, North (Ms Keeble). Beyond that, the subject has been mentioned in a number of debates, but I suggest that parliamentary attention to it has been woefully inadequate to the scale of the challenge that we face.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41021-32_para4">
The United Nations estimates that 1.2 million children are trafficked internally and externally a year. There were 250 known cases of children trafficked into the UK between 1995 and 2003. This number, however, should not be taken as an indication that this is not a significant problem. It is impossible to estimate the true extent of trafficking, owing to the lack of reliable data. The underground nature of the business and the lack of co-ordinated research have hindered progress in explaining its extent. The groundbreaking research paper by ECPAT UK&#151;End Child Prostitution, Child Pornography and the Trafficking of Children for Sexual Purposes&#151;on trafficking in London discovered that social services departments in 32 of the 33 London boroughs were concerned that they had a problem with child trafficking.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41021-32_para5">
No estimate of income from child trafficking alone has been made, but global profits from people trafficking as a whole are approximately &#163;5 billion per year. This evil trade in human beings is big business. The profits are approximately six times those of our most successful food retailer in Britain&#151;Tesco. The profitability of people trafficking is second only to the trafficking of drugs and arms. Indeed, there appears even to be a crossover with those other forms of international organised crime, with trafficked children being used as drug mules.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41021-32_para6">
Large-scale trafficking takes place within countries or to neighbouring countries within the developing world. In west Africa, children are often sent to live with &quot;relatives&quot; in cities, in effect becoming domestic slaves. In eastern Europe, young women are trafficked from desperately poor areas to relatively wealthy neighbouring countries. European Union accession states are prime destination and transit countries for the conduct of this business. In Asia, women and children are trafficked from Burma to Thailand for work in the sex trade, begging or labouring in a number of different industries.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41021-32_para7">
Children are trafficked to the United Kingdom to be exploited in a number of ways. Often Britain is targeted as a transit country on the way to other European destinations. The most high-profile cases are those of sexual exploitation through prostitution or the making of child porn. Children&#039;s lives are shattered by such experiences, but this is just one way in which children are abused. Domestic servitude is a significant problem, although one that is difficult to detect as children are kept away from the authorities. Child labour, organised 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>21 Oct 2004 : Column 1117</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>begging, forced marriage, benefit fraud, adoption and the practice of black magic rituals are further purposes for which children are trafficked.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41021-32_para8">
The high-profile cases of Victoria Climbi&#233;, who was trafficked to the UK by her aunt in order to commit benefit fraud; of &quot;Adam&quot;, the Nigerian boy whose torso was discovered in the Thames; and of controversial alleged baby smuggler evangelist Gilbert Deya, are just the tip of the iceberg.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41021-32_para9">
We must also not forget&#151;indeed, the debate gives us an opportunity to remember&#151;the cases that the media do not so readily pick up. For example, &quot;Dayo&quot;, a 15-year-old Nigerian girl, was trafficked to the United Kingdom for work as a domestic slave. She worked long hours looking after three children, as well as cooking and cleaning. After a few months, friends of the family with which she lived left their children in her care. By the time she was 16, she was looking after no fewer than seven children. She received no payment, was regularly beaten savagely and was subjected to rape attempts by the father of the family.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41021-32_para10">
There is the complex case of &quot;Lydia&quot;, a 16-year-old Albanian girl who was trafficked to Italy by her boyfriend. He had prostituted her from the age of 14 in Albania but promised her a new life. She believed him and hoped to escape her abusive family. However, she was forced into prostitution. She came into contact with social services in London, claiming to have escaped her trafficker, but disappeared soon afterwards, probably falling back into his clutches. Social services in London also had to deal with the distressing case of a 13-year-old Vietnamese girl who was brought to the United Kingdom and kept in a house as a prostitute. She managed to escape after breaking a window.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41021-32_para11">
Those are only some of the cases about which we know. How many more children, who are not fortunate enough to come into contact with a non-governmental organisation or social services department to help them to escape, are being exploited? We need to do far more to combat the evil trade in human lives and help its victims to recover their lives.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41021-32_para12">
First, we need to work with source countries to help to mitigate the factors that facilitate trafficking. The Government are already working with agencies in Romania and the Czech Republic; and the Department for International Development, whose Under-Secretary I am delighted to see in the Chamber listening to the debate, funds NGOs that work on anti-trafficking projects. Despite those efforts, much more needs to be done. Raising awareness of the trafficking problem must be a top priority. Parents must be made aware that they are not sending their children to a better life when they put them in the hands of traffickers. New communities in Britain can help by sending the message to their contacts in the developing world about the grim prospect that awaits the victims of trafficking.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41021-32_para13">
The myriad problems of underdevelopment, poverty, lack of education, conflict, weak institutions and poor governance work in the traffickers&#039; favour. We can combat those by helping Governments to tackle corruption and fund the necessary social expenditure to protect vulnerable children. In Russia alone, 620,000 children are social orphans. Given the paucity of welfare spending there, every one of them is vulnerable to trafficking. The same applies to a vast number of 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>21 Oct 2004 : Column 1118</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>developing countries, which, I am sorry to say, spend far more on propping up their military or police apparatus than on public services or help for their poorest citizens. In Africa, HIV/AIDS has ravaged whole communities and destroyed family structures. Traffickers are targeting the orphans and vulnerable children left behind.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41021-32_para14">
In addition, we need to work to improve children&#039;s status. That is especially true of girls in the developing world who, all too often and deplorably, are treated not as human beings with human rights but as pieces of property and items for barter. Close and extended co-operation between the Home Office and the Department for International Development is vital.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41021-32_para15">
We must expand our support for Governments and NGOs to provide shelter and care for victims of trafficking. In many cases, returned children are rejected by their families or are fearful of returning home in case the trafficker finds them. It is essential that proper provisions be made to prevent retrafficking and to allow children to recover.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41021-32_para16">
We must not return children to an environment in which they are likely, once again, to be exploited.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41021-32_para17">
There is much to be done within the United Kingdom. Recent legislation has criminalised trafficking, but to tackle the trade, we need to work in three broad areas: at ports of entry, in tracking children who depart and in bolstering services for those who are exploited and damaged.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41021-32_para18">
First, we need to build up services at ports of entry. The findings of Operation Paladin showed that the most effective way to intercept the trade is to intercept children as they pass through immigration before they disappear into the world outside the airport and face likely exploitation. Officers&#151;whether immigration staff, police or social workers&#151;specially trained to read body language and identify children at risk should be stationed in substantial numbers at all major ports of entry. In addition, we need to work with airlines, as they may be able to identify children at risk on their flights.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41021-32_para19">
Secondly, let us establish an effective mechanism to track children when they leave the airport. The National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children has recommended the assignment of identity numbers to all risk-assessed children. It is also calling for the establishment of a register to monitor private fostering, as it is suspected that a substantial proportion of the 10,000 children privately fostered in the UK are, in fact, victims of trafficking. Communication between the various agencies involved must also be improved to track children and rescue victims&#151;for example, to provide co-ordination between the police and social services, to target so-called hot addresses that frequently come to the attention of social workers.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41021-32_para20">
Thirdly, in seeking to assist child victims, social workers need to be trained both to recognise cases of trafficking and to handle them effectively. There are no national guidelines to advise social services, and many workers have complained of feeling ill-equipped to deal with trafficking cases. In addition, we must ensure that the support services are in place to help children to overcome their ordeal. Safe, secure housing, education and counselling are all essential. There are currently no facilities to deal specifically with trafficked children. That is simply unacceptable.

As I hope I have demonstrated, the problem of child trafficking is acute, growing and under-recognised. Those who profit from it and drive its expansion remind us of the extent of human evil. They cannot be ignored; they must not be appeased; they have to be confronted and defeated. There is a big challenge to policy makers to act nationally, internationally and in concert with our European partners. I doubt whether there is any difference between the Minister and me about the importance of tackling the problem and protecting children. I have sought to make a constructive contribution this evening, and I look forward to the Minister&#039;s constructive reply.

<p><a name="41021-33_spmin0"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department  (Fiona Mactaggart): </b> 
 I thank the hon. Member for Buckingham (Mr. Bercow) for helping to achieve one of his own demands: placing this issue higher up the agenda of public debate. As he says, it has been discussed in Parliament in questions and the Adjournment debate initiated by my hon. Friend the Member for Northampton, North (Ms Keeble). Nevertheless, it is one of the subjects that is not sufficiently addressed in public discourse, and the hon. Gentleman has contributed to raising it further up the agenda by initiating this debate today.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41021-33_para0">
The hon. Gentleman is right to suggest that we need to keep the bright light of public attention on the issue because the thing that feeds the shady and evil world of the child traffickers is that some people do not believe that things could be so; they do not believe the horrific accounts of individual children who, as he described, have been trafficked into prostitution and domestic servitude in this country. Child trafficking is probably the most grotesque violation of human rights that I can conceive of happening in this country, and it is a trade that transcends national borders and feeds other forms of crime. As he pointed out, there is evidence that child trafficking and drug trafficking work in a partnership that enhances both.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41021-33_para1">
It is clear that we need to work together, across agencies and Departments, with citizens and voluntary organisations if we are to tackle child trafficking effectively.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41021-33_para2">
We know that detailed statistics are hard to come by. One of the problems with illegal trades is that we cannot count how often they occur, but we get into trouble for saying that and are told that we do not know what is going on. One of the fundamental things about illegality is that because it is illegal it is hard to quantify. The hon. Gentleman set out the scale of the problem according to the UNICEF study. A study in 1995 by the International Organisation for Migration estimated that 500,000 women were trafficked to the EU. Let us be clear about this: if 500,000 women are being trafficked to the EU, I would be surprised if the scale of child trafficking was not higher than most estimates suggest, although we cannot get a precise figure on that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41021-33_para3">
There is a serious problem to address. The Government operate in four ways. The first and most important, as I think the hon. Gentleman acknowledged, is to prevent trafficking from happening 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>21 Oct 2004 : Column 1120</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>in the first place. That involves working in source countries. I am glad that the Under-Secretary of State for International Development is in the Chamber. That reflects the seriousness with which the Government take the matter. Indeed, I spoke to the Secretary of State for International Development about it this morning. He was eager to know what happens tonight.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41021-33_para4">
Secondly, we are putting in place an enforcement response to clamp down on the traffickers. Thirdly, we are trying to punish them when we catch them. We will not catch them all, but when we do we need to ensure that appropriate punishment and tough sentences are in place. Fourthly, we need to do all we can to support the victims of child trafficking to help them to overcome the trauma of trafficking and to restart their lives.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41021-33_para5">
On the preventive work, I do not want to talk at length about the work that we need to do to tackle poverty, ignorance and the conditions that make a life of servitude in a rich country something to which someone might aspire. Those are part of the reason why some children&#039;s parents believe the tales. The hon. Gentleman referred to Dayo. Often enough families believe that their children might have a better life to consent to something that they also think might be other than that. It is important that we deal with abject poverty that enables parents to con themselves.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41021-33_para6">
It is also important, however, that we ensure that education is in place. We must have the voice to ensure that people back home in source countries know about the consequences of trafficking. We must help to stop traditional practices mutating into exploitation. The example of west African children fostered over here and turned into domestic slaves, such as in the Dayo case, is not uncommon. We need to ensure that the traditional practice of sharing child care across families does not end up in another Victoria Climbi&#233; case. Children must not end up in servitude.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41021-33_para7">
The first part of the Home Office&#039;s preventive approach is the Reflex work. Reflex Romania is one example of that. Romania is a source country for a range of trafficking. At the beginning of 2002, the UK and Romania agreed to establish a central intelligence unit based in Bucharest, focusing on the organised immigration crime that originates from and transits through Romania. The project started in April 2002 and in its first year of operational activity 105 criminal groups were identified, 48 were disrupted and 90 individuals were arrested.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41021-33_para8">
We have launched a twinning project, which is EU-funded, with the Czech Republic, which the UK is leading and running in partnership with the Netherlands to develop law enforcement in the Czech Republic to deal with trafficking.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41021-33_para9">
The hon. Gentleman asked about the voice of those already in this country. We have been investigating how we can use publicity to raise awareness of the consequences of falling victim to trafficking. Hon. Members will recall that when a large number of Roma were arriving in the UK and claiming asylum, there seems to have been video in Romania suggesting that everything was wonderful in Britain and that people who came here would have all their bills paid and have

<br>&nbsp;<br>a happy life. It is clear that propaganda from the UK can act as a drag, so with non-governmental organisations&#151;this does not necessarily work best when initiated by Governments&#151;we are looking at how previous publicity activity worked and making plans for activity to reach those most at risk of being trafficked. We are working collaboratively with NGOs and the Government in Romania.

The Department for International Development has funded radio programmes, for example, in other areas. We must learn from each example and make sure that as part of our work overseas we fund the message that the hon. Gentleman rightly highlighted. We have committed almost &#163;9 million to the International Labour Organisation&#039;s international programme for the elimination of child labour for work in the Greater Mekong region. The programme involves a number of interventions to raise awareness, prevent trafficking and reintegrate survivors of trafficking into society. That is particularly important for children. If we return them to the place where they were trafficked from, we need to ensure that there is a safe place for them to return to. That may be difficult to assess from the UK, but their future prospects may be better in their own environment with their own language and culture.

<p><a name="41021-33_spnew0"><b> Mr. Bercow: </b> 
 The hon. Lady rightly referred to the International Labour Organisation. In the course of my remarks I referred to the traffic from Burma to Thailand. It is also relevant to recognise and highlight the fact that Burma is in serious violation of ILO conventions in relation to labour. Will the Minister reiterate the Government&#039;s strong discouragement of companies trading with a regime that breaks those conventions?

 One of the things that I do in my broader role as Minister with responsibility for charities is spend quite a lot of time talking to companies about their corporate social responsibility policies. I find it inconceivable that a company can be smug about its corporate social responsibility when it is responsible for investing in plant and managing production in places where employees are denied basic human rights. I am unashamed to say that to those with whom I debate issues of corporate social responsibility. I remind them that they damage their reputation. If part of their corporate social responsibility is to make people feel proud of the company that they work for or good about a particular product, people will not feel that if there is child labour or exploitation, if they do not meet basic human rights standards or if their policies abroad are inadequate.

What are we doing in the UK? I will not list the whole range of enforcement activities that we undertake, but it is important to mention the Reflex programme, which has managed to intervene in 38 organised crime groups. Thirty-eight convictions have been secured for related offences, most of them trafficking, including the conviction of a ruthless criminal who was trafficking young girls into prostitution in London.

I congratulate the Metropolitan police and Reflex on their work, which resulted in the principal defendant in that case being sentenced to 23 years&#039; imprisonment. Appropriate punishments, as well as effective enforcement, are critical.

The hon. Gentleman mentioned Operation Paladin. If a trafficked child reaches the UK, we must, as he pointed out, make sure that the response at the ports is adequate. Operation Paladin was led by the Metropolitan police in conjunction with the immigration service, social services and the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children. It took place between August and November last year and was funded by Reflex. The operation has not found conclusive evidence on trafficking at Heathrow, but significant child protection issues undoubtedly exist. The report made a number of recommendations, which we are examining carefully. I assure the hon. Gentleman that we will take steps to respond to those recommendations, but I cannot pre-announce the final decisions.

In the meantime, a child protection officer is already based at Heathrow. The immigration service is developing a proposal to base social work teams at major ports of entry, exactly as the hon. Gentleman demanded. He is right that picking up vulnerable children at the moment of entry is the best way to protect them. We are also looking to roll out a training course to give immigration officers specialist skills for interviewing children, because some ports or flights will inevitably not be covered. We must try to ensure that immigration officers know how to interview children and the signs and symptoms to look for.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41021-33_para15">
I have discussed the emphasis that we have placed on punishment. The Sexual Offences Act 2003, which came into force this year, introduces comprehensive offences, including trafficking offences, and we must ensure that they are enforced as quickly as possible.

<a name="41021-33_para16">
On support for victims, the most important message is that the victims are children, not immigration cases. We must focus on the point that child trafficking is a child protection issue. It is the business of those who are responsible for child protection to protect trafficked children, whatever their immigration status. I know that my right hon. Friend the Minister for Children, Young People and Families is currently engaged in a robust debate on the Children Bill. I do not want to intervene in that debate, although I will make sure that she sees a copy of this debate, because I know that these issues are being discussed.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41021-33_para17">
If we have effective and robust child protection structures, we will have effective structures to protect trafficked children. Sometimes social services query whether such children are their business because of those children&#039;s immigration status. They are our business because they are children. The leaders of bodies working in social services know that, but we must help everyone in social services departments to understand that they must, as in any other case, undertake a needs assessment and provide services in the light of its outcome. Services must be tailored to the individual needs of the child, just as they should be for any child in need. That is the Government&#039;s commitment, which must happen in practice.

Our newspapers and media are horrified by child abuse, and they are also horrified by the trafficking of children, but they do not know how serious the problem is and the scale of work that is required to prevent, deter and punish those involved and to protect the victims.
