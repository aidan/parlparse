 I welcome my right hon. Friend&#146;s commitment to affordable housing, but may I caution her against returning to the days when we built large mono-tenure housing estates? It is crucial for us to retain mixed-tenure estates. One way of investing in affordable housing to liberate the supply in the social rented sector is to build more affordable housing schemes for supported housing, which shakes people down through the tenancy stream and frees up social housing tenancies.

 My hon. Friend is entirely right, and has shown remarkable prescience.

They all have ambitious and difficult targets to achieve, however, which will be different for each one. What is important is that every site in that programme achieves the standards that would be required for eco-town status, and I have said&#151;clearly, I hope&#151;to those who are ambitious to take part in such developments, of whom there remain many, that they will be required to meet those standards. The standards will not be lowered, and that is why I say that I am not&#151;neither are the Government, and nor have we ever been&#151;fixed to any specific number.

Given the recession that we are entering, is he aware that the Housing Corporation is permitted to finance only up to 40 per cent. of social housing developments, and that the rest must come from sale-for-market properties or from borrowing? Given the dependence of social housing on the private sector, would it not be intelligent to raise the 40 per cent. limit so that the Housing Corporation could make a proportionately bigger contribution to social housing?

 I would like to pay tribute to my hon. Friend, who is a strong Brighton Member of Parliament, but I do not want to do so because Hartlepool United are playing Brighton and Hove Albion in an FA cup replay this evening. He makes an important point; Brighton is a fantastic place, but its large proportion of private rented properties creates an issue. On studentification and its associated problems, he will be aware of a range of possible planning proposals and non-planning proposals. He also mentioned the ECOTEC report, on which I am hoping to consult later this year.</p>

 Despite the current market correction, the need for affordable housing in south Devon remains as great as ever, yet both the proposed new towns, which were intended to deliver much of that affordable housing, are now unlikely to happen for many years because of the credit crunch.

 I am not entirely certain what that had to do with the private rented sector, but one of the things that the Julie Rugg review says is that we must grow the business of that sector&#151;we must improve the supply. That is true of not only the private rented sector but social and affordable housing. As I mentioned in an earlier response, the Government are providing about &#163;8.4 billion to help improve the supply of affordable housing. We need to do that, and we need to correct the imbalance between housing demand and supply, which persists in this country. I hope that Conservative Members will support us in that.</p>

I saw an example this week where someone was living in a poor-quality three-bedroomed flat, yet the rent was &#163;380 a week.

 I congratulate my hon. Friend; as chair of the all-party group on Gypsy and Traveller law reform, she has been the catalyst for much of the progress that has been made. She raises a serious point about whether, in our enthusiasm for investing in refurbishment and providing additional pitches, some may be lost in other parts of the country. The important point for local communities and local authorities to recognise is the benefit that the provision of well-managed, authorised sites can offer. They help to reduce the number of unauthorised sites and mean that there are more levers at the disposal of local authorities when it comes to removing unauthorised sites. We will ensure that we encourage local authorities to continue to provide additional pitches and to refurbish those pitches that are already in existence, as they should do.</p>

 Does the Minister agree that the rules and laws of this country should apply to everybody equally?

That permission is being granted not because those sites are wanted there and not because the district council wants them, but because the council is being forced to grant permission on land for which it would not otherwise do so, because of pressure from the Government and from the regional planning policy. One of the two sites has already been rejected for use in building conventional housing. The other is a greenfield site.

 Gypsies and Travellers are bound by the same planning laws and human rights legislation as everyone else, which means that they should apply for planning permission before moving on to or developing land that they own.

 Let me deal with the hon. Lady&#146;s first point. Local authorities spend &#163;18 million a year on enforcement action on unauthorised sites. If we can reduce the number of unauthorised sites by encouraging local authorities to provide authorised sites, that will reduce that bill. Secondly, I know from a letter that I have been passed by the Under-Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, my hon. Friend the Member for Hartlepool (Mr. Wright), that the hon. Lady has been involved in a campaign that some would characterise as scaremongering about compulsory purchase orders in her community. There is no truth in the headlines.

 Leicestershire lies at the heart of England and is very well served by the motorway network, including the M6, M1 and M42, but the county has much more than its fair share of unauthorised Traveller encampments on both private and public land. Would my hon. Friend like authorities to share best practice in respect of how rapidly they deal with such concerns?

 Frankly, the hon. Lady should know better. Compulsory purchase orders are entirely a matter for the local authority. If a local authority wished to compulsorily purchase any land, it would have to demonstrate that there was a compelling case in the public interest before confirming a compulsory purchase order.

When we brought in the measure, we reduced the rates for charities and sports clubs to zero, and we have a done great deal to help on empty property rates. If the hon.

Obviously, we are aware of the pressures, we are keeping the issue under review and we are engaged with the property sector, but it is right that we establish the context of those empty property rates.</p>

 Could the Minister offer any additional guidance to councils such as West Lancashire district council to ensure that affordable housing schemes are progressed to positive fruition? Sadly, I have to report a number of incidents, including one in which the housing association, working with the council&#146;s housing department, brought forward a scheme costing &#163;800,000, only to find that the planning department preferred it on an adjacent site for which there was no grant. The whole scheme therefore fell apart, with &#163;800,000 or &#163;900,000 lost and no affordable housing built. That is an absolute disgrace. We need some help with things like that.</p>

 We are being asked to vote on the Ways and Means resolution on the Energy Bill that provides power for Ofgem to levy charges in connection with the renewable heat obligation. The Minister will know that the renewable heat obligation is vague. It came in only at the last minute of their lordships&#146; consideration of the Bill, and even the Government will accept that we do not really know what it is, what form it will take, or when it will come in.

However, when it comes to renewable heat, I am not clear what we are giving a blank cheque to Ofgem to do. Will the Minister, when he responds to this short debate, tell the House what powers we are giving to Ofgem, in what circumstances it would levy charges, on what sorts of people, for what purposes, on what scale, and when? It is not without reason that we have been given 45 minutes to explore and probe the provision, and I hope that the Minister tells us what Ofgem would use the power for.</p>

All the amendments to be debated later will do is give us the power, if necessary, to enable Ofgem to levy some charges or make some payments to put the renewable heat incentive in place.

 This group of amendments deals with a number of issues, including carbon capture and storage, the renewables obligation and offshore electricity transmission.

<p><a name="stpa_o17"><a name="81118-0004.htm_para13"><a name="08111874000177">Amendment No. 1 refers to the carbon dioxide storage provisions and relates to clause 20, which deals with the terms and conditions of carbon dioxide storage licences. In Committee, the other place agreed an amendment to require the licensing authority to consult the licence holder before making modifications to an existing licence. Even though this would be standard practice, an express duty would provide greater certainty to commercial operators. We agreed with the arguments presented and I am therefore bringing forward the amendment from the other place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o18"><a name="81118-0004.htm_para14"><a name="08111874000178">Amendments Nos. 2 to 11 are proposed to the carbon dioxide storage provisions in the Bill, specifically clause 34. The clause enables the functions of the Secretary of State and the Scottish Ministers to be transferred, by order, to another authority, or more than one authority, that is best placed to exercise such functions. It will be possible to use the power to transfer functions to the most appropriate and best equipped authority to regulate carbon dioxide storage in due course. For example, if a marine management organisation is established, it might prove an appropriate authority for regulating carbon dioxide storage. The provision will give the House an opportunity to decide later if that is the way in which it wishes to deal with the matter.</p>

The Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee recommended that regulations made under clauses 13 and 27 be subject to an affirmative procedure. Such regulations would specify the powers and duties of inspectors of offshore gas storage and unloading and carbon dioxide storage facilities, respectively. Amendment No. 68 was tabled in the other place to meet those recommendations. We accept the Committee's recommendation to subject the making of the regulations to an affirmative resolution procedure.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o22"><a name="81118-0004.htm_para18"><a name="08111874000182">The second set of amendments in the group relates to the renewables obligation under clause 37. It is our intention, supported by the renewables industry, to introduce a reformed renewables obligation as soon as possible after receiving Royal Assent for the Bill. In practice, that will mean from 1 April 2009, as the obligation runs out at the end of a financial year. However, the timetable for achieving that is very tight. The difficulty is that the operation of the renewables obligation in Scotland is already devolved. The amendment puts the transfer of the reformed functions to Scottish Ministers in the Bill rather than using the longer process of an order under section 63 of the Scotland Act 1998 once Royal Assent has been received.</p>

 We took the view that the issue of biofuels was not appropriate for the Bill. The amendments do not deal with that; they deal with a separate issue of how the renewables obligation will be dealt with and the way in which clause 37 will operate. As I have already indicated, with these Lords amendments we are ensuring that the role of Scottish Ministers is dealt with, rather than trying to deal with a particular issue, such as biofuels. I accept that the right hon. Gentleman has a view on biofuels&#151;we certainly accept that many other people have&#151;but this is not the appropriate place to deal with it.</p>

 I think that the Minister has mistaken me; I am asking not about biofuels, but about the powers under the legislation that could have been altered at this point. It is not a question of argument between us that a mistake was made in the legislation&#151;that has been admitted&#151;and we need to put it right. This is the only opportunity to do so, and I wonder why he decided not to take it.</p>

 I will look again at what the right hon. Gentleman is saying to see what has happened, but I am not aware that any legal point needs to be amended. If he is suggesting that there is such a point, perhaps it would have been appropriate to ensure that it was brought to my attention earlier, rather than on the Floor of the House in that way. He smiles knowingly. If he wants to make a point, I will happily consider it later in our proceedings. He will be aware that I have just been handed a note from officials, and I am told that the issue that he raises will be dealt with in secondary legislation. Perhaps that satisfies him. It has brought a smile to his face, and I am pleased to have done that. However, I have not been aware of any legal point such as he described, so I am pleased that officials have now reassured me that it can be dealt with in secondary legislation.</p>

During a debate in the other place, we identified that, as drafted, the provisions in proposed new section 32E of the Electricity Act 1989 that cover the transitional arrangements for existing projects would have inadvertently prevented future research projects from benefiting from our reforms to the renewables obligation and receiving grant support if appropriate. That was not our intention, and these technical amendments seek to address the issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o25"><a name="81118-0005.htm_para1"><a name="08111874000191">The final set of amendments in this group relates to the provision for offshore electricity transmission. Lords Amendments Nos. 45 and 99 will amend the definition of the term &#147;relevant offshore line&#148; in section 64(1A) of the Electricity Act 1989 for the purpose of defining the term &#147;high voltage line&#148;. The amendments will ensure that the new offshore electricity transmission regulatory regime will apply to the right electric lines&#151;those of more than 132 kV or those built to transmit electricity from an offshore generating station to the onshore grid, even if only a small proportion of the relevant line is situated offshore. The amendments will also clarify the status of electric lines if they convey electricity to a place in Scotland and are wholly or partly in offshore waters&#151;thus ensuring, for example, that a line connecting the Shetland islands to mainland Scotland comes within the scope of the regime even if some of it is on the land.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o26"><a name="81118-0005.htm_para2"><a name="08111874000192">Lords amendments Nos. 84 and 85 are minor drafting changes to clarify that the references in paragraph 26(2)(b) and (c) of schedule 2 are to the person who owns the asset prior to the transfer scheme taking place. These technical amendments will ensure that the references correctly capture the generator developers who will transfer property, rights and liabilities to the holders of an offshore transmission licence under any property transfer scheme made by Ofgem under schedule 2.</p>

 I broadly welcome the amendments. We consider that the Bill has improved greatly since it left the House of Commons a while ago. There are aspects that we should have liked to be included which are still not included, but we are glad to note the concessions that the Government have been willing to offer in the other place in response to significant cross-party agreement on the need for changes in relation to, for instance, smart meters, the role of Ofgem, feed-in tariffs and reporting issues.</p>

I congratulate their lordships on the changes that they have made, but I also thank the Minister, his colleagues and his officials for their willingness to listen to the arguments.</p>

While we are still talking about it in this country, China, the Canadian province of Alberta and Abu Dhabi have moved ahead of us. We are slipping down the league table in carbon capture and storage. We are also disappointed, to say the least, by the structure of the Government&#146;s pilot scheme, which rules out various technologies. That, however, is a debate for another day, and I am sure that the Minister and I will discuss it further in due course.</p>

It is important for such arrangements to apply to all parts of the United Kingdom in the same way. The application of common standards regardless of where the scheme operates in the UK will clearly benefit investors. The clarification of grandfathering rights is also important. It is also sensible to clarify the fact that the rules on offshore transmission will apply even if most of the grid connection cables are onshore rather than offshore. The two should obviously be treated as a single entity. I realise that that will apply in only a minority of cases, but we support the Government&#146;s efforts to secure a cohesive package.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman is right, and his comments allow me to come to the final part of my tributes to those who have brought us to our current position, by paying tribute to the new Secretary of State, because it is fair to say that the lead he has given is what has transformed the agenda. We are right to have tabled today&#146;s amendments, which require any feed-in tariff scheme to include a precise timetable for its introduction and to be precise about the technologies that will be incorporated and the different tariffs that will apply both to the technologies and the scale of the technologies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o41"><a name="81118-0005.htm_para17"><a name="08111874000215">On a personal level, every time I had to bang on the Secretary of State&#146;s door about getting things right, I did not find the difficulties or hostility that we faced little more than a year ago. It is important that the House recognises the way in which the goalposts have shifted in the debate. It was not too long ago that the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform issued an internal briefing paper whose whole approach was hostile to feed-in tariffs, dogmatically repeating a mantra that the renewables obligation delivered all the answers and that feed-in tariffs would be a distraction. The Secretary of State grabbed the process by the scruff of the neck and gave it a shake. He saw that there was nothing in that argument, and he came to the House to make a commitment to introduce a feed-in tariff regime in the UK; his role in that should be recognised.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o42"><a name="81118-0005.htm_para18"><a name="08111874000216">I am sure that the Secretary of State will not parade any of the bruises or scars that he has acquired in introducing his proposals on the threshold for feed-in tariffs.

<p><a name="stpa_o43"><a name="81118-0005.htm_para19"><a name="08111874000219">I want to say more about the shift that has taken place. On the record, many of the big energy suppliers have been fighting tooth and claw to prevent us from doing anything as bold and imaginative as we are doing. The Association of Electricity Producers had lobbied for a threshold of 50 kW. The British Wind Energy Association lobbied, until the last moment, for a threshold of 500 kW. Such demands would preclude the opportunity to develop genuine, transformational renewable energy systems on a community, town or city scale. The Secretary of State should be praised for his determination and willingness to push the boat out much further than many of those vested interests would have felt comfortable with.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o44"><a name="81118-0005.htm_para20"><a name="08111874000220">It is worth noting that the arguments used by energy companies, and their representatives in another place, suggested that if we were willing to be bold by setting a threshold of 3 MW or 5 MW, it could be disastrous. In the other place, Lord Jenkin of Roding cautioned the Lords:</p>
<a name="81118-0005.htm_brev0"><a name="08111874000880"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;One has to remember that for many of the firms that are investing in large wind farms both onshore and offshore, the world is their oyster.

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o45"><a name="81118-0005.htm_para21"><a name="08111874000221">I am glad that the Secretary of State ignored or resisted that argument, because the truth is that they will not push off anywhere. Far be it for me to suggest that the energy companies that have been hiking up household energy charges in Britain are crooks in this sense; let us merely say that energy companies recognise a gravy train when they see one, and they are fond of gravy. Under the renewables obligation, they have been able to make returns on capital of roughly 40 per cent., so it is little wonder that they want to preserve this precious domain of substantial rewards that go only to our large energy companies.</p>

 We are a nation of inventors, and I wonder whether, like me, the hon.

 I share that excitement, but I want to repatriate some of our inventiveness. This country has some of the leading solar photovoltaic suppliers in Europe, but their leading role is primarily based on supplying others, rather than us. A recent high-profile article in <i> The Guardian</i> featured a Scottish company, Pelamis Wave Power Ltd, which has constructed the &#147;serpent&#148;, a wave-generating machine, off the coast of Portugal. It will be part of a sequence that will deliver 21 MW of energy under Portugal&#146;s feed-in tariff regime. That is precisely the inventiveness that we must seek to bring back into our domestic energy agenda. The one thing that we must be able to say is that we have access to wave power that many of our European partners would envy. We must harness that inventiveness on the basis of the security and clarity that a feed-in tariff regime has to offer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o46"><a name="81118-0005.htm_para22"><a name="08111874000224">I make that point only as a way of reinforcing many that have been made to successive Departments by Government-commissioned studies into the way forward on renewables. Many of the reports have stated specifically that the renewables obligation is an obstacle to the dynamic extension of renewable energy generation in the UK. Even those who have tried to say that we should set lower thresholds have come up with fairly fraudulent arguments about what would be lost if the big energy suppliers ceased to invest.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o47"><a name="81118-0005.htm_para23"><a name="08111874000225">I wish to make two points on that. First, the big energy companies know the obligation that they share with us on the UK&#146;s 2020 renewable energy obligations. Any company that does not want to be part of meeting those obligations can simply surrender its part of the energy market, and I am sure that its competitors would gladly clean its plate for it&#151;if a company does not want to be part of this, let it go. Secondly, it is fallacious to say that the companies are already doing what I hope the Secretary of State will ensure we are able to do after this Bill is passed. The fear argument is that somehow this 5 MW threshold would scupper investors&#146; security. Even the figures on the British Wind Energy Association&#146;s website make it clear that, in reality, the amount of wind energy being supplied at less than 5 MW&#151;the existing capacity&#151;is 8 per cent., the amount in construction is 0.6 per cent. and the amount in the planning system is no more than 1.2 per cent. So this threshold will not scupper any of the energy companies&#146; plans&#151;the truth is that all their plans have been on a much larger scale.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o48"><a name="81118-0005.htm_para24"><a name="08111874000226">The simpler reality is that the energy companies do not want to go down the path that 18 countries elsewhere in Europe have already taken with the introduction of feed-in tariff legislation. The principal reason for that is that the energy companies do not want to pay citizens for contributing to a renewable energy future, yet any of the partner countries in Europe will tell us that that is precisely what gives dynamism to their renewables agenda.</p>

Some of that clarity must be in the definition of what will be included in the scheme. I think that even the large energy suppliers, perversely, will want the Government to deliver that clarity. They will want clarity about the time scale within which we intend to introduce the scheme, about the pricing regime and about how and where it interfaces with the renewables obligation. It is important that we make this change not just to deliver energy security for the future but to harness some of the potential that is sitting waiting for us.</p>

At some point, we will need to return to the practicalities of what those tariffs will be. Different tariffs will need to apply to photovoltaics, to wind energy on different scales and to wave energy. They will have to be discounted over different time periods. The suggestion was that even if  <br>

That transformation will be possible, and I would like the Minister to clarify the details rather than sign up to aspirations. There is no point in the House being pretty much united on a desire to set off in a race to a different renewable energy future if we are unable to say when the race will start, how long it will run for and what the course will be.

I somehow suspect that they might not, but nevertheless I hope that they can be persuaded in the course of the debate. I think that we now have 95 per cent. of what is needed, and we just need that other 5 per cent. of detail to reassure people about exactly what direction the feed-in tariffs are going in and what they will deliver.</p>

It is all very well to say to people that we need months and months to talk through the detail, but if they realised that they were not going home to see their wives and kids at the weekend until they had worked out the detail, I think that we would have agreement on these matters pretty soon.

Concerns have been expressed by some groups that raising the threshold of the feed-in tariff above a limit of 1 MW would start interfering with the renewables obligation. We tabled amendments precisely to allow for the variation of the feed-in tariff, according to technology and the size of development. Some older and more developed technologies do not require the boost that a feed-in tariff would give to newer small-scale renewables.</p>

The idea behind it is to allow the inclusion of non-commercial scale projects, such as those that will be installed by homeowners, small businesses, local authorities, community groups, farmers and others. That would help out hospitals and schools that want to facilitate greater use of renewables and ensure low emissions as part of our 2020 targets. It would also help households to reduce their reliance on the grid, ameliorating levels of fuel poverty. However, we also understand why those in the wind sector were anxious about the threshold, as they are concerned not to have a system that jeopardises any investment plans. The key to resolving the problem is to have much greater clarity. We therefore urgently need the Government to indicate what upper limits for  <br>

For the scheme to work effectively, the Government must fix the level of the tariff and guarantee the tariff level for a specified contract period.

Under the renewable obligation, only larger-scale investments have prospered, but CHP has been recognised as one of the most significant drivers in reducing carbon dioxide emissions. Our cities are responsible for about 80 per cent. of greenhouse gas emissions, and their potential for installing CHP is enormous.

<p><a name="stpa_o84"><a name="81118-0007.htm_para0"><a name="08111874000271">I want to be brief, but I should make a couple of small declarations of interest. I am a very small investor in the Westmill wind farm co-operative in Oxfordshire, and I am a customer of Good Energy Group plc. Thinking of small businesses and small concerns makes me ask about the specified maximum capacity. We should use the correct language. It is not really a threshold; it might be one for the renewables obligation, but it is not the threshold for the feed-in tariff, which is probably half a kilowatt.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o85"><a name="81118-0007.htm_para1"><a name="08111874000272">The specified maximum capacity is an issue. I support the fact that we have travelled a great distance; before the summer recess, we were considering one hundredth of the generating capacity as a maximum, but now the figure has multiplied by 100, which is a great step forward. My question relates to small businesses that may want to generate renewable electricity, but find a glass ceiling. What do they do when they get to 5 MW? Will they have to split off into separate entities to avoid the bureaucracy, which would be an additional&#151;not a separate or replacement&#151;burden? When they get to that maximum capacity, they will have to consider seriously what they do with their business, and that could mean a limit on their expansion. That will happen in the early stages, because we are just starting out on this process. I support having no specified maximum capacity for a feed-in tariff, but since we are having one, we need to consider what happens to businesses as a result.</p>

 I am anxious about my hon. Friend&#146;s comment. The renewables obligation has served us well in many respects, but it has not been acceptable and valid in the case of small microgeneration projects. Surely one cannot run the renewables obligation alongside a feed-in tariff that has no upper limit.</p>

 We will, de facto, be operating a feed-in tariff alongside the renewables obligation. Some people who have small generation units of less than 5 MW may operate both systems. There might be an administrative burden for small businesses. What happens when they get to that ceiling? Do they split off, sell out to somebody else, or start again? Having the ceiling imposes a whole range of questions. I say to my hon. Friend, whose record on renewable energy is among the best in the House, that the real answer to his question is to ask why we did not start with the feed-in tariff all those years ago, instead of trying to improve on a failed system of support&#151;the non-fossil fuel obligation, which was a Thatcherite market solution largely designed to support the nuclear industry.</p>

 Will my hon. Friend reflect on his own knowledge of how feed-in tariff schemes operate in other parts of Europe, particularly Germany? Is not the right way to set the interface in running two schemes in parallel&#151;feed-in tariffs and the renewables obligation&#151;to be found in setting tariffs for higher levels of energy generation? After we have done that, is it not sensible to let the market itself decide? Although we are introducing  <br>

further reforms to the renewables obligation, the Ernst and Young study commissioned by the Government last year set out specific and serious ways in which the structure of the RO is an obstacle to the development of renewables, in so far as it requires people to second-guess the future price of tradeable certificates. Is not the strength of the feed-in tariff regime its clarity and certainty over the guaranteed time for which it operates?</p>

 I completely agree with everything that my hon. Friend says. We want that certainty, and in the near term we will now see it for people who want to invest their own money in small schemes. That is a brilliant step forward. The 5 MW maximum that will be in the Bill, since there is no other amendment, is a huge advance. However, the certainty that that brings will last only for a certain period, until people want to go that little bit further but do not want to get involved in the complications of the RO, which was designed for big business&#151;the big box solution&#151;and not for the smaller player. In a few years&#146; time, in the fourth term of a Labour Government, we will have to ask ourselves what is the appropriate level for the maximum capacity. By that time, it should not be a problem, because people will have accepted that we have made this start and it will be a matter of a little tick-box that goes up to 50 MW or whatever is then thought appropriate in the light of experience.</p>

 It would be remiss of me not to add my congratulations to the hon. Member for Nottingham, South (Alan Simpson) on all his achievements.

Perhaps we are still not quite there on urgency. The Minister will be familiar with the 100 months campaign, which was launched at the start of August. It talks about 100 months before reaching a tipping point for climate change. We are already three and a half months through that time. We need a new way of thinking about such matters, which does not involve a consultation, a discussion paper, a Green Paper, a review or a period of further reflection. We are past all that.</p>

Member for Wealden (Charles Hendry), my worry about the Minister in another place, who said that he hoped that we could achieve the aim in 18 months, but perhaps we cannot, is that not acting quickly is not an option. It is far better to get something roughly right by, as the right hon. Member for Suffolk, Coastal (Mr. Gummer) said, locking people in a room for a weekend, and then perhaps refining it, than to try to wait until it is perfect&#151;it probably would not be perfect anyway.</p>

<notus-date day="18" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><b>18 Nov 2008 : Column 151</b><br>

<p><a name="stpa_o90"><a name="81118-0007.htm_para6"><a name="08111874000282">I am worried by the mentality that assumes that we have to work according to financial years. I do not know whether I am right, but I sense a presumption about 6 April. I hope that that is not the case. I do not know where 6 April comes from&#151;perhaps pagan festivals and the spring equinox&#151;but it should not govern when we have to act. Things are far more urgent. We should get on with it the very day, week or month that we determine how to act.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o91"><a name="81118-0007.htm_para7"><a name="08111874000283">I therefore support amendment (a), which would set a deadline of within 12 months of Royal Assent. We could fill any time available&#151;we could spend six years thinking about this&#151;but we urgently need to get on with it. I therefore urge the Minister to accept amendment (a). Even if he were not forced to do so, I am sure that he would want to pull out every stop to ensure that action was taken in 12 months.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o92"><a name="81118-0007.htm_para8"><a name="08111874000284">I welcome amendment (f), and if the Minister does not feel able to accept it, I hope that we can test the House&#146;s opinion on it. It deals with combined heat and power. One could be a purist and say that, because that is not a renewable, it should not be included. That would be an argument, albeit one that I do not accept. However, if we intend to include combined heat and power and recognise its contribution, the low threshold is odd. I know that the Minister will try to justify it shortly, but the contribution of combined heat and power, at least in the transitional phase when we try to move to very low carbon, if not zero carbon, is demonstrable. To constrain it so much, up-front, in primary legislation is odd. Tariffs can differ according to technology and at varying thresholds, so the potential to treat small micro-CHP differently from larger CHP already exists. Removing the constraint simply gives the Government more power and flexibility. I therefore hope that the Minister will accept amendment (f).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o93"><a name="81118-0007.htm_para9"><a name="08111874000285">A potential downside of the feed-in tariff has not been mentioned. We support and welcome the feed-in tariff, but I hope that the Minister will reflect on that possible downside. Who pays for it? If we are not careful, we know which small-scale community groups, hospitals and schools and householders will do small-scale generation. We know who will have a solar panel and&#151;dare I say it?&#151;a small-scale wind turbine on the roof. We know the social groups and the income bands that will do that and to whom the feed-in tariffs will be paid, if we are not careful. Everybody else will pay for it in their bills, and that will be bad news for fuel poverty.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o94"><a name="81118-0007.htm_para10"><a name="08111874000286">We have a combined Ministry dealing with climate change and energy. Part of the energy remit is obviously affordable energy. Clearly, there is a tension. However, given that we want feed-in tariffs, and that we want them to be generous enough to make things happen, does not that place a great onus on the Government to get serious about social tariffs and tackling fuel poverty by other means? If all we do is introduce a generous feed-in tariff that results in an increase in fuel bills across the board, we will worsen fuel poverty. None of us wants to do that. What will go hand in hand with feed-in tariffs to ensure that we do not make fuel poverty worse? I hope that part of the answer is insulation and so on, but that is happening anyway. We hope that other energy efficiency measures will be taken, and that companies will introduce social tariffs, but there is precious little evidence of that so far.</p>

 I thank the hon. Gentleman&#151;my neighbour&#151;for giving way. Does he agree that that point is a weakness, and that one way of responding to it would be to collectivise the operation of the feed-in tariffs? One weakness of the renewables industry is that we rely far too much on pepper-potting activity, depending on the willingness of individuals to participate. We need communities, neighbourhoods and streets to take up initiatives together, so that they can benefit from the efficiencies that arise from economies of scale.</p>

<p><a name="st_o152"><a name="08111874000288"><a name="81118-0007.htm_spnew6"><a name="08111874001068"><b>Steve Webb:</b>
 I agree that one possibility for the 5 MW threshold is schemes of that kind. However, even if a school undertakes such a scheme, the money goes to the school. That is great for the school, but who is paying? Everybody else is paying, through their energy bills. My worry is that we will do something that is entirely laudable and right, but which has unintended consequences for those whom we are all so concerned about.</p>

 Is the hon. Gentleman aware of one way in which other EU partners have begun to address this issue? The certainty of the tariff system has allowed local authorities to cushion the installation costs in social housing, so that rather than being a barrier to addressing fuel poverty, the system turns out to be an additional resource. However, that is possible only by doing what the Secretary of State has done, which is to set a threshold high enough to encourage municipalities to undertake schemes on that scale.</p>

<p><a name="st_o154"><a name="08111874000290"><a name="81118-0007.htm_spnew8"><a name="08111874001070"><b>Steve Webb:</b>
 We can certainly learn from what has happened elsewhere, and the examples that the hon. Gentleman cites are good ones. For example, if a local authority takes forward a scheme, the revenue from that scheme can cushion council tax bills, or whatever. My worry is that whereas local authorities in Germany, for example, are substantially devolved, with revenue-raising power and other freedoms, we are grafting the feed-in tariff on to a British system that is staggeringly centralised. Local government has little power to do those things, although some find ways. There is great potential for what the hon. Gentleman describes, but a lot of other things would have to happen to facilitate it. In a sense, that is what I am flagging up. We need to ensure that mitigation measures are in place so that we get the good of the feed-in tariff without the damage of fuel poverty.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o95"><a name="81118-0007.htm_para11"><a name="08111874000291">I want briefly to raise two other issues. The first is the issue of grandfathering, which is to say that we want to avoid any hiatus. Again, that argues in favour of the 12-month limit proposed in amendment (a). We want people to invest now; we do not want them to hold off. One reason for holding off on a smaller-scale development&#151;either a renewables obligation development or a feed-in tariff development&#151;might be to wait and see what happens to the feed-in tariff. If the Minister could confirm that somebody investing in a certain regime would be guaranteed that regime for the life of the project, that would remove some of the investment uncertainty. If somebody was considering investing in a 4.4 MW two-wind-turbine project, that project would be below the threshold, and therefore potentially either feed-in tariff-able or ROC-able. We would want them to invest now and to get on with it, so can the Minister clarify whether, if it turned out that the feed-in tariff would be more beneficial, such a person would be able to opt into the feed-in tariff, perhaps once and for all, for the lifetime of the project?</p>

Can the Minister confirm whether there might be a one-off opportunity to switch? I am still slightly hazy as to whether, once everything is up and running and both schemes are potentially available to small-scale generation, people will choose one or the other, or whether they would be able to switch between the two and change their minds. Can the Minister clarify how the two will interrelate?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o97"><a name="81118-0007.htm_para13"><a name="08111874000293">We warmly welcome the feed-in tariff, and the Government&#146;s amendment (g), which increases its scope. We need action to check that fuel poverty will not be worsened by the measure, but above all we need a sense of urgency, not endless further consideration to try to perfect the provisions. We must not make the best the enemy of the good. We must not simply strive for perfection when that means delay, because we will never have perfection.

 May I also give my warm support to the introduction of feed-in tariffs? The Government have been bold on this matter. I also give my support to the campaigns by non-governmental organisations such as Friends of the Earth, and to the many Members of this House who have taken the issue forward.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o98"><a name="81118-0007.htm_para14"><a name="08111874000295">It is fair to say that if we had understood feed-in tariffs better at the beginning of the incentivisation of renewables, the Government might have gone down that path. However, I understand, given the need to encourage investment in large-scale renewables and the fact that there has been a lot of investment in ROCs, that the Government are reluctant to disturb the stability that has been put in place. Stability and certainty are important, which is why I accept the argument that it is important for the Government to give some indication about time scale, pricing and structures. That cannot be done overnight; it will take a little time and involve some consultation. However, the sooner it is done, the better in terms of the undoubted benefits that we will get from a feed-in tariff. Those benefits will be both environmental and economic. There is no doubt that feed-in tariffs will be a great stimulus to the development of new small-scale technologies, and I am keen to see support for manufacturing in this country, innovation and new developments.</p>

Some good points were made on that by the hon. Member for Northavon (Steve Webb) and my hon. Friend the Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew). Will the Minister consider the idea of a community or co-operative approach to encourage small-scale renewables? Perhaps one way of doing that is through warm zones. To their credit, the Government have pioneered warm zones, whereby additional funding is made available for insulation in areas of low-income housing. It would be possible,  <br>

without too much difficulty, to adapt the funding for those zones to encourage the installation of small-scale renewables in the same way. I am sure that that could be done in partnership with local authorities. As my hon.

It is not without its problems, one of which was touched on briefly by other Members: that many of the renewable energy resources are very expensive to install at the moment. The feed-in tariff will help to some extent, but we also need to ensure that the capital cost of the equipment is reduced, to allow many other people to take advantage of this. I look forward to the day when smaller communities can have their own renewable energy, and feed in the excess to the grid.</p>

I shall not rehearse all the arguments again, but I note that only this week, the Crown Estate Commissioners started their licensing application for renewable energy through wave and tidal power in the Pentland firth, which offers huge potential for renewable energy.

 The hon. Gentleman is making an important point, but I hope he will accept that how we tackle the grid does not need to be addressed in this legislation. The EU directive on renewables gave all EU countries the right to decide for themselves whether renewables were to have priority access to the grid, or whether it would be left to the market. The UK took a decision not to make that a binding obligation. We could reverse that decision ourselves; we do not need to view it as a deficiency in the Bill. We can change the Government&#146;s remit through regulation, which does not require primary legislation. If we have the will, there should be no obstacle to changing the remit and putting ourselves on the same sort of playing field as the rest of Europe.</p>

 I hope that we are not in danger of sounding churlish to the Minister, as there is no doubt that we have moved a long way in a very short time. There is also no doubt that the new Ministry has got off to a very good start; right from the beginning, certain things were announced that we had all hoped for. The 80 per cent. reduction in emissions by 2050, and feed-in tariffs, were two things that gave all of us across the House a feeling that the new Ministry had lined up its ducks in the right order.</p>

If we are being fair about the excellence aspects, we must also be fair about the drawbacks. We have treated many of these matters with a lack of urgency. The Government have not been as quick or fleet-footed as they ought to have been. Most of us would accept that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o109"><a name="81118-0008.htm_para0"><a name="08111874000310">If that is true, and if urgency is very important, it is reasonable to support the amendments, to ensure that people get on with it. That is not because I believe there is any possibility of the Government going back on their feed-in tariffs decision. It would be foolish for anyone to suggest that someone will turn up and say that that is not what the Government promised. I would love to find out who it was in the Treasury who hated feed-in tariffs for so many years. There must have been a person whose life&#146;s determination was to block feed-in tariffs. However much the argument went on, somebody there deep in a cavern was determined to make sure that it would happen over his dead body. Now we will find the body, but it would be interesting to know to whom it belonged.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o110"><a name="81118-0008.htm_para1"><a name="08111874000311">I do not think that the Government will get this wrong, but we need to involve people outside in a real crusade to find answers to the issues of climate change. The reason why I have always believed in feed-in tariffs, and why we made them a central part of our energy proposals in the &#147;Quality of Life&#148; report, was simply that we dare not leave to the experts, the big companies or the ministries the job of finding the way to solve the challenge of climate change. We must get every kind of person with any kind of contribution to make that contribution. As my hon. Friend the Member for Wealden (Charles Hendry) said, we are an innovative country and we can find ways that were hitherto unthought of.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o111"><a name="81118-0008.htm_para2"><a name="08111874000312">Feed-in tariffs draw those ideas out and encourage all sorts of different people to find structures that make it possible for us to apply new ways of generation that would otherwise not occur. I hope that the Government will help us by ensuring that we know that this will happen quickly, and that people know how it will affect them. Will the Minister answer some of the questions asked by the hon. Member for Northavon (Steve Webb), who speaks for the Liberal Democrats, in terms of understanding whether people who opt in to one system can opt out, if the other is more suitable?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o112"><a name="81118-0008.htm_para3"><a name="08111874000313">Perhaps the Minister will take these questions as compliments to the Government. We are all pleased that today we can see this new beginning; we just want it quickly. Christmas cannot come quickly enough, because we do not have time, and urgency must be injected not only into the Government, but into the world outside. If the Minister can give us that assurance, we will have a real reason to thank the new Ministry, beyond all the plaudits that it has received already.</p>

Government have signed up, but there has been much lengthy debate about the effective deployment of renewables since the Bill was introduced in the House in January. I am pleased that hon. Members both sides of the House share our objective of ensuring that we are best placed and have the best possible financial framework to enable us to meet our 2020 renewables target.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o115"><a name="81118-0008.htm_para6"><a name="08111874000317">The changes that we will make to the renewables obligation under the Bill will build on the success of the renewables obligation so far and lead to the deployment of more diverse mixes of larger-scale renewable electricity projects as we move towards 2020. That is important: although there is a lot of praise for the introduction of feed-in tariffs, the renewables obligation will continue to be a primary means by which we ensure that the 2020 target is hit.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o116"><a name="81118-0008.htm_para7"><a name="08111874000318">We have listened to the arguments that the RO is not suitable for domestic and small-scale electricity generation projects, at least partly because of its relative complexity. Although some small-scale projects have operated via the RO, the results are patchy, so we have decided to introduce feed-in tariffs for small-scale low-carbon electricity generation. An upper cap for those feed-in tariffs has been defined in the Bill to give clarity and certainty to investors in large-scale projects under the RO. Our original amendment in the other place set an upper limit of 3 MW&#151;we wanted the upper cap to be high enough to give us sufficient flexibility to ensure that we can direct support to small-scale projects of the right capacity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o117"><a name="81118-0008.htm_para8"><a name="08111874000319">It is important that there is no confusion about the fact that the 5 MW limit relates to capacity, not generation. The capacity restriction is not dependent on the number of kilowatt-hours that an installation will generate over a year. Different technologies will generate different kilowatt-hours of electricity, and they will be paid over that period. This is a capacity argument in terms of determining whether or not they qualify, rather than anything else. It is important that that point is made clear during the debate, so that no one expects all those technologies to generate at that massive 5 MW level or whatever, but we also want the cap to be low enough to avoid delaying perfectly viable renewable projects under the renewables obligation. Since the debate in the other place, we have decided that the 5 MW level will be better than the 3 MW one because it will enable projects that fall into the 3 to 5 MW category to benefit from feed-in tariffs. Those involved in such projects should analyse the evidence to find out which tariff is beneficial.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o118"><a name="81118-0008.htm_para9"><a name="08111874000320">We will, of course, consult on the tariffs next year. As part of that process, we will undertake further analysis to determine the limit at which FITs would be set below the 5 MW cap. It is important to note that we expect that the renewables obligation will deliver the vast majority of renewable electricity up to 2020. We intend to make further announcements soon on how we plan to modify the renewables obligation to ensure that it delivers a much higher share of renewable electricity by 2020 than previously planned.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o119"><a name="81118-0008.htm_para10"><a name="08111874000321">On a one-off opt-out to the RO or to FITs, we intend to make further announcements on our approach to transitional projects that could be captured in the new scheme. Our aim in this announcement, however, is to minimise the risk of projects being tempted to wait and  <br>

see before committing to either the RO or FITs. It is absolutely crucial that we ensure that investment confidence is sustained in the RO for larger-scale electricity projects and that no project is disrupted while we develop a feed-in tariff policy to support small-scale low-carbon generation. Indeed, 2020 is only 11 years away; delay now is undesirable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o120"><a name="81118-0008.htm_para11"><a name="08111874000322">Amendment (a) seeks to require the Secretary of State to modify licences within a period of 12 months after Royal Assent to the Bill. I understand the wish of Members in all parts of the House to make rapid progress on these enabling provisions and to ensure that we deliver an effective scheme as quickly as possible. The need for urgency is felt no more keenly than in Government, especially in view of the EU renewables target that we need to hit by 2020. However, we also need to ensure that we get this right.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o121"><a name="81118-0008.htm_para12"><a name="08111874000323">For example, before we can modify the relevant licences to implement the policy, we need to develop models enabling us to introduce a scheme that can effectively encourage deployment on the scale that we want. We need to consult on our analysis on the proposed tariff levels of payments for the different technologies. We need to work with the electricity suppliers and Ofgem, which will deliver the tariffs to generators to ensure that the licence modifications that we propose will function as we intend, alongside the existing licence conditions that regulate this complex market.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o122"><a name="81118-0008.htm_para13"><a name="08111874000324">Members should not assume that this process will be simple. It will be enormously complex. However, the benefits will be considerable and important, so we shall have to go through the process and we shall have to get it right. It will involve spending a vast amount of consumers&#146; money, for, as was pointed out by the hon. Member for Northavon (Steve Webb), the consumer will ultimately pay for much of it. We do not want to waste any of that money. We do not want people to be pushed further into fuel poverty because we are spending more money than is necessary on a particular project.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o123"><a name="81118-0008.htm_para14"><a name="08111874000325">The hon. Member for Northavon said that we had wasted enough time, and that we needed to get on with all this. I agree about the urgency, but moving too fast and getting it wrong will carry a price, and that price will be paid by consumers. We have an obligation to ensure that we get the process right, and that means getting the consultation right. While we all agree on the need for urgency, I trust that we also all agree on the need to ensure that we do not land consumers with a big and unnecessary bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o124"><a name="81118-0008.htm_para15"><a name="08111874000326">Last but not least, we need to allow time for Parliament to scrutinise the draft proposals before modifications can be made. Parliament takes its time with things: it has to go through the processes. Let us ensure that we can carry out our consultation on the feed-in tariff system and the proposed tariff levels next summer. Following that consultation and through further work with Ofgem, electricity industry players and other interested parties, we shall be in a position to finalise the implementation aspects of the system, such as arrangements for payment processes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o125"><a name="81118-0008.htm_para16"><a name="08111874000327">Taking all that into account, we are committed to introducing a feed-in tariff scheme for small-scale electricity in 2010. Our ideal target is for the scheme to go live in  <br>

April 2010, so that it can be aligned with the financial year of the renewables obligation. As I do not know the date of the next general election just yet, I cannot assure my hon. Friend the Member for Morley and Rothwell that &#147;power to the people&#148; will be at the top of the manifesto; but I can say that, if this Parliament extends to a full term, it might.</p>

We are committed to introducing the feed-in tariff as soon as possible. However, choosing an arbitrary date at this stage will fetter our ability to deliver a fully functional and effective scheme in 2010, and may put consumers at risk of having to pay more than they need.</p>

 I would intend to introduce it as soon as possible thereafter. In the event of a delay of a month or two, we would aim to introduce it after that. If, for example, Parliament took a little longer to discuss things for some reason, we would want to allow that time framework, but we would then be able to introduce the scheme at the appropriate moment. April is a convenient date because many, although not all, businesses manage their annual calendars in relation to it, but it is not an essential date.</p>

 I wholeheartedly agree with the Minister that it is more important to get the scheme right than just to get it in place quickly, but will he consider the following two things in the process of trying to combine those two goals? First, it is clear from today&#146;s amendments that a considerable amount of expertise in the House could be harnessed towards coming up with a scheme that we get right in the first place, so can we have a commitment to try to harness that know-how now, rather than leave it to the end of a consultation process? Secondly, will the Minister make sure that we have as seamless a transfer-in as possible, which does not lose certain things? For instance, will he look specifically at the current decision to close access to the low-carbon building programme in seven months&#146; time, because the danger is that we will have precisely the sort of renewables energy-generating companies that will then cease to have access to the only low-carbon schemes we are currently promoting, yet we will still be dependent on such schemes for perhaps a year after they have ceased to exist? Will he look at the interfaces, so that we do not lose access to our current expertise?</p>

work to do. I hope that when he rises to close the debate, he will be able to reassure us that he is prepared to work with us on that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o127"><a name="81118-0008.htm_para18"><a name="08111874000333">I have quite a lot still to say, so I shall try to give as full a reply, and as brief, as possible. Amendment (b) to Lords amendment No. 42 suggests we replace the term &#147;financial incentives&#148; in proposed new subsection (2)(a) with &#147;payment&#148;. The use of the term &#147;financial incentives&#148; clarifies that the general purpose of the scheme is to incentivise low-carbon electricity generation through financial incentives, as opposed to other means such as a regulatory obligation or barrier-busting support, such as help with the planning system. We believe that such clarity is helpful in setting out beyond any doubt the primary purpose of the scheme. However, to give additional reassurances about our intentions, I would point to the powers under proposed new subsection (3) that specifies the term &#147;payment&#148; in all the key provisions that will establish the scheme. In others words, it is explicit that we are dealing with payments to small-scale generators. What is proposed will be a real feed-in tariff scheme.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o128"><a name="81118-0008.htm_para19"><a name="08111874000334">Amendments (c) and (d) seek confirmation that the Government intend to introduce a feed-in tariff scheme similar to those established on the continent. We want to ensure that those schemes work as effectively as possible in the UK electricity system, and we need to get this right. We certainly want to learn from our European colleagues and make sure we consider the best features of their schemes. My officials have already benefited from discussions with the German Government during the policy development process. Officials also attended the meeting of the international feed-in co-operation group in Brussels earlier this month, which was also attended by representatives from Spain, Germany and Slovenia. It aimed to update co-operation on feed-in tariff developments in the UK, and to show how countries could learn more about best practice from other nations with operational tariffs in force. That group has recently updated its best practice paper, which will be an extremely useful document for us to use when developing this policy, and we look forward to working in close co-operation with other countries. In line with best practice, the expectation is that generators will receive a guaranteed payment for generating electricity over a set period of time. This is covered in proposed new subsection (3)(a), which allows for &#147;specified circumstances&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o129"><a name="81118-0008.htm_para20"><a name="08111874000335">Changing proposed new subsection (3)(b) to include the words &#147;level of payment&#148; in addition to outlining how a payment is calculated is unnecessary as this is already covered in the proposed new subsection. For newly installed plants only, we expect that the level of payments for a given group of technologies will decrease year by year to take account of learning and economies of scale&#151;a familiar concept in most feed-in tariff schemes. That eventuality is already covered in proposed new subsection (3)(c).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o130"><a name="81118-0008.htm_para21"><a name="08111874000336">Amendment (d) to Lords amendment No. 42 concerns, among other things, the distribution system, a point that was raised on Report in the other place. It demonstrates the sort of complexities created by the introduction of a feed-in tariff. The new scheme has to operate within what is effectively a dynamic electricity system with many players and interested parties. Subsections (1) and (2)(b), as proposed in amendment No. 42, seek to address those issues by giving us the power to modify distribution licences where we believe it necessary to do  <br>

so. The proposed new clause is sufficiently flexible to allow different levels of tariff payments to be made to different sources of energy and technologies as well as to different scales of plant, so I can give hon. Members some assurance on that point.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o131"><a name="81118-0008.htm_para22"><a name="08111874000337">Finally, I would like to respond to amendment (f) to Lords amendment No. 42, which removes the capacity limit for fossil-fuel combined heat and power within the feed-in tariff. CHP has an important role to play in moving the UK towards a thriving, competitive, low-carbon economy. That is demonstrated by the range of support measures that we already have for good quality, fossil-fuel CHP, such as the exemption from the climate change levy, special status in the second phase of the European Union emissions trading scheme and eligibility for enhanced capital allowances. Those measures are already in place. We should not forget that the principal purpose of the feed-in-tariff clause is to reward smaller-scale renewable electricity technologies in order to meet our ambitious renewable energy targets.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o132"><a name="81118-0008.htm_para23"><a name="08111874000338">However, we were persuaded by the arguments put forward in the other place by the Opposition, who sought, through their own amendment, to place a cap on CHP of 50kW. They did so because micro-CHP is still a technology in development, unlike large-scale CHP, which is a proven technology. As with other technologies, we can expect our final feed-in tariffs policy to set different tariffs for different scales of micro-CHP units, but it is most important that we support CHP appropriately. We cannot know all the unintended consequences of taking a last-minute decision to switch from a mechanism that should principally be about incentivising small renewable projects to one which can encourage non-renewable CHP up to a scale of 5 MW. Is that what that the Opposition intended? I have some concerns about that. The right place to consider the incentive framework for non-renewable CHP above the micro-level is in the forthcoming heat and energy efficiency strategy, not here.</p>

I remind him that the Government have set a target for CHP, and he knows that we are a long way from achieving that. I welcome his undertaking to look at the issue again when we talk about a renewable heat strategy. It is important that we make significant progress in that respect.</p>

 My hon. Friend is absolutely right. I can heartily give him such a reassurance, particularly on a day when we remember Peter Lehmann, who was most active in ensuring that CHP was put on the public agenda. Today, on the day of his funeral, I pay enormous tribute to a man who was a wonderful advocate for people who suffer from fuel poverty, and who campaigned strongly for CHP. It was in the latter context that I first met him, and I reassure my hon. Friend that I&#151;along with him and other hon.

50 kW threshold in the Bill, but then decides, through his other strategy, that the best way to incentivise 100 kW or 150 kW CHP is through a feed-in tariff.

 Because we need to ensure that we focus on the renewables agenda that we intend this entire legislation to focus on. We have accepted an Opposition proposal that we make provision up to a certain level. Not setting the cap may have a series of unintended consequences that we need to consider with a great deal of care. I am advised that if, as the hon. Gentleman suggests, we decide at some future stage that we want to get rid of the cap, we would be able to do so in secondary legislation&#151;we would have the power to do that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o133"><a name="81118-0009.htm_para0"><a name="08111874000343">I am satisfied that 50 kW should be the limit that we set in this Bill, because I do not want to create expectations that feed-in tariffs will be available to above that level for CHP. That would generate a load of speculation and a lot of pressure, and it would be very difficult for us to resist it, as we might wish to do after considering this issue in the round as part of a wider examination of non-renewable CHP. The hon. Gentleman&#146;s approach would close down the options much more than it would keep them open, because it would generate a level of expectation that I do not wish to see at this stage. I strongly believe that we need to examine the matter separately, and we will examine CHP above the micro-level in the forthcoming heat and energy efficiency study.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o134"><a name="81118-0009.htm_para1"><a name="08111874000344">The hon. Member for Angus (Mr. Weir) raised an important point when he asked whether feed-in tariffs would help to relieve rural poverty and help people in hard-to-connect areas. The answer is absolutely, because this is a significant development for people in the sorts of areas that he identifies. He also mentioned, as did others, that there were problems in getting access to the grid, and he rightly said that such issues have to be addressed. However, we must remember not only that we need to help people in those rural areas with feed-in tariffs, but that the renewable heat incentive could be of significant benefit to such people. As a result of some of the changes that we are introducing today, if the House decides to accept them, some of his constituents, like the constituents of many of us&#151;I, too, represent a rural area&#151;could well derive significant benefits.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o135"><a name="81118-0009.htm_para2"><a name="08111874000345">In conclusion, the Government are determined to reassure the House that we are committed to feed-in tariffs. In reality, we are not talking about super-ROCs or any such thing; these are genuine feed-in tariffs that we want to see implemented. We have a clear strategy on that, and I shall be happy to meet my hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham, South to discuss how we implement it. He can keep an eye on us to ensure that when we implement it, we do so properly.</p>

<p><a name="st_o169"><a name="08111874000346"><a name="81118-0009.htm_spnew1"><a name="08111874001085"><b>Mr. Jim Devine (Livingston) (Lab):</b>
 We should place on record our congratulations to my hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham, South (Alan Simpson) on his work. This is a dream day for him. He has been superb in campaigning on this issue and it is great how far this Government have gone. So, I also pay tribute to my Front-Bench team for today&#146;s debate.</p>

 My hon. Friend rightly says that we should praise my hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham, South. He has always been on the radical left of the party, so I am not sure whether a new Labour Minister praising him from the Dispatch Box would have been in his dreams or his nightmares. However, praise him we should and we do&#151;I congratulate him on the work that he has done.</p>

<p><a name="st_o171"><a name="08111874000348"><a name="81118-0009.htm_spnew3"><a name="08111874001087"><b>Alan Simpson:</b>
 I speak with some trepidation, but I thank the Minister for the way in which he has responded to the debate. I do not think that the House could have expected him to go into such detail in his assurances about the specifics of what will be incorporated into the Government scheme. Anyone who takes stock of those will understand that they will put the UK scheme at the forefront of European standards of best practice and best guidelines rather than at the back. That is exactly where we ought to be.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o136"><a name="81118-0009.htm_para3"><a name="08111874000349">On the timetable, I understand the Minister&#146;s anxiety to get the correct balance between urgency and accuracy. On the basis of his assurances, it would be crass to push the House to a Division. It would also be appropriate to say that given the specific invitations and the kind and generous words that the Minister has offered to me, I agree wholeheartedly to work with him in whatever ways the Government and the Department want me to. I can think of no better way of using my remaining time in Parliament. We are moving into our own renewable energy revolution, and that is something of which I am proud to be a part. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

 This group of amendments covers the changes made in the other place to a number of issues in the Bill, including the three decommissioning regimes&#151;nuclear, offshore renewables and oil and gas decommissioning&#151;the reporting requirements and matters relating to smart meters. There is also a minor and technical drafting amendment. I shall deal with each of them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o146"><a name="81118-0010.htm_para3"><a name="08111882000529">Amendments Nos. 46 and 47 relate to the nuclear decommissioning provisions. The other place sought greater clarification about the factors that the Secretary of State may take into account when deciding to approve or modify a funded decommissioning programme for a new nuclear power station. Amendment No. 46 creates a duty on the Secretary of State to publish guidance on factors that it may be appropriate to consider when approving a programme or making a modification to a programme in clause 51(5). Amendment No. 47 creates a duty on the Secretary of State to have regard to that guidance. That provides the potential operator with greater certainty about the factors that the Secretary of State will take into account, while not unduly limiting his flexibility.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o147"><a name="81118-0010.htm_para4"><a name="08111882000530">Amendments Nos. 48, 50 and 53 relate to the definition of security and the protection of that security in the event of insolvency for the three decommissioning regulatory regimes in the Bill&#151;the nuclear power stations, offshore renewable energy installations and offshore oil and gas installations. The amendments clarify the meaning of the term &#147;security&#148; as it is used in relation to the three regulatory regimes. Under the Bill as it was previously  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="18 Nov 2008">

<notus-date day="18" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><b>18 Nov 2008 : Column 172</b><br>
drafted, there was a risk that if an operator became insolvent, the courts could construe the term &#147;security&#148; by reference to the narrow, legal nature of any arrangements in place, rather than to their broader economic effect. In such a situation, there would be a high risk that the taxpayer would have to meet any resultant shortfall in decommissioning funds. The amendments will help to ensure that the courts take a broad definition of security when considering insolvency cases, thereby helping to protect the taxpayer better.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o148"><a name="81118-0010.htm_para5"><a name="08111882000531">Amendments Nos. 51 and 52 relate to the oil and gas decommissioning provision in clause 69. The other place debated an amendment aimed at more closely linking the liability for decommissioning an offshore installation to companies that have received benefits from the installation. The amendments are technical in nature, and make it clear that liability will apply to licensees only when they are entitled to benefit or have benefited from the principal purpose for which the installation is maintained or is intended to be maintained. The amendments will create a precise link between the benefit and activities on the relevant field. The liability will not extend to licensees on a different field even if they receive a secondary service from the installation. The amendments will extend further clarification to gas unloading and storage and carbon sequestration activities. The Government believe that these amendments add to the clarity and practicality of the respective frameworks while maintaining their robustness.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o149"><a name="81118-0010.htm_para6"><a name="08111882000532">Amendments Nos. 58 to 62 reinstate a requirement for the sustainable energy report to cover a specific reporting period. We propose that this period should run from January to December instead of retaining the current 12-month reporting period ending with 23 February, which was arbitrarily based on the publication date of the energy White Paper in 2003. That change will enable our report to align with the carbon budget reporting cycles that will be established through the Climate Change Bill. The change of reporting period to a calendar year also necessitates a change in publication date. We have therefore added a requirement that the report for a particular calendar year should be published no later than October the following year. That would commit the Government to report by a certain time in the year but will still enable the appropriate analysis to be completed shortly after all the latest data become available, which is generally between April and July. Finally, we are reinstating the requirement in section 172 of the Energy Act 2004 for the Secretary of State to report separately to Parliament on security of energy supplies. Lobby groups have expressed concern that we might be seen to be rowing back from reporting, but that is not our intention.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o150"><a name="81118-0010.htm_para7"><a name="08111882000533">Amendment No. 49 relates to nuclear decommissioning. The other place debated the offence under clause 57 of knowingly or recklessly supplying false or misleading information to Ministers in relation to nuclear decommissioning programmes, and whether that should apply in all cases. Lord Jenkin of Roding believed that that was too onerous. Amendment No. 49 therefore creates a materiality threshold so that only information that is false or misleading in a material respect falls within the scope of the clause. That makes clause 57 consistent with equivalent offences in other areas of legislation&#151;for example, sections 117 and 201 of the Enterprise Act 2002.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o151"><a name="81118-0010.htm_para8"><a name="08111882000534">Some of the other Government amendments cover a variety of smaller technical matters and consequential issues related to legislation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o152"><a name="81118-0010.htm_para9"><a name="08111882000535">Let me turn to amendments Nos. 63, 86, 87, 90, 92 and 93. The House will be aware that the Government recently confirmed that we will move forward with smart metering for all households in Britain. I believe that we all recognise that delivering 47 million smart meters to homes across Britain in an efficient and well managed way will be an enormous challenge. On Report in the other place, Lord Dubs proposed an important amendment related to the type of market model that will underpin the roll-out of smart meters. As we develop the detail of the project, it may become apparent that there are advantages to moving away from our current competitive metering market and considering centralising some or all metering services. At the moment, smart meters could be got to six houses by six different suppliers, who could send six different sub-contractors to those houses, which could be all in a row next to each other. We should look for a better way of doing things. At this stage, our objective is to ensure that we have a legislative basis on which to deliver a range of future options to ensure an effective roll-out.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o153"><a name="81118-0010.htm_para10"><a name="08111882000536">In response to my noble Friend&#146;s amendment, the Government tabled amendments Nos. 63, 86, 87, 90, 92 and 93. We believe that the new clauses and new schedule will enable us to deliver a range of market model options in future. They amend the Secretary of State&#146;s powers under the Gas Act 1986 and the Electricity Act 1989 to create new licensable activities and ensure that, by affirmative order, he can create new licensable activities in connection with providing, installing or operating smart meters or the related communications infrastructure. The power also provides that the Secretary of State may make regulations so that he or Ofgem will be able to award those licences following a competitive tender process, the detail of which is outlined in schedule 4. We believe that that type of power is the best way to ensure that we can deliver a range of market model options to ensure that, whatever model we choose, we retain an appropriate element of competition. This is about ensuring that we deliver the smart meters effectively and that we have competition that is not obtuse or bizarre but effective, and a model that enables it to be delivered.</p>

 Will this allow the Secretary of State to ensure that the same type of smart meter is installed in an area so that if someone wishes to switch they are able to do so without needing to have a meter removed and a different type refitted?</p>

 We want to ensure that people are able easily to switch. We do not necessarily want to ensure that all the smart meters are provided by exactly the same supplier&#151;we want an element of competition. In terms of delivery, we must work out how we ensure that we have smart meters that enable effective switching so that people do not need to swap them if they decide to switch suppliers two or three times a month to get the best price. I do not have a straight answer to the hon. Gentleman&#146;s question whether there will be one standard meter, although I think that there probably will not be.  <br>

On whether we can frame a system of smart meters that will facilitate the sorts of circumstances where people are able to switch, I think that we should be able to do that. However, we need to consult those who will be delivering this stuff to ensure that the mechanics of doing it are right.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o155"><a name="81118-0010.htm_para12"><a name="08111882000541">The Government will be aware that we have supported the approach taken in the Bill towards encouraging nuclear new-build.

We have to examine the changes proposed in the Bill in conjunction with some of the other initiatives that the government are taking to encourage people to consider nuclear new-build.</p>

That is a good example for other areas of energy policy. I single out for praise the work of Dr. Tim Stone in trying to identify where the obstacles may be, looking specifically at the nuclear installations inspectorate and seeing what needs to be done to provide it with additional resources and more skilled personnel so that it can move forward more quickly with the work of assessing the role that different reactor types might be able to play.</p>

We strongly support the obligation to publish the decommissioning guidance and the requirement on the Secretary of State to take account of that guidance. We also welcome the clarification of the definition of what would constitute information that is false or misleading. In fact, we proposed that in Committee, so it would be rather churlish not to support it now.</p>

For example, one report could have covered 15 months, with the next covering nine months, and we could not easily have gained a clear picture of what was going on. We could not compare like with like. We therefore welcome the Government&#146;s change of heart and the decision to state specifically the definition of the reporting period, which will relate largely to the calendar year.</p>

Perhaps that approach could be taken to other Government reports, for example, on the number of people in fuel poverty. The figures always appear to lag approximately three years behind the actual figures. They probably do not lag when the numbers are going down, but when they increase, there seems to be more of a lag. Nevertheless, the requirement is a welcome step forward and we are pleased to support it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o161"><a name="81118-0010.htm_para18"><a name="08111882000547">One of the most significant changes of heart that the Government had during the Bill&#146;s passage was about smart metering. We are pleased that they will mandate the installation of smart meters. It will make a huge contribution to resolving fuel poverty, removing for ever the need for estimated bills. It will enable people to choose the cheapest tariff much more constructively and give the customer much more information. It will also help meet the environmental goals, which we share, encouraging people to use energy outside peak times. It will also be a key element in encouraging microgeneration by measuring two-way flows of electricity: that which is brought into a house and that which is exported from it. It will be essential if feed-in tariffs are to work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o162"><a name="81118-0010.htm_para19"><a name="08111882000548">It is crucial that smart meters will apply to gas, electricity and, potentially, water. That is an important step in fulfilling a range of different goals. It is a step towards what would be called a smart grid&#151;a much more intelligent grid&#151;and being able to control the way in which people&#146;s electricity is used and manage demand much more effectively.</p>

We are also glad that they have been persuaded of the need to accept a time scale for introducing smart meters.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o164"><a name="81118-0010.htm_para21"><a name="08111882000550">The 10-year roll-out is not significantly different from the current rate. Typically, in a year, 8 per cent. of meters are replaced and, just on that natural rate of churn, one would expect the whole country to be done in 12 or 13 years. Ten years is, therefore, not especially ambitious, but we recognise that it has much support in industry and with other groups outside.</p>

 It is the first time that I have spoken in today&#146;s debate, so, first, I congratulate the Department on moving some way with the amendments that it has tabled. We all acknowledge that the Bill is much better than the measure we started debating.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o169"><a name="81118-0010.htm_para26"><a name="08111882000556">I am grateful to the Department for providing a briefing on some of the amendments that we are discussing today, partly because some are complex. I was encouraged by the heading, &#147;Nuclear energy&#151;false and misleading&#148;, but, sadly, it was only an introduction to amendment No. 49. For one moment, I thought that the revolution in the Department of Energy and Climate Change had begun&#151;sadly, it has not.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o170"><a name="81118-0010.htm_para27"><a name="08111882000557">I am surprised by amendment No. 49. I accept the Minister&#146;s comments that Members in the other place felt that clause 57 was onerous, but it is strange to punish knowingly false and misleading information, yet excuse it if it is slightly false and misleading, even if it is &#147;knowingly or recklessly&#148; provided. If even a small amount of false information is provided knowingly and recklessly, a small fine might be appropriate, but there should still be a penalty. Although we will not make a huge issue of that, there is a good case for retaining clause 57 unamended.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o171"><a name="81118-0010.htm_para28"><a name="08111882000558">By contrast, we unreservedly welcome amendments Nos. 46 and 47 to clause 51. More frequent use of &#147;must&#148; in legislation that applies to Ministers is a good thing. Some of the duties that the amendments would explicitly create helpfully strengthen clause 51. The Minister understandably gave the amendments a slightly understated welcome, but he should be congratulated on accepting them. If they mean that the Department has to take into account the advice of, for example, the Health and Safety Executive and the Environment Agency, and that it must publish the way in which it has taken that advice, it will be less tempted to balance health and environmental considerations with those dictated by short-term political convenience&#151;or, as is more likely, political embarrassment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o172"><a name="81118-0010.htm_para29"><a name="08111882000559">Let me deal with amendments Nos. 48 to 53&#151;the most interesting set of amendments, which the Minister portrayed as somewhat technical&#151;which cover the slightly controversial subject of the nuclear decommissioning programme. The hon. Member for Wealden (Charles Hendry) is right that there was considerable debate, which I shall not revisit, about them in Committee. However, it was good to hear the hon. Gentleman making it crystal clear that the Conservative party is now enthusiastically pro-nuclear and has abandoned the ambivalence that seemed to be present in Committee about whether it could be simultaneously pro-nuclear and anti-nuclear. He clearly said that he wanted to encourage nuclear new-build, and I welcome his clarification of his party&#146;s position. It is obviously not our position.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o173"><a name="81118-0010.htm_para30"><a name="08111882000560">We are especially concerned for the amendments on arrangements for securities to do what the Minister suggested and better protect the taxpayer. What would  <br>

happen if the funded nuclear decommissioning programmes turned out not to be so well funded? That is a critical question. The amendments sensibly help define the term &#147;securities&#148; in a legal context. However, as we know, not all securities are as secure as others. As businesses and local authorities that are trying to recover funds from Iceland have found, some bonds and investments turn out not be as secure as they had believed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o174"><a name="81118-0010.htm_para31"><a name="08111882000561">That underlines the long-term issue with funded decommissioning programmes for nuclear power, which is whether, in the event of future economic downturns, financial crises or simply bank failures, the public purse will yet again have to subsidise nuclear power. Perhaps this is a moment for the Minister to clarify how likely he thinks it is that those provisions will be used to allow public funds yet again to bail out the nuclear industry, which seems to us to be a bail-out that we need not risk at all.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o175"><a name="81118-0011.htm_para0"><a name="08111882000562">Many of the remaining amendments in the group are technical, tidying amendments, which is welcome. The most interesting are those from amendment No. 63 onwards, which relate to smart meters. I entirely endorse the comments that other hon. Members have made about these important provisions. It is welcome that we are setting the framework for smart meters to be introduced. Smart meters will empower householders, so that they can not only play their part in tackling climate change and helping to save the planet, but use their household appliances much more efficiently and reduce their energy bills, thereby tackling fuel poverty. That has to be a good thing and, as the hon. Member for Wealden pointed out, may contribute towards a more intelligent use of energy on the grid more broadly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o176"><a name="81118-0011.htm_para1"><a name="08111882000563">It is a shame that the time scales envisaged in the amendments are of the rather more relaxed kind that were typical of the old Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform, rather than the imaginative new Department for Energy and Climate Change. It is pretty disappointing that the process will be complete only by 2020. We all know&#151;the financial crisis has underlined this&#151;that the House and the Government can certainly move fast when they want to. It would therefore be nice to see a greater sense of urgency in the planning of the introduction of smart metering.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o177"><a name="81118-0011.htm_para2"><a name="08111882000564">The Minister is right, however, that there are complicated details to be sorted out. I understand that, and the devil will be in the detail. I am sure that I am not alone in having already been lobbied quite extensively by advocates of different systems and technologies. We can all anticipate a heated debate on the regulations and orders made under the Bill. It will be important that we get them right and that we correctly balance commercial competitiveness, affordability for energy customers and the environmental priority of having the best possible technology to allow people to reduce their energy use.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o178"><a name="81118-0011.htm_para3"><a name="08111882000565">Overall, however, progress is progress. I end by congratulating the Government on the bulk of the amendments and on the green shoots of environmental change that they are beginning to cultivate in their policies.</p>

 I was interested in the opening comment that the hon. Member for Wealden (Charles Hendry) made about the vote moving his way. I look at the assembled ranks behind him and wonder whether that would continue&#151;mind you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, I look at the similarly empty Benches behind me and wonder what our majority would be. I join the hon. Gentleman in praising the work of Dr. Tim Stone and welcome the establishment of the office of nuclear development, which was set up by my predecessor, my right hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, North (Malcolm Wicks), who was with us earlier, and our predecessors in the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform, including the then Secretary of State.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o179"><a name="81118-0011.htm_para4"><a name="08111882000567">Let me deal with the points that have been raised. On the target of two years plus 10 years, we are undertaking a massive project and we need the time to do it properly. New build provides us with the opportunity to make sensible provisions early on. We would like to consult the building industry on how quickly we can introduce the scheme, but it makes sense that new buildings should have the new smart meters as soon as possible.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o180"><a name="81118-0011.htm_para5"><a name="08111882000568">The hon. Member for Cheltenham (Martin Horwood) raised a couple of issues, including one about clause 57 and the need for materiality before a prosecution is undertaken. If somebody knowingly or recklessly gave information that was utterly immaterial to the decommissioning process, it would be a bit onerous for us even to give them a small fine. People do things frivolously, and that can be taken as reckless; therefore, we need some element of materiality in a criminal prosecution. That is why we have decided to accept the proposal made in the other place that there would need to be some issue about the release that was deserving of prosecution.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o181"><a name="81118-0011.htm_para6"><a name="08111882000569">The hon. Gentleman also asked about the public becoming responsible for decommissioning. I remind him that nuclear power was initially public, which meant that there was an obvious public liability in relation to decommissioning. However, in respect of the introduction of nuclear power in the future, we have said that we are putting in place robust mechanisms to ensure that the taxpayer is protected, through ensuring that the operator securely pays sufficient funds to cover the costs of decommissioning and waste management. We have no intention of subsidising new nuclear, and that will include the costs of constructing the stations. Keeping the costs of construction under control is a matter for energy companies, not the Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o182"><a name="81118-0011.htm_para7"><a name="08111882000570">The strength of the regime lies in the wide range of powers that we have taken. They include the power for the Secretary of State to modify a programme, issue a direction, request information, undertake reviews and, if appropriate, bring criminal proceedings to ensure compliance. The power to place bodies corporate associated with the operator under certain obligations&#151;for example, if the Secretary of State considers that there is a risk to taxpayer protection&#151;adds further strength to that regime. The regime is fairly robust and will ensure that we can protect the taxpayer. Having responded to those points, I hope that the House will be able to support the amendment.</p>

 This group of amendments covers a large group of areas that the Bill addresses, including: the duties of Ofgem and the related issue of access to the transmission grid for new electricity generation projects, including renewables; the ability of distribution network operators to recover the costs associated with making offers of connection to new developments; and ensuring consistency between the Bill and the existing statutory framework for energy policy.</p>

We have had a lot of debate about Ofgem and its powers during the passage of the Bill. A number of concerns have been raised, centring on the need to give sustainability greater priority in Ofgem&#146;s statutory duties and the need to address the problems of strategic investment in the electricity transmission grid in the medium and longer term, and access to the existing grid in the shorter term.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o187"><a name="81118-0011.htm_para12"><a name="08111893000010">After the determination shown on the subject by Members of both Houses, we brought forward a package of amendments in the other place that we believe will address those key concerns. The first element of our proposals, in Lords amendments Nos. 54, 95, 96 and 104, is to change the Secretary of State&#146;s and Ofgem&#146;s duties in two ways. The first is by placing the words &#147;existing and future consumers&#148; directly into the wording of the primary duty. In the other place, the Government were persuaded by arguments that placing such a formulation of words directly into Ofgem&#146;s primary duty would be a clear signal from Parliament that it must take the needs of tomorrow&#146;s consumers into account when making decisions today. It is a key signal about the importance of sustainability in decision making.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o188"><a name="81118-0011.htm_para13"><a name="08111893000011">The second change to the duties was made in response to those who wanted the Government to find a way to put consideration of sustainability on to an equal level with security of supply.</p>

 I have not left the point about Ofgem, but I was going on to the second part of it. I shall make that point and then give way to my hon. Friend.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o189"><a name="81118-0011.htm_para14"><a name="08111893000014">The second change in relation to Ofgem was making sustainability equal with the issue of security of supply. Amendments Nos. 54, 95, 96 and 104 will therefore place sustainability at the same level within the hierarchy of duties as security of supply, at the top of Ofgem&#146;s list of secondary duties. We are confident that that will give sustainability more prominence in Ofgem&#146;s decision-making process, while maintaining its primary focus on consumer protection, without creating uncertainty for investment in new energy infrastructure.</p>

 It is clear in example after example in my constituency that Ofgem is powerless in a number of ways. What is being done to improve the situation so that we can best protect our constituents? Clearly, just now, Ofgem is almost a toothless tiger.</p>

<p><a name="st_o186"><a name="08111893000017"><a name="81118-0011.htm_spnew7"><a name="08111893000111"><b>Mr. O'Brien:</b>
 It seems to me that the way in which Ofgem was set up gives it quite strong powers. In the past, it has worked with the industry to ensure that competition was effectively delivered. We have been clear with Ofgem that we expect it to use its powers robustly in future to ensure not only that competition is effectively delivered, but that consumers are fully protected.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o191"><a name="81118-0011.htm_para16"><a name="08111893000018">That needs to be done within the context of recognising that we are expecting billions of pounds-worth of investment in new generation to come from the energy companies. We are asking for vast amounts of money from them&#151;billions of pounds&#151;for new power stations, renewables development, wind farms and nuclear. The change in the size of the agenda is massive. Ofgem is well aware that it has a role in ensuring security of supply and a competitive market, and that the consumer is dealt with responsibly when it comes to competition. However, it must also ensure that the energy companies are able to bring forward that very substantial generation, to ensure that we have the energy that consumers need for the future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o192"><a name="81118-0011.htm_para17"><a name="08111893000019">Getting that balance right is always going to cause a lot of debate and disagreement. Ministers are supporting Ofgem, but we are also making it clear that the new Department expects it to use its powers robustly. At the same time, it must recognise that there is a wider agenda than merely keeping prices as low as possible. Recognising that agenda is desirable for all us, as the energy suppliers agreed when we met them yesterday. It is also important that we bring forward that investment and deal fairly with suppliers.</p>

 I am grateful for the Minister&#146;s clarification, because the implications of the words added to Ofgem&#146;s primary duty are quite far reaching. Is the Minister confident that Ofgem understands that this is not simply a bolt-on phrase that is being added to the primary duty, but a sea change in thinking? I ask that because whenever we have asked Ofgem to address specific commitments either to a future shift to renewable energy or to specific provisions that address the needs of the fuel poor, we have not been able to get it to go beyond its primary duty, which is delivering price competition within the market. If the poorest have had any choice, it has been simply to change supplier. What the Minister said represented a much more radical upheaval in the thinking. Does he feel that Ofgem is clear about the scale of the sea change that he has invited them to accept?</p>

issues, and they are aware. Indeed, more importantly, the suppliers and generators of energy will need to be aware that the requirements are part of Ofgem&#146;s remit. Therefore, when it comes to making decisions, they will have to have regard to the requirements. They are important changes, but whether they amount to a sea change or an element of radicalism remains to be seen. We have made it clear to Ofgem that we expect it to have full and proper regard to the changes when it makes decisions.</p>

 I always find that the problem with Ofgem is simply that the guiding factor was not necessarily consumers, but its strange vision of locational charging. That everything was determined by an economic theory of locational charging was always the excuse, for example, when we approached it about difficulties with grid connections. I am not sure that the changes to bring sustainability will necessarily deal with that central problem with Ofgem.</p>

 At the time of privatisation, when the rules under which Ofgem operates were set, it was required to have regard to competition in particular. Ofgem officials have always fallen back, in my discussions with them, on that requirement. With the legislation, we are trying to clarify and emphasise some of Ofgem&#146;s roles, so that we can get it into a better position to deal with the issues, without damaging the way in which we expect companies to bring forward long-term investment.</p>

Because this market is a good one, I believe that most of them would want to be here in any event. However, there are degrees and proportions of investment, and we therefore want to ensure that we have the Ofgem rules right. We have listened with care to the arguments in this place and the other place on how to introduce issues such as the need to look after the interests of future consumers and sustainability. We have also examined how to ensure that electricity transmission issues are better addressed.</p>

I am not presenting this to the hon. Member for Angus as a panacea; it is not. We recognise precisely what he says&#151;that there are issues about transmission access to the grid and that they have to be resolved. That is why we sought the transmission access review to look further into how to resolve these problems, and the process to get agreement on how to deal with it is now under way.

The Government believe that an element of up-front charging for assessment work related to large commercial projects is an efficient way of balancing the need to promote competition in the market for distribution network connections, while disincentivising speculative connection requests. What happens is we get these speculative requests, they get a slot, they crowd out those that are more definite, and it ends up with those who want access being put further down the queue. We need the capacity to charge some fees, so I believe that this is the right approach. It is envisaged that the regulations will be made, following a consultation by Ofgem to ascertain the most appropriate way of allowing these charges to be levied.</p>

The worst case I know of is the offer of a connection in 2022&#151;14 years from where we are now&#151;even though the facility will be available to run many years before that.

It is an awkward formulation, and I am not convinced that it will achieve what some of our noble Friends believed it would, as they thought it would be a completely unambiguous provision, but there is still room for some doubt about that.</p>

The reform of energy pricing should one day break the link between the increased use of energy and electricity and the profits of the energy companies. That link has to be broken in some way. We need to reflect on whether it can be done by allowing consumers to pay still more for increased use of energy or by capping the profit that an energy company can take from an increase, perhaps redistributing it as another means of tackling fuel poverty. These issues are being looked at by other regulators. Ofwat is having some interesting discussions in connection with the current price review on water, attempting to break the link between resource use and private profit.

That has been advocated by the British Wind Energy Association&#151;and I suppose we might say that it would advocate that, wouldn&#146;t it? But it is also supported by the Sustainable Development Commission, which is there to advise the Government independently on the application of sustainable development policy. It is through tests such as this that we will really see whether this section of the Bill is strong enough to achieve the kind of change that we want to see in the energy markets, and will support the ambitious targets for carbon reduction that we will probably be debating later this evening.</p>

 I want to make a few brief remarks on this subject. I have had many struggles with Ofgem over the years on the question of transmission charges. I genuinely welcome the amendments, which move things forward a little, particularly on up-front charges and the ridiculous situation with people having to wait years for connections. I continue to have concerns, particularly about Ofgem&#146;s state of mind on locational charging and economic theory.

At the end of the day, a clause was inserted into the Bill to allow one area to have capped charges. It was widely assumed at that time we were talking about the Highlands and Islands of Scotland. However, it was only the islands of Scotland on which the price cap was placed; it did not really work, and Ofgem continued on its own merry way.</p>

Ofgem has tended to be the organisation that advised the Secretary of State of the actions he should take, so we seem to be getting into a slightly circular difficulty with that. The measure will also last for only two years. This is the same argument with the sunset clause on the capping charges, which allowed five years, if I remember correctly, for the first development that was capped, as it was very quickly on a sliding scale.

That suggests that Ofgem&#146;s mindset is beginning to change a little, but I would have liked to see something stronger to ensure that the grid was strengthened and our wide capacity for renewables would be able to connect to the grid quickly.

 Lords amendment No. 65 is decidedly good news and amendment (a) simply seeks to put a time frame around its implementation. The reason I say that it is decidedly good news is that there has been a very important shift in the thinking about how we deal with the heat part of the energy agenda. For a long time whenever Members approached Ministers on the issue, we were given the rather intriguing assurance that the Department had a &#147;team on heat.&#148; This may have raised some eye-watering prospects as to what life was like in the then Department for Trade and Industry or Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform, but it was not clear whether this team on heat was delivering anything.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o214"><a name="81118-0012.htm_para10"><a name="08111893000054">One of the problems was that the efforts at that time were centred on trying to find an equivalent of the renewables obligation for heat. The good news about the amendment is that it represents an abandonment of that search in favour of a feed-in tariff arrangements; a production tariff, the like of which we can see in operation in other parts of Europe. I welcome that, and the important thing for us to address now is the time scale and the significance of the measure in connecting with other parts of the renewables agenda that we have already debated this afternoon.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o215"><a name="81118-0012.htm_para11"><a name="08111893000055">I would like to give just a couple of examples of why it is important that we get the time frame right. Perhaps I should say in parentheses that I welcome the fact that the Government have accepted that there should be no threshold in relation to heat generation. That is a definite good move that allows us to bridge the gap that currently exists between ourselves and, for example, Germany in relation to the generation of heat from renewable sources. In the UK at the moment there are 17 biodigesters producing gas and heat. In Germany, there are 5,500. The reason for that is that the German system already has a production tariff, which allows the system to work in ways that direct heat to off-grid communities and/or to the fuel poor, while allowing it to connect to the use of biogas for electricity. That is why it is important that the Government synchronise the timetables for the introduction of this renewables-intensive programme, and that we set in the cross-party amendments the same sort of time frame that we wanted to see in place for the introduction of feed-in tariffs for electricity. Let me give some examples as to how that makes sense.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o216"><a name="81118-0012.htm_para12"><a name="08111893000056">First, if a hospital, as in my own city, is considering investing in the construction of a biodigester that would take hospital waste, including food waste, and some of the biodigestible waste from other parts of the city, it will want to use that waste to create biogas, to increase its quality to biomethane and to use it to provide direct heating. In parts of the summer, when it might not require heating to the same extent, the obvious answer is to turn the excess heat into electricity. So there is an overlapping purpose: connection to the renewable energy agenda makes sense for the renewable heat agenda.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o217"><a name="81118-0012.htm_para13"><a name="08111893000057">The same applies to off-grid communities and the fuel poor.

fixed gas prices for the entire contract period for the disposal of the biodigestible waste. In an era of ever-spiralling gas prices in the international gas market, everyone who can offer, in real terms, fixed gas prices by taking what is currently a problem&#151;biodigestible waste&#151;and turning it into a fixed-price resource is almost offering a winning lottery ticket. Against the criteria of how we address the needs of the fuel poor and those of off-grid communities, such schemes in many respects offer a potential that is at least as large as the capacity to generate renewable electricity and place it in the context of renewable gas and heat. The point of amendment (a) is simply to say that, if we seek to remove confusion, it would be phenomenally helpful if the schemes for both could be synchronised.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o218"><a name="81118-0012.htm_para14"><a name="08111893000058">I do not want to be dogmatic given that, if I were to turn the argument around slightly, it would be disastrous to hold back one scheme just because the final details were not in place for the second. However, it is still legitimate for us to say that, as we think about the time scales for electricity, it makes sense for us to try to synchronise them with the time scales for the introduction of renewable heat incentives. In many cases, the same companies, communities and localities will be at the heart of that investment planning. So if we are to offer a genuinely joined-up approach to our renewables strategy, it would be helpful to have the same sort of time scale according to which we seek to deliver them.</p>

 I associate myself very much with the remarks that we have just heard from the hon. Member for Nottingham, South (Alan Simpson). We welcome greatly the distance that the Government have already travelled on this issue. In Committee, we were told that this was a step too far, and there was a sense that we would fail to include any aspect of heat in the Bill. It shows how far the Government have moved that we are considering in more detail today a proposal that was put into the Bill in the other place.</p>

About half the energy consumed in the United Kingdom is in the form of heat, and its generation is responsible for about 47 per cent. of our carbon emissions, so it must be a crucial part of the Government&#146;s carbon abatement programme. But all too often, it has been easy to overlook the importance of heat, because many different households are involved, it is complicated and the solutions have been less easy to consider than in other parts of energy policy. However, we are glad that the Government have sought to address the issue and have made progress on it.</p>

It is very neat process. The only thing that is missed is the extra heat that is emitted as part of firing the boilers, which means that, as a result, some heat escapes into the atmosphere. The final link would be to capture that heat and supply it to businesses or homes that need extra heat.</p>

The Renewable Energy Association is concerned that the Lords amendment excludes biodiesel, as it refers to biogas and biomass. There is concern that it could be extremely problematic to have a definition of biomass in primary legislation for the first time that is possibly inconsistent with existing support mechanisms. The Renewable Energy Association suggests that the safest approach would be to use the definition of biomass found in the current renewables directive and the draft 2008 version.</p>

Essentially, Ofgem would introduce a levy and take money from the generators. That money would presumably go to the Treasury and become a Government grant to renewable heat producers. If the Department already knows that that is roughly the model that it is considering, it would help those in the world outside who might be thinking of going into such things to understand what sort of support they might get, just in very broad terms. I understand that the Minister does not yet know the detail.</p>

Member for Wealden (Charles Hendry) says, we are talking about something that is a huge part of our overall energy mix and that could be a big part of our renewable energy targets by 2020. According to figures from the National Grid Company which I am sure the Minister has seen, in what might be described as a &#147;stretch scenario&#148;, an amount approaching 10 per cent. of our 15 per cent. target for 2020 could come from renewable heat, gas on the grid and the like. The scope for that seems enormous.</p>

 This is a strange moment for me.

That Bill, which was drawn up by Friends of the Earth, was talked out. I also sponsored a Bill promoted by the hon. Member for Edinburgh, North and Leith (Mark Lazarowicz) providing for a renewable heat obligation. As I recall, that obligation was dropped from the Bill because of staunch opposition from the Government.

I understand why information should be required&#151;the hon. Member for Wealden (Charles Hendry) rightly said that people would need it so that they could take a view&#151;but because heat, including renewable heat, is a new and potentially complex area of policy, it will take some time to make the necessary arrangements. A new Department with a new agenda has made a series of changes to the Bill at quite a late stage, and, understandably, a good deal of work on the details of the policy remains to be done.</p>

We want to enable those who generate heat to be paid from a levy to be imposed on those who supply fossil fuel for the purpose. The funds created by the levy will be used to support the production of renewable heat. That formulation, however, does not take us far enough. We could do this through the Treasury, through something more like the renewables obligation or through a direct mechanism like a feed-in tariff, which I think would be preferable. We need to think about the details, and discuss them not only with the industry but with all the potential beneficiaries.</p>

Friend the Member for Nottingham, South (Alan Simpson) and the hon. Member for Wealden, people want to know about the timetable. We plan to introduce the renewable heat incentive as soon as possible, and hope to be able to set out a robust timetable in the new year.

Clearly the two schemes will have to work side by side, and clearly it will be important to provide a single interface for generators who will want to benefit from both schemes. Heat is a complex issue, and considerable time will be required for the development of the strategy. However, we must find a way of providing the two financial incentives together, so that people can benefit from both.</p>

 I am tempted by that suggestion, but I would want to be a little cautious about it. The hon.

Throughout discussions on the issue in this House and in the other place, the Government&#146;s consistent position has been that it is vital to put in place strong mechanisms to deal with emissions from international aviation and international shipping, but that finding the right way of deciding on which of those emissions should be allocated as being the UK&#146;s responsibility is beyond our reach at the moment. These amendments reflect the view&#151;as expressed by the Chairman of the shadow Committee on Climate Change, Lord Turner of Ecchinswell, in his letter to the Secretary of State&#151;that although the right methodology does not yet exist for including these emissions in the carbon budgets, decisions made by the Committee or the Government in relation to the budgets must take into account projected emissions from international aviation and shipping. On Report in the Commons, the Government accepted an amendment that reflected the Committee&#146;s view, but on the basis that we would need to ask parliamentary counsel to advise on the drafting. We propose amendments Nos. 7A and 7B to fulfil this commitment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o250"><a name="81118-0013.htm_para18"><a name="08111898000012">Amendment No. 7A would require that both the Government and the Committee take account of projected emissions from international aviation and international shipping in setting, and advising on, carbon budgets, respectively. Amendment No. 7B defines what we have in mind, and also provides that the projections may be estimated using such reasonable methods as the Secretary of State or the Committee considers appropriate.</p>

Amendment No. 17A would require the Secretary of State to set in secondary legislation a binding limit on the use of carbon units for each budgetary period, taking into account the views of the Committee on Climate Change on the appropriate balance between domestic and overseas effort. This limit would also have to be set in the context of the requirement, which we introduced in Committee in the Commons, for the Secretary of State to have regard to the need for UK domestic action on climate change in considering how to meet the 2050 target or any carbon budget. In proposing a limit, the Secretary of State would also have to consider each of the matters in clause 11, which must be taken into account in coming to</p>

credits that affected the EU ETS sector by including emissions allowances sourced from participants in the scheme elsewhere in the EU would conflict with the UK&#146;s commitment to this key policy measure. This approach could also undermine the economic efficiency of the trading scheme by placing further requirements on UK-based participants that were not imposed elsewhere in the EU. Such a limit would also cause a real likelihood that we will find ourselves with inconsistencies or a lack of transparency, which would go against everything we are trying to do in this Bill.

We are pleased that the Government have agreed that there will be a limit on the carbon units that can be purchased from abroad and that, in doing so, they will take into account the advice of the independent Climate Change Committee.

President-elect Obama says that he wants 5 million jobs in that sector in the United States. The question before us is how much of that new economy will be based in the UK. The lack of clarity that surrounded carbon trading in the Bill jeopardised Britain&#146;s opportunity to maximise its potential in that regard. The amendments are certainly not the answer to all our problems, nor will they herald a new economic age on their own, but they will give greater clarity and market certainty, and for that reason, we welcome their inclusion in the Bill.</p>

 Amendments Nos. 17A and 17B represent a small step in the right direction on the issue of domestic effort, but remain vague. Their lordships thought that at least 70 per cent. of the savings needed to be made domestically. Their Bill came to this House, and the Government got rid of that provision in Committee. The Bill went back to the other place, and they said, &#147;All right, we won&#146;t do that, but there will at least be some sort of cap.&#148; I suppose that having some sort of cap is better than having none, but there is no indication in the amendments of what cap we are talking about&#151;whether it is 50, 60 or 70 per cent.</p>

I want to stress, however, that this is not purely a technocratic issue&#151;I am glad to see that the Secretary of State is in his place&#151;where we just buy from the cheapest place, and assume that if we buy abroad or at home it does not much matter because a tonne of carbon is a tonne of carbon. National leadership is fundamentally important, and I am worried that his Department has started to say something profoundly concerning. When questions are asked about what Governments might do that would lead to emissions, such as airport expansion, coal-fired power plants or whatever, the answer from Ministers is that it does not matter because there is an overall cap. Heathrow expansion does not matter because aviation is in the emissions trading scheme&#151;</p>

 The Secretary of State is shaking his head, but Ministers have said from the Dispatch Box that these things do not matter any more because there is an overall cap. It would be horrific if Britain were to send a signal to the world, through its decisions about airport expansion, coal-fired power stations or whatever, that we were doing such things while somehow expecting others not to do them and that it did not matter because of a cap. The relevance of that to amendments Nos. 17A and 17B is that if we simply think that we can emit like crazy, but buy it in, we are undermining not just the moral leadership to which the hon.

 My hon. Friend is sitting behind me, but I guess he cannot read my handwriting from there. My second point was precisely that&#151;I had written, &#147;overseas credits bring &#145;wrong&#146; technology&#148;. From a developmental point of view, there is a place for assisting developing countries to deal with carbon emissions in order to prevent them from going down a path of dirty technology. It is far better, however, to save carbon emissions at home. We can then put money into technology that will work in the developed world where the big emissions problem is. There is a strong case not to say that a tonne of carbon saved is a tonne of carbon saved and it does not matter where. If we save it at home we are spending money on technology that works in the rich world, which can be exported. That is good for the green economy, and helps the world to tackle its carbon emissions.</p>

I make no apologies for egging&#151;not over-egging&#151;this pudding because we need the Government to take the conclusions of the Climate Change Committee seriously. I hope that they will have listened to the arguments that we, and others, are making, and will come up with something tough on the need for domestic effort. Ministers have started to say that we can do all sorts of things because we live in an emissions-trading world and it does not matter. That is profoundly worrying.

about our support for a global trading market. The ultimate goal is to have a truly global carbon market, and that is particularly important given the ongoing negotiations on a comprehensive global long-term framework for action, which we hope will be agreed in Copenhagen in December next year.</p>

We know that doing so is in our interests, as is saving energy and being more energy-secure. He need only look at our renewables strategy to know that we have made a commitment, that we expect to produce many more green jobs as a consequence, and that that is clearly in this country&#146;s interest. For that reason, we can give assurances that a huge domestic effort will be made; indeed, we have a raft of policies in place to make that domestic effort.</p>

 Does my hon. Friend agree that our concern is perhaps not so much with the level of the cap&#151;I would prefer a high one&#151;but about the quality of the credits that can be bought? There has been great debate about the quality of the clean development mechanism&#151;CDM&#151;credits that have been traded so far. Although I am very much in favour of a higher cap, I think that it is the job of an independent climate change committee to inform government about what it thinks is the quality of the credits that are available. There is no point saying that we will have a cap, and then spending 20 or 30 per cent. of the UK carbon account on useless credits.</p>

 I thank my hon. Friend for this contribution; I could not agree with him more, because this matter is tremendously important. Much criticism of the CDM has been made, some of which is entirely justified, but the Government have worked very hard to ensure that improvements are made. We believe that the mechanism is basically sound, but, as he said, this is about the quality of the projects. Some projects have been cheap and large, which was perhaps understandable in the early days but it was very controversial in the example of the HCFC-22 programme, which has now been halted. He rightly says that we need to be concerned about the quality, but there is no conflict on this matter. A big domestic effort will be made, as I have said, but we also see the value in being able to help, through the credits system, developing countries. Of course, they have a great need to deal with their own advances and growth, and they need to bring their population out of poverty at the same time as curbing the growth in their emissions.</p>

The procurement of new energy-efficient buildings is just one element of the strategy to reduce energy consumption on the Government estate, but we are fully committed to procuring buildings in the upper quartile of energy performance.

 My hon. Friend is obviously referring to existing buildings. I do not expect that we would in any way seek to deal retrospectively with such cases. That does not mean that we not very committed and anxious to do what we can to improve energy efficiency throughout the Government estate. Right hon. and hon. Members will appreciate that Governments have acquired over a long history a great many buildings that are probably the least efficient that we could find. There is a huge historical backlog when it comes to solving the problem&#151;<i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i><i> </i>Hon. Members are looking at the roof&#151;and we all understand how difficult it is to be energy-efficient in such buildings.</p>

We seek to make those improvements, and, of course, one of the easiest times to do that is when we attempt to procure a new building. At that point we would have real choices, although of course we would be keen to do what we could elsewhere.</p>

We have clarified the definition of &#147;building&#148; to ensure that it captures those buildings where energy performance is a relevant consideration, as well as defining the civil estate. No one has risen to intervene on that point, but it is strange to try to imagine a building where energy performance is not a relevant consideration.

I thank the Minister for her courteous and generous remarks. Credit should go to my hon.

In fact, if the Ministry of Defence&#151;which has achieved its own reductions, by selling off QinetiQ in particular&#151;is discounted, all the public estate performance improvements are negated. Carbon emissions from the civil service estate offices have increased by 22 per cent. since 2006 and energy efficiency has worsened by 3.3 per cent. since 2006.

The Office of Government Commerce is considering the introduction of national property controls, which will require Government organisations to develop business case justifications that address sustainability as well as efficient and effective building performance in respect of all new building acquisitions or leases.

 The Government have a policy of not building on green belt, and some Essex councils have held meaningful consultations and then voted to protect their green belt. The petitioners feel that councillors in Castle Point are railroading through plans, in order to get a &#163;200,000 pay-off from the Government. Apparently, councillors have their price, which is about the cost of a house. I sincerely urge the councillors to listen to the petitioners, to consult the public before they cast their vote, to forget the bribe, and to join the campaign to save our green belt, which I started two years ago, and which is backed by everyone except the developers and their friends. I thank and congratulate the many excellent people who signed the petition, which states:</p>

The sheer size of the proposed development of up to 750 houses would be catastrophic and out of character with the area. Infrastructure, including roads, sewers, school places, dentists, youth facilities and much else are insufficient even without the additional houses. And we note that our neighbouring councillors, unlike Castle Point Councillors, have consulted their residents widely and have voted against green belt development; further note that the Government has stated green belt should not be built upon; therefore urge Castle Point Councillors to consult the public before they vote to destroy our environment and quality of life.</p>

 I am delighted to have secured this debate on such an important subject. There are an estimated 2 million people in the UK living with or beyond cancer. An estimated 550,000 of them have had a diagnosis of breast cancer. That includes people who have completed their treatment and are cancer-free, as well as those who are living with the active disease. A sizeable proportion of those 550,000 people could be living with secondary or metastatic breast cancer, which occurs when cancer spreads from the breast&#151;the primary tumour site&#151;to another part of the body, such as the liver or the bones. At that point, the disease does not become, say, liver cancer. It is, in fact, still breast cancer that has spread to the liver.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o298"><a name="81118-0016.htm_para0"><a name="081118107000004">Once breast cancer has spread in that way, it cannot be cured, but innovative drug treatments have been developed that allow the cancer to be controlled and improve the quality of life for patients living with it, thereby making the cancer life-limiting. Yet at present it is impossible to know exactly how large the group of people living with such secondary cancer is, as incidence data are not routinely collected or widely available.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o299"><a name="81118-0016.htm_para1"><a name="081118107000005">The Under-Secretary of State for Health, my hon. Friend the Member for Brentford and Isleworth (Ann Keen), knows that Breast Cancer Care established the secondary breast cancer taskforce in 2006 to improve the treatment, support and care of people living with secondary breast cancer in the UK. The taskforce was set up when Breast Cancer Care heard that that patient group felt neglected, in terms of the care and support that it received. Since then, there have been some steps in the right direction, and both Breast Cancer Care and I offer our congratulations on that. However, there are four key issues that the organisation has focused on to ensure that those living with secondary breast cancer are given the same high standard of care and support that they received when diagnosed the first time around.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o300"><a name="81118-0016.htm_para2"><a name="081118107000006">The first of those issues is the collection of data. We do not know how many people are living with secondary breast cancer in the UK, as those data are not routinely collected. Without those data, it is unclear how many people diagnosed with primary breast cancer go on to develop it in a secondary form. In addition, the median survival time for metastatic breast cancer is estimated at three years, yet some patients will live substantially longer&#151;for up to 10 or 15 years, in some cases.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o301"><a name="81118-0016.htm_para3"><a name="081118107000007">I welcome the formation of the national cancer intelligence network, which is committed to building and retaining a new national repository of cancer data. It is an important step. Without knowing how many people are living with secondary breast cancer in England, it is impossible to provide adequate services for them. However, I look for reassurances today from the Minister that the Department of Health will make every effort to ensure that the data are collected, and collected in a timely manner, so that the necessary assessments of care for secondary patients can be made.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o302"><a name="81118-0016.htm_para4"><a name="081118107000008">The second focus is on co-ordination of care. Better co-ordination of care remains one of the most challenging aspects to improving care for this patient group, and  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="18 Nov 2008">

<notus-date day="18" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><b>18 Nov 2008 : Column 209</b><br>
access to a clinical nurse specialist or a key worker who has the skills and knowledge to manage metastatic breast cancer is a top priority. Breast cancer nurses bring immense benefits for people living with that cancer. They act as a point of contact, providing and signposting individuals to sources of emotional and psychosocial support&#151;particularly as a secondary or metastatic diagnosis is treatable but not curable, and is therefore devastating for the patient.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o303"><a name="81118-0016.htm_para5"><a name="081118107000009">National guidance states that breast cancer patients should have access to a named person whom they can contact about their care at any time. Yet breast cancer patients on the taskforce have highlighted the lack of access and the fact that secondary breast cancer patients seem to fall through a gap between the breast cancer unit and the palliative care services.</p>

<p><a name="st_o237"><a name="081118107000010"><a name="81118-0016.htm_spnew1"><a name="081118107000057"><b>Mr. David Drew (Stroud) (Lab/Co-op):</b>
 What my hon. Friend says is compelling, and surely there is a role for the hospice movement, provided that access is appropriate and people know that there is a local hospice that they can go to. There is always a worry, however, because we never seem to fund the hospice movement as generously as we could. Would my hon. Friend like to comment on that?</p>

<p><a name="st_o238"><a name="081118107000011"><a name="81118-0016.htm_spnew2"><a name="081118107000058"><b>Mrs. Riordan:</b>
 I agree with my hon. Friend and pay tribute to hospices throughout the country. I know first hand the work that they do, and, of course, they can play a part in the care of secondary breast cancer patients.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o304"><a name="81118-0016.htm_para6"><a name="081118107000012">Cancer networks, working with primary care trusts, urgently need to reconfigure their work force to ensure that they can provide this much needed and necessary service for that patient group. Therefore, I ask the Minister to restate her support for access to specialist nurses for all cancer patients, and not just for those with a primary diagnosis.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o305"><a name="81118-0016.htm_para7"><a name="081118107000013">The third focus is on adequate and sufficient access to information. Information empowers the patient, enabling them to understand their diagnosis and to make the necessary decisions about their treatment and care. Existing guidance from the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence states that information should be given to people living with breast cancer &#147;at every stage&#148;, yet the secondary breast cancer taskforce has recognised that the information needs of its patients are not being met. If patients had access to a clinical nurse specialist or to a key worker, as I have already said, those carers could point patients in the right direction and ensure that they were well informed and well prepared. Will the Minister therefore please reassure me that all cancer networks will have information managers in post by February 2009 to ensure that patients have access to the necessary support and guidance?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o306"><a name="81118-0016.htm_para8"><a name="081118107000014">Finally, the key focus of Breast Cancer Care is the provision of good psychosocial support for patients. A diagnosis of secondary breast cancer can be significantly more dramatic than a first diagnosis, which, in itself, is recognised as a highly distressing experience for patients. Further, recent studies have proved that such patients have poorer emotional as well as physical and functional health. Therefore, it is important that people living with secondary breast cancer are able to access all levels of  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="18 Nov 2008">

<notus-date day="18" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><b>18 Nov 2008 : Column 210</b><br>
psychosocial support. Breast Cancer Care very much welcomed the NICE guidance entitled &#147;Improving Supportive and Palliative Care for Adults&#148;, which is very relevant to the work of the taskforce.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o307"><a name="81118-0016.htm_para9"><a name="081118107000015">The taskforce believes that the full implementation of that guidance would significantly improve support and care for those patients. We should be working towards full implementation of the guidance by December 2009, with partial implementation by December 2008. However, it appears doubtful that that deadline will be met. It has been heard repeatedly that secondary patients are simply not receiving the psychological support that they need and that there is an apparent lack of priority for the implementation of the guidance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o308"><a name="81118-0016.htm_para10"><a name="081118107000016">Although national guidance in this area is very welcome, there has been no assessment of how the guidance is being effectively implemented. I therefore ask that the Department strengthens measures to ensure that PCTs and cancer networks fully implement the NICE guidelines. I further stress that PCTs will gain economic benefits, such as decreased hospital admissions, by ensuring that proper support care services are in place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o309"><a name="81118-0016.htm_para11"><a name="081118107000017">Finally, there needs to be a call for action. Cancer networks and PCTs should review the availability of clinical nurse specialists in their network who have the necessary skills and knowledge to deal with breast cancer patients. Service providers should be able to demonstrate that every one of their patients has access to a clinical nurse specialist and the NHS cancer patients&#146; experience survey must include the views of secondary breast cancer patients.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o310"><a name="81118-0016.htm_para12"><a name="081118107000018">Breast Cancer Care, other affiliated organisations that help to make the lives of those living with cancer a little better, and I, welcome the Government&#146;s focus on living with cancer and survivorship. But now we want that to happen at a local level, so that the patients receive the best supportive care and full access to the services to which they are entitled.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o311"><a name="81118-0016.htm_para13"><a name="081118107000019">I pay tribute to all the women with secondary breast cancer who have contributed to the work of the taskforce. Not all of them survived the experience, but they contributed their experiences of dealing with the reality of living with cancer and coping with the demands of treatment. We owe it to those people, and those who have survived them, to ensure that the standard of treatment, support and care for people with secondary breast cancer improves.</p>

 I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Halifax (Mrs. Riordan) on securing this important debate on secondary breast cancer particularly. I am the joint chair of the all-party group on breast cancer.</p>

The survivors told us that they had received wonderful and targeted treatment during their primary cancer; they could not speak highly enough of their treatment then. However, things went a bit pear-shaped when they went into secondary cancer, because they felt cut adrift.

know where to turn. They were not sure of the nature of their cancer, nor of the relationship between the primary and secondary diseases and what sort of treatments were going to take place. The treatment and support that they received changed considerably. I support what my hon. Friend has said. The Government ought to consider the issue and focus more on how a woman who has been diagnosed with secondary breast cancer can survive; it is a different ball game from the original diagnosis.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o313"><a name="81118-0016.htm_para15"><a name="081118107000022">As a member of the all-party group, I was invited to speak at a wonderful occasion in the magnificent premises of one of the engineering associations on either the Mall or George street&#151;I am not sure which. It was a multicultural event for breast cancer survivors, mainly primary survivors. The women were Chinese, Indian, West Indian, Pakistani&#151;you name it, they were there. There were many middle-class and professional people who knew what they were talking about. In my conversations that night, I learned from many of them about their concerns for other women from their community, who, having started with primary breast cancer, did not feel confident enough, because of a degree of anxiety within their family about family shame and pride, to go to their doctor for quite a while, and when they did their English was not sufficient and so they frequently had to take a child to translate for them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o314"><a name="81118-0016.htm_para16"><a name="081118107000023">I said to those women, and they agreed, that women are actually dying of embarrassment. They are so embarrassed that they are not going to the doctor when they should, at an early stage in their cancer, and by the time they get there it is often well down the line. Many of these women survive, but many do not, entirely because they have been worried about raising the subject within their own family and with a doctor. Can the Department consider how we can press to get more information to women in these communities, where little English is spoken and where they have come in as wives, possibly from the sub-continent, or wherever? Can we encourage doctors, health visitors and district nurses to be on the look-out for such women and encourage them to go to their doctor at an early stage and get an early diagnosis?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o315"><a name="81118-0016.htm_para17"><a name="081118107000024">Apparently this debate can go on until 10 o&#146;clock, but I will not keep us here for that long. However, I should like to pick up on what my hon. Friend the Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew) said about the hospice movement. The hospice movement is wonderful, but hospices often suffer from a lack of funding because primary care trusts are not injecting enough money into them. In Keighley, there is a wonderful hospice in Oxenhope called Sue Ryder Care Manorlands. Its problems have not been with Bradford and Airedale PCT but with North Yorkshire and York PCT, which, it is fair to say, has been a bit skinny with it in not giving it appropriate amounts of money to cover the number of cancer patients with whom it is dealing. Of course, many of those patients will be breast cancer patients. I have been having a big argument with that primary care trust. I think that we are now seeing the end of that argument because many of us are pushing for Manorlands to get adequate funds to carry on with its excellent work. My hon. Friend the Member for Halifax is right to suggest that the hospice movement can often be a perfect solution, particularly for women with breast cancer, because it offers a much more homely and less clinical atmosphere.</p>

That is partly to do with a diffidence about English and about interacting with authority, but it is often also to do with a sense of stigma. In many ethnic minority communities, there is still a strong sense of stigma about cancer. I remember that when my own mother was dying of stomach cancer she was most insistent that nobody knew, because she felt that there was something shameful about it. In those circumstances, members of ethnic minorities often present late. I think that the Government have done an enormous amount on breast cancer and cancer in general since 1997, but in framing a strategy we should be looking at the very specific needs and issues in ethnic minority communities.</p>

 I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Halifax (Mrs. Riordan) on securing the debate on the national health service for secondary breast cancer patients. I am aware of her interest in breast cancer, and I realise that today&#146;s debate has been prompted by the recent work of Breast Cancer Care&#146;s secondary breast cancer taskforce on metastatic&#151;advanced&#151;breast cancer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o317"><a name="81118-0016.htm_para19"><a name="081118107000028">I was able to attend a meeting with Breast Cancer Care in May, and, in the past couple of weeks, a meeting of the all-party group on breast cancer. We welcome the work by Breast Cancer Care and the secondary breast cancer taskforce to raise the profile of secondary breast cancer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o318"><a name="81118-0016.htm_para20"><a name="081118107000029">We are aware that patients with secondary breast cancer have different needs from those with primary breast cancer. My hon. Friend the Member for Keighley (Mrs. Cryer), who spoke in her usual positive and passionate way, made important points about cultural differences and the work that remains to be done. My hon. Friend the Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew) raised the important issue of the hospice movement, and my hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington (Ms Abbott) mentioned a certain stigma that persists among some older women in the community. I can relate to all those points because, as a nurse for many years, I experienced them with patients and their families. Many of us now represent constituencies that include groups of people who need the confidence and reassurance that the NHS can give women.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o319"><a name="81118-0016.htm_para21"><a name="081118107000030">The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence&#146;s guidance, &#147;Improving Outcomes in Breast Cancer&#148;, recommends how breast cancer services should be organised, and covers recurrent and metastatic breast cancer. It recommends that a patient with breast cancer</p>
<a name="81118-0016.htm_brev0"><a name="081118107000050"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;should receive information relevant to her case about the disease, diagnostic procedures, treatment options and effectiveness&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o320"><a name="81118-0016.htm_para22"><a name="081118107000031">Of course, that includes information on the probability of recurrence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o321"><a name="81118-0016.htm_para23"><a name="081118107000032">Let me explain how the information is given. NICE is currently developing clinical guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of secondary breast cancer, which we  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="18 Nov 2008">

expect to publish in February 2009. At the all-party group meeting, I heard the very different experiences of women in respect of the way in which information is presented to them, and especially the burden that giving information only to the patient, who has to go away and explain it time and again to friends and family, creates. It cannot be acceptable for that burden to fall on the patient alone, especially of an unexpected secondary diagnosis. I emphasise that NICE is currently developing clinical guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of secondary breast cancer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o322"><a name="81118-0016.htm_para24"><a name="081118107000033">Several key priorities that the taskforce identified in its excellent work, and that my hon. Friend the Member for Halifax highlighted today, were raised by stakeholders during the development of our cancer reform strategy, which we published in December 2007. Actions to tackle those issues, which affect all cancer patients, were included in the strategy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o323"><a name="81118-0016.htm_para25"><a name="081118107000034">The first priority that the taskforce identified is the need for a key worker for all secondary breast cancer patients. I cannot stress the importance of that enough. In its November report, the taskforce further recommends,</p>
<a name="81118-0016.htm_brev1"><a name="081118107000051"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;that within every patient&#146;s clinical team, there is a Clinical Nurse Specialist who has the skill and knowledge to manage metastatic breast cancer. This person will act as the patient&#146;s key worker.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o324"><a name="81118-0016.htm_para26"><a name="081118107000035">I would say, key worker, advocate, friend, counsellor and nurse.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o325"><a name="81118-0016.htm_para27"><a name="081118107000036">As my hon. Friend knows, work force planning is a local matter and is the responsibility of NHS organisations, with the support of their strategic health authority.However, the debate enables me to say that a strong message is sent to strategic health authorities, local health communities and primary care trusts at every opportunity to emphasise that we recognise the importance of employing nurse specialists, with that specific skill. We acknowledge the critical role that clinical nurse specialists play in cancer care. That has been confirmed by the importance of the role as part of the multi-disciplinary team, as set out in the NICE series of &#147;improving outcomes&#148; guidance. During the development of the strategy, patients repeatedly told us of the important role that clinical nurse specialists can play in improving the experience of people living with and surviving cancer. At our recent party conference, I was asked to speak at a meeting entitled &#147;Long-term conditions&#148;, but some years ago we would not have expected that to include cancer. We are so pleased that people are living much longer lives with cancer and secondary cancer. Therefore, they deserve to have&#151;and must have&#151;the support that the taskforce has set out.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o326"><a name="81118-0016.htm_para28"><a name="081118107000038">The strategy asked commissioners to give particular attention to that role for clinical nurse specialists. The strategy also recommends that good commissioners will use the peer review data to benchmark their local clinical nurse specialist provision against that of similar PCTs and take action where the clinical nurse specialist work force are found to be insufficient. There will therefore be much more transparency and other PCTs will be able to see how best practice is being portrayed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o327"><a name="81118-0017.htm_para0"><a name="081118107000039">As part of the implementation of the strategy, a small working group has been set up by the national cancer action team to look into the role and contribution of nurses across cancer services. The group will look at the outcomes required across tumour type pathways and  <br>

the competences required to deliver them. The national cancer action team is now funding a survey of clinical nurse specialists.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o328"><a name="81118-0017.htm_para1"><a name="081118107000040">My hon. Friend the Member for Halifax rightly raised the issue of collecting data. Collecting data on the number of those diagnosed and living with secondary breast cancer is the second priority. The national cancer intelligence network, which was launched in June, will build, maintain and quality-assure a new repository of national cancer data. That will help patients to make choices about their treatment, enable hospital teams to identify areas of weakness and encourage commissioners to seek improvements in quality where necessary. We are working hard to help the NCIN collect those data in a timely manner, and its first annual report is scheduled for publication in 2009.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o329"><a name="81118-0017.htm_para2"><a name="081118107000041">The need for high quality patient information is another priority. Ensuring that all patients have access to high quality information and support is a key part of the pledge that we made to cancer patients in the strategy. The strategy sets out a number of initiatives to improve patient support services for those living with and, of course, beyond cancer. Those initiatives include: ensuring that patients receive high quality personalised information throughout their&#151;as it is described in the strategy&#151;cancer journey on issues such as cancer treatment, local and national support services, and, importantly, financial benefits; working with cancer professionals in the NHS to improve their communication skills when dealing with patients; the establishment of a new national cancer survivorship initiative; and monitoring progress on improving patient experience through annual surveys, which will include the views of secondary breast cancer patients.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o330"><a name="81118-0017.htm_para3"><a name="081118107000042">I have listened to many of the women involved and, along with my hon. Friend, pay tribute to their courage and commitment. Even when they have not felt well enough to attend, they have bravely done so. We have made good progress on the national initiatives to improve information delivery and communication skills training since the publication of the strategy. That is so important. We all think that we are getting it right, but then we listen to the patient experience and discover that some things are still lacking. Therefore, the commitment to professional development and training is of the utmost importance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o331"><a name="81118-0017.htm_para4"><a name="081118107000043">The national cancer action team is working closely with cancer networks and charities to roll out national information pathways, and this is being linked to pilot work on information prescriptions. I take note of what my hon. Friends have said this evening&#151;particularly about the culture and how the older woman is affected&#151;and can now see that it is fed into the information pathway. National patient information pathways for bowel, lung, prostate and breast cancers were launched in July. They are nationally agreed sources of information that will be available for clinicians and clinical nurse specialists to give to patients at each stage of their cancer journey, including information for women with secondary breast cancer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o332"><a name="81118-0017.htm_para5"><a name="081118107000044">Improved access to psychological services for all secondary breast cancer patients and their families is the fourth priority. Once again, we recognise that that can be as important as any other aspect of treatment, and we have stated that commissioners will need to ensure that adequate provision is available so that all  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="18 Nov 2008">

<notus-date day="18" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><b>18 Nov 2008 : Column 215</b><br>
patients, and their families, friends and carers, can access the appropriate psychological support that they need. When a person is informed of a second diagnosis, they require different support. All the clinical people involved in the care of patients with a secondary diagnosis are aware that, sometimes, that support is not adequate. Everyone is trying to ensure that the psychological support is available, not only for the patient, but for family members.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o333"><a name="81118-0017.htm_para6"><a name="081118107000045">Improved management of secondary breast cancer patient care is the fifth priority. I can confirm that the management of active cancer has been identified as a workstream to be taken forward as part of the new national cancer survivor initiative.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o334"><a name="81118-0017.htm_para7"><a name="081118107000046">Cancer services remain a high priority for this Government, and my hon. Friends have praised the work that our clinicians and NHS staff have done. We have seen changes and significant improvements in cancer services in the past 10 years, especially since the publication of the NHS cancer plan in 2000. Our achievements include: extending breast screening to women aged up to 70; the roll-out of the bowel cancer screening programme; a reduction in waiting times for patients with suspected cancer; more cancer specialists&#151;that is absolutely critical to the strategy, and there are more than 1,655 extra  <br>

consultants in this area since 1997; and cancer mortality in under-75s fell by more than 18 per cent. between 1996 and 2006. We are on course to meet our target of a reduction of at least 20 per cent. in cancer deaths in under-75s by 2010. The public health and awareness agenda that all of us must take account of will make a significant difference to that figure.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o335"><a name="81118-0017.htm_para8"><a name="081118107000047">That does not mean that we are complacent. We face significant challenges when dealing with cancer services for people with secondary cancer. We have opportunities to deliver further improvements through the strategy, which was developed with the help of more than 1,000 groups and individuals. It is very much an inclusive and involved strategy, which I believe was welcomed by all the cancer charities and patients who are not associated with them. We value the work of Breast Cancer Care and all other cancer charities, and look forward to continuing to work with them through the various strategy initiatives to improve the experience of all cancer patients, including, of course, those with secondary breast cancer. We owe that to those women and their families, and the NHS wants to deliver it.</p>
