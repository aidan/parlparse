 I thank my hon. Friend for his reply. I am sure that he will want to join me in congratulating the South Bank centre and the Royal Festival hall on their magnificent reopening overture weekend, which really brought in the community. Events included every primary school child in Lambeth singing gospel, gospel choirs from all over the south-east singing with the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment, and an outdoor ballroom dance, in which I participated with my young son. Does my hon. Friend share my disappointment, however, and that of the chief executive, Michael Lynch, that, in a city in which more than 4,000 people received bonuses of more than &#163;1 million last year, it has been so hard for the centre to fund-raise for the refurbishment from the City boys and girls?</p>

 I join my hon. Friend in congratulating the South Bank centre on the most fantastic of openings. It was really inclusive to the wider London community and resulted in record numbers of people participating, including many who had never visited the centre before. She raises a serious question, however, and she is right to suggest that, at its heart, our arts ecology is based not only on public subsidy and the self-revenue that many of our institutions raise themselves, but on private and commercial giving. There is new money in the City, and all those in the arts community, working particularly with Arts &amp; Business and similar organisations, want to find ways of tapping the money that has come into the City in the past few years.</p>

Obviously, over the next few years, we will expect to see proposals coming forward from different parts of the regions. We have also said that there will be an international Shakespeare festival and an exhibition for which all our museums will join up. We have also said that there will be a legacy trust to provide up to &#163;40 million of funding for events over the period. We also want to see private investment coming in.</p>

 Notwithstanding the &#163;40 million legacy trust, which is welcome, the organising committee is clearly saying in its document that there will be only start-up and limited funds for the second and third tier events, and that it expects existing arts bodies to fund those events. However, the Arts Council is facing a cut of &#163;112 million over the next few years, and Grants for the Arts is also being cut. I find it difficult to understand how these two proposals sit together; perhaps the Minister will explain that to me.</p>

 The cut in funding is from 2009. My hon. Friend should also remember that most arts organisations are receiving funds from the core grant, which has gone up 75 per cent. over the last period. We should be proud of that. I am sure that he would agree, given that his constituency is in the east end of London, that it is absolutely right that the young people in one of the poorest areas of London should benefit from lottery money in this way. We all have to play our part in ensuring that the Olympics are a success.</p>

 May I help the Minister to answer the question from the hon. Member for Walthamstow (Mr. Gerrard)? He has referred to the &#163;40 million legacy trust, which is welcome, but will he acknowledge that the figures from his own Department illustrate that the cut to the budgets of those lottery projects responsible for culture, the arts and heritage amount to more than &#163;470 million up to 2012?</p>

 That is an example of the Liberal Democrats not being able to add up. Let me take the hon. Gentleman through this. In the first tier, the money for the opening and closing ceremony will come from the London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games budget, which is now &#163;2 billion. We have also announced the legacy trust. We hope to see private and commercial investment, so I am pleased that Lloyds TSB has announced that it wants to sponsor the &#147;live sites&#148;, and that Youth Music has announced a &#163;9 million investment in a music extravaganza involving young people. That is notwithstanding core funding. The hon. Gentleman knows that, and he ought not to persist with making up numbers as he goes along.</p>

Friend is adding his voice to the concern expressed, with some reason, because we must make sure that the premier league does not turn into a billionaire&#146;s playground. The grass-roots communities from which those clubs came must be respected. I hope that it is not just lip service that is paid to the fans&#146; organisations, to which he refers, but that clubs consider their views when making decisions.</p>

 I am meeting the Football Association, the Football League and the premier league later this week to discuss ownership and some concerns, which the right hon. Gentleman rightly raises. There is a meeting in the Treasury tomorrow with a number of my hon. Friends and Treasury officials to consider share ownership and how certain actions have been taken. I do not want to comment on any individual action or club, but I do want to respond by saying that many share his concern and we are giving that issue serious consideration.</p>

 Will my right hon. Friend join me in condemning football clubs that are charging above-inflation increases for tickets?

 Again, I have a lot of sympathy with the question. Football trusts are developing up and down the land. However, it is important that club owners take ticket pricing into consideration. Because of the fairly hefty increase in television fees, in particular in the premier division, I have appealed to football clubs in England to consider their fans by at least freezing, if not reducing, some ticket prices. Some clubs have done that, especially in the north-west.</p>

 I do not think so. Let us keep things in proportion. As I said, we are running the most professional league in the world. There are 40,000 football clubs in England. It is by far the largest participation sport. It is governed by the Football Association, which has brought new governance into play. The conduct of clubs is being scrutinised more closely than ever. In July, the European Union will produce a White Paper on sport, which will address some of the issues at a European level, where they have to be considered if action is to be taken to curtail some of those excesses that have emerged in the game.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right: we have said in two election manifestos that we will sell the Tote into racing. It is not the Treasury that has been the major problem, but Europe. <i> [Interruption.] </i>Perhaps the hon. Gentleman will listen. We were trying to sell the Tote at a fair price, but we were told very clearly that it had to be sold at a market price. We had a lot of wrangling with the European Commission and its competition directorate-general, but eventually we got an agreement and a market price. We had been in discussions with a consortium, but the consortium could not come up with the money in the first round. The Tote&#146;s staff and management got involved, and I believe that in the coming period we will come before the House and say how we intend to proceed. It has been a long, drawn-out process, but I can say to the hon. Gentleman that we will put the Tote into racing; we will secure the 600 jobs in the north-west, and about 2,000 jobs around the country; and we will make sure that the Tote&#146;s product is there for the punters, who believe that they have a safe bet with the Tote.</p>

 I give that assurance. One of the things that has been at the centre of these discussions is to ensure that in bringing the Tote into the marketplace owned by racing we secure the 600 jobs in Wigan. Those staff are absolutely first class, and I know that when the sale goes through the management have plans considerably to expand the influence of the Tote in the United Kingdom and internationally.

The commission examined the NAO estimate for 2007-08 earlier this year. It approved a budget of just under &#163;92 million for audit and other assurance services. The NAO estimated that some &#163;55 million would be needed for staff, &#163;21 million for outsourced services, and the balance for supporting services such as IT and travel. Just under 25 per cent. of the NAO budget, therefore, is expected to buy in external expertise.</p>

 With permission, Mr. Speaker, I shall make a statement about the outcome of the European Council in Brussels on 21 and 22 June.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o11"><a name="70625-0003.htm_para4"><a name="07062511000173">I congratulate the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, on concluding successfully an exceptionally difficult negotiation and on an outstanding presidency of the European Union.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o12"><a name="70625-0003.htm_para5"><a name="07062511000174">Before the European Council, I made it clear that the concept of a constitutional treaty for Europe had to be abandoned and that we should agree instead a conventional amending treaty like the Nice, Amsterdam and Maastricht treaties and the Single European Act. I also made it clear that the UK had four central demands which had to be met. First, on the charter of fundamental rights, we secured a legally binding protocol, specific to the UK, and applicable both to the British courts and to the European Court of Justice. Let me read the terms. The protocol states that</p>
<a name="70625-0003.htm_brev2"><a name="07062511000330"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;the Charter does not extend the ability of the Court of Justice, or any court or tribunal of the United Kingdom, to find that the laws, regulations or administrative provisions, practices or action of the United Kingdom are inconsistent with the fundamental rights, freedoms and principles that&#148;</p>

</ul><a name="70625-0003.htm_brev4"><a name="07062511000332"><ul><p class="tabletext">In particular, and for the avoidance of doubt, nothing in the Charter creates justiciable rights applicable to the United Kingdom except in so far as the United Kingdom has provided for such rights in its national law.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o14"><a name="70625-0003.htm_para7"><a name="07062511000176">In respect of our criminal law system and police and judicial processes, we obtained an extension of the opt-in rights that we secured in an earlier treaty on migration, asylum and immigration issues. This means that we have the sovereign right to opt in on individual measures, where we consider it would be in the British interest to do so, but also to stay out, if we want to. It is precisely the pick and choose policy often advocated. It gives us complete freedom to protect our common law system, but it also allows us to participate in areas where co-operation advances British interests. In asylum and immigration, for example, we have opted in on measures dealing with illegal immigration, and in measures allowing us to return asylum seekers to other European countries&#151;both unquestionably in Britain&#146;s interests. But it will be within our exclusive power to decide on a case-by-case basis, which is exactly what we wanted.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o15"><a name="70625-0003.htm_para8"><a name="07062511000177">In respect of social security, we negotiated a provision which allows us to insist on unanimity in any case where we&#151;that is, Britain&#151;declare that any proposal from the Commission would affect important aspects of our social security system, including its scope, cost, or financial structure or balance. Our social security and benefits system is therefore completely protected.</p>

The essential features of the CFSP remain as they were. Unanimity voting is the rule. There is no sole right of initiative for the Commission. There is no role for the European Parliament in decision taking. There  <br>

is no jurisdiction for the European Court of Justice, except in the particular case of safeguarding the rights of individuals subject to EU sanctions. The two jobs of Commissioner for External Relations and High Representative which, of course, exist already, will be amalgamated in a single job. But this reform does not extend the EU&#146;s substantive powers to act in foreign policy. In particular, the Union Representative, when working on common foreign and security policy issues, will operate within a policy framework set by the European Union Foreign Ministers, by unanimity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o17"><a name="70625-0004.htm_para1"><a name="07062511000179">All these guarantees not merely remain in the new treaty, but are reinforced in a new overview article that reaffirms them and has full legal force. For the avoidance of doubt, we also obtained a declaration that sets out the unanimous view of all member states about the meaning of those guarantees. That declaration, which then informs the detailed negotiation of the intergovernmental conference, states that the common and foreign security policies of the treaty, including in respect of the office of Union Representative and the external action service,</p>
<a name="70625-0004.htm_brev0"><a name="07062511000333"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;will not affect the existing legal basis, responsibilities, and powers of each Member State in relation to the formulation and conduct of its foreign policy, its national diplomatic service, relations with third countries, and participation in international organisations, including a Member State&#146;s membership of the Security Council of the UN.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o18"><a name="70625-0004.htm_para2"><a name="07062511000180">There was also a discussion at the Council about competition. The treaties have always made it clear that competition in the internal market should not be distorted. The now defunct constitutional treaty&#146;s objectives would have included new wording about &#147;free and undistorted competition&#148;. When the treaty was set aside, that provision was lost, but we agreed on a new and legally binding protocol to be annexed to the treaties, which reaffirms the commitment to ensuring that competition is not distorted, and the other references to competition in the existing treaties will remain: for example, articles 4, 27, 34, 81 to 89, 96, 98, 105 and 157 from the European Community treaty. The legal position in relation to competition therefore remains unchanged.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o19"><a name="70625-0004.htm_para3"><a name="07062511000181">Alongside meeting our four essential requirements, we secured a number of further improvements. The new treaty will confirm for the first time, explicitly, that national security is the sole responsibility of member states. The Union already signs international agreements, but the treaty formalises its legal personality. However, we have now agreed a declaration by all countries for this intergovernmental conference confirming that the fact of this legal personality does not authorise the Union in any way to legislate or act beyond the powers conferred on it by member states in the treaties. There are also new powers for national Parliaments to object to Commission proposals on subsidiarity grounds.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o20"><a name="70625-0004.htm_para4"><a name="07062511000182">There are a number of extensions of qualified majority voting. In the most sensitive areas of QMV&#151;justice and home affairs, and social security&#151;we obtained the right either not to participate or to insist on unanimity. In addition, a number of other QMV measures&#151;for example, those about rules within the eurozone, or those in justice and home affairs&#151;do not apply to us. As for the rest, we have agreed them, because qualified majority voting is often in Britain&#146;s interest. The biggest move to qualified majority voting in Europe&#146;s history  <br>

was the Single European Act, but this allowed the creation of one of Europe&#146;s greatest achievements: the single European market. More recently, we have secured reforms such as the services directive and other liberalising measures through QMV, including the lifting of the beef ban, when they would almost certainly have been blocked through unanimity. Among the QMV provisions in the treaty is one that provides a new legal base and QMV for energy market liberalisation, and another that provides QMV for decisions on emergency humanitarian aid to third countries&#151;both of them manifestly in the UK&#146;s national interest.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o21"><a name="70625-0004.htm_para5"><a name="07062511000183">The other main reform is the fixed term, two-and-a-half-year presidency of the European Council, replacing the current rotating six-monthly arrangements. This is necessary for the Union&#146;s efficiency, but does not involve any extension of presidency powers. The President of the European Council will remain the servant of the leaders of the member states.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o22"><a name="70625-0004.htm_para6"><a name="07062511000184">The most important aspect of the new treaty is that it allows the European Union to move on to the issues that really matter. For too many years, we have been bogged down in a debate about institutions. With the increase from 15 to 27 member states, change is essential, but with this agreement, we can now concentrate on issues that really matter: energy security, organised crime and terrorism, globalisation, further enlargement and making Europe&#146;s voice more effective internationally.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o23"><a name="70625-0004.htm_para7"><a name="07062511000185">This agenda is surely quintessentially one in Britain&#146;s interests. Over the past 10 years, Britain has moved from the margins of European debate to the centre. This is absolutely right for Britain. Whether in defence or economic reform or in energy policy or the environment, or of course most particularly in enlargement and the appointment of the new Commission President, Britain has for a decade been in a leadership position in Europe. That is exactly where we should stay. I commend this agreement to the House.</p>

Prime Minister confirm that power is being transferred in 60 areas as the veto is abolished? Far from their all being minor areas, they include energy, transport, employment law and the new EU diplomatic service. The new treaty even gives up some powers which members of his own Government have warned against. Two weeks ago, the Foreign Secretary said that putting criminal justice under the control of the European Court would be a &#147;major change&#148; and a &#147;matter of some controversy&#148;.

 The detail of what was agreed obviously has to be negotiated at the intergovernmental conference, but the key elements have been agreed. In relation to the language in the constitutional treaty about free and undistorted competition, it was somewhat bizarre to meet people who said that they wanted the whole constitutional treaty to be scrapped, but that we should have preserved these particular words. I am afraid that, once vetoes went down from us in a whole series of areas, vetoes went down for others, but that is exactly why we had the legal protocol.

and others to get an agreement is important. I did not pick up this point when the leader of the Conservative party was speaking, but he wrote an article the other day about what Europe should concentrate on, and that it should not be navel gazing. In a sense, that is absolutely right. The important thing, however, is that it did need to change its rules. The move from 15 to 27 countries, particularly when the majority of the new countries are very small, requires us to change our rules to make them effective. Now that the key elements have been agreed, we can put the matter to one side and get on with the more important issues that really affect citizens in Europe.</p>

Does he realise that he has adopted one of the recommendations of the Conservative party&#146;s democracy taskforce in rescuing from the wreckage of the Giscardian constitution the enhanced role for national Parliaments in future legislation? Now that we can put a line under institutional debate and get on with the real business of the Union, however, does he agree that, in addition to the subjects that my right hon. Friend the Leader of the Opposition and he mentioned, we need to develop on an inter- governmental basis some foreign and security policy that will enable Europe to take a collective line on the problems of the middle east, relations with Russia and our role in the Atlantic alliance, and that we are now clear that we can go ahead with our own sovereign right to participate quite untarnished?</p>

 I agree entirely with what the right hon. and learned Gentleman says about the efficiency of the European Union and the need for the rules to change. It is important that people understand that the expansion to 27 countries is not just a question of another 12 countries being there. Because some of those countries&#151;no disrespect to them&#151;happen to be small, carrying the burden of a full-time presidency will be difficult for them. The national Parliaments point is absolutely right. I had not realised that it was a Conservative party taskforce recommendation; despite that, I am still in favour of it. His last point is important, because even though I am a very strong supporter of the American alliance, I also believe that it is important that Europe has a common foreign and security policy&#151;<i> [Interruption.] </i>Well, I do believe that. I remind Conservative Members that those words were first used in the Single European Act and the Maastricht treaty. They were negotiated originally by Margaret Thatcher, and quite right too. That should not be against the American alliance, but in relation to Iran, Kosovo or how we make progress in the middle east, for example, it should allow us to have a European position. That is sensible and in the interests of this country.</p>

 My hon. Friend is absolutely right. Incidentally, at the time that I concluded the St. Malo defence agreement in 1998, Conservative Members in particular said that it would effectively abolish our right to act independently, that, in particular, we would not be able to go into military alliance with America, and that we would end up with a European army superseding the UK Army. All those points have turned out to be nonsense. Europe does some very worthwhile missions in different parts of the world, and co-operating in European defence is entirely sensible. The European Union should definitely work together on climate change. If Europe makes its voice heard on climate change in a collective way, there is no doubt that it will be far stronger than any individual country, including Britain.</p>

 Absolutely not. It is not merely the political declaration, which of course is binding on the IGC political negotiation, but it is also what I described as the overview article. I suggest that the right hon. Gentleman sit down and read it, because he will see that there is no question whatever of any country wanting to give up its independent foreign policy. A country like France&#151;quite apart from ourselves&#151;is not going to sign away its right to act independently. However, there are areas where it is important that we co-operate. For example, we are surely stronger as Britain, Germany and France negotiating together in respect of Iran, representing a common European position, than we are individually and on our own. That is why it is sensible for us to do that in certain areas, but nothing obliges us to give up any foreign policy rights or interfere with our own diplomatic service in any way whatever.

We did not on the Single European Act; we did not on Maastricht; we did not on Amsterdam; we did not on Nice. We accepted that the constitutional treaty was in a different bracket precisely because it purported to be a constitution that governed all the various items in Europe. As a result of the changes that we have made, it is impossible to say that. This treaty transfers less power than any of the four previous treaties in the past 20 years.

The Prime Minister&#146;s Foreign Secretary and Minister for Europe now argue that one of the main reasons why we should not have a referendum is that we are a parliamentary democracy&#151;yet the document to which the Prime Minister signed up at the weekend grants the people of Europe a right that neither national Parliaments nor Governments have, which is to petition the Commission for legislative proposals.

For example, Russia is trying to divide us on energy policy, Iran is taking advantages of divisions in approach and even America, with the &#147;coalition of the willing&#148;, attempted to divide the European Union.

 Britain has been trying for many years to get a level playing field in energy policy, so that British people can own French energy companies, just as French people can own British energy companies, and so that we can keep fuel prices low in this country. Is it not vital for us to have qualified majority voting on energy policy, so that we can deal better with our country, and so that we can ensure a more united front when dealing with Russia?</p>

 My hon. Friend is absolutely right, and it is one of the reasons why the deal that we have concluded is a good one for this country.

We know perfectly well that there may be countries that will always block energy market liberalisation, and that is why it is absurd to say that any QMV is bad for Britain.

<p><a name="stpa_o60"><a name="70625-0007.htm_para0"><a name="07062511000302">New clause 5 introduces a targeted anti-avoidance rule that tackles the use of tax avoidance schemes designed to generate deductions in respect of &#147;expenses of management&#148; under section 75 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988. If left unchecked, those schemes would cost the UK Exchequer&#151;the public   <br>

purse&#151;&#163;1 billion a year. Section 75 of the 1988 Act provides &#147;companies with investment business&#148; relief for the expenses of managing that investment business. The rules were introduced way back in 1915 and originally applied only to pure investment companies and to insurance companies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o61"><a name="70625-0007.htm_para1"><a name="07062511000303">The rules remained largely unchanged until the Finance Act 2004. The changes that we made three years ago widened the range of companies able to obtain relief for expenses of management. They also specifically excluded capital expenditure and introduced an unallowable purpose rule in relation to investments not held for a business or commercial purpose. The unallowable purpose rule made no explicit reference to tax avoidance purposes. It was believed at the time that that rule and a tough approach to the construction of the phrase &#147;expenses of management&#148; derived from case law would be sufficient to stop any abuse. Sadly, the appetite of some for tax avoidance has proved us wrong. In the past two or three years, the disclosure of tax avoidance schemes rules and other inquiries have shown us that there are already a number of avoidance schemes that create deductions for relief as expenses of management which are both substantial and contrived.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o62"><a name="70625-0007.htm_para2"><a name="07062511000304">The latest scheme is an attempt to circumvent other anti-avoidance legislation introduced in the Finance Act 2004. It creates a wholly artificial deduction for management expenses in return for the receipt of a dividend to which the UK company was already entitled before the scheme was put in place. These payments&#151;treated by the companies as management expenses&#151;are made to overseas companies, which are usually located in tax havens and therefore usually outside the UK tax net. The group of companies as a whole suffers no economic loss as the money is effectively flowing in a circular fashion&#151;the loss is actually borne by the UK Exchequer. That happens when the holding company gets relief for the artificially manufactured management expenses. That sort of scheme is relatively easy to implement and we calculate that&#151;if effective&#151;it has already put at risk more than &#163;240 million to the public purse. Without urgent action, many more groups of companies are likely to adopt the scheme.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o63"><a name="70625-0007.htm_para3"><a name="07062511000305">Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs does not accept that the schemes are in accordance with existing legislation. Given the potential cost to the Exchequer and the uncertain outcome of litigation, we are taking action now, to put the issue beyond doubt. The new clause confirms that assets held for a tax avoidance purpose are not held for a business or commercial purpose of the company, and ensures that the scope of the provisions is as wide as possible. We believe that the changes deal with the known schemes and also go appropriately wider, countering any other schemes that might try to secure relief of contrived management expenses.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o64"><a name="70625-0007.htm_para4"><a name="07062511000306">The sheer size of the potential cost requires immediate action. I therefore regret that, in those circumstances, it has not been possible to consult on the new clause. However, the measure will not affect compliant companies. It affects only those that are involved in tax avoidance. The new clause tackles artificial schemes and will not therefore affect commercial transactions. I commend it to the House.</p>

 I thank the Financial Secretary for his explanation of the circumstances that lie behind the new clause. It elaborates on the letter that he sent to my hon. Friend the Member for Chipping Barnet (Mrs. Villiers) and other members of the Committee last week. In the letter, the Financial Secretary said that the estimated cost approached &#163;1 billion, but in his remarks he said that it was &#163;240 million. I appreciate that the Treasury likes to round things up from time to time, but that appeared to be a large rounding up. Will he be a little clearer about the basis of both the figure in his letter and the cost that he cited in his speech?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o65"><a name="70625-0007.htm_para5"><a name="07062511000308">My broader concern is that the new clause is drafted widely, as the Financial Secretary acknowledged. We held several debates in Committee about the breadth of anti-avoidance legislation. We had a long debate about the way in which broadly framed legislation was subsequently narrowed through guidance. I was therefore disappointed, given the circumstances that gave rise to the new clause, that the provision was not more tightly drawn to attack the specific abuses that he highlighted of group companies, the use of dividends and so on as a means of generating management expenses. I wonder why he feels the need to phrase the new clause so widely. Are not we in danger of creating uncertainty among taxpayers and their advisers through the breadth of the provision? Cannot we have a more specific provision to tackle the abuse that he mentioned?</p>

creeping retrospection from polluting the Government&#146;s finance legislation. I intend to speak to it, as well as to the amendments tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Christchurch (Mr. Chope) and others, and to his new clause 7.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o78"><a name="70625-0007.htm_para18"><a name="07062518000010">New clause 2 arises directly from the debate in the Committee of the whole House about air passenger duty in relation to clause 12. I do not intend to repeat the debate that we had on 1 May, but as the new clause deals with retrospection and as retrospection was present in clause 12, I must necessarily set the context that gives rise to the amendment. The definitive statement on retrospection in relation to clause 12 was made by the Treasury Committee as follows:</p>
<a name="70625-0007.htm_brev0"><a name="07062518000598"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The first element of retrospection is that airlines will be liable to pay the tax for departures on or after 1 February 2007 regardless of whether tickets were purchased before the new rules were announced. The second element of retrospection is that the liability to pay air passenger duty at the new higher rates will effectively be incurred before the House of Commons has authorised the increase; such authorisation will take place only after the Budget.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o79"><a name="70625-0007.htm_para19"><a name="07062518000011">It is worth noting that two separate though related ideas of retrospection are described by the Select Committee in that context. It concluded:</p>
<a name="70625-0007.htm_brev1"><a name="07062518000599"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;As a general rule we consider that, where increases in rates of duties or taxes are proposed in the pre-Budget report, those increases should not come into force until after the House of Commons has had an opportunity to come to a formal decision on the proposed increase following the Budget. We draw the attention of the House of Commons to the unusual timing of the implementation of the increases in air passenger duty, for which the Treasury has not cited any relevant precedents.&#148;</p>

However, the House of Commons Library said that</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o82"><a name="70625-0008.htm_para1"><a name="07062518000014">During that debate and in a previous letter to the shadow Chief Secretary the Financial Secretary set out a series of further claimed precedents&#151;the 2002 Budget decisions in relation to income tax rates, and another similar change made to the taxation of North sea oil, the petroleum revenue changes made in 1978 and confirmed in 1979. He was unable to explain why all these claimed precedents were not originally given to the Select Committee. He was also unable to explain why they were being dribbled out in this gradual way, rather than being offered all at once in a coherent whole.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o83"><a name="70625-0008.htm_para2"><a name="07062518000015">I suspect that the explanation is that the Treasury has been forced to scrape the bottom of the barrel for these precedents, and my suspicion is given at least some backing by the Library, which is no more impressed by the new set of precedents than it was by the old ones. Having been consulted, it repeats:</p>
<a name="70625-0008.htm_brev1"><a name="07062518000601"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;It remains the case that none of these examples provide a precedent that appears to capture all the aspects of the rise in APD rates&#148;.</p>

If the Government are prepared to legislate retrospectively and unprecedentedly once, and in doing so, drawing a rebuke from the Select Committee, what is to prevent them from using this unprecedented APD rise as a further precedent in the future? It is in order to prevent them from doing so again that we have tabled the new clause. In the Committee of the whole House, I said:</p>

In drawing it up, we have attempted to find a basis for legislating in relation to retrospection that will command a consensus in the House. Let me make it clear that we are not against retrospective taxation per se on all occasions. It is reasonable to tax retrospectively in order to tackle a new tax avoidance scheme that threatens a significant loss of tax revenue, for example, or to restore the law in relation to some particular aspect of taxation to what it was believed to be until a court decided otherwise.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o88"><a name="70625-0008.htm_para7"><a name="07062518000020">That view was set out by my right hon. Friend the Member for Charnwood (Mr. Dorrell) as a Minister in the last Conservative Government. He said:</p>

In 2004, the Paymaster General made a statement of the Government&#146;s view that is broadly similar to what I shall name, after my right hon. Friend the Member for Charnwood, the Dorrell doctrine. At present, the Government are entitled to collect new taxes prior to receiving full legislative authority from the passage of a Finance Act under the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act 1968. The trigger, so to speak, for the retrospective APD rise&#151;the cause of this debate&#151;was the passing of the Budget resolutions announced on Budget day.</p>

Finance Bill before us, would be obliged by law to state that such retrospective taxation was, in effect, consistent with the Dorrell doctrine set out under the previous Conservative Government and echoed in the Paymaster General&#146;s 2004 statement. If the new clause were on the statute book now, the Financial Secretary would have been compelled during the debate on 1 May to concede that the retrospective elements of the APD rise contained in this year&#146;s Finance Bill were utterly inconsistent with the Dorrell doctrine and bad practice, since even the Government have not attempted to claim that the APD rise was necessary to prevent tax avoidance by passengers or airlines or to restore the law to what it was previously believed to be. I believe that the Financial Secretary would not have endured the embarrassment and difficulty of so doing, and that the new clause is a strong deterrent to bad retrospective legislation.</p>

Friend the Member for Christchurch and his new clause 7 seek to remove all possible doubt. His amendments would bar Ministers from proceeding with retrospective tax rises that they declare inconsistent with the Dorrell doctrine. As my hon. Friend knows, we considered tabling a new clause identical to new clause 7 that would have had the same broad effect as his amendments. We decided not to do so for a single reason: the Financial Secretary should have the opportunity this afternoon, we hope in the course of accepting the new clause, to persuade the House that there are some categories of retrospective legislation that are incompatible with the Dorrell doctrine, but that it would none the less be right for the House to be able to consider in the future. My hon. Friend&#146;s amendments and new clause would have the effect of barring the House from considering any such retrospective legislation in future. However, I have to say to him and to the House that I very much doubt whether such categories exist and whether the Minister can make such a case. As I have said, that is why we are sympathetic towards amendments (a) and (c) and new clause 7. If new clause 2 is passed, we will accept amendments (a) and (c), unless the Financial Secretary can persuade us otherwise. If, having accepted amendments (a) and (c), new clause 2 is none the less unsuccessful when put to a vote, I will advise my right hon. and hon. Friends to vote for new clause 7.</p>

New clause 2(1)(b) would permit a Minister to introduce a retrospective tax measure as good practice that would either close a significant new tax-avoidance loophole or restore the law to what it was previously believed to be. New clause 7 maintains that either/or principle. However, amendment (b) takes a different view. Taken with the other amendments, it would permit a Minister to introduce a retrospective tax measure only if it both closed a significant new tax-avoidance loophole and restored the law to what it was previously believed to be. In other words, a Minister would not be able to introduce a retrospective tax measure to close a significant new tax loophole unless they were also restoring the law to what it was previously believed to be and vice versa. According to the Library, the last Conservative Government legislated retrospectively to restore the law to what it  <br>

It is important to have openness and honesty about retrospective taxation and, in fact, any changes in the tax system. I was reassured by the comment of the hon.

Member for Bishop Auckland (Helen Goodman) remembers that both this year and last year the Finance Bill included some retrospective taxes, which it was necessary to introduce without consultation because of significant abuses of the taxation system and loopholes that needed to be closed. On that basis, such measures are entirely necessary. However, there are examples&#151;air passenger duty is not the only one&#151;where it is not clear whether a loophole needed to be closed or that avoidance was taking place. On air passenger duty, people who paid for their tickets before the changes were introduced found out that there was an additional charge only when they arrived to catch their flights.

The first concerns the agricultural buildings allowance, which was dealt with in this year&#146;s Finance Bill, changes to which will have an impact on investment decisions that were made anything up to 24 years previously. In theory that affects only taxation going forward, but it will have an effect on decisions that people made many years previously with regard to buildings that it is not easy to dispose of if the tax liability represents a significant problem to the businesses involved.

 I thank my hon. Friend the Member for Wycombe (Mr. Goodman) for his open and transparent discussion of these issues with me over many weeks. When I first raised the matter in the Budget debate I found myself in a minority of Conservative Members voting against air passenger duty. However, I overheard one of my colleagues saying, &#147;Since when has it been Conservative party policy not to vote against retrospective legislation?&#148; That voice, which seemed at one stage to be unheeded, has now been heeded, and I am grateful to my hon.

If the Minister can come up with some categories that are not consistent with the Dorrell doctrine beyond those set out in subsection (7) (i) and (ii), he will be able to use that argument against supporting my new clause, but if he does not do so, the way will be open for the House to support new clause 7.</p>

However, I take my hon. Friend&#146;s point that by removing the word &#147;of&#148; as well from line three, that would have the effect of suggesting that both the relevant principles would have to be satisfied rather than just one.</p>

 Does the hon. Gentleman agree that it is particularly unfortunate that this whole problem has flared up over a green tax?

 I accept that the Government made that admission. It was a candid admission, and my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke) made the same admission when he first introduced air passenger duty. He said, &#147;We&#146;re short of money in the Exchequer. We need to find some new taxes.&#148; The Government of whom he was Chancellor of the Exchequer were famed for introducing new taxes. In the end, that resulted in the problems that our party encountered when it had to face the people in the 1997 general election. That is part of history, but my right hon. and learned Friend was certainly candid about air passenger duty being a revenue-raising tax, and I believe that the Financial Secretary has accepted as much. It has been suggested that it is not a revenue-raising tax but a tax designed to alter behaviour, but how can we alter behaviour when that behaviour has already occurred? It is nonsense to make a green tax retrospective, because the behaviour has already occurred. Unless people withdrew their decision to take a holiday with their children or to embark on a flight for some other reason, the retrospective element of the environmental tax would mean that it had no impact whatever.</p>

My many law-abiding constituents with business interests or savings activities know that they should make an honest declaration of what they are earning or of their savings in the required form, and they accept that they should pay tax. They also believe that they have every right to make intelligent use of fiscal incentives from tax breaks, and some of those offered by the Government in previous Finance Acts have been very attractive, such as the decision to allow more favourable tax status to small business incorporation. Having made intelligent use of those things, they fear that the Government will come down on them like a ton of bricks, saying, &#147;We didn&#146;t really mean it.

A series of radio advertisements are currently running on various channels about National Savings and Investments. The whole point of the adverts is that people can be protected from the rather high rate of inflation now prevailing under this Government, and from their tax demands, by buying index-linked National Savings bonds, which, miraculously, are protected from both the ravages of inflation and the depredations of the taxman. That is a perfectly good selling point. I am not here to advertise those bonds today, but it shows that the Government recognise the importance of fiscal incentive in selling savings products and are happy to use it. Having taken advantage of some other fiscal incentive, my constituents therefore feel that it is unfair of the Government to turn round, decide that it is a loophole that is allowing too much revenue to be lost, and try to change things retrospectively.</p>

In support of my hon.

Law-abiding decent people who run small businesses or who try to put together their savings for retirement do not have that option. Only one case may matter to them, and they will probably lose it. There is the feeling that the Revenue is out to grab as much money as it can from any law-abiding person who advises it that he has a bit of money, rather than the Revenue sensibly following the rules laid down by Ministers and not going in for retrospective changes.</p>

 I support new clause 2 because the principle that it espouses of not having retrospective taxation is important for the confidence of investors, consumers and taxpayers, so that they know where they stand when making decisions. The whole point of taxation, especially taxation that is tinged with the idea of green taxation, is that it must be trusted by people if it is going to affect behaviour and influence their decisions. When it comes to investment, people must have the confidence that they understand the fiscal climate in which they are making those decisions. There is enough uncertainty in the business and trading worlds in trying to guess markets. To have the Government throwing in more uncertainty is clearly damaging to long-term decision making and to the wealth of the economy.

Nor do the precedents allay any of the real concerns felt by the general public that they may be taxed retrospectively for things that they did that were legal at the time or, in terms of savings and investments, things that were not deemed to be avoidance schemes at the time at which they invested in them, but are now thus deemed because of misuse by others.</p>

Were such a detailed exposition to be presented for a specific problem that required to be taxed retrospectively, I suspect that it would allay the genuine concerns of the public and explain why the Government were seeking to make the proposed changes.

Those precedents match precisely what has happened with that duty: in each case, measures were introduced that had an effect on duty tax points before they were considered by Parliament&#151;but after the Government had made a clear announcement to Parliament of their intention to introduce them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o124"><a name="70625-0009.htm_para16"><a name="07062518000076">I am glad that the hon. Member for Wycombe said that he was not against retrospection per se, but I remind him that the decision on air passenger duty that we announced in December&#146;s pre-Budget report was not retrospective. It was pre-announced: the pre-Budget report documents made it clear that the new rates would apply to passengers travelling on or after 1 February. It was a departures tax, not a ticket tax or a booking tax. Of course, questions arose in respect of flights booked before 6 December, when my right hon. Friend the Chancellor made his announcements, but airlines had two months&#146; notice before the new tax rates came into force. The airlines have been liable for the air passenger duty since 1993. They are responsible for its payment and free to choose&#151;as they did in February&#151;whether and how to pass their costs on to passengers.</p>

 The Financial Secretary cannot argue that a tax is not retrospective just because it was pre-announced. The rise was voted on as part of the Budget resolutions, and will be voted on again during the course of this Finance Bill, but it is backdated to February.</p>

<p><a name="st_o219"><a name="07062518000078"><a name="70625-0009.htm_spnew11"><a name="07062518000634"><b>John Healey:</b>
 The provision was not retrospective, but it is true that it applied to tickets booked before as well as after the announcement on 6 December, just as air passenger duty applied when it was first introduced in 1993, as did the changes made to the duty in 1996 and 2000.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o125"><a name="70625-0009.htm_para17"><a name="07062518000079">My hon. Friend the Member for Bishop Auckland (Helen Goodman) did not look too disappointed when I broke the news that she was not to be a member of the Finance Committee this year. However, we missed her during the six weeks we spent scrutinising the Bill and discussing it in detail.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o126"><a name="70625-0009.htm_para18"><a name="07062518000080">I respect the way in which the hon. Member for Christchurch (Mr. Chope) again raised the retrospective taxation issue. He is absolutely assiduous in doing so, and not just in the Chamber; he and I have debated the issue in Westminster Hall, too. His arguments seem to be making more headway on his Front Bench than on the Treasury Bench, although he and his Front-Bench colleagues obviously do not entirely see eye to eye on green taxes and environmental policy in general. The hon. Gentleman is right: his Front-Bench colleagues did not support him when he moved a similar proposition on air passenger duty in the Committee of the whole House. However, they seem to be lining up to support him on this occasion. Perhaps we should not be surprised&#151;we are getting used to rapid and dramatic shifts of policy position on the Opposition Front Bench.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o127"><a name="70625-0009.htm_para19"><a name="07062518000081">The hon. Member for Falmouth and Camborne (Julia Goldsworthy) referred to agricultural buildings allowance and the trust legislation&#151;concerns that were also mentioned by the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Stewart Hosie). I encourage the hon. Lady to consider that there could be no legitimate expectation that the law relating either to agricultural buildings allowance or to the taxation of trusts would remain unaltered indefinitely. The right hon. Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood) touched on whether the trusts legislation was retrospective. The tax changes on the treatment of trusts were not retrospective; they may, and do, apply to trusts that have been previously  <br>

established, but only for future years. That is not retrospection in any serious sense of the word.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o128"><a name="70625-0009.htm_para20"><a name="07062518000082">New clauses 2 and 7 would restrict the use of retrospective tax law far beyond existing domestic and European Court of Human Rights precedents and would have effect in respect of a wider range of tax provisions than Members might realise. New clause 7 in particular would severely restrict the Government&#146;s ability to react to changing circumstances to protect the Exchequer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o129"><a name="70625-0009.htm_para21"><a name="07062518000083">Let me stress that the Government take the use of any retrospective tax law extremely seriously. Before introducing the Finance Bill to the House of Commons, the Chancellor is required to certify that it is compatible with the European convention on human rights, which he does only after he has sought advice from Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs and other departmental lawyers. That ensures that every provision in the Bill is scrutinised carefully and an assessment is made as to whether it complies with the rights conferred by the convention.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o130"><a name="70625-0009.htm_para22"><a name="07062518000084">As Members will be aware, the main constitutional conventions on retrospective tax law are known as the Rees rules, which require a Minister to make a full announcement to the House when introducing fiscal changes that have effect on a date before the enabling legislation will be enacted. Over the past 10 years, the Government have used and followed those rules, just as previous Governments did on many occasions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o131"><a name="70625-0009.htm_para23"><a name="07062518000085">The hon. Member for Wycombe referred to the statement made by my right hon. Friend the Paymaster General in 2004 when she set out an approach to tax avoidance schemes&#151;tough but necessary arrangements&#151;that were subsequently supported on both sides of the House. I think that all hon. Members might concede that tax decisions often have to recognise a wide range of economic, social or environmental factors, and sometimes we face factors that change rapidly and constantly. Of course, those factors have to be balanced with the need for certainty and the need to respect the rights of taxpayers to understand their position&#151;including compliance with the provisions of the Human Rights Act 1998. We are satisfied that the balance that we have built into the current parliamentary framework is sufficient to deal with the situations we face.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o132"><a name="70625-0009.htm_para24"><a name="07062518000086">As the hon. Member for Wycombe explained to the House, new clause 2 seeks to enshrine in legislation elements of existing convention and best practice. New clause 7 seeks to go further than new clause 2 and rows back from existing convention and best practice. Together, they would restrict the ability of the tax system to respond to changing circumstances and, on occasions, to avoidance threats. New clause 7 seeks to impose wholly impractical restrictions by making it a duty of Treasury Ministers not to bring before Parliament retrospective tax provisions, whether in the Finance Bill or otherwise, that do not comply with certain conditions set out in the clause.</p>

<p><a name="st_o220"><a name="07062518000087"><a name="70625-0009.htm_spnew12"><a name="07062518000635"><b>Mr. Redwood:</b>
 How can the Minister say that the provisions would cause problems with tax avoidance when new clause 2 specifically allows the Treasury still to take action to deal with tax avoidance?</p>

<p><a name="st_o221"><a name="07062518000088"><a name="70625-0010.htm_spnew0"><a name="07062518000636"><b>John Healey:</b>
 If the right hon. Gentleman will bear with me, I will come on to the sort of problems that would be caused by the flawed way in which the provisions in new clauses 2 and 7 are framed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o133"><a name="70625-0010.htm_para0"><a name="07062518000089">There are many precedents, going back many years, for Acts of Parliament and resolutions that take effect from dates before the date on which they are debated and voted on by the House. Subsections (7) and (8) of new clause 2 set out conditions under which retrospective tax law would be compatible with subsection (1). Subsections (2) and (3) of new clause 7 set out the same conditions under which retrospective tax law could be introduced in accordance with subsection (1). The first condition is that some event&#151;most likely a court judgment&#151;has changed the interpretation of the law contrary to &#147;the reasonable expectations&#148; of &#147;tax practitioners&#148;. That phrase is defined in new clause 2(8) and new clause 7(3). A moment&#146;s thought would encourage one to conclude that it would be extremely difficult to determine what the reasonable expectations of such a diverse body as tax practitioners would be.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o134"><a name="70625-0010.htm_para1"><a name="07062518000090">The second condition in both new clauses is that a scheme has been disclosed to Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs. I think that this is the point that the right hon. Member for Wokingham was making. However, although the term &#147;tax avoidance scheme&#148; appears in the titles of the legislation referred to in the new clauses, it is not defined anywhere in UK legislation. The descriptions used in primary legislation&#151;principally in part 7 of the Finance Act 2004&#151;and in regulations are targeted at avoidance, but they do not define it. In effect, they are proxies for new and innovative schemes, as these often carry the highest risk of avoidance. But not every scheme that is notifiable is avoidance and, equally, since the descriptions must strike a balance between countering avoidance and imposing unnecessary or burdensome responsibilities on business, they will not capture every avoidance scheme.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o135"><a name="70625-0010.htm_para2"><a name="07062518000091">New clause 2(6) and new clause 7(7) would further give the provisions effect in situations where the tax change may affect a pricing decision that has already been made by a company, even when the measure applied only to tax points that occurred after the measure had been passed by the House. It cannot be the case&#151;although it appears to be from the way in which the provisions are framed&#151;that hon. Members seriously propose that the House should be alerted in any case in which a change to tax rates has an impact on a commercial decision or arrangement that has already been entered into. Again, a moment&#146;s thought would lead one to suggest that that might apply to virtually any tax change. In general, any tax change has the potential to have an impact on such decisions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o136"><a name="70625-0010.htm_para3"><a name="07062518000092">It is difficult to envisage why the provisions are necessary. The Chancellor must certify that any retrospective measure is human rights-compatible. Parliament has the ability to consider all the factors raised in the new clauses when debating such a measure. The drafting of the new clauses is fundamentally flawed. The measures would have far wider consequences than even the hon. Member for Christchurch might intend. Following the reassurances that I have given, I hope  <br>

 The debate has demonstrated the widespread concern throughout the House about creeping retrospection, as was evident from the comments made by my right hon. Friend the Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood) and my hon. Friend the Member for Braintree (Mr. Newmark). The hon. Member for Falmouth and Camborne (Julia Goldsworthy) reminded the House of a point that I omitted to make: the issue of retrospection was very live when we considered trusts during our proceedings on last year&#146;s Finance Bill. The hon. Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine (Sir Robert Smith) also made that point. The hon. Member for Dundee, East (Stewart Hosie) was sympathetic to new clause 2. To borrow a phrase from my hon. Friend the Member for Christchurch (Mr. Chope), we are seeing a large pincer movement on the Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o137"><a name="70625-0010.htm_para4"><a name="07062518000094">I pay tribute to my hon. Friend the Member for Christchurch, who strongly opposes the rise in air passenger duty. He is also concerned about retrospection and I am grateful to him for pressing the issue in such a way.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o138"><a name="70625-0010.htm_para5"><a name="07062518000095">My hon. Friend was right about the pincer movement on the Government because the hon. Member for Bishop Auckland (Helen Goodman) said shortly after I finished my speech that she opposed new clause 2, but that her opposition would be justified retrospectively. That set the tone for the debate. She has been joined on the Labour Benches by the hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Rob Marris). He is in the Chamber retrospectively, given that he was here in spirit right from the start of the debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o139"><a name="70625-0010.htm_para6"><a name="07062518000096">The Financial Secretary, like the hon. Member for Bishop Auckland, produced a scant argument. He says that the considerations already apply and that new clause 2 is badly drafted, but subsection (1)(b) of the new clause would allow him to introduce any measure and simply claim that it would be justified, despite being retrospective, for the reasons that he wished to set out to the House. However, he did not address that point at all.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o140"><a name="70625-0010.htm_para7"><a name="07062518000097">Having heard the Financial Secretary&#146;s argument, if new clause 2 were agreed to, I would be happy to accept amendments (a) and (c) to it, which were tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Christchurch. I would look sympathetically on new clause 7, which he also tabled. We will press new clause 2 to a Division.</p>

 With this it will be convenient to discuss Government amendment No. 2.</p>

<p><a name="st_o225"><a name="07062528000006"><a name="70625-0010.htm_spnew4"><a name="07062528000067"><b>Mr. Gauke:</b>
 Before I deal with new clause 4, let me say a few words about Government amendment No. 2 and return to the comments made by the Financial Secretary earlier. As he said, on my debut on the Front Bench in Committee, he generously agreed to amend the Bill to require an affirmative resolution where the joint and several liability requirements are to be extended, as in clause 97. He has been as good as his word, and I welcome the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o143"><a name="70625-0010.htm_para10"><a name="07062528000007">New clause 4 would require that the Treasury, in consultation with Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs, specify a maximum period for HMRC to determine an application for VAT registration or VAT repayment. If it were not determined within the period specified, the applicant could apply to the special commissioners for a declaration of approval to be granted, unless the commissioners determined that HMRC had reasonable grounds for failing to determine the application. The reason for tabling the new clause is the widespread and growing concern that VAT applications, whether for registrations or repayments, are taking substantially longer than previously, and substantially longer than the target times specified by HMRC.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o144"><a name="70625-0010.htm_para11"><a name="07062528000008">I should say at the outset that I recognise that part of the reason for the delays is action that is being taken to try to tackle missing trader intra-Community&#151;MITC&#151;fraud, which has a substantial cost. We recognise and support the Government&#146;s view that action needs to be taken. We also accept that, in fighting MTIC fraud, there is a role for ensuring that only legitimate companies become registered for VAT and only companies with clean hands receive VAT repayments. I have received some representations stating that the VAT registration process should have been tightened at an earlier stage in order to address the issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o145"><a name="70625-0010.htm_para12"><a name="07062528000009">It is not our intention to disrupt attempts by the Government to tackle MTIC fraud. Indeed, new clause 4 is so drafted that if HMRC had good reason for delaying a registration or repayment it would be able to do so, and of course tackling fraud is a good reason. However, I hope that the new clause will give us a chance to explore whether the problems with registration and repayment are entirely due to MTIC fraud, and whether the balance is right between tackling fraud and ensuring that legitimate businesses are not harmed and that their activities are facilitated. I also hope to explore the question of whether there is any prospect of an improvement in performance by HMRC in this area. I will listen carefully to what the Financial Secretary says when he responds, and if he persuades me that the new clause would harm efforts to tackle MITC fraud, I will not press it. None the less, we wait to hear those arguments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o146"><a name="70625-0010.htm_para13"><a name="07062528000010">Essentially, there are two closely related problems: VAT registrations and VAT repayments. This is not a new issue. I raised the question of VAT registrations last summer in the Standing Committee on last year&#146;s Finance Bill. I subsequently raised it with senior HMRC officials when I was a member of the Treasury Committee and they gave evidence on HMRC&#146;s performance to the Treasury Sub-Committee. It is  <br>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o147"><a name="70625-0010.htm_para14"><a name="07062528000011">His colleague, Mike Eland, added:</p>

We did not get that quite right. We put the emphasis on tackling the fraud. We are now looking to correct it the other way by simplifying some of the procedures and also getting better IT backup to carry out some of the fraud checks so that we can do the checking more quickly&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o148"><a name="70625-0011.htm_para0"><a name="07062528000012">Mr. Gray and Mr. Eland stated that HMRC was improving but was &#147;not there yet&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="st_o226"><a name="07062528000013"><a name="70625-0011.htm_spnew0"><a name="07062528000068"><b>Mr. Redwood:</b>
 My hon. Friend is making a good case. Could he give me some idea of the length of time for which he thinks it reasonable for Revenue and Customs to delay considering an application?</p>

<p><a name="st_o227"><a name="07062528000014"><a name="70625-0011.htm_spnew1"><a name="07062528000069"><b>Mr. Gauke:</b>
 I am grateful to my right hon. Friend. I will deal with some of these points in more detail in a few moments. HMRC&#146;s standard target is 21 days &#151;15 working days. There may well be circumstances in which additional time is necessary, but at the moment there are regularly delays of three, four, five or six months. That is unacceptable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o149"><a name="70625-0011.htm_para1"><a name="07062528000015">Let me consider some of the performance figures. HMRC accepts that last summer&#146;s performance was unacceptable. In June 2006, 109 complaints were made, and in July 2006 the figure was 96. I have the most up-to-date figures from answers to parliamentary questions, which show that the number of complaints had increased to 131 in April 2007 and 133 in May 2007.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o150"><a name="70625-0011.htm_para2"><a name="07062528000016">Perhaps the most important figure is the percentage of applications that were processed within 21 days of receipt. In May, June and July 2006 it was 56, 57 and 57 per cent. respectively. Again, the most up-to-date figures that I have are from parliamentary answers. Although in January HMRC officials were looking for a substantial improvement, and recognised that there had been a problem the previous summer, the figure was still a mere 60 per cent.; anecdotal evidence suggests that it may have declined since then. However, even if 60 per cent. of applications are tackled within the 21-day target period, that means that of approximately 280,000 VAT applications a year, some 112,000 are not tackled in that time. That is a substantial number. Given that I believe that the target has been missed by some margin, we are talking about a reasonably major issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o151"><a name="70625-0011.htm_para3"><a name="07062528000017">The concern was further highlighted last week in an article that John Arnold, the chairman of the tax faculty of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, and Neil Gaskell, its technical manager, wrote. Their introductory remarks are worth quoting:</p>
<a name="70625-0011.htm_brev1"><a name="07062528000058"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;At the Tax Faculty we know that the continuing and unacceptable HMRC delay in processing new VAT registrations is the biggest single VAT issue facing our members and their clients.</p>
</ul><a name="70625-0011.htm_brev2"><a name="07062528000059"><ul><p class="tabletext">Some registrations are taking over six months to obtain. Smaller businesses are faced with cash flow problems because,  <br>

without a VAT number, they have difficulty in getting their invoices paid. Larger businesses find restructuring or acquisitions held up; and for everyone, property transactions are delayed if the purchaser needs to become VAT registered&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o152"><a name="70625-0011.htm_para4"><a name="07062528000018">They go on to argue that accountants have been running up approximately &#163;100 million worth of chargeable time as a consequence of trying to deal with HMRC&#146;s inefficiencies and errors. They estimate that only 20 per cent. is passed on to clients. None the less, the problem affects accountants and clients.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o153"><a name="70625-0011.htm_para5"><a name="07062528000019">How bad is the problem according to HMRC? Mr. Arnold and Mr. Gaskell state in their article that HMRC claims that 95 per cent. of applications are processed within 30 days; I remind hon. Members that the target is 21 days. Let us consider the assessment that the accountants make of the various VAT registration offices. They note that Newry takes 30 days, and Wolverhampton takes 34 days to open applications. Performance appears to be slightly better in Carmarthen, but there are no details. Hon. Members should note that we are considering the time taken simply to open applications.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o154"><a name="70625-0011.htm_para6"><a name="07062528000020">The accountants&#146; article refers to HMRC&#146;s figure of 30 days, although an article in last week&#146;s <i> Financial Times </i>cited 38 days. Does that figure mean that processing takes place 30 days from receipt, or 30 days from opening applications? If it is taking more than a month simply to open applications, we are contemplating serious problems. As Mr. Arnold and Mr. Gaskell say, it suggests that the 30-day claim is somewhat &#147;misleading&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o155"><a name="70625-0011.htm_para7"><a name="07062528000021">One of the problems that the tax faculty article identified is the large increase in the number of applications for VAT registration, which the Government&#146;s legislation on managed service companies has caused. I am sure that we will revert to that subject later because it has caused a substantial increase&#151;approximately 20,000&#151;in applications. The VAT application officers have simply been unable to cope with that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o156"><a name="70625-0011.htm_para8"><a name="07062528000022">The issue raises several questions, and I would be grateful if the Financial Secretary could answer them. Do the Government accept that performance in dealing with VAT applications is declining? Does the Financial Secretary have any further up-to-date figures? Does he maintain that 95 per cent. of cases are tackled in 30 days, or 38 days? Does that time run from receipt of applications or opening of applications?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o157"><a name="70625-0011.htm_para9"><a name="07062528000023">The accountants have raised concerns about the closure of the Newry VAT office. What will be the effect of that? HMRC appears to have acknowledged that it will cause further delays. What steps did HMRC take to mitigate the problems that the proposals for the managed service companies caused? Was it anticipated that they would cause an increase in VAT applications? What was done to tackle that? Are the problems exacerbated by attempts to reduce HMRC staff? Is that a wider problem in HMRC? Are legitimate companies that are trying obtain a VAT registration feeling the impact of attempts to reduce staff? How targeted are the problems relating to VAT registrations at companies that are in high-risk areas for missing trader intra-Community fraud? The problem appears to be much greater than simply a handful of companies in key high-risk areas, such as mobile phones or specific electronic goods.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o158"><a name="70625-0011.htm_para10"><a name="07062528000024">The second cause of concern is VAT repayments. In Committee, I provided several examples of difficulties with VAT repayments. Again, there is clearly a relationship with MTIC fraud; indeed, it is even stronger. The system of extended verification, which has caused delay in several cases, is undoubtedly an attempt&#151;on the face of it, a successful attempt&#151;to tackle MTIC fraud.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o159"><a name="70625-0011.htm_para11"><a name="07062528000025">Two statistics are wheeled out. First, in 95 per cent. of cases in which traders are subject to extended verification, participation in or profit from MTIC has been found, or sufficient suspicion exists to warrant further investigation&#151;&#147;sufficient suspicion&#148; in the opinion of HMRC, presumably. There is a distinction between cases in which someone subject to the extended verification system has been found to participate in or profit from MTIC fraud and those in which sufficient suspicion exists. Is it possible to break down the figure of 95 per cent. to ascertain how many traders fall within each category?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o160"><a name="70625-0011.htm_para12"><a name="07062528000026">The second figure that HMRC uses is the 1 per cent. of withheld VAT, which is subsequently found to have been correctly claimed and properly payable. The test of &#147;correctly claimed and properly payable&#148; is higher than that for being involved with MTIC fraud. I sought further clarification through parliamentary questions without success about whether it could be argued that an element of the VAT funds that are not being repaid do not relate to MTIC fraud but to a technical, perhaps minor, breach of the claim form. I should be grateful for that further clarification.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o161"><a name="70625-0011.htm_para13"><a name="07062528000027">There is a concern that staffing underlies many of the problems, especially those with VAT registration. In Committee, I raised the case of Viking Garages, and a professional adviser to the company pointed out, in connection with VAT repayments:</p>
<a name="70625-0011.htm_brev3"><a name="07062528000060"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;HMRC are putting woefully inadequate resources to the team responsible for authorising repayments&#148; .</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o162"><a name="70625-0011.htm_para14"><a name="07062528000028">Do the Government recognise that there is a problem, and a staffing issue? If so, what steps will they take to improve the position?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o163"><a name="70625-0011.htm_para15"><a name="07062528000029">Both issues hamper legitimate business. There is concern that the delays are preventing us from dealing accurately with MTIC and from taking well-targeted action, but there is broader anxiety that the legitimate needs of legitimate business have not been facilitated by HMRC. New clause 4 highlights and attempts to address those concerns. For 12 months, professional bodies and members of the Conservative party have sought to improve something that HMRC has recognised is a serious problem. I hope that the Financial Secretary accepts that there is a problem, and will provide reassurance that those concerns will be addressed.</p>

 I support the powerful case made by my hon. Friend the Member for South-West Hertfordshire (Mr. Gauke) for new clause 4, particularly on the repayment of VAT. Some 1.8 million businesses are VAT- registered, and they submit 7.6 million assessments each year. In the year ending March 2006, 85 per cent. of those assessments were paid on time, which means that a substantial number were not. The new clause would assist the Revenue in sharpening up its act, and would both help it to catch up with those who have not paid their VAT bill on time and ease the burden on businesses that have not received their repayments on time. In the absence  <br>

of such a provision, the Revenue has paid insufficient attention to the efficiency improvements that are needed following its combination with Customs and Excise.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o164"><a name="70625-0011.htm_para16"><a name="07062528000031">The Revenue is quick to fine businesses that do not submit their returns on time. Indeed, if a business is two weeks or more late in filing its return, a default fine is automatically imposed. In the year ending March 2006&#151;the latest year for which figures are available&#151;the Revenue issued 250,000 late filing penalties, which is an increase of 10,000 on the previous year. The total value of VAT-related penalties earned by the Revenue that year was &#163;270 million. That is a significant source of tax revenue, which HMRC could clearly increase, given the proportion of fines that have not been paid. However, there is an imbalance, as HMRC&#146;s performance in refunding overpayment is not subject to anything like such rapid equivalency. Indeed, businesses can apply for compensation only once an inquiry launched by HMRC into VAT irregularities is completed. As we heard from several hon. Members in Committee, that may take a very long time indeed, even for businesses that trade legitimately and supply the information requested by HMRC. They do not receive such payments as a result of HMRC&#146;s inefficiencies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o165"><a name="70625-0011.htm_para17"><a name="07062528000032">I am dealing with a constituency case that involves a company whose VAT payment for March 2006 is under investigation. It was not notified of the investigation until six and a half months later, in mid-October. An overpayment had been made, so the Revenue may have suspected MTIC fraud&#151;indeed, it transpires that that was the case&#151;and it launched an inquiry. Fourteen months later, the company is still waiting for the inquiry to conclude. There is a catalogue of errors in HMRC&#146;s systems, with which I will not bore the House&#151;but to illustrate the challenges facing companies I should explain that that business, having failed to receive a refund of the significant overpayments in its March return and its subsequent May return, received a demand from the Revenue regarding the non-payment of corporation tax. The Revenue decided to pursue the company through the courts for the tax, which amounted to roughly 20 per cent. of the VAT overpayment due to the company. The company got into cash flow difficulties as a result of the Revenue retaining its funding, and business more or less ceased. It was only as a result of my intervention with Mr. Gray at HMRC that the Revenue backed down from its demand for corporation tax and stopped pursuing the company into liquidation through the courts. Fourteen months later, however, despite repeated correspondence with Mr. Gray on the company&#146;s behalf, there is no resolution in sight.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o166"><a name="70625-0011.htm_para18"><a name="07062528000033">If the Government accepted the new clause, the Revenue would be obliged to report regularly on its performance, so it would have a salutary effect both on the way in which HMRC chases up people who default on payments and on cases in which overpayments have not been refunded. As a final illustration, may I rehearse for the House a point that I made in Committee about online filing and HMRC&#146;s woeful performance in meeting its own targets? By March of this financial year, HMRC aims to achieve a target of 50 per cent. of VAT returns filed online. As of March&#151;the end of the last financial year&#151;only 9 per cent. of returns were filed online. The new clause would encourage substantially greater efficiencies in HMRC, so it should be supported.</p>

 I shall be brief, because the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire (Mr. Gauke) outlined very clearly a significant problem in VAT registration and repayment. It is important to underline the impact of such problems on businesses. Hon. Members have given examples of businesses that have ceased trading as a result of delays, so we should not underestimate the problems on the ground. As always, it is difficult to balance the interests of law-abiding businesses with the need to tackle the fraudulent endeavours of people trying to cheat the system. Liberal Democrats have always made it clear that they are sympathetic to the Government&#146;s efforts to tackle the issue. MTIC fraud is a significant problem that costs the Treasury billions of pounds a year, so we support the Government&#146;s efforts to introduce a reverse charging system to overcome it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o167"><a name="70625-0011.htm_para19"><a name="07062528000035">I am sympathetic to the intention behind new clause 4, but I wonder whether it is too bureaucratic. If HMRC officials are already struggling to deal with repayment applications, the provision might make the spiral even worse. If I have any hesitation, it is about the fact that the proposal may be more time consuming for officials who are struggling to cope with the new measures that have been introduced as a result of reverse charging and the verification process. They are trying, too, to cope with restructuring and staff cuts, which have had a wider impact on the system. I should be grateful if the Minister told the House the average time that it takes an HMRC official to process applications for repayment and to deal with verification.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o168"><a name="70625-0011.htm_para20"><a name="07062528000036">Finally, I do not know whether the Minister will accept the new clause, but businesses are seeking genuine assurances from him that the wider HMRC reforms and efficiency changes will not have a negative impact on their ability to complete the VAT verification process or to seek repayment. Efforts to counter MTIC fraud should not affect law-abiding businesses. Above everything else, with respect to the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire, who tabled the new clause, ultimately that is what small businesses seek from today&#146;s debate.</p>

 Business is looking for greater speed and greater co-operation from all parts of Government, and I am delighted that my hon. Friend the Member for South-West Hertfordshire (Mr. Gauke) has highlighted the need for improved performance in the important area of VAT refunds and VAT registration. The asymmetry has already been illustrated in one respect. If a business files late, there is an automatic penalty. If the Revenue and Customs is late in returning, that is bad luck on the business concerned.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o169"><a name="70625-0011.htm_para21"><a name="07062528000038">There is another asymmetry that is relevant and extends more widely across Government: the asymmetry between the standards now expected of a world-class business in terms of error and delay, and the standards that we have grown used to expecting from Government. A world-class business would think it bad to have an error rate as high as 0.1 per cent., and it would expect very little delay in service or product delivery to its customers, yet we are discussing an organisation where 40 per cent. of the initial registrations and 14 per cent. of the refunds are delayed. Those are massively large  <br>

<p><a name="stpa_o170"><a name="70625-0011.htm_para22"><a name="07062528000039">It is the Government&#146;s job and a Minister&#146;s task to engage with senior officials and administrators to try to lift Government standards to something like those that world-class competitive businesses must hit or go out of business. As we have heard, small businesses and some big businesses can be extremely embarrassed if an important refund is much delayed, because they budget their cash flows to very fine tolerances. If a large cheque from Revenue and Customs is missing, that can make a big difference to the business&#146;s future and therefore to the jobs represented by that business.</p>

 I thought that I had left VAT returns behind when I moved from business to politics, although as the Financial Secretary knows, I maintain a keen interest in VAT issues as HMRC has three main buildings in the constituency that I represent, two of which deal with VAT issues. With reference to my local VAT office, I have had a number of discussions about job cuts in HMRC, and from the Front Bench my hon. Friend the Member for South-West Hertfordshire (Mr. Gauke) expressed concerns about the impact of job cuts on already worrying performance figures. I support new clause 3 in particular, as it is right that we examine the performance figures in detail.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o171"><a name="70625-0011.htm_para23"><a name="07062528000041">My second point involves a recent constituency case. A constituent recently visited me who was concerned that an internet-based competitor was selling goods without paying any VAT. I wrote to the Financial Secretary, who took the matter extremely seriously, although for understandable reasons he wrote back to say that he could not correspond about a third company and reveal details. From my investigation of the matter, there seems to be concern in the industry that, because of carousel fraud, the performance figures of HMRC were adversely affected. That was affecting not only repayments and the processing of applications, but other fraud issues relating to VAT. I should appreciate reassurances from the Minister that non-carousel fraud is being investigated equally and that resources are not being sidetracked because of carousel fraud.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o172"><a name="70625-0011.htm_para24"><a name="07062528000042">Finally, in my discussions with a number of people about the case that I mentioned, concerns were raised that managed service companies are submitting thousands of new companies for VAT registration on a daily basis. Can the Financial Secretary allay my concerns or put a number on the VAT applications coming through daily and monthly? Will he confirm reports that up to 20,000 applications in bulk have been submitted to HMRC in one day? That would explain some of the performance figures and performance concerns.</p>

 When the issue of timely VAT repayment was raised in Committee in the context of MTIC fraud, the Financial Secretary commended me for speaking with some passion on the subject&#151;at least, I think it was a commendation. It will come as no surprise to him, then, that I want to return to it.</p>

the Treasury Committee. The acting chairman and the director general of enforcement and compliance at HMRC both admitted to the Treasury Committee that VAT registration was an area in which HMRC was under considerable pressure.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o174"><a name="70625-0011.htm_para26"><a name="07062528000045">However, my interest, or rather my passion, stems from the fact that I have seen the effect that the pursuit of MTIC fraud can have on a business when it causes significant delay in VAT repayment. I therefore welcome new clauses 3 and 4, because they both improve parliamentary oversight and introduce some form of benchmarking in HMRC&#146;s treatment of VAT. However, the first depends on the second if it is to be effective. The value of scrutiny depends, to a large extent, on the existence of benchmarks and standards of reasonable behaviour. That is particularly important in respect of MTIC fraud.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o175"><a name="70625-0011.htm_para27"><a name="07062528000046">First, there is a consensus that tackling MTIC fraud is necessary and beneficial. However, the unintended consequence of that consensus is that scrutiny becomes more challenging, because we must be careful that an attack on the effectiveness of the repayment system is not construed as an attack on anti-avoidance itself.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o176"><a name="70625-0011.htm_para28"><a name="07062528000047">Secondly, the Government are fond of telling the House how fiendishly complicated MTIC fraud is and how HMRC is engaged in a running battle to outwit its perpetrators. The reasoning is that complication justifies delay. The logical outcome of the endless race between fraudsters and HMRC is that as complication increases, so must delay. That was the essence of the Financial Secretary&#146;s argument in Committee. He told me:</p>


<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070625/debtext/70625-0012.htm"/>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o177"><a name="70625-0012.htm_para0"><a name="07062528000048">Nevertheless, there remains a point at which delay becomes unreasonable and unjustifiable, whatever the worthy objective behind it. The Financial Secretary cited a figure of 12 months for the completion of verification checks which had been accepted by the courts. If that is truly a reasonable and justifiable delay, let the Treasury specify it in an order, or let HMRC print it in a glossy brochure so that businesses know what to expect.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o178"><a name="70625-0012.htm_para1"><a name="07062528000049">Thirdly, the Financial Secretary argued that HMRC&#146;s record on MTIC fraud is very good, showing that the Government&#146;s strategy on MTIC fraud is well focused. He cited the figure that we heard earlier, that only 1 per cent. of the VAT that had been withheld because of verification was found to be correctly claimed and repayable, but that statistic will be of little comfort to those who are caught up in investigation, and it has no direct bearing on whether HMRC can agree a timetable for verification and then stick to it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o179"><a name="70625-0012.htm_para2"><a name="07062528000050">I raised the issue in Committee because I was worried that HMRC might lack the resources that it needed to cope with the scale of MTIC fraud. Publicised time scales for VAT registration and repayment would assist resource management within the organisation. It would also be invaluable to businesses that rely on prompt VAT repayment in order to maintain a healthy cash flow.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o180"><a name="70625-0012.htm_para3"><a name="07062528000051">One of my constituents was a director of a firm that was caught up in an MTIC fraud investigation. My  <br>

constituent&#146;s company supplied mobile phones, and it had exports totalling &#163;60 million in 2006. It waited some 10 months for a VAT repayment claim of &#163;6.7 million to be met while &#147;extended verification&#148; procedures were carried out on its supply chain. Unfortunately, that wait did not have a happy outcome; on 17 January, the company went into administration due to the significant dent in operating cash flow represented by that &#163;6.7 million, which is a substantial sum for a company with a &#163;60 million turnover.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o181"><a name="70625-0012.htm_para4"><a name="07062528000052">It is unfortunate to say the least that any company should be driven to the wall in those circumstances. I do not wish to second-guess HMRC&#146;s judgment on that particular case, but I do question the process. I suspect that the uncertainty of living month to month while investigations were carried out was the final straw for my constituent. He also told me that he did not think that any investigation was going on for much of those 10 months, as few of his suppliers were even contacted.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o182"><a name="70625-0012.htm_para5"><a name="07062528000053">Proposed subsection (3) of the new clause would ensure that HMRC had an incentive to get a move on, since running out of time would result in a determination in favour of the application. It is better that HMRC should run out of time than a company should go to the wall or go bust having run out of money. What the new clause does not do is prescribe a reasonable time scale. It is quite right that HMRC should, informed by all the relevant operational considerations, advise the Treasury on an appropriate time scale. Once in place, however, that time scale would introduce some accountability and get companies that are being investigated for MTIC fraud out of limbo.</p>

Let me try to deal with them at the outset, after which I shall come on to the proposals set out in the new clause. First, claims that registration applications have not even been opened are simply not true. Post received by the registration units is opened on the day of receipt. The timetable against which HMRC attempts to manage its operations, which it monitors and then is judged against, counts from the point of receipt of the form.</p>

In particular, I refer to the process of verification of repayments that may have been linked to MTIC loss where there are grounds for further investigation. In a third of those cases&#151;or, if he likes, 95 per cent. by value&#151;there was firm evidence of links to such fraud. In two thirds&#151;by number, but not value&#151;there are strong indications of such links, warranting further investigation. I hope that that helps him with his question.</p>

I understand the concerns and I recognise that problems have been caused to some legitimate businesses, but I think that hon. Members on both sides of the House have also recognised the necessity of the action that HMRC has to take to try to counter what is a very serious and systematic form of fraud. We already have a good deal of scrutiny of HMRC&#146;s performance in these fields, and there are also well-established arrangements for judicial challenge, should that be required. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will accept that his new clause is not necessary and may risk causing complications and further problems.</p>

The House is well aware of the scale of that threat; its impact on VAT receipts was estimated at between &#163;2 billion and &#163;3 billion in 2005-06. The House is also well aware of the range of measures that the Government have taken to stem those losses. I am confident that the combination of those measures, together with the work of HMRC officers in tackling the fraudsters, is beginning to have a significant impact on the scale of MTIC fraud losses.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o192"><a name="70625-0012.htm_para15"><a name="07062538000013">In 2006-07, 7,100 applications for registration were refused on the grounds that they were suspect, and 2,500 applications were registered with specific conditions such as financial security. It remains the case, however, that the two key components of HMRC&#146;s MTIC strategy must be, first, to prevent bogus businesses from obtaining a VAT registration, because without that it is not possible to operate that form of fraud, and, secondly, to verify that VAT repayment claims suspected of arising from the supply chains affected by that type of fraud are properly checked and verified.</p>

The House will accept that it is only right that those returns are subject to certain credibility checks before payment is made. Just 10 per cent. of all repayment returns fail those credibility checks and are therefore selected for further checking&#151;in other words, nine out of 10 returns are not selected for further checking. A tiny fraction of those claims is suspected to be linked to MTIC fraud and is therefore subject to a highly targeted process of extended or in-depth verification.</p>

Historically, the delays in registration have been largely due to incorrect or incomplete applications, and the introduction of a new form in December last year made registrations easier to complete accurately&#151;the number of people who get their applications right first time has increased from 30 per cent. to around 70 per cent. The assessment procedures around registration have become more targeted, and they have also become more flexible as we have detected changing risks. Nineteen out of 20&#151;95 per cent.&#151;of applications are now cleared for registration after an initial check, and for those applicants the average time to process an application is currently 38 days. I acknowledge, however, that there are also some unacceptable delays in the registration service at the moment.</p>

Member for South-West Hertfordshire cited Mr. Paul Gray, the HMRC chairman, and Mr. Mike Eland conceding that point before the Treasury Committee and asked what steps HMRC is taking to tackle those delays. First, a taskforce has been set up within HMRC further to concentrate on the highest risk applications to minimise the disruption caused to other legitimate applications. Secondly, the maximum resource possible has been committed to introducing the medium-term changes to concentrate registration staff and expertise in two sites rather than four. Thirdly, there has been a concentration on making the necessary improvements to the computer system. I recognise that it may take some time to get those measures precisely right. HMRC has told me that it is confident that by the autumn it will be on track to deliver a sustained improvement in the registration service that serves taxpayers&#146; needs while remaining tough and strong on fraud. On top of the undoubted pressure with which HMRC is dealing, Opposition Members have proposed a new obligation, which could cause further problems.</p>

In the context of a VAT registration service that is currently under pressure and that is dealing with temporary problems, new clause 4 is a disproportionate overreaction. As the hon. Member for Falmouth and Camborne (Julia Goldsworthy) has rightly pointed out, it might have the perverse effect of tying up HMRC in unnecessary bureaucracy and litigation at a time when all of us want it operationally to sort out the problems and delays on registration and to maintain the pressure on VAT fraudsters.</p>

10p compared with the UK average. In Dalwhinnie, in my constituency, the average price was 10l.1p. In Thurso, the average was 102.3p, showing a range of differences in the sorts of areas that might well be caught within the scope of the new clause, of between 3p and 10p a litre.</p>

There are the higher fuel prices, the fact that people in such areas travel much longer distances than in other parts of the country, and the lack of public transport. In many cases, there is either no viable public transport alternative, or a very limited public transport alternative. That all contributes to the fact that in the highlands, fuel costs are a higher proportion of domestic costs than the average across the UK&#151;18 per cent. of disposable income is spent on fuel in the highlands, compared with a UK average of 13 per cent.</p>

 The 3 per cent. figure is interesting, because it solves some of the difficulties that we have had previously with the various definitions of remote, rural and sparsely populated areas.

Gentleman suggesting that it would be a car owner or a vehicle registered in a particular area, which would include the people who lived in that area?

 The hon. Gentleman makes an important point. The scheme would not apply to tourists. There is a good case for having a more generally available scheme to answer such points, but one of the major arguments against the proposal last year, which the hon. Gentleman supported, was the potential for leakage outside the target population for the measure. The reason for limiting the scope is to try to find a way to deal with the problem of leakage in an effort, I hope not a vain one, to encourage Treasury Ministers to look more favourably on trying to find a way to move this forward.</p>

I am a member of the Scottish Affairs Committee and we recently visited Bonar Bridge in the highlands, and it was made clear that one of the major barriers to work for people on low incomes was the perception that in addition to all the other calculations that would have to be made in terms of being better off in work, there was the cost of travel to work. That also applies to the long distances that many people who live in remote areas have to travel to access public services. </p>

I use the euro cents definition for the benefit of the right hon. Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood) and others. At today&#146;s exchange rate, that would equate to 2.4p per litre of unleaded petrol. The proposal would not, therefore, go the whole way towards closing the gap that I have described. Indeed, I might choose on another occasion to argue that the amount allowable for the rebate should be greater, because of the differences in prices that I have described, particularly in island communities.

island communities to discounts on their air fares as they travel back and forth from their homes. It is possible to administer schemes of this nature in a simple, cost-effective way, but administration would none the less be needed, not least to protect against the potential for fraud and leakage that Treasury Ministers were concerned about last year. For the same reason, it would be linked both to the individual and to their registered vehicle. I do not believe that there would be leakage or fraud, but having a simple registration scheme for the individual person and their vehicle would address the concerns previously expressed by Ministers.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman has referred to both the owner and the vehicle. Will he clarify to which one the rebate would apply? If it would apply to a vehicle that is registered and routinely used in a sparsely populated area, I can appreciate that.

 The new clause is clear on that point. The discount would apply to individuals who had their main residence in such areas, but the vehicles that they wished to use while claiming the discount would also have to be registered.</p>

Member for Wokingham made a good point when he asked how we could protect against second home owners taking advantage of the discount. There are already schemes in place in which second homes have to be registered for certain purposes, such as the claiming of council tax discounts. Perhaps that information could be used for these purposes. Equally, it could be a requirement that the home that was registered for the purposes of the discount should be the person&#146;s principal private residence for tax purposes. That does not wholly answer the right hon. Gentleman&#146;s question, but it would at least partly tackle the issue that he has raised. </p>

 I think that this scheme would be a great deal easier to administer than the congestion charge, not least because the eligible registrants would be receiving a benefit rather than paying a cost. That would result in a great deal more enthusiasm for the registration process, which could be made very simple. I gave the example earlier of the air discount scheme, which has a very simple registration process. Adopting something along those lines would ensure that the procedure was neither complicated nor bureaucratic.</p>

The 3 per cent. figure has been referred to, and the new clause makes it clear that such an area would be defined by regulation. However, I should like to make some suggestions on that point. There are different definitions of remote rural areas in Scotland, compared with England, Wales and Northern Ireland. I would suggest that, in Scotland, areas classified as remote small towns, very remote small towns, remote rural areas and very remote rural areas under the Scottish Executive&#146;s urban and rural classification scheme&#151;with which I know Members will be familiar&#151;should be included. In England and Wales, sparse rural small towns, villages and dispersed areas&#151;as defined by the Countryside Agency&#146;s rural and urban area classification scheme of 2004&#151;seem broadly similar to the Scottish definitions that I have described.</p>

I do not have an estimate of the number of filling stations in those areas; that information is not available. The 3 per cent. limit would allow for some variability in the definitions if, for example, it became necessary to ensure that there was absolute consistency between the arrangements in Scotland, England, Wales and Northern Ireland.

 The hon. Gentleman makes an important point. The purpose of the scheme is to level the playing field. In my constituency, for example, the city of Inverness would not qualify for the discount under the scheme because petrol prices there are pretty near to the UK average. We are not seeking to implement the scheme in such a way that it would lead to a cut in prices there. Similarly, if the hon. Gentleman drove to London and bought petrol here, that would not qualify. In the case of Inverness, I shall concentrate on persuading Tesco to cut the price of its fuel to the same level that it charges at its store in Elgin, where it has competition from Asda. It has no such competition in Inverness. That would ensure an additional benefit.</p>

term, a scheme involving road user pricing would bring the combination of benefits and environmental advantages to remote rural areas that the Liberal Democrats are seeking to achieve. In the meantime, however, given that a car is a necessity in those areas, and the amount of car use will not be reduced or increased, it would be wrong to reject the new clause on an environmental basis. We have other ways to promote the use of fuel-efficient vehicles, for example through vehicle excise duty incentives. The scheme is designed to reduce the additional cost burden on people living in the communities that I have described, and I commend it to the House.</p>

 I want to pay two compliments to the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey (Danny Alexander). First, he undoubtedly spoke from the heart on behalf of his constituents. Secondly, in putting the proposal together, his party has made some attempt to listen to some of the criticisms that were ventilated in relation to last year&#146;s proposals, which he mentioned, and to which I will return in a moment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o219"><a name="70625-0013.htm_para13"><a name="07062538000059">As was apparent, the new clause is the Liberals&#146; latest attempt to find a workable solution to some of the problems that undoubtedly afflict people living in remote rural areas and rural areas generally. As I said in Committee, it is incontestably true that people living in remote rural areas often do not have access to public transport in the way that people in less remote areas do, nor do their circumstances make walking, or even cycling, practical.</p>

Gentleman did not make clear how many people in England and Wales would be covered by the proposal, but we will return to that in a moment&#151;showed that half the residents in rural settlements of fewer than 3,000 people lived within a 30-minute walk of a bus stop. According to the expenditure and food survey for 2002-03, households in such areas spent &#163;70.60 on transport, compared with households in rural areas, which spent &#163;45.50 on transport. Of course, there is less congestion in some areas, which can lead to apparently counter-intuitive results&#151;a bus in a remote area may be less environmentally friendly than a car if that bus carries only a few people. In short, people in such areas often need cars, and the hon. Gentleman&#146;s remarks about fuel prices in those areas were entirely apposite.</p>

As Members who were present for last year&#146;s debate will recall, those amendments did not stand up to examination in every detail. In effect, that was acknowledged by the hon. Gentleman when he proposed the new scheme. It is perhaps significant that the Liberals have not retabled the VED cut proposal at all this year; they did retable the lower fuel duty rate proposal, but in Committee, not on Report. It was significant that the hon. Member for Falmouth and Camborne (Julia Goldsworthy) said in Committee that she was doing that &#147;to highlight a principle&#148;, which suggested to me that she did not have any great confidence in its practicality.</p>

Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey has proposed, essentially, a coupon scheme, but he described it as a kind of swipe-card scheme.

That raises several questions.</p>

Member for Dundee, East (Stewart Hosie) famously pointed out last year&#151;in Committee, I think&#151;that there are several definitions. Certainly, were the proposal to be progressed, the 3 per cent. figure would have to be considered closely. Once that problem is settled&#151;I shall assume that it is capable of being settled&#151;there is the question of who should qualify, which the new clause as drafted does not make clear. Is it right, for example, that a multimillionaire with a second home in a remote rural area should be able to get a discount, whereas a widow dependent on benefits in an urban area should not? Once that is settled, there is the question of what vehicles should qualify. If band G vehicles, for example, are not to qualify&#151;on paper, there is a case for them not qualifying&#151;will our multimillionaire driving a band F vehicle get a discount, while, say, a farmer on a lower income driving a band G vehicle does not?</p>

 The hon. Gentleman makes an interesting point. However, in answer to the right hon. Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood), who is no longer in his place, I suggested that a requirement that the remote rural area be the individual&#146;s primary residence for tax purposes would, except in the case of the small number of multimillionaires who live permanently in such areas, deal with that.</p>

 I am tempted to reply that when we get a workable solution, rather than three unworkable proposals, we will respond with our own; my answer, however, is that I will come to that precise point in a moment, and explain why we might have been able to support the new clause had it been formed in a slightly different way.</p>

Perhaps he felt that there were already a lot of those.

She talks about local shopping.

If I had a criticism of it, it would be that it shows too much restraint and not enough generosity, but I would rather have some crumbs than none at all, so I am happy to support him.

That is a regular occurrence. Over the years that I have spoken about this issue, I have looked at the premium on many occasions and it ranges from a minimum of 6p up to a maximum in my constituency of 12p. The reason is straightforward&#151;it has been investigated repeatedly by the relevant competition authorities&#151;and it is because there are too few vehicles crossing the forecourt to provide sufficient cash income to cover the fixed costs of running that forecourt. Therefore, the extra price is necessary. My hon.

Kinlochbervie, which is the best part of two hours to drive, there is one filling station on the main road at Scourie. The residents of those areas therefore have to drive up to 20 miles and back just to fill up.

The NHS Highlands is good about providing taxis for those who cannot access private cars, but the vast bulk of people have to use a private car.

He has given the figures for the cost to the Exchequer, but he has worked them out on the basis that 100 per cent. of those eligible will take up the scheme. As we know from questions asked in the Treasury Committee, the take-up rates of almost every benefit offered are 50 per cent. or lower. It is therefore highly unlikely that that cost would be the effective cost. I have one small suggestion that might help, which is to devolve the issue to the Scottish Government and let them pay for it out of the block grant.

 We all know that fuel that is sold in remote areas is sold at a much higher price than in urban areas. The purpose of new clause 8 is to achieve a level playing field to work against the triple whammy of higher fuel prices, no public transport alternatives and the need to drive longer distances. I shall give some examples from my constituency that will show how large the differentials can be. On the large islands of Mull and Islay, a litre of unleaded is usually some 15p to 20p more than in Glasgow. On the smaller islands, the differential is much greater. On Coll and Colonsay, it is usually some 30p a litre extra.</p>

differentiation of duties allowed under the EU energy products directive is 3.54 eurocents per litre for unleaded petrol. At current exchange rates, that amounts to 2.4p a litre, or roughly 5 per cent. of the duty. For diesel fuel, the maximum differentiation is 2.3 eurocents, or 1.56p.</p>

However, ensuring that the discount was available only to qualifying persons at qualifying filling stations would mean that on presenting their swipe card the eligible person would receive a discount on the advertised price at the filling station, which would undoubtedly be selling petrol to other individuals at that advertised price. There would clearly be a difference, from which the qualifying person would gain. The Minister may have misunderstood that important point.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o264"><a name="70625-0015.htm_para16"><a name="07062538000149">I was sorry to hear that the Minister could not understand how the proposal could be made to work, especially as our proposal is a great deal simpler than the extensive administration of the tax credit system over which his Department presides&#151;although I would not use that as an example. The scheme is simple and modest, and would deliver real benefits to the people of remote rural areas. For that reason I shall press the new clause to a Division.</p>

 I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o267"><a name="70625-0016.htm_para1"><a name="07062541000007">Judging from the number of Members present, this is going to be quite a short debate, but I hope that it will achieve something. I hope that we will move the debate on so that we are all able to take a view about private equity based on the facts, rather than supposition.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o268"><a name="70625-0016.htm_para2"><a name="07062541000008">By way of background to the debate, it is worth highlighting some of the benefits of private equity to the economy as a whole. Companies backed by private equity firms have increased their work force by an average of 9 per cent. each year for the past five years, whereas FTSE 100 companies increased their work force by an average of only 1 per cent. a year over the same period. Companies backed by private equity firms have increased their sales by 9 per cent. per year&#151;almost double the average for FTSE mid-cap companies. The private equity industry has invested more than &#163;60 billion in 24,000 UK companies over the course of the past 20 years. So, the record is impressive. The value that is created is one of the reasons why many pension funds choose to invest in private equity funds. The returns that they offer help millions of people across the country to receive a decent income in retirement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o269"><a name="70625-0016.htm_para3"><a name="07062541000009">It is important that we put the current debate in that context. Over the course of the past few months that debate has been in two stages. In the earlier part of the year, there were concerns about the transparency of private equity&#151;</p>

<p><a name="st_o301"><a name="07062541000010"><a name="70625-0016.htm_spnew1"><a name="07062541000130"><b>Madam Deputy Speaker:</b>

 Indeed, Madam Deputy Speaker. I thought that it was important, for the sake of those taking an interest in the debate, to set the context in terms of some of the remarks that have been made in recent weeks. Against that clear background, there have been a number of calls from different sources for reviews of private equity and the way in which some of the tax structures work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o270"><a name="70625-0016.htm_para4"><a name="07062541000012">Let me quote one example. I hope that the new Prime Minister&#151;as of Wednesday afternoon&#151;has read the remarks about private equity made by the new deputy leader of the Labour party, the right hon. and learned Member for Camberwell and Peckham (Ms Harman). I am sure that she is looking forward to working closely with him. She said&#151;</p>

 Indeed, Madam Deputy Speaker. The right hon. and learned Member for Camberwell and Peckham called for action on taxation, which is the point that I am coming to. Several people have called for action on taxation over the past few weeks. Indeed, members of the Treasury Committee have made that a feature of their inquiry on private equity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o271"><a name="70625-0016.htm_para5"><a name="07062541000015">New clause 11 would give the Treasury the opportunity to produce information to help to bring clarity to the debate on private equity. It is important to know the Treasury&#146;s estimate of the cost of the tax relief granted to private equity companies and venture capital funds through the application of taper relief on carried interest. The matter is not straightforward, which is why we have asked the European School of Management to examine carefully not only the broad question of private equity, but some of the tax issues. We realise that taper relief is an incentive for people to make long-term investment decisions and to be rewarded for the risk that they have taken.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o272"><a name="70625-0016.htm_para6"><a name="07062541000016">The treatment of carried interest stems from a memorandum of understanding between the British Private Equity and Venture Capital Association and the Government. The MOU is referred to in the first part of the new clause. That treatment is applied to the carried interest, which is described in the MOU as</p>
<a name="70625-0016.htm_brev0"><a name="07062541000107"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;an interest in a partnership which provides that the holder is entitled to participate in the super profit made by the fund&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o273"><a name="70625-0016.htm_para7"><a name="07062541000017">Super-profit occurs when the return from a fund exceeds various thresholds. In effect, the MOU disapplies income tax rules under the Income Tax (Earnings and Pensions) Act 2003 that usually apply to securities that are acquired as part of employment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o274"><a name="70625-0016.htm_para8"><a name="07062541000018">We have a problem understanding the amounts involved. For example, during last week&#146;s Prime Minister&#146;s questions, the right hon. and learned Member for North-East Fife (Sir Menzies Campbell) said</p>
<a name="70625-0016.htm_brev1"><a name="07062541000108"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;we are giving a tax break of &#163;6 billion per annum to some of the wealthiest people in the United Kingdom.&#148;&#151;[<i> Official Report</i>, 20 June 2007; Vol. 461, c. 1372.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o275"><a name="70625-0016.htm_para9"><a name="07062541000019">I was not quite sure what he meant by that. While the Red Book gives that figure as the value of taper relief, that relief applies to a wide range of transactions and people. Last week, the managing director of Gala Bingo highlighted the fact that all his employees who invest in shares in the business benefit from that taper relief. As part of the debate on private equity, it is important that we get information about the value of tax relief, which would be the purpose of the first part of new clause 11.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o276"><a name="70625-0016.htm_para10"><a name="07062541000020">I would be keen for the Treasury to publish how much it has raised through private equity in capital gains tax in each year since 1997 and the impact that the MOU has had on the amount taken. Given that the Treasury is conducting a review on carried interest, I assume that it has such information at its fingertips. It would be beneficial to the entire debate on private equity if that information was published so that people could gain an understanding of the true extent of the problem. It would also be helpful if there was a way of analysing from the Government&#146;s figures the time that the carried interest had been held to determine whether private equity investors hold for the long term. At the moment, the taper relief kicks in after two years. The period for which private equity holders are holding  <br>

carried interest beyond that cut-off point is a matter of contention. Will the Economic Secretary share with us the terms of reference of the Treasury&#146;s review of the matter?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o277"><a name="70625-0016.htm_para11"><a name="07062541000021">The other aspect of tax relief that has recently caused concern, which has been cited by the Transport and General Workers Union in the context of the acquisition of Boots by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, is the fact that interest paid on money used to fund an acquisition is subject to tax relief, as is any money borrowed by companies. It is important that we know the extent to which private equity is using a relief that is available to all businesses that are owed money. Such information would bring clarity to the debate that is taking place not only in the House, but elsewhere. While the Red Book tells us the value of the taper relief, it does not give information about the general tax relief or the extent to which the private equity industry takes advantage of that. However, earlier this year, the Economic Secretary announced a Treasury review on the interest treatment of certain loans, so perhaps he will be able to share information with the House to inform the broader debate on that tax relief.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o278"><a name="70625-0016.htm_para12"><a name="07062541000022">As you indicated, Madam Deputy Speaker, this is a narrow debate. However, it is important that we have such information so that the wider debate, which has been characterised by generating more heat than light, can take place in the context of that information.</p>

<p><a name="st_o305"><a name="07062541000023"><a name="70625-0016.htm_spnew5"><a name="07062541000134"><b>Dr. Vincent Cable (Twickenham) (LD):</b>
 I support new clause 12, which seems helpful. It cannot be wrong to request information about a matter that is a little obscure and not especially transparent. I thus welcome the search for entitlement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o279"><a name="70625-0016.htm_para13"><a name="07062541000024">The measure is brave, in a Sir Humphrey way, given that the Conservative shadow Chancellor gave a pretty robust defence of the tax privileges of private equity firms at their annual dinner. Some Conservative Members really know about the business. The hon. Member for Hammersmith and Fulham (Mr. Hands) wrote a toughly worded letter to the <i> Financial Times </i>last week in which he defended the status quo. I do not know whether the purpose of the new clause is to row back from that. However, as I understand it, the starting point of the Conservative party is that it wishes to defend the existing regime.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o280"><a name="70625-0016.htm_para14"><a name="07062541000025">On the other hand, there is some consensus that things are happening that need to be looked at again. I certainly interpreted the Economic Secretary&#146;s comments, when he spoke at the London School of Economics at the beginning at March, as showing a willingness to consider at least the second issue raised in the new clause&#151;interest relief. I am sure that the Economic Secretary will not mind me quoting what he said&#151;in fact, I am sure that he will say it again:</p>
<a name="70625-0016.htm_brev2"><a name="07062541000109"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Today, I can announce that the Government will review the current rules that apply to the use of shareholder debt where it replaces the equity element in highly leveraged deals&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o281"><a name="70625-0016.htm_para15"><a name="07062541000026">That is half of the problem that is described in the new clause, and I am sure that we would all agree about that. The meat of the problem, and the area that I think that we are debating, is the bit of the tax-privileged status of private equity that relates to taper relief.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o282"><a name="70625-0016.htm_para16"><a name="07062541000027">Of course, as the hon. Member for Fareham (Mr. Hoban) acknowledged, those concerned with private equity are merely one group of people who currently benefit from that relief, and I am inclined to ask, &#147;Why pick on them?&#148; After all, there are other groups who benefit from the relief in a similar way, and no more or less reputably. I read in the <i> Evening Standard</i> today that Madonna has just bought her sixth &#163;1 million-plus house. I do not know what her tax status is; if she is a British taxpayer, she will presumably be able to benefit from taper relief, if she holds that property as an investment for a period of years. It is not just those with private equity who benefit from taper relief.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o283"><a name="70625-0016.htm_para17"><a name="07062541000028">To understand the nature of the problem that the hon. Member for Fareham raised, we need to go back to Parliament&#146;s decision, in 1998, to introduce such an approach to capital gains tax. I think that I have the advantage of being the only person in the Chamber who took part in that debate; it was opened by the hon. Member for Coventry, North-West (Mr. Robinson), and the reply was given by the Conservative spokesman, the then Member for Arundel and South Downs, who left the House in unfortunate circumstances, and the right hon. Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory). As I remember it, I said pretty much the same as the Conservatives at the time, which was that we had a good system of capital gains tax, which was introduced by the noble Lord Lawson. It was simple and clear, and it applied the same rate for capital gains tax and for income tax. It was straightforward, so why introduce complicated taper provisions that could eventually be taken advantage of by the group that we are discussing and others?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o284"><a name="70625-0016.htm_para18"><a name="07062541000029">Several arguments were advanced. The first was that if we create a differential, and if there is a 40 per cent. rate on one hand and a 10 per cent. rate on the other&#151;that is roughly the magnitude of the difference between income tax and capital gains tax&#151;of course people will look for ways of exploiting that, and that is exactly what the British Private Equity and Venture Capital Association sought to do in its memorandum. If it had not done it, other groups would have done it in a different way. Moreover, the Conservatives and my party argued that there was no justification for the suggestion that the measure would change business behaviour. Indeed, what was forecast by the Opposition parties is exactly what has happened. Groups of people have taken advantage of that very generous provision, which, as the hon. Member for Fareham says, has cost more than &#163;6 billion, and there is not a great deal of evidence that it has changed business behaviour in any way that has contributed to national economic welfare.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o285"><a name="70625-0016.htm_para19"><a name="07062541000030">It is absolutely right that we look afresh at the relief, not simply in relation to private equity, but in relation to the whole, large-scale, far-reaching and extremely generous tax concession. In my view, we should go back to the regime that applied in 1997, which was perfectly satisfactory. That is the basis on which we have argued for getting rid of the whole taper relief arrangement, rather than simply singling out the part of it that applies to private equity. I suspect that I would go a great deal further in reforming the system than the Conservative Front-Benchers would, but none  <br>

 I am happy to respond to the debate on the new clause, and on proposals for a report to Parliament on the costs to the taxpayer of the tax treatment of carried interest and the deductibility of interest payable on loans. I am happy to respond in the spirit in which the hon. Member for Fareham (Mr. Hoban) spoke to his new clause. I think that he was seeking to probe our thinking on some tax issues in advance of the pre-Budget report, while trying to avoid being drawn into too wide a discussion on the merits or otherwise of private equity, and the views of deputy leadership candidates&#151;or victors&#151;on the subject. I am happy to respond in that spirit.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o286"><a name="70625-0016.htm_para20"><a name="07062541000032">The hon. Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable) quoted from a speech that I gave in March, in which I set out in detail our views at the time on the private equity debate. Since then, there has been a great deal of further debate in the newspapers, and there looks set to be a very interesting report from the Treasury Committee, which held its evidence-gathering sessions in recent weeks. I will read just one quote from that speech, as it will set the context, and show that I accept and agree with many of the points that the hon. Member for Fareham made. I said:</p>
<a name="70625-0016.htm_brev3"><a name="07062541000110"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Private equity, like any other form of ownership, has good and bad aspects&#151;and it has features of both long-termism and short-termism. But the evidence does not suggest that Government has any intrinsic reason either to "favour" private equity or to do the opposite.</p>
</ul><a name="70625-0016.htm_brev4"><a name="07062541000111"><ul><p class="tabletext">Our aim should be to support economic dynamism and long-term investment and job creation. And the Government's objectives in the field of private equity should be no different from its objectives in relation to any other form of ownership: to promote an environment of long-term, sustainable business success, underpinned by a strong culture of clear disclosure to, and engagement with, underlying investors. This is the way to ensure that "good" long-term investment propositions prosper.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o287"><a name="70625-0016.htm_para21"><a name="07062541000033">Everything that we are doing in the field of private equity is in the context of that overall objective.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o288"><a name="70625-0016.htm_para22"><a name="07062541000034">The hon. Member for Fareham will not be surprised that I am not going to support his proposals for a further report. That is not because I am averse to reports but because rather a lot of reports on this issue are already on the table or being prepared. I have already referred to the forthcoming report by the Treasury. In my speech in March, I mentioned a report already provided by the Financial Services Authority into private equity&#146;s potential systemic implications for the stability of financial markets. On disclosure and transparency, Sir David Walker is chairing an independent working party to develop a voluntary &#147;comply or explain&#148; code to improve private equity&#146;s transparency and levels of disclosure. The hon. Gentleman mentioned a review that I have promised for the pre-Budget report of the rules that apply to the use of shareholder debt where it replaces the equity element in highly leveraged deals. There is also the forthcoming report on improving the UK environment for enterprise and venture capital commissioned by the shadow Chancellor from the European School of Management, which is to report by early autumn before the Treasury taxation reviews conclude.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o289"><a name="70625-0016.htm_para23"><a name="07062541000035">In other words, there are a rather a lot of reports coming up. Before the pre-Budget report and following the shadow Chancellor&#146;s review, we will want to take stock across the piece and respond properly to recommendations by the Treasury Committee, as we always have in other policy areas. I am not sure that another report is necessary.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o290"><a name="70625-0016.htm_para24"><a name="07062541000036">The hon. Member for Fareham tried to draw out some of our thinking on these tax issues. Both aspects of the new clause relate to the tax treatment of the private equity industry. As I have already said, the Government do not believe that one form of ownership should be inherently preferred over another. Rather, our aim should be to support economic dynamism and long-term investment and job creation. That is also the objective of our tax system. We do not believe that private equity should be favoured in a particular way, including in tax terms. Therefore, the capital gains tax treatment available for gains arising from carried interest and corporate tax deductions for interest&#151;the two aspects mentioned in the new clause&#151;is available to all taxpayers, not only to private equity investors in any preferential way compared with any other investor. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o291"><a name="70625-0016.htm_para25"><a name="07062541000037">Let me deal first with carried interest. The hon. Member for Fareham referred to a memorandum of understanding published in 2003. To set that properly in context, a previous memorandum of understanding had been produced in 1987 by the Inland Revenue and the British Private Equity and Venture Capital Association, which made it clear that carried interest would continue to be taxed to capital gains, not income. During the 2003 Finance Bill debate on this issue, which neither I nor the hon. Member for Fareham will remember&#151;I am sure that my hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Rob Marris) was not only there but commented on the explanatory notes&#151;concern was expressed, particularly by the former Member for Arundel and South Downs, that changes being introduced to schedule 22, covering the whole range of employment-related securities, might have a negative impact on the capital gains tax treatment of venture capital.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o292"><a name="70625-0016.htm_para26"><a name="07062541000038">As a result of those debates, the memorandum of understanding that had been agreed in 1987 was re-examined and a new one, again agreed between the Revenue and the British Private Equity and Venture Capital Association was published. It provided guidance to the industry, but, importantly, did not affect the operation of the law in the Finance Act 2003. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o293"><a name="70625-0016.htm_para27"><a name="07062541000039">That memorandum of understanding confirms that returns received through carried interest should, in law, in the circumstances that it sets out&#151;in plain vanilla form, which is a technical tax term that means &#147;in a simple and straightforward way&#148;&#151;be taxed as capital gains. No concessions were made to the private equity industry at the time, but the memorandum of understanding clearly set out how the underlying legislation applied in the case of carried interest. It set that out in a way that would apply to any taxpayer who received such employment-related securities.</p>

<p><a name="st_o307"><a name="07062541000040"><a name="70625-0016.htm_spnew6"><a name="07062541000136"><b>Rob Marris:</b>
 Is my hon. Friend saying that the memorandum of understanding of 25 July 2003 was instigated or drawn up at the behest of Howard Flight, who was then the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs?</p>

<p><a name="st_o308"><a name="07062541000041"><a name="70625-0017.htm_spnew0"><a name="07062541000137"><b>Ed Balls:</b>
 Yes. There is no controversy about that. In those Finance Bill debates, concern was expressed that the schedule might have an adverse impact on the venture capital industry. Consequently, a memorandum of understanding was drawn up to give guidance to make it clear that, on the basis of the proper application of the law to all taxpayers and investors, including the private equity industry, some of the fears expressed would not be realised.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o294"><a name="70625-0017.htm_para0"><a name="07062541000042">Clearly, since then the salience of and media interest in such issues have increased. That applies especially to the way in which business asset taper relief is available to taxpayers who make gains on business assets. The hon. Member for Twickenham explained the genesis of the business taper relief and his principled position on opposing it. I could describe his position as almost Lawsonesque in its consistency&#151;the former Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson strongly believed that capital gains should be taxed at 40 per cent., not a lower rate. He believed that any lower rate between the top rate of income tax and capital gains tax would lead inevitably to avoidance. I understand the Lawsonian views that the hon. Member for Twickenham expressed. I take them at face value, not simply because he needs the &#163;5 billion or so to pay for the tax cuts that he wants to promise others.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o295"><a name="70625-0017.htm_para1"><a name="07062541000043">We have always perceived the purpose of the business taper relief as an important means of encouraging investment and rewarding serial entrepreneurs, business angels and venture capitalists, who are prepared to take risks in growing companies. We probably agree with Conservative Members about that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o296"><a name="70625-0017.htm_para2"><a name="07062541000044">There are no special rules for private equity fund managers and we do not collect information on the specific tax reliefs that private equity fund managers receive. It is therefore not possible to identify the particular gains that are made on carried interest or to disaggregate the proportion of the cost of the overall relief, which is approximately &#163;4.78 billion in 2006-07. If we produced the report that the hon. Member for Fareham requested, it would make less interesting reading than he might like.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o297"><a name="70625-0017.htm_para3"><a name="07062541000045">However, I believe that the hon. Gentleman raised the matter because he wants to know the direction of the review. As he knows, although an effective capital gains regime is vital to encourage enterprise and stimulate investment and entrepreneurship, it must also distinguish between employment reward and capital gains and ensure that a proper balance is struck. Indeed, the shadow Chancellor made the same point when announcing his review last week. He said:</p>
<a name="70625-0017.htm_brev0"><a name="07062541000112"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;As leading members of the private equity industry acknowledge, if it looks like income then it would be peculiar not to tax it like income... But if it looks like genuine risk-taking and entrepreneurship then we should do everything to encourage it.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o298"><a name="70625-0017.htm_para4"><a name="07062541000046">I agree with that sentiment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o299"><a name="70625-0017.htm_para5"><a name="07062541000047">That is why we are currently reviewing the taxation of a range of employment-related securities, which private equity and non-private equity companies alike use to ensure that the distinction is correctly drawn. If it reassures the hon. Member for Fareham and makes it easier for him to withdraw the motion, I assure him that we will provide an update on that review, too, at the time of the pre-Budget report. I shall make sure that, while avoiding excessive bureaucratic duplication and even more reports, we provide such an update on those issues at the time of the pre-Budget report.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o300"><a name="70625-0017.htm_para6"><a name="07062541000048">On the issue of corporate tax deductions for interest payments, I can confirm that the goal of the Treasury review that I announced earlier this year is to determine whether the rules that apply to private and non-private equity investments alike are working as intended. That review is looking at the way in which the rules are working in the light of market developments but, as I said in my March speech, the deductibility of interest as a business expense for tax purposes is a fundamental principle of our tax system. We are not reviewing the basic principle that interest should in general be treated as a business expense and is deductible for taxable profits for companies in any form of ownership. However, we aim to ensure that where shareholder debt replaces the equity element in high-leverage deals, it does so consistent with our intention that interest on debt should be tax deductible. Equity, however, is treated differently, to make sure that we are as consistent as possible in our aim of providing a level playing field. As I said, the review will be published at the time of the pre-Budget report.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o301"><a name="70625-0017.htm_para7"><a name="07062541000049">The hon. Member for Fareham wondered whether or not Government Members were sending mixed messages about private equity. From the Treasury&#146;s point of view, we have sent a clear message: we believe that private equity can play an important role in the economy by driving change, and by promoting employment and investment. There are some bad private equity deals, however, in exactly the same way that there are some poorly performing public companies. It is much better to look at the conditions to support long-term investment than take a particular view on private equity. I responded to an Adjournment debate introduced by a potential leadership candidate&#151; that candidacy did not last very long&#151;on those matters, so we have debated those issues fully in the House. I do not think that Ministers or the Treasury have sent mixed messages, but the same could not be said of Opposition Members. The shadow Chancellor&#146;s review was reported by the <i> Financial Times</i> on 22 June under the headline, &#147;Tories back higher taxes for private equity&#148;. The article continued:</p>

are good these days at spin, but either they have contradicted the shadow Chancellor&#146;s speech in March or the FT misunderstood the story. In any case, given the number of reports that have been published, I do not think that we will gain enlightenment from a further report. Instead, I encourage hon. Members to look forward to the report by the Treasury Committee with interest. We will respond on all those matters at the time of the pre-Budget report. On that basis, I suggest that the House reject the new clause.</p>

 I will take no lessons from the Economic Secretary on spin. We have seen quite enough of his handiwork in the past few weeks. He ought to stick to his job as Economic Secretary, rather than engaging in media management or trying to give lessons to others.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o305"><a name="70625-0017.htm_para11"><a name="07062541000054">The hon. Gentleman was a little disappointing in his remarks. We share some common ground. We both recognise that the reliefs specified in my new clause are available to all, not exclusively to private equity. However, we are in danger of having a debate in an information vacuum. Questions are being asked about how much the reliefs are worth. There were questions in the Treasury Committee last week, when the people from private equity firms were asked how much capital gains tax was being paid. It would have been helpful if that information were available. Without it, it is difficult for that debate to take place in a rational and well reasoned fashion. The information would provide a context or framework. There is no point in pushing for a report which would consist of a series of blank pages.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o306"><a name="70625-0017.htm_para12"><a name="07062541000055">In the debate about private equity, we should be careful about drawing the wrong conclusions, reading headlines, not substance, or being distracted by other issues. It is regrettable that the information is not available. The Treasury Ministers may be sending out a clear message, but I am not sure it is the same message as is being given out by their colleagues on the Back Benches or in other positions in Government. No doubt that will all change after Wednesday, in its own inimitable style.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o307"><a name="70625-0017.htm_para13"><a name="07062541000056">We need to make sure that a proper debate takes place. The fact that the information is not available should be made clear to all the participants. I hope members of the Treasury Committee will read this brief debate and understand the constraints under which everyone is working in the debate. The Minister rightly pointed out the continuation of the memorandum of understanding from a treatment agreed in 1987, and he spoke about the Lawsonian purposefulness of the hon. Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable).</p>

Although the MOU has been around for 40 years, it has been brought into sharper focus as a consequence of those changes. It therefore behoves us all to think carefully about it.</p>

That information is by what amount our constituents will lose out by the abolition of the 10p standard rate of tax, and how many of them and which groups will be affected.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o313"><a name="70625-0017.htm_para19"><a name="07062541000063">Let me declare an interest: I favour the abolition of the 10p rate of tax. I believe that most of our constituents think about a headline rate, and that is the standard rate. Any move that brings the standard rate down is welcome to me. Indeed, long before I came to the House, I was advocating the abolition of tax allowances so that we could get the standard rate down even further than it has fallen today and is proposed in the Budget.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o314"><a name="70625-0017.htm_para20"><a name="07062541000064">It is clear from our postbags around the country that three groups stand to lose from the change, and they may not be covered by the tax credits changes that have already been announced and the child benefit changes that might be announced next year. The first group is lower-income households that will see their tax burden increase as a result of the abolition of the 10p rate, while those on higher incomes see their tax take fall. One person put it in powerful terms in their letter to me by saying that they never thought that they would see a Labour Chancellor of the Exchequer redistributing from poorer to richer households. As to the numbers that are affected, I hope, as I said, to read the parliamentary answer in a moment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o315"><a name="70625-0017.htm_para21"><a name="07062541000065">Secondly, a number of voters around the country have said that, although their husbands will benefit from cuts in the standard rate, they will lose income through the abolition of the 10p rate because they are viewed in traditional terms as the minor earners in the  <br>

household, although most such households would not survive without their two earners. My hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Rob Marris) mentioned the third group&#151;this is the first time we have raised the matter in the House&#151;which is people who have retired early, largely because of ill health, and who do not gain the advantages of the additional tax allowances that people gain once they reach the standard retirement age. It could be argued that the change in the tax rates will be offset in that way.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o316"><a name="70625-0017.htm_para22"><a name="07062541000066">The new clause therefore says that, before the House of Commons considers measures that affect our constituents&#146; living standards, particularly where we are decreasing them, the Government should give us the information as part of the Budget, so that we know the numbers and the extent to which that cut in income is taking place. We know that the measures before us will affect some people who will lose out in relation to the 10p rate. I am not sure how many, but I am hoping that that will be revealed.</p>

 I know that the right hon. Gentleman is expecting a formal answer from the Minister, and I hope that he gets one. The calculations that we have say that 836,000 people in Scotland will suffer because of the change. He might like to consider the UK figure as somewhere between 8 million and 9 million people, which is a huge number. Specifically, 52 per cent. of the workers in Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath, who earn less than &#163;17,000 would be worse off. I am sure that that figure may be replicated in similar constituencies around the country.</p>

We should have a guarantee that, before the proposed measures came into effect with the next Finance Bill, some transitional form of relief would be announced for people who were going to lose money.</p>

I think it shameful that the Government have run away from giving us that information since the middle of April. Unless I am wrong and the Chief Secretary has some different news, we are not prepared to introduce transitional relief to protect a group who are doing everything that the Government have asked them to do, which is to work, to work harder and to maintain their families.

 The Opposition welcome the opportunity to debate the impact of tax changes on different income decile groups. New clause 14 is a constructive contribution to that important debate and we sympathise with the sentiment that underlies it. It is, of course, vital for any Chancellor to carry out a proper and effective empirical assessment of the impact of proposed tax changes, and I shall explain why I believe that that is particularly important in relation to those on low incomes&#151;the right hon.

However, it is with regret that I say that, although we will not vote against new clause 14, we cannot support it this evening, because we are concerned how it would work in practice were it actually to be written into legislation. For example, we have some concerns about how feasible it is always to assess the changes in the relative share of national wealth. That assessment would not be easy, because it would be difficult to find the data. Unlike the case of income, there is no obligation to report one&#146;s wealth to the Inland Revenue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o324"><a name="70625-0018.htm_para1"><a name="07062541000081">Furthermore, I fear that the new clause might mean that almost all tax changes would have to be subjected to phased implementation, and while such measures would certainly be justifiable and welcome in some contexts, we hesitate to impose a blanket obligation in all cases. We also believe that the underlying issues raised by the new clause&#151;the importance of moving to greater transparency and objectivity in tax policy&#151;are so important as to merit further detailed consideration before we could make a commitment to a proposal such as this. That is one reason why the shadow Chancellor asked my noble Friend Lord Howe a few months ago to investigate how we might implement some of our independent tax reform commission&#146;s proposals for improving the way in which we make and scrutinise tax law.</p>

 One of the best changes would be a change of Government.

They may not qualify for the working tax credit or they may fail to take it up. They may also be in the position where the two earners both lose under the income tax and national insurance changes, but there is only one gain from the tax credit, which is assessed per household.

The hardship caused by tax increases is clearly more keenly felt when families feel that their household budget is already under strain. With inflation hitting a 16-year high earlier this year, many families on lower incomes are struggling to make ends meet. Last year, inflation was almost double the EU average, and disposable incomes rose at the slowest rate for nearly a quarter of a century. Two weeks ago, the Office for National Statistics announced that, for the sixth month in a row, regular pay failed to keep pace with inflation and real living standards fell again.</p>

According to the Institute for Fiscal Studies, poverty among adults without dependent children&#151;a group significantly affected by the tax changes in the Budget&#151;is now at its highest point since records began in 1961. That group now makes up one third of the total of Britain&#146;s poor.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o333"><a name="70625-0018.htm_para10"><a name="07062541000094">A number of deeply worrying points emerged from the most recent Department for Work and Pensions figures on poverty, covering the period between 2004-05 and 2005-06. These were analysed by the IFS and show that relative poverty and income inequality actually got worse last year. The number of people in relative poverty rose from 12.1 million to 12.8 million.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o334"><a name="70625-0018.htm_para11"><a name="07062541000095">A range of measures demonstrates the recent increase in inequality of income. The most commonly used measurement, the Gini coefficient, tells us that income inequality has increased in total during the Chancellor&#146;s 10 years at No. 11 Downing street. The DWP figures also show that the number of people living in absolute poverty rose by 400,000 to 7.4 million&#151;12.6 per cent. of the population&#151;last year. There are more people in deep poverty now than when the Chancellor entered Downing street. There are 600,000 more people on less than 40 per cent. of median income now than there were in 1997, and the poor are getting poorer. Recent Government data show that the real incomes of the poorest 20 per cent. actually fell last year.</p>

The right hon. Member for Birkenhead today repeated his concerns about the impact of the Budget on those on low incomes, but he was not alone among his Labour colleagues in expressing anxiety. As the hon. Member for Birmingham, Selly Oak (Lynne Jones) acknowledged, the Budget neglected poorer people who have no children. The hon. Member for Coventry, North-West (Mr. Robinson) has pointed out that the Budget is hurting many people whom the Government never set out to hurt, and the right hon.

Mike Warburton of Grant Thornton said after the Budget:</p>
<a name="70625-0018.htm_brev1"><a name="07062541000118"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Families on low incomes will really lose out because they will pay a marginal rate of tax at 70 per cent. starting from an earlier point.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o337"><a name="70625-0018.htm_para14"><a name="07062541000098">With the abolition of the 10p band and the increase in the tax credit withdrawal rate, the Budget leaves many low-income families with marginal tax rates of even more than 70 per cent., as their benefits are withdrawn with each extra pound they earn. Of course, such rates make it much harder to escape the poverty trap.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o338"><a name="70625-0018.htm_para15"><a name="07062541000099">In conducting an assessment of this issue in relation to different income groups, the Chancellor must take into account the interaction with the tax credit system. To return to the point made in an intervention by the right hon. Member for Birkenhead, one of the ways in which we can help those who are hit hard by the Budget is to get the tax credit system to work effectively, and to reform it so that we grapple with the chaos that has characterised it over the past couple of years. As Francesca Largerberg of the Institute of Chartered Accountants said after the Budget:</p>
<a name="70625-0018.htm_brev2"><a name="07062541000119"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;It is now seemingly necessary for those with incomes between &#163;5,225 and &#163;18,605 to get to grips with the tax credit system and claim in order to negate their losses.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o339"><a name="70625-0018.htm_para16"><a name="07062541000100">Both the Chancellor and the Chief Secretary have defended the abolition of the 10p band on the ground that tax credits will compensate some of the families affected. As I have set out, however, not everyone qualifies for tax credits, and as we heard from the hon. Member for Dundee, East, not everyone claims them. As Ms Largerberg went on to explain:</p>
<a name="70625-0018.htm_brev3"><a name="07062541000120"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Tax credits may in some cases claw back lost income but they are often difficult to claim and some lower earners may not be eligible&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o340"><a name="70625-0018.htm_para17"><a name="07062541000101">The figures for the uptake of working tax credit among childless households&#151;as we have established, a group significantly affected by the loss of the 10p band&#151;are as low as 25 per cent. of the total entitlement and only 19 per cent. of eligible claimants. If the effect of a tax increase is to push more people into the tax credit system, one must assess the way in which the system is working to analyse properly the impact of the change proposed. The latest available figures show a depressing picture. Of 5 million payments made, more than 2 million were overpaid and almost 1 million were underpaid, which means that more than half the payments in the system were wrong. At least &#163;200 million has been lost through fraud. The tax credit website had to be taken offline because of wholesale attack by fraudsters.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o344"><a name="70625-0018.htm_para21"><a name="07062541000105">To conclude, it is regrettable that the Chancellor has taken so long to answer the questions tabled by the right hon. Member for Birkenhead regarding how his Budget has impacted on different groups. That is further proof that the kind of serious and thoughtful assessment of the impact of tax rises on different income deciles envisaged by new clause 14 was very far from the Chancellor&#146;s mind in preparing his Budget. He was so desperate to grab the headlines with his basic rate tax cut con that he was prepared to do anything to achieve it, even if that meant hardship for people grappling with poverty, low incomes, falling living standards, problem debt and rising interest rates. Because he wanted to pull a fast one during the Budget debate, the 10p band had to go.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o345"><a name="70625-0018.htm_para22"><a name="07062541000106">Of all the critical comment that followed the Budget debate, that of a former Member of this House, Michael Portillo, writing in <i> The Sunday Times</i> about the closing seconds of the Chancellor&#146;s Budget speech, summed up the position most effectively:</p>
<a name="70625-0018.htm_brev7"><a name="07062541000124"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;30 seconds of theatre...had made poorer all those on low incomes who pay tax only or mainly at 10 per cent. Some will be compensated with tax credits, but not all. The chancellor cannot explain why he once thought that the lowest earners needed protection...but now has changed his mind. Those at the bottom of the pile have been sacrificed for the sake of a quick laugh. Politics, it seems, is but a game played with people&#146;s lives. It is astonishing that a chancellor who has worked with some success to redistribute income has, in his last budget, penalised the poorest but rewarded higher rate taxpayers.&#148;</p>

 We need to put this very important debate in context. The hon. Member for Chipping Barnet (Mrs. Villiers) did that a bit, although somewhat grudgingly, and she gave some useful figures. However, it needs to be put in the context of what the Government have done in 10 years to address poverty. On pensioner poverty, they have introduced the winter fuel allowance, the minimum income guarantee and the pension credit. Pensioner poverty has come down a lot. There are problems with take-up and so on, but the Government have addressed the situation of older people.</p>

 While I do not want to go too far down that path, I agree that there may be difficulties for some pensioners, although one has to be careful not to aggregate all pensioners together. For example, almost 90 per cent. of pensioners over the age of 85 have a bank account, despite all the talk about the Department for Work and Pensions and the Post Office card account. However, one has to make special arrangements for vulnerable pensioners, and the Government have tried to do that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o347"><a name="70625-0018.htm_para24"><a name="07062546000005">The point that has not been made about new clause 14 is that the proposals would take effect from April 2008. They are not in this Finance Bill. That gives us a chance to pause for reflection and to consider the figures that have been mentioned. It is vital that we get more clarity from the Government on those. According to table A1 on page 208 of the Red Book, the drop from 22 to 20 per cent. in the basic rate of income tax will cost the Treasury &#163;8 billion in 2008-09, the first year it is due to come in. However, the cost to the taxpayer of abolishing the starting rate of 10p in the &#163;1 in tax year 2008-09 will be &#163;7.3 billion.</p>

We are all higher-rate taxpayers, and they are much less than 10 per cent. of the working population in this country. We can all declare an interest in the 10, 20 and 22 per cent. rate, but intuitively the change says to me that there is a shift in the wrong direction, which is why I want more figures. Depending on those figures, my right hon. Friend the Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field) may have a point about transitional relief, but it is difficult for him&#151;he has not suggested otherwise&#151;and the rest of us to know about transitional relief until we know what we are transitioning from.

Another group is those aged under 25 who are on low incomes, because they do not qualify for working tax credits. For those people, the tax system will not reward their work, ensure that they are better off or become fairer for them.

 I welcome this debate, and all hon. Members will understand the motivation and thinking behind the new clause moved with characteristic conviction by my right hon. Friend the Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field). However, I hope that I can persuade the House that the proposal is impractical and that, if we are to assess the impact of personal tax changes on a group of taxpayers, we need to do so over a period longer than that covered by a single Budget.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o358"><a name="70625-0019.htm_para5"><a name="07062546000018">It is worth reflecting on what this year&#146;s Budget package will achieve. There will be a significant simplification of the income tax system, which my right hon. Friend has welcomed, and the reduction in the basic rate to 20p. A further 200,000 children will be taken out of poverty, on top of the 600,000 helped in that way by previous measures. More than 500,000 pensioners will be taken out of tax entirely, and the biggest proportionate gains from the Budget tax package will go to those in the lowest two deciles of income.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o359"><a name="70625-0019.htm_para6"><a name="07062546000019">That latter fact is something that I want to emphasise, especially in light of the observations made by my hon.

That analysis is still available on the IFS website, and I was checking it out earlier today. It is a very striking attribute of the Budget that the biggest proportionate gains go to the households on the lowest incomes.</p>

 In fact, the analysis does take that into account. I refer the hon. Lady to the slide in the Budget analysis on the IFS website that sets out the relevant figures. The slide shows two bars for each decile&#151;one on the assumption of 100 per cent. take-up, and the other on the assumption of 33 per cent. take-up of tax credits by childless families. The statement that I have made about where the biggest proportionate gains fall applies in both those cases.</p>

 That depends on the figures to which the hon. Lady is referring. I am not sure which they are, but later in my remarks I will deal with the take-up of tax credits.

 At this early stage in his remarks, will the Chief Secretary confirm that the take-up of family tax credits is at around 80 per cent. but that, according to the most recent report, unclaimed working tax credits amounted to &#163;5 billion last year?

There has been some discussion, rightly and fairly, of the position of pensioners. This year, the Government are spending in real terms about &#163;11.5 billion more on pensioners than if we had left the system as it was in 1997, and nearly half that extra spending&#151;more than &#163;5 billion&#151;is going to the least well-off third of pensioners. On average, they are &#163;2,300 a year or &#163;44 a week better off. Other groups in the taxpayer population referred to in the debate have benefited from other changes. We need to make a full assessment of the effects on people of changes introduced over a period rather than insisting on the basis of one year&#146;s tax changes that there should be transitional protection.</p>

When the package is fully implemented, 6 million families with children will be better off and the gain to work will rise by &#163;50 a year for many, up to &#163;350 a year for some, helping to work make pay. The package reduces and simplifies personal taxation within a fiscally neutral Budget, protecting and boosting the incomes of vulnerable groups, with the number of losers minimised. I am not saying that there are none, but the number has effectively been minimised.</p>

Income tax is paid by more than 30 million people &#151;I think my right hon. Friend said 31 million.

That is right in the middle of the band that was mentioned. A lone parent, with one child, working full time at the minimum wage will be &#163;335 a year better off. If we all agree&#151;I think that on the whole we do&#151;that it is right to prioritise the reduction and ultimately the eradication of child poverty, we need to prioritise households with children in Budget measures. That is what the package in the Budget does.</p>

As far as I can see, where losses accrue to some as a result of the changes, they are small.</p>

 I am listening carefully to what the right hon. Gentleman is saying about transitional arrangements, but is he able to say whether the Treasury will undertake to publish information at the time of the Budget on the effect of the measures on individuals, as well as information on how their incomes may have changed over time? That would enable us to see clearly, in one place, the impact of Budget measures on different income groups.</p>

<p><a name="st_o336"><a name="07062546000039"><a name="70625-0019.htm_spnew9"><a name="07062546000414"><b>Mr. Timms:</b>
 Information has already been published. I point the hon. Lady to the IFS analysis for the sort of detail that she is asking for. That shows that the biggest proportionate gains from the package will be enjoyed by households in the lowest two income deciles. That is an important feature of the package.</p>

I understand the concerns expressed by my right hon. Friend the Member for Birkenhead and others across the House, but they are effectively addressed by the tax credit changes that are part of the package as well. I hope that he feels that it would not be right to press the new clause to a vote, but, if he does press it, I will certainly ask my hon. Friends not to support it.</p>

 I thank my right hon. Friend for those comments. The thrust of his remarks was that we have not put forward a workable scheme for transitional relief, but it was only seconds before I came into the Chamber that we got the crudest information on the numbers who would be gainers and the numbers&#151;the 3 million&#151;who would be losers, so it is a bit rich of him to say that we might have persuaded him had we come up with a workable scheme. For some reason or other, the information was not available. We could have looked at those data and come up with a workable scheme.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o371"><a name="70625-0019.htm_para18"><a name="07062546000042">I want to make two comments: one to my side and one to the Opposition. What the Chief Secretary said was significant. He said that households in the lowest two deciles are the big gainers from the Budget. Since Lord Lawson introduced personal taxation, we have never been primarily concerned with household income; we have been concerned with individual income. On this side of the House, we were particularly keen on that, because we wished to see a transfer from wallet to purse wherever possible. If the Bill goes through as it stands, it will reverse the tradition that we started. It will move moneys from low-paid women&#146;s purses into the wallets of higher-paid husbands. For that reason alone, people on this side of the House ought to be disturbed. I am sorry that there are not more women Members present to support that group in the debate and then in the Lobby.</p>

We were told by the official Opposition that while the new clause addressed a serious problem, they would not vote on the matter. The hon. Lady said that we could rely on the tax credit system to compensate people who will lose out&#151;we do not know who they are, but we know that there will be 3 million of them. The official Opposition have rightly secured debates and asked questions on tax credits. This evening, the hon. Lady said that one in two   <br>

 The right hon. Gentleman must have misunderstood the point that I made.

 It is difficult to understate the mess into which the Government have got themselves on the taxation of small companies. After 11 Budgets and multiple rate changes, the Chancellor has almost come full circle on the subject. When the Government came to office, the rate was 23p in the pound. They reduced it to 21p in 1997 and to 20 per cent. in 1998. In 1999, a new 10 per cent. rate was introduced, reduced to zero in 2002, only to be put back up to 19 per cent. for non-corporate distributions in 2004. In this year&#146;s Budget, the rate was increased from 19 to 20 per cent.; next year it will increase from 20p to 21p, and the following year, it will go up from 21p to 22p. By the next general election, the small companies rate will be only a penny less than it was in 1997. There have been so many changes, yet so little progress. Eight tax changes have been made, simply for the rate to fall by only 1p in the past 10 years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o376"><a name="70625-0020.htm_para1"><a name="0706263000007">That constant meddling in the small companies rate reflects a problem at the heart of the Government&#146;s tax policy. Treasury Ministers perceive tax as a means of behavioural change; sometimes it might work and sometimes it does not. However, in 2002 some bright spark at the Treasury decided to stimulate enterprise by reducing the starting rate of corporation tax to zero. We know that that stimulated incorporation; hence the changes in later years to the starting rates, and their effects, until last year&#146;s abolition.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o377"><a name="70625-0020.htm_para2"><a name="0706263000008">In the debate in the Committee of the whole House, the hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Rob Marris) and I referred to proceedings on Second Reading of the Finance Act 2002. We both admitted that our memory was rather hazy, but I checked the debate and I found a quote, in which I thought that hon. Members might be interested. It is:</p>

<a name="70625-0020.htm_brev3"><a name="0706263000507"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;In fact, a quarter of large companies&#151;those employing more than 250 staff&#151;pay the small companies or small profits rate; and fully around half of medium-sized companies, which have between 50 and 250 employees, pay that rate.&#148;&#151;[<i> Official Report, </i>30 April 2007; Vol. 459, c. 1266.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o380"><a name="70625-0020.htm_para5"><a name="0706263000011">A measure that was apparently supposed to deal with unincorporated businesses becoming limited companies will lead to increases in the tax rate paid by 13,000 medium-sized companies and about 1,500 large companies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o381"><a name="70625-0020.htm_para6"><a name="0706263000012">In the spirit of consensus, may I offer to help the Government out of the hole they have got themselves into by increasing the tax rate on many businesses employing more than 50 staff? In amendments Nos. 41 and 42, they have an opportunity to focus the measure more effectively on the smallest companies, which they believe responded to their policy in 2002 to incorporate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o382"><a name="70625-0020.htm_para7"><a name="0706263000013">What is the Government&#146;s justification for the measure? What are they using to defend that change of tax policy? The Budget note on corporation tax reform summarised the argument succinctly by setting out three main objectives of reform: enhancing the international competitiveness of UK-based business; encouraging growth through investment and innovation; and ensuring fairness across the tax system. Those are laudable objectives, but let us look more carefully at what they mean in practice for small business. The cut in mainstream corporation tax, which we support, aims to improve Britain&#146;s international competitiveness, but only for companies earning profits of more than &#163;300,000 a year. The Government&#146;s attitude is, &#147;If you earn profits lower than that, tough.&#148; The Budget has worsened the position of such companies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o383"><a name="70625-0020.htm_para8"><a name="0706263000014">I suspect that the Financial Secretary will argue, as he did in the Committee of the whole House, that in the Budget there are changes to the annual investment allowance that will help small companies. However, that depends on businesses making decisions to invest in plant and machinery rather than in human capital. Small businesses that expected to earn the industrial buildings allowance or the agricultural buildings allowance will be hit hard by measures that we will discuss tomorrow.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o384"><a name="70625-0020.htm_para9"><a name="0706263000015">The Government use the argument of fairness to justify the increase in the small companies tax rate, but I have established that it is a crude, clunking measure that hits companies of all sizes.

the heart of the tax change, as the Government do not understand properly how small businesses work and how they are affected by the tax system. If they did, perhaps they would not be in this mess in the first place. It appears from representations made by small business groups that they do not believe that the Government understand them, either. Carol Undy of the Federation of Small Businesses was reported as saying:</p>

The Government have sent mixed messages for business in the Budget, and it is time for a consistent approach to company taxation. Cutting one rate but increasing another sends a confused signal to the business world. It is right to encourage businesses to grow and invest, so it is wrong for the Chancellor, who did the right thing for companies earning large profits by cutting the headline rate of corporation tax, to increase the small companies rate. Because of the mistakes that he made in the past, he is penalising all small companies that pay that rate. Why should companies suffer because he got it wrong? The Government owe them an apology, not a tax increase.</p>

 I shall be brief. We have covered many of these issues on Second Reading, in the Committee of the whole House and in the Public Bill Committee. The only point that I wish to make, in addition to those made by the hon. Member for Fareham (Mr. Hoban), ties in with the previous debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o388"><a name="70625-0020.htm_para13"><a name="0706263000019">It is not yet clear to many businesses how their tax treatment will be affected by the increase in the small business rate of corporation tax, the capital allowances and the research and development tax credits that may be available to them. Again, it would be helpful if, at the time of the Budget, information was published about what the differential impact of all the changes, in the round, will be&#151;over time, as not all the changes occur within the same time frame; over sector, because we have heard that some capital-intensive businesses will benefit disproportionately; and by region, because in my part of the world, down in Cornwall and across the south-west, there are a disproportionate number of very small businesses. If many small businesses encounter a tax hike, areas with the highest proportion of small businesses will see that driver of their economy affected more negatively than other areas that have more big businesses or more capital-intensive businesses.</p>

disadvantages there will be for them in the tax changes in the Budget and the Bill. I hope the Minister will give us an assurance that by the end of the debate on the Bill, businesses will have a clearer sense of what it will mean for them.</p>

<p><a name="st_o344"><a name="0706263000021"><a name="70625-0020.htm_spnew4"><a name="0706263000518"><b>John Healey:</b>
 As the hon. Member for Falmouth and Camborne (Julia Goldsworthy) said, we have covered much of the ground before, several times since the Budget, and we have rehearsed many of the general arguments in debates on the Bill and elsewhere. The arguments that I heard this evening from the hon. Member for Fareham (Mr. Hoban) are fundamentally flawed, first in the proposition that there should be a differential in how the small companies rate is charged, and secondly, in the way that he attempted to target those rates.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o390"><a name="70625-0020.htm_para15"><a name="0706263000022">There are huge practical difficulties with attempting to fix a tax rate based on fairly arbitrary and easily manipulated criteria, such as employment figures. What is the rationale for choosing five employees as representing a real company, rather than, say, six or four? What if employment levels change throughout the year? Would a company wait until after it had filed its tax returns to cut the work force? Would it take on temporary workers in order to get above the magic level of five employees?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o391"><a name="70625-0020.htm_para16"><a name="0706263000023">On a more serious level, one needs to consider the risk of distorting what should be commercial decisions because of a tax structure. That would create incentives for small companies to merge not for commercial reasons, but for tax reasons. It would also be an incentive to exaggerate employment levels in the company. The proposition is seriously flawed in a number of ways.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o392"><a name="70625-0020.htm_para17"><a name="0706263000024">The core of the problem is not the practicality of introducing such arbitrary measures, but the rationale for doing so. To encourage investment, as the hon. Member for Fareham recognised, the Government have looked to reduce corporation tax rates successively since 1997, to the extent that even when we reverse that trend and return the small companies rate to 22 per cent., it will be still be lower than when we came into office in 1997. The hon. Gentleman acknowledged that earlier.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o393"><a name="70625-0020.htm_para18"><a name="0706263000025">The hon. Gentleman criticised us for what he termed constant meddling with the rates, but at each stage what we have done, and the rationale for doing it, have been clearly set out. At each stage we have said that the changes that we are making in the rates were to encourage retention, reinvestment and growth. As with all elements of the tax system, we have made it clear that we would keep those changes under careful and constant review.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o394"><a name="70625-0020.htm_para19"><a name="0706263000026">As hon. Members have recognised, the earlier changes and their impact were not as we intended. We saw an increase in incorporation taking place, not as a launch pad for growth but as a way of reducing personal tax and national insurance levels, while in many cases those involved were carrying out exactly the same economic activity as before.</p>

than five employees, but for all businesses&#151;not just companies, but those that are unincorporated as well. The hon. Member for Fareham cited the Federation of Small Businesses, and I shall do so too, as I have in previous debates. It has welcomed the proposal for the annual investment allowance, which will benefit the direct activity of investment. By providing an allowance of up to &#163;50,000 for all businesses, the arrangement will cover all the yearly expenditure of about 19 out of 20 small businesses, effectively providing them with 100 per cent. first-year allowances, moving towards a cash-flow tax system, dealing with what many small businesses constantly say is their biggest problem&#151;their tax-flow levels. Even modest levels of investment in plant and machinery will bring significant benefits.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o396"><a name="70625-0020.htm_para21"><a name="0706263000028">We recognise that there are many sound reasons for incorporation. We do not want to stop or discourage genuine commercial incorporations. We are proud of our record in encouraging the start-up and growth of small firms, not least with the stability that we have been able to bring to the general economy. The changes that we are making in the Bill build on that success. They reduce the unfair tax advantages that can distort competition between incorporated and unincorporated businesses, and they ensure that the incentives in the tax system that are designed to promote growth will do just that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o397"><a name="70625-0020.htm_para22"><a name="0706263000029">For that reason, I hope that the hon. Member for Fareham will not press amendment No. 43. Amendments Nos. 41 and 42 go directly against what businesses say to us that they want&#151;a simple and fair tax system&#151;so I hope that he will not press those amendments, either. If he does, I shall ask my hon. Friends to resist.</p>

<p><a name="st_o345"><a name="0706263000030"><a name="70625-0020.htm_spnew5"><a name="0706263000519"><b>Mr. Hoban:</b>
 This has been a brief debate, which is probably to the advantage of all hon. Members; as the Financial Secretary said, we have rehearsed these arguments before.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o398"><a name="70625-0020.htm_para23"><a name="0706263000031">I accept that amendments Nos. 41 and 42 are quite crude amendments. In a sense, they mirror what the Government have sought to do by increasing the small companies rate, because the Government&#146;s increase has been a very crude way of tackling a problem of their own making. Perhaps the Financial Secretary should take his own advice about measures that could end up distorting commercial decisions. Tax can distort commercial decisions, as the 2002 tax changes clearly did. He needs to reflect on that when considering future changes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o399"><a name="70625-0020.htm_para24"><a name="0706263000032">It is clear that, despite the package that the Financial Secretary described, as we established in the Committee of the whole House, the average gain for businesses from the introduction of the annual investment allowance is about &#163;60 or &#163;70 a business. The loss for small companies as a consequence of the increase in the tax rate is about &#163;1,000 a company. I think that many small businesses and companies will find that a burden, and will find that they cannot invest as much as they would want to invest in developing their staff.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o400"><a name="70625-0020.htm_para25"><a name="0706263000033">That sends out mixed and confused messages to companies that hear the Chancellor praising large companies and cutting their corporation tax, while small companies are penalised by this increase.

 I am grateful for the opportunity to raise this issue tonight. I notice that the last time I raised the issue of roads in the south-west on the Adjournment it was at 11.15 pm, so tonight&#146;s timing is slightly better.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o416"><a name="70625-0021.htm_para14"><a name="0706266000031">Although the title of my debate on the Order Paper is &#147;Strategic routes in the South West&#148;, I hope to reduce the scope of that a little, as it would be a very large subject. One might have a debate about the rail system in the west country, which is desperately in need of investment to meet the demands on it, or about the motorway system. I want to concentrate my comments, however, on the A303 in my constituency and the strategic routes between the south coast and Bristol and Bath. I will try desperately to put out of my mind the fact that, because of the Glastonbury festival traffic, it took me four hours to drive from my constituency this morning along the said A303. Indeed, it is not capacity or journey times that I want to concentrate on, but rather safety and the quality of life for people who live in my constituency.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o417"><a name="70625-0021.htm_para15"><a name="0706266000032">The particular stretch of the A303 that most interests me is between Sparkford and Ilchester. It horrifies me to realise that I have been talking at intervals about that stretch of road, which is only 31/2 miles long, for the 10 years that I have been in the House and before that as a county councillor. We went through a long process immediately prior to my entering the House in 1997, when the then Government produced plans for safety improvements on that stretch. They were put to local people and went through a public inquiry. The public inquiry satisfied itself that there were no overwhelming environmental problems or problems with local concerns about the plans.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o418"><a name="70625-0021.htm_para16"><a name="0706266000033">That was different from other parts of the A303. There was considerable concern about the implications of schemes to increase capacity over the Blackdowns, and we have a continuing problem with what can be done at Stonehenge. However, there was a general realisation that there could be a significant improvement in the safety of the stretch of road from Sparkford to Ilchester by dualling it, and that that could be done without an excessive take of land and reasonably inexpensively.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o419"><a name="70625-0021.htm_para17"><a name="0706266000034">The scheme got caught in the moratorium on road building as the new Government took office in 1997. We then entered into what I have learned to call the south-west area multi-modal study&#151;the so-called SWARMMS report&#151;which looked at the whole length of the A303, and there it stayed. I have raised the issue at regular intervals since then. When I did so in 1998, the then Minister, the hon. Member for Hampstead and Highgate (Glenda Jackson), gave me a learned dissertation on Stonehenge and why I should care more about it than about my constituents. I do care about Stonehenge, but I was interested in safety improvements between Sparkford and Podimore.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o420"><a name="70625-0021.htm_para18"><a name="0706266000035">Every time we have raised the issue since 1997 we have seen an ever-receding prospect of action. Why do we need action? It is a stretch of road where the A303  <br>

changes from a dual carriageway to a single carriageway and back to a dual carriageway. There is a pinchpoint. It carries a significant amount of traffic. I have said before that the A303 carries more traffic than many motorways, particularly in the summer season, when there is a great deal of holiday traffic, much of which, for some reason, wants to go to Devon and Cornwall. I cannot understand why entirely, but it does, and it goes through Somerset. There is also a lot of locally induced traffic from the Glastonbury festival, the Yeovilton air show and local events of that kind.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o421"><a name="70625-0021.htm_para19"><a name="0706266000036">The other critical factor is the distance of the stretch of road from London and the far south-west. It is at the point when drivers start to get tired and lose their concentration. According to information that I have been given by the Highways Agency, the sad consequence of that is that there have been 18 deaths and 68 serious injuries on that short, 31/2 mile stretch. That is significant.</p>

<p><a name="st_o350"><a name="0706266000037"><a name="70625-0021.htm_spnew4"><a name="0706266000091"><b>Mr. Oliver Letwin (West Dorset) (Con):</b>
 The hon. Gentleman makes a powerful case. I hope that he agrees that there is another reason for taking the steps that he advocates: the effect lower down on the A35 on the south coast, where my constituents suffer from an excess of through traffic which could be relieved to a considerable extent by dealing with pinchpoints on the A303.</p>

<p><a name="st_o351"><a name="0706266000038"><a name="70625-0021.htm_spnew5"><a name="0706266000092"><b>Mr. Heath:</b>
 I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman. I do not know the details of the situation that he describes in Dorset, but I am well aware of the case for establishing the A303 as the second strategic route&#151;as I am told I must call it. Sometimes I am told that I must call it policy TR3 of the regional spatial strategy. All those acronyms denote the fact that it is a very important road and something needs to be done.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o422"><a name="70625-0021.htm_para20"><a name="0706266000039">Apparently, that stretch of road will not be done before 2016 at the earliest. The implication is that if the problems of Stonehenge&#151;which I understand is a difficult conundrum, given that a world heritage site is right next to a trunk road&#151;cannot be satisfactorily resolved, nothing will be done along the entire length of the A303. We have proposals for a single scheme, which should not be included in the whole scheme for the length of the A303 but judged on its merits. Those merits suggest, in safety terms and for the sake of saving lives, that it is justified. It concerns me greatly that it will be held up by circumstances beyond the control of anyone who is making the case for it. Those circumstances include the Stonehenge issues and the problem of investing in the A358 as the other leg that brings the traffic from the A303 back to the M5. I ask the Minister whether we can look again at the safety record of that short stretch of road and how we can improve it. We cannot reasonably and responsibly wait until 2016 for something to be done.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o423"><a name="70625-0021.htm_para21"><a name="0706266000040">The other outstanding issue on the A303 is the noise-reduction surface, which we were faithfully promised by the Highways Agency would be in place four years ago. For the sake of their quality of life, people who live in close proximity to a road that for all intents and purposes is carrying the traffic of a motorway, in places such as Blackford, Holton, Maperton and Compton Pauncefoot, have been desperately waiting for a change in the surface. They are sadly disappointed that it has not been done yet.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o424"><a name="70625-0021.htm_para22"><a name="0706266000041">I thought that the subject of the second strategic route was opaque, but BB2SC&#151;as I am told I must call the other route&#151;is even more obscure. BB2SC does not yet exist but will be the road that will connect the south coast ports of Poole and Southampton with Bristol and Bath and, therefore, the motorway network to the north. The difficulty at the moment is that we have not identified that key strategic route. The consequence of that is that heavy goods vehicles leaving those ports&#151;and we are told that both ports will be expanded&#151;take totally unsuitable routes north. They choose different routes, one of which is the A357 through Dorset into the Blackmore vale and, in my constituency, through villages such as Henstridge and Templecombe. I cannot imagine villages that would be less suitable for heavy goods vehicles, given the width of the carriageway, the fact that buildings are very close to the road on each side, and the sharp bends. They are totally unsuitable for lorries of any size.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o425"><a name="70625-0021.htm_para23"><a name="0706266000042">In addition, Templecombe has a low railway bridge and, every month or so, a lorry gets stuck under it. I was in Templecombe only three or four weeks ago and a lorry got stuck. It got squashed under the bridge about 20 minutes after Abbas and Templecombe primary school had finished its day. Had that happened 20 minutes earlier, the pavement under the bridge would have been full of primary-age children. That is unsatisfactory, dangerous, and could be completely avoided if we had a proper strategic route, with all the necessary signage, to take lorries away. The road is supposed be an A route, but it is incapable of taking that sort of traffic.</p>

 Does the hon. Gentleman think that satellite navigation plays a part with the lorries? My constituency is rural, like his, and I too have seen more problems with lorries. It seems that satnav gives drivers the most direct route, but using some of the most inappropriate roads possible.</p>

 I am so glad that the hon. Lady has asked that question, as the next word on my notes is &#147;satnav&#148;. She is right; in the case that I described, the Slovenian driver was using satnav. As a result, he followed an unsuitable road. Satnav navigation systems are fine, in their place, and they have a value, but far too many heavy goods vehicles&#151;especially those driven by foreign drivers&#151;seem to use inappropriate devices intended for cars rather than heavy goods vehicles. In any case, the HGV satnav programs do not show clearly enough the unsuitability of some roads. For instance, the driver of a delivery lorry tried to make a delivery right next to my office in Frome. He went down a cobbled street in Sheppards Barton in Frome and met a flight of steps&#151;that was where the satnav had sent him, but that is not an entirely satisfactory routing system.</p>

He said then that the consultation about the Government&#146;s proposals was to end on 9 January this year. We should therefore have some firm proposals about what should be done, but it  <br>

seems to me that we should translate the suitability of roads and the various obstacles on them on to a commonly agreed, pan-European satnav format which HGV drivers must use. In that way, all drivers can use the same basis of information, and lorries can be prevented from using unsuitable roads.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o427"><a name="70625-0021.htm_para25"><a name="0706266000046">I conclude by saying that I want the upgrade of the A303 linking Sparkford, Ilchester and Podimore recognised as something that can be done soon. It has already gone through public inquiries, so we know the arguments and issues involved and that the upgrade will save lives. I also want to ensure that we identify a proper north-south route from the south coast ports to Bristol and Bath, with the result that lorries do not use grossly unsuitable roads. I also want to know what has happened to the noise-reducing resurfacing of the A303 in my constituency. I was promised that, but the money seems to have been moved elsewhere.</p>

 I begin by congratulating the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath) on securing this debate and making his constituents&#146; concerns so clear to the House. In the next few minutes, I hope to be able to give him the information, if not the comfort, that he seeks.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o429"><a name="70625-0021.htm_para27"><a name="0706266000049">As the hon. Gentleman said, the A303 is an important trunk road, and part of the strategic route from London to Exeter. Much of it is already dual carriageway, but he was right to say that there remain a number of single-carriageway sections, including the stretch between Sparkford and Ilchester in his constituency. The A303 serves local, regional and longer distance traffic and, as he said, it is a popular holiday route to the south-west. It is also an important route for businesses from Somerset, Devon and Cornwall.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o430"><a name="70625-0021.htm_para28"><a name="0706266000050">The single carriageway sections are often congested during the summer months as the road provides the most direct route to the south-west for tourists from London and the south-east. The main alternative to the road is the longer M4 and M5 route around Bristol, but as we all know there is increasing pressure and congestion on the M4 and M5, too. It is against that background that we accepted the conclusion of the London to south-west and south Wales multi-modal study that, in transport terms, there is a strong case for the whole of the A303 route to be improved, which would provide a second high quality dual carriageway road from London to the south-west.</p>

priorities. That is why in July 2005 we asked the south-west region for advice on transport priorities, within an indicative funding allocation for major schemes in the south-west.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o432"><a name="70625-0022.htm_para1"><a name="0706266000052">The regional funding allocations process, for the first time, has given regions a say in decision making about transport schemes that affect them. The RFA process is an opportunity for people in the region to work together to develop a realistic, prioritised and affordable transport investment programme, to support the region&#146;s high level objectives for jobs, the economy, housing and the environment. It is central to our thinking that regions are better placed than the men and women of Whitehall to advise decision makers on how transport can help make regions into even better places. I hope the hon. Gentleman will welcome that approach.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o433"><a name="70625-0022.htm_para2"><a name="0706266000053">We are backing the RFA process with massively increased investment funding. We have increased our annual spending on such schemes by 50 per cent. since 2001-02; for example, the Highways Agency has invested &#163;92 million to improve the A30 between Bodmin and Indian Queens&#151;a scheme that, subject to events later this week, I hope to open on 11 July. In addition, &#163;16 million is being spent on improving the Commonhead junction on the A419 in Swindon. The agency is spending &#163;42 million to provide a much needed bypass for Dobwalls on the A38 in Cornwall and &#163;65 million constructing the Blunsdon bypass, also on the A419 near Swindon.</p>

 I shall come on to how the hon. Gentleman&#146;s constituents could address that issue in the near future.</p>

I hope that figure might impress the hon. Gentleman&#146;s constituents. However, he and others have suggested that we are not making enough money available in the south-west. That was certainly the suggestion made when prioritisation took place; some people claimed that there was no way to prioritise the Ilchester to Sparkford improvement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o435"><a name="70625-0022.htm_para4"><a name="0706266000057">As I have told the House on a number of occasions, I hear similar arguments from every region in relation to many other schemes, which makes me think that we have been pretty fair in dividing the pot between regions. It could be argued that the regional pot should be bigger, but then it would have to be made clear where the money would come from&#151;what tax would be raised or what other investment would be cut. We have to be realistic. The Government do not have unlimited funds and sometimes tough choices have to be made. The RFA process helps us to make those choices in the best and most sensible way. Following its advice, the south-west region assigned funding to a total of 31 schemes in the period to 2016. The region advised us that the Ilchester to Sparkford improvement may well prove to be a long-term priority but should not come forward before 2016.</p>

road he is talking about. The Minister talks about other regional needs. I have driven all over the country over a number of years and in the midlands or the north I drive on motorways or dual carriageways. Very rarely do I have to drive on long sections of single carriageway, as I do in the south-west. Does the Minister accept that the south-west has been deprived of funding in the past and that there is a need for the Stonehenge link, the section of road that my hon.

 Of course I can understand why Members from the south-west want these investments. Were I in their position, I would probably be arguing for the same thing. However, I find it a bit rich that when I take part in Adjournment debates with Liberal Democrats they spend the evening telling me that the road scheme in their constituency is a priority and must go ahead. On other occasions, they tell me that we should not build any more roads and that we should concentrate on other initiatives. They really cannot have it both ways.</p>

 I will give the hon. Gentleman a list of Liberal Democrat MPs who are constantly telling me and the newspapers that we are not nearly green enough and that we should not build any more roads&#151;except of course for the roads in their constituency. The fact of the matter is that there was a certain amount of money to be distributed around the country. We asked the regions how we should distribute it. The formula was agreed. It was allocated to those regions and then we asked the regions to do their best to prioritise within that envelope. We have taken their advice. I would have thought that the hon.

 One of the road projects that has been agreed in principle and that the Minister mentioned earlier is the dualling of the A358 between Ilminster and the M5. Many people in my constituency would welcome that because it would ease congestion and make that stretch of road safer. However, there are real concerns among the residents of Blackbrook in Taunton about the proposed loop design, which would take northbound traffic off the M5 and onto the new A358. They are unhappy about that because it would mean the loss of a playing field, it would be ugly, and it would add to noise pollution and other pollution. Can the Minister update us on whether it is possible to have the new stretch of the A358 dualled without those adverse effects on the residents of Blackbrook in Taunton?</p>

Members may be disappointed about the outcome, but, nevertheless, we accepted the region&#146;s advice. We have asked those involved in the regional funding allocation to look at their priorities again and come back to us next year to tell us whether those priorities have changed. I put it to the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome, his colleagues on the Back Benches, and hon. Members across the House that if they do not like the priorities that their region has come up with, they have the opportunity over the next year to work within their local region to win over people&#146;s hearts and minds to a reprioritisation process. We would be just as delighted to accept that advice as we were to accept the original advice.</p>

Gentleman has alluded to, in particular in respect of the Ilchester and Sparkford section. The level of accidents on that stretch is not significantly higher than the average for trunk roads. The national average is 16 personal injury accidents per 100 million vehicle kilometres and the rate for that section of road is 16.72. However, that is not an argument for not taking other opportunities to improve safety when we can do so sensibly. We thus recently invested &#163;450,000 in safety improvements at the Podimore roundabout. Although it is still only a year since the scheme was introduced, the early indications are encouraging. The number of accidents has dropped from an average of 19.25 a year, as measured over a four-year period, to just six in 2006, which was the first year of the scheme&#146;s operation.</p>

I understand his constituents&#146; distress about the problem, but highways are resurfaced to maintain their safety. We do not have the resources to resurface highways simply to reduce noise. When the highway needs to be resurfaced for purposes of maintenance or safety, quieter materials will be used. However, these days we do not resurface in advance of a need for maintenance.</p>

Somerset county council is responsible for those roads. It says that it aims to discourage the use of those unsuitable routes through dialogue and publicity, and, when necessary, by introducing weight restrictions. If the hon. Gentleman does not think that those measures are working, I am afraid that he needs to take up the matter with Somerset county council, rather than with me.</p>
