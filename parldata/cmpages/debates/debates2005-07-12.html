 (Con): What estimate she has made of the cost to the NHS of the failure to return equipment loaned to patients in the last year for which figures are available.  [11240]
</p>


<p><a name="st_0"><a name="50712-01_spmin0"><b>The Minister of State, Department of Health  (Jane Kennedy): </b> 
 As I am sure all hon. Members would want me to do, speaking as Minister with responsibility for the health service in London, may I first pay my own tribute and express my deepest gratitude, which I know we all share, to the health and emergency services for their response last week?
</p>

<p>
<a name="50712-01_para0">
<a name="stpa_0">Now to perhaps more prosaic, but none the less important matters&#151;the Department has not estimated those costs. It is for the local national health service and social care bodies to determine how best to provide equipment to meet the needs of individuals. Some equipment can be reused, subject to its condition and to any need to decontaminate it.
</p>





<p><a name="st_1"><a name="50712-01_spnew0"><b> Andrew Selous: </b> 
 I am sure that the Minister will agree that public money is precious money, and I hope therefore that she will follow up the concerns of one of my constituents, a retired civil servant, who has brought to my attention the fact that many patients are loaned equipment on a short-term basis, such as chair and bed raisers, stools, helping hands and so on; that there is no follow-up for the return of that equipment&#151;that is purely left to the conscience of the patient; and that the providers of that equipment are making money out of the NHS by the continual loan of such equipment. Will the Minister undertake to look into that to ensure that there is no waste of precious NHS resources across the country?
</p>





<p><a name="st_2"><a name="50712-01_spnew1"><b> Jane Kennedy: </b> 
 I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for raising this issue. He may be aware that in 2000 an initiative called integrating community equipment services was undertaken, through which we have placed greater emphasis on refurbishing and recycling equipment and, as he suggests, tracking the equipment 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>12 Jul 2005 : Column 682</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>that is loaned. He suggests that that is not working in his location. I would be grateful if he wrote to me specifically about that matter so that I can look into it in the detail that he is obviously requesting.

 (Lab/Co-op): I endorse the remarks of the hon. Member for South-West Bedfordshire (Andrew Selous). There is certainly a problem in the east midlands, not unrelated to the fact that there appear to be no computer systems to track items that are not hugely costly individually, but are very valuable to people on the waiting lists for them. Will the Minister please investigate whether there is some way in which either a regional system or some other means could be developed to track, in particular, wheelchairs and equipment of that kind, which can lie gathering dust while other people could use them?
</p>





<p><a name="st_4"><a name="50712-01_spnew3"><b> Jane Kennedy: </b> 
 I understand that the majority of services now pay particular attention to encouraging the return of such equipment and that those services have improved their decontamination, repair and maintenance systems. My hon. Friend will be pleased to hear that improved tracking systems are both enabling services to trace equipment and facilitating its return. However, given the concerns that have been raised today, I will undertake to look into this matter in some depth.

 (Con): What measures are in place to ensure that the NHS abides by its code of practice on ethical recruitment.  [11241]
</p>


<p><a name="st_5"><a name="50712-01_spmin1"><b>The Minister of State, Department of Health  (Ms   Rosie Winterton): </b> 
 Compliance with the code of practice is monitored by NHS Employers, an organisation that works closely with strategic health authorities and trusts to ensure that the NHS abides by the code.
</p>





<p><a name="st_6"><a name="50712-01_spnew4"><b> Mr. Lilley: </b> 
 Can the Minister confirm that, none the less, this country imported some 15,000 nurses, largely from developing countries, in the last year for which we have figures, while exporting 8,000 nurses that we trained, largely to developed countries? Are we not at risk of being accused of hypocrisy if we spend a lot of time saying that we should give more aid to Africa, which should help its health service and train its nurses to cure the sicknesses and diseases that we deplore, when it is actually subsidising our health service by sending nurses to this country who, despite the measures that the Minister referred to, end up employed in the NHS?
</p>





<p><a name="st_7"><a name="50712-01_spnew5"><b> Ms Winterton: </b> 
 We are the only developed country that has an ethical international recruitment policy. There are about 150 countries from which we do not actively recruit, including all the sub-Saharan African countries. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will agree that it is difficult for us to stop people applying for jobs in this country and to prevent them from coming here. All sorts of human rights issues would be raised if we were to do that. However, we are clear that the NHS 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>12 Jul 2005 : Column 683</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>does not actively recruit in developing countries that say they have problems, and we have recently extended that to cover the independent health care sector as well.
</p>





<p><a name="st_8"><a name="50712-01_spnew6"><b> Paul Clark  (Gillingham)</b> 
 (Lab): I welcome the Minister&#039;s response as there is a need for a strong recruitment code in the NHS in respect of developing countries. Does she agree that there is a need for the NHS to share its expertise with such countries and those that are developing their own services? To that end, will she welcome the work of the Kent and Medway strategic health authority, which is currently hosting 10 Iraqi psychiatrists with the aim of enhancing their skills and knowledge, so that they can return to Iraq to develop their own home-grown mental health services?
</p>





<p><a name="st_9"><a name="50712-01_spnew7"><b> Ms Winterton: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is absolutely right on two points. First, many people who come to this country to work in the NHS return to their own countries, taking with them new skills and expertise. Indeed, many Governments encourage workers from their countries to do that. Secondly, the NHS has many contacts with international organisations and other countries to help to train people and improve their expertise. I have met the 10 Iraqi psychiatrists to whom my hon. Friend referred, so I congratulate his trust on facilitating that programme by working with the Department of Health. The programme was greatly dependent on the commitment of Dr. Sadik, who initiated it. It will make a real difference to the development of services in Iraq and I know how much the psychiatrists appreciate the work that is being done.
</p>





<p><a name="st_10"><a name="50712-01_spnew8"><b> Dr. Evan Harris  (Oxford, West and Abingdon)</b> 
 (LD): I hope that the Minister will accept that I recognise the difficulties that she faces in controlling the flow, given what she said. Has she considered the British Medical Association&#039;s argument that there could be some form of restitution to countries? We know how many nurses are coming in from these countries, albeit not through active recruitment by the NHS, so could we not propose a scheme through which NHS workers could be funded on NHS salaries to volunteer&#151;I think that they would be willing to do so&#151;to go out in equal numbers to compensate those countries and provide their skills?
</p>





<p><a name="st_11"><a name="50712-01_spnew9"><b> Ms Winterton: </b> 
 An active programme of work is under way to do just that. The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right that it is important for us to help developing countries to develop their health care systems in exactly that way. Much of the work is carried out through the Department for International Development, which recently put about &#163;580 million into assisting the development of health care systems. DFID has worked jointly with the Department of Health and volunteers from the NHS. Some 40 per cent. of NHS trusts now have international links to allow volunteers to go to other countries and join in with Government-funded programmes, which are proving to be extremely successful.
</p>





<p><a name="st_12"><a name="50712-01_spnew10"><b> Mr. John Baron  (Billericay)</b> 
 (Con): Although we recognise that this is a difficult area and that some progress has been made, there is no shortage of evidence to suggest that much more still needs to be done. For example, more than 10,000 work permits were granted 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>12 Jul 2005 : Column 684</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>last year to health workers from more than 80 countries on the Department of Health&#039;s proscribed list. No wonder the BMA has called on the Government to end the rape of the world&#039;s poorest countries. Given that the NHS is only commended to use recruitment agencies that comply with its code of practice, will the Government take a further step forward and give their policy real teeth by banning the NHS from using recruitment agencies that have not signed up to the code of practice?
</p>





<p><a name="st_13"><a name="50712-01_spnew11"><b> Ms Winterton: </b> 
 We do&#151;absolutely. Let me explain. Virtually everyone in the independent provider sector recently signed up to the code of practice. It is clear that if NHS employers find out that a trust has employed someone who has been recruited through an agency that has actively recruited in a developing country on the list of banned countries for recruitment, the agency will be removed from the trust&#039;s list. That extremely important development has taken place recently.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50712-01_para1">
<a name="stpa_1">Returning to the question of work permits, I should say that the policy was changed recently so that work permits could not be extended from the time of training. For example, if people have work permits for the period during which they are training as doctors, they are expected to return to their home countries and reapply for a permit if they wish to work full time for the NHS. The changed work permit policy thus reflects some concerns expressed about people moving from training straight into full-time employment in the NHS. As I have explained, we continue to keep the policy under review, but the many recent changes have led to a 28 per cent. fall in the number of nurses recruited from South Africa, for example.

 May I add my tribute to all our NHS staff who   performed with such heroism last Thursday, and also to the staff and members of the British Medical Association, who gave immediate help to those injured in Tavistock square? I am sure that the whole House will join me in thanking them for their outstanding work.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50712-02_para0">
<a name="stpa_2">By 2008, we will be investing in an extra 900,000 MRI scans for NHS patients, doubling the number performed last year. About a quarter of the total number of scans will be carried out by the independent sector, all of them for NHS patients, free at the point of use.
</p>

 I thank my right hon. Friend for that reply. What would she say to the chief executive of the University hospital of North Durham, who wrote to me recently saying that the new MRI scanner in his hospital is considerably underemployed and has been for some time, and that if the money given to the private sector company, Alliance Medical, had been directed to the hospital, he could have increased the number of scans and reduced the waiting list to zero?

<a name="stpa_4">Is not this the economics of the madhouse, or is it simple ideological dogma to increase capacity in the private sector when there is underutilised capacity in the NHS, and when my constituents have to travel 30 miles to access private health care in Middlesbrough?

<p><a name="st_16"><a name="50712-02_spnew1"><b> Ms Hewitt: </b> 
 I say to my hon. Friend, and through him to the chief executive, that it is not a question of choosing between NHS hospital capacity and independent sector capacity. We need both to reduce the unacceptable waiting times for scans and to meet our target of a maximum of 18 weeks from GP referral to hospital treatment by 2008.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50712-02_para3">
<a name="stpa_5">Furthermore, well before 2008, but certainly by then, University hospital of North Durham will need to use its capacity to the full, either by employing extra staff&#151;and there is a shortage of radiologists and radiographers, which we are investing to overcome&#151;or by making even more effective use of the NHS staff that it has. By 2008, NHS and other centres will provide an extra half a million MRI scans. The funding for that extra capacity is already pledged in the system.
</p>





<p><a name="st_17"><a name="50712-02_spnew2"><b> Julia Goldsworthy  (Falmouth and Camborne)</b> 
 (LD): The use of the private sector is designed to cut waiting times. The NHS chief executive, Nigel Crisp, said in a recent meeting with MPs that he was confident that by 2008 the NHS will meet the target of no one waiting more than 18 weeks. As the Government do not routinely collect data on waiting times for diagnostic tests, will the Secretary of State undertake to publish the information on waiting times that enables the Department to be confident that the target will be met?
</p>





<p><a name="st_18"><a name="50712-02_spnew3"><b> Ms Hewitt: </b> 
 The target for 2008 starts with the GP referral and ends with the hospital treatment. It will therefore involve measuring and reducing the hidden waiting times, which were never counted by the Conservatives, for diagnostics. By March next year at the latest, we are confident that the maximum wait for a CT or MRI scan will be 26 weeks. By March 2007, the maximum wait for all scans will be no more than 13 weeks. We are making good progress and can see the benchmarks. As more information becomes available, we will, of course, publish it.

 (Lab): My right hon. Friend may recall that I raised this question with the Prime Minister some months ago, and I echo entirely the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for North Durham (Mr. Jones). Luton and Dunstable hospital is in the same situation. If my right hon. Friend is concerned to maximise the use of scans, why is funding not being provided to the hospital so that it can staff its own scanners, which are coming on stream?
</p>





<p><a name="st_20"><a name="50712-02_spnew5"><b> Ms Hewitt: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is aware that we have more than doubled our investment in the NHS. By 2008, that funding will have increased to an unprecedented &#163;92 billion a year. That includes additional funding for MRI scans and the other diagnostics that are needed.
</p>

<b>12 Jul 2005 : Column 686</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>The additional capacity for MRI and other scans that is being made available to NHS patients from the independent sector is over and above what the NHS can provide. That is made possible in particular by using radiologists and other staff from other parts of Europe and South Africa to supplement the staff available to the NHS in our country. It is good news for NHS patients that we are cutting the MRI waiting times.

 The Government have delivered record increases in investment for the NHS&#151;funding that has been used to deliver substantial improvements across a range of services. In 2003&#150;04, the NHS recorded a small surplus of &#163;73 million. In the same year, 204 NHS trusts were in financial balance or had a surplus and 65 trusts posted a deficit.

 The Secretary of State will know that many NHS trusts and primary care trusts, particularly those that do badly out of the funding formula, have been able to reach NHS targets and deliver improved levels of care only by running up substantial financial deficits.

There are enormous and unprecedented amounts of money going into the NHS. The reforms that we are making to the system, including money following the patient as patients are enabled to exercise greater choice and control over their health care, will improve patient safety and care rather than damage it.

I will look at the specific situation of the hon. Gentleman&#039;s trust and write to him about that.

<a name="stpa_7">This is an important issue for many those hospitals. In 2003&#150;04, 106 NHS bodies ended the year in deficit, up from 71 the year before. Can the Secretary of State say how many NHS bodies were in deficit at the end of the 2004&#150;05 financial year? She says that much more money has gone into the NHS&#151;but as we need more capacity in the NHS, can she explain why front-line services are being cut not just in Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire, but in Leeds, Bradford, South Teesside, Suffolk, Hampshire, Surrey, Sussex and Cornwall?

<p><a name="st_33"><a name="50712-02_spnew17"><b> Ms Hewitt: </b> 
 All over the country national health services and care for patients have been improving, compared with what we inherited in 1997. I note that eight years ago there were 384 people waiting in Hinchingbrooke Health Care Trust for more than nine months. Today, that figure is zero. With regard to 2004&#150;05, we are anticipating a deficit of around &#163;140 million. That is the total picture. It is around 0.2 per cent. of the total NHS budget. It will be considerably more serious than that for individual trusts, but we will not publish the details of which trusts are in deficit until the 2004&#150;05 figures have been audited.

<p><a name="st_34"><a name="50712-02_spnew18"><b> Mr. Lansley: </b> 
 There are two essential questions: where is all the money going, and does the Secretary of State know how bad the problem is? The National Audit Office said that auditors expressed concern about the financial standing of one third of NHS trusts. A dozen strategic health authorities are reported to have overspent in the last financial year. Leaving aside the net figure of &#163;140 million that she has just cited, what does the right hon.

I have received reports that that figure has more than doubled, and that it is &#163;800 million in 2004&#150;05.

Listening to that exchange, it occurred to me that one problem that is not discussed, particularly by the two Front-Bench teams, is the fact that since 1975 there have been 27 reorganisations of the national health service. What people want most of all is a settlement. When people paint the Forth bridge, they normally finish the job before they start again. Under both Tory and Labour Governments we have altered the NHS. When a new Minister comes in, he undoes what his predecessor did&#151;but what patients want above all else is a settlement and an agreement.

<p><a name="st_47"><a name="50712-03_spnew7"><b> Mr. Byrne: </b> 
 The new contract underpins some important changes in primary care. As I outlined, that care involves better and faster treatment, as well as delivering more specialisms and wider services locally. Part of the reason for ensuring that registrations are often with practices as opposed to individuals is that more GPs are engaging in sub-specialisms. There are now 1,400 GPs with a sub-specialism. We promised to deliver 1,000 under the NHS plan by 2004, and we achieved the target a year early.

<a name="stpa_8">It is worth pointing out that, before the new GP contract was introduced, fewer than 5 per cent. of GPs provided their own out-of-hours cover.

The fact that 99.9 per cent. of people see a GP within 48 hours or a primary care professional within 24 hours is due to the new contract. Achievement in the quality in outcomes framework exceeds 95 per cent. Again, that is down to the new contract. Those changes are important. I am sure that that is why the chair of the British Medical Association&#039;s General Practitioners Committee said:

The Department of Health has made it clear that primary care trusts must fulfil national quality requirements when they put arrangements in place.

 The Department of Health collects figures on operations that have been cancelled for non-clinical reasons on either the day of admission to hospital or after admission, on the day when the patient is admitted.

 Is not the Minister remotely ashamed of the figures that she has just announced, given the human misery that they represent? Does she realise how upsetting it is for hospital staff to have to ring people on the day of a cancelled operation to say that they should not come in, despite their acutely painful condition? Does she appreciate the trouble that it causes the people involved, who might well have suffered a sleepless night and made extensive arrangements with their friends and family to cover their time in hospital? Does she not accept that the Government&#039;s focus on targets, targets, targets, instead of clinical priorities makes those figures so shameful?

That figure is still higher than the national average, but her local staff&#151;whom I hope she will support&#151;are working on the issue of bed management within the local trust. One of the difficulties has involved increased admissions through accident and emergency units. The purpose of the work is to ensure that people are discharged early from hospital and not kept there inappropriately, and that there are no inappropriate admissions through A and E. I would have thought that the hon. Lady would congratulate her local NHS staff on that work, because they are working very hard to give the highest quality services to patients.

<p><a name="st_66"><a name="50712-04_spnew6"><b> Mr. McFadden: </b> 
 I thank the Secretary of State for her reply. Does she agree that, where choice has been introduced so far&#151;for example, in offering patients a shorter waiting time in exchange for having their operation done somewhere other than their local hospital&#151;it has been a success? Does she also agree that, while choice will not operate in exactly the same way in the public and private sectors, it is essential that as the Government increase investment in the NHS to record levels, it should be matched by the empowerment of patients to ensure that they have increased control over the timing, nature and location of their treatment?

<p><a name="st_67"><a name="50712-04_spnew7"><b> Ms Hewitt: </b> 
 I entirely agree with my hon. Friend. Patients are telling us very clearly that they want more choice and more control over their health care. We can see the policy of increased patient choice working very well in the city of Wolverhampton in my hon. Friend&#039;s constituency. For example, since the beginning of this year, patients there have had a choice of two or more hospitals for cataract operations, which has helped to bring the maximum waiting time for such operations down to three months, four years ahead of the target that we set in the NHS plan. Similarly, since April, NHS patients in Wolverhampton have had a choice of two or more hospitals for heart treatment and cardiac surgery, which improves the quality of care available to them.

 The commitment that we have made in relation to choice, such as the choice of four or more hospitals by the end of this year, applies specifically to in-patient treatment. As my hon.

There is a much wider agenda, however, to ensure that people with depression and other mental illnesses can exercise more choice and control over their treatment, for instance by having a range of different therapies available to them.

 Following the negotiation of the new GP contract, primary care trusts are making available to patients and users a range of out-of-hours services, including those provided by our ambulance service and emergency care practitioners.

That is why it is essential that primary care trusts in the right hon. Gentleman&#039;s constituency and elsewhere ensure that there is proper provision for out-of-hours service.

Given that professional psychiatrists were not allowed to sit on the appraisal panel and that the advice of those who sent the panel evidence has been ignored, will the Government intervene immediately and insist that the drugs be prescribed to these vulnerable people on the NHS without delay?

<p><a name="st_82"><a name="50712-05_spnew1"><b> Jane Kennedy: </b> 
 The original assessment of the drugs, issued in 2001, still applies, and patients already receiving them will continue to do so. NICE employs a very transparent process for the appraisal of drugs. It gives stakeholders, including patients&#039; groups such as those that the hon. Gentleman mentioned, an opportunity to make representations on the economic model as well as commenting on the proposals themselves. I would expect NICE to take careful account of all such comments before making its final appraisal.

 (Lab): I am grateful to the Minister for that information, but I remind her that last week was Alzheimer&#039;s awareness week. Many Members will have visited local Alzheimer&#039;s societies, as I did. There is considerable apprehension as they await NICE&#039;s decision, which I understand is imminent. May I ask the Minister again to use whatever influence she has to try to ensure that those drugs remain available to Alzheimer&#039;s sufferers on the NHS?
</p>





<p><a name="st_84"><a name="50712-05_spnew3"><b> Jane Kennedy: </b> 
 As I said last time the subject was raised, NICE has an international reputation. It will decide on the form of its final guidance taking account of all views expressed to it as part of the consultation, and we trust it to make informed, fully considered recommendations on the drugs. I know that there will be intense interest in the matter, and I am sure that we shall return to it in the future.

<p><a name="st_85"><a name="50712-05_spnew4"><b> Sandra Gidley  (Romsey)</b>

If, as is 

<br>&nbsp;<br>

<p><a name="st_86"><a name="50712-05_spnew5"><b> Jane Kennedy: </b> 
 I do not accept the premise on which the hon. Lady&#039;s question is based. I repeat that the existing guidance, produced in 2001, remains in place until the final guidance has been issued. She should not jump to conclusions about what that final guidance should be. We should wait and allow NICE to take its time, and to reach a decision on the proper advice and guidance that it will issue in due course.

 Waiting times for referrals other than those made by a general practitioner are not collected centrally.

 I am pleased to say&#151;perhaps the hon. Gentleman did not listen to my earlier reply&#151;that we are doing something about it. We are able to introduce for patients a wait of no longer than 18 weeks from first referral to treatment, which means that we can cut out the hidden waiting lists that often emerge within our health system.

<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0">That leave be given to bring in a Bill to amend the Computer Misuse Act 1990; and for connected purposes.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50712-05_para3">
<a name="stpa_0">In moving this motion, may I first of all pay tribute to the work undertaken by the all-party group on the internet, which carried out a thorough review of the Computer Misuse Act 1990, and whose recommendations form the basis of the Bill that I present today? I want particularly to thank my hon. Friend the Member for Sittingbourne and Sheppey (Derek Wyatt). He presented a similar Bill to the House in March of this year, but in the end it was defeated by the timetable for the general election.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50712-05_para4">
<a name="stpa_1">My Bill will revise the 1990 Act to take account of commitments made in European instruments in respect of combating and effectively punishing attacks against computers, and it will update the Act in other areas. It will amend section 1(3) to increase the term of imprisonment for a related offence from six months to two years. It will amend section 3(7) to increase the term of imprisonment for a further related offence from five years to 10 years. It will amend section 3 in order to clarify that all means of interference with a computer system are criminalised. And in particular it will ensure that adequate provision is made to criminalise all forms of denial-of-service attacks. It will also give effect to article 6(l)(a)(i) of the convention on cybercrime, which requires criminalisation of the distribution of, or making available of, a computer password through which a computer system is capable of being accessed, with intent to commit an offence.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50712-05_para5">
<a name="stpa_2">This Bill will, I hope, meet with the House&#039;s approval. It contains only six clauses, has no financial implications, implements measures that have been approved by Ministers and Parliament and is, I hope, relatively simple. As last year&#039;s report by the all-party group on the internet demonstrates, these measures already have cross-party support. I trust this will remain the case after I finish my speech. As the report pointed out and as every Member of this House will doubtless accept, the worldwide web has changed out of all recognition in the past 15 years, as has the nature of cybercrime. The media like to imagine that hacking, virus proliferation and denial-of-service attacks using e-mail are the product of bright but lonely and socially challenged teenagers sitting in their bedrooms. That is an outdated, inaccurate and, I think, dangerous notion. Those who regularly and increasingly hold website operators to ransom are more likely to be members of an organised crime syndicate than the school computer club. It is time that cyber crime was recognised for the serious crime that it is.

<a name="stpa_3">Following the recent sentencing of teenager Joseph James McElroy to 200 hours of community service for breaking into a US Government laboratory system, detective chief superintendent Len Hynds, the former head of the national hi-tech crime unit, called on the Government and the courts to reform sentencing policy

</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50712-05_para7">
<a name="stpa_4">My Bill seeks to specify a new offence of denial of service. A denial-of-service attack occurs when a deliberate attempt is made to stop a computer performing. Examples include attempts to flood a network, thereby preventing legitimate network traffic; attempts to disrupt the connections between two machines, thereby preventing access to a service; attempts to prevent a particular individual from accessing a service; and attempts to disrupt services to a specific system or person.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50712-05_para8">
<a name="stpa_5">Denial-of-service attacks can essentially disable one&#039;s computer or one&#039;s network. Some denial-of-service attacks can be executed with limited resources against a large, sophisticated site. For example, an attacker with an old PC and a slow modem may yet be able to disable much faster and more sophisticated machines or networks. One form of such attack could mean a large number of remote computers being orchestrated to attack a target at the same time. In some cases, the attacks overwhelm the connecting links to a machine rather than the machine itself. That can result in significant collateral damage that extends beyond the machine being attacked. Denial-of-service attacks are extremely common on today&#039;s internet. At the lower end of effectiveness, the blips in traffic are hardly noticeable, but we are told of cases at the other end in which large university networks have been made unusable for hours at a time.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50712-05_para9">
<a name="stpa_6">The chief constable of Greater Manchester, Michael Todd, was bombarded with thousands of threatening e-mails in a denial-of-service attack shortly before the   May Day bank holiday this year. At one point, 2000 e-mails were being sent every hour. The purpose of the attack was to crash the force&#039;s computer systems through the volume of e-mails being sent. Cambridgeshire police were subject to a similar denial-of-service attack almost two years ago, when thousands of spam e-mails told recipients that their credit cards were about to be charged for an iPod that they had purchased unless they phoned a customer service number. The customer service number turned out to be the switchboard at Cambridgeshire police, which was deluged by thousands of people who had received the hoax e-mail. Closer to home, a gun control website contacted me two years ago to complain that one of my constituents, a gun enthusiast, had bombarded the site with so many e-mails over a short period of time that their server had crashed.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50712-05_para10">
<a name="stpa_7">The Computer Misuse Act 1990 came into force on 29 August 1990 and specifies offences for attacks against computer systems or data. Criminal denial-of-service attacks are regularly made on gambling websites both in the United Kingdom and elsewhere. Such attacks are invariably accompanied by demands for amounts between &#163;10,000 and more than &#163;100,000 in order to make the attacks stop. The impact on gambling businesses has been severe. The national hi-tech crime unit has become involved in the investigations, but the perpetrators are believed to be based abroad, which sets some limits on what can be achieved quickly.

<p>
<a name="50712-05_para11">
<a name="stpa_8">The second part of the Bill deals with the length of sentences. At present, offences under section 1 of the Computer Misuse Act 1990 can be dealt with only in a magistrates court, where the maximum penalty is six months in prison and/or a fine of &#163;5,000. A conviction in a higher court currently applies only to offences defined in sections 2 and 3 of the Computer Misuse Act. In those cases, the maximum penalty is five years in prison or an unlimited fine.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50712-05_para12">
<a name="stpa_9">By increasing the tariff on these crimes, the House would be sending a message to the courts and the public prosecution service that these crimes must be taken seriously and that, where appropriate, custodial sentences must be applied. Home Office figures show that, when an offence under the Computer Misuse Act is the principal offence with which someone is charged, only about a third of those found guilty are given custodial sentences. When such an offence is not the principal offence, the proportion is very small indeed.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50712-05_para13">
<a name="stpa_10">It is regularly claimed that the cost of cleaning up virus or worm attacks runs into billions of pounds. The current level of sentences does not reflect the seriousness of such offences. This Bill would therefore raise the maximum sentence for a conviction under section 1 of the 1990 Act to two years. That would have a number of indirect benefits. It would make an offender subject to extradition procedures, and also make it possible to prosecute for a criminal attempt, even where such an attempt had not succeeded.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50712-05_para14">
<a name="stpa_11">Before I conclude, I wish to draw the House&#039;s attention to a recent NOP survey conducted on behalf of the national hi-tech crime unit. It estimates that the minimum cost of the impact of high-tech crime on UK-based companies with more than 1,000 employees is no less than &#163;2.5 billion every year.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50712-05_para15">
<a name="stpa_12">As the worldwide web grows both in size and in its influence on all our daily lives, the threats posed to all of us by cybercrime also grow. Although high-profile denial-of-service attacks have been made against e-commerce and, especially, gambling sites, the UK Government and the country&#039;s critical infrastructure are also vulnerable. It is essential that we have a law in place to make prosecution possible when offences are committed, because that will send the strong and unambiguous message that e-crime will be treated with the utmost seriousness.

That this House commends the Parliamentary Ombudsman and the Citizens Advice Bureau on their reports on Tax Credits; notes with concern their conclusions that many thousands of low income families are suffering financial hardship as a result of the serious problems with the administration of tax credits; further notes the huge cost to the taxpayer of these problems; calls on the Government to implement as soon as possible all the Ombudsman&#039;s recommendations to improve the tax credit administration; in particular calls on the Government to adopt the Ombudsman&#039;s recommendation to set up a statutory test for recovery of excess payments of tax credits consistent with the test that is currently applied to social security benefits, with the right of appeal to an independent tribunal and calls on HM Revenue and Customs to suspend all recovery of tax credit overpayments until this reform has been completed; and calls on the Chancellor of the Exchequer to explain the Government&#039;s failure to provide low income families with the service they deserve; and requests that he conduct a fundamental review of the structure and administration of tax credits, as recommended by the Ombudsman.
<br>



<p><a name="st_5">This is my first opportunity in the House to express my sadness and sorrow to the victims of last week&#039;s murderous bombs, and to the injured who continue to suffer. I have just seen pictures on the television news of those who died. That brings home in a very graphic way how many lives have been so cruelly snatched away from us. I think that is an appropriate opening to an Opposition day debate, as democratic debate must continue undaunted.</p>





<p><a name="st_6">Today&#039;s debate is about people like Mr. Crow and his family, from Dover. They have two kids, a mortgage and no spare cash. Mr. Crow recently took a job as a carer, and became entitled to tax credits. When his pay rose, he did what he was supposed to do, and informed the Inland Revenue. He was told that the increase in his pay was to be disregarded. A year later, he has been told that he has been overpaid and that he now must pay back the difference. His working tax credit has been reduced from &#163;35 a week to &#163;2.44 for the entire month. That family has been forced to go into debt or lose their home.</p>





<p><a name="st_7">This debate is also about people like my constituent Helen Thompson, a single mother. She contacted the helpline and was told that she could keep an overpayment of &#163;3,000, even though she had offered to pay it back immediately. Out of the blue, the Revenue demanded that money back, with the result that she could not meet her child care costs. She faced losing her job, and only the intervention of my constituency office caused the Revenue to change its position.</p>





<p><a name="st_8">This debate is also about people like the lone parent in the report by Citizens Advice, who received no tax credit payments whatsoever for the last few weeks of the financial year. She had to resort to Salvation Army food parcels to feed her children.</p>

<p><a name="st_9">Every Member of the House knows that, sadly, those are not isolated examples. Citizens Advice handled 150,000 cases in the last year alone. The parliamentary ombudsman now spends a quarter of her time on tax credit cases, and the Revenue has recently admitted to me in writing that it is dealing with 51,000 complaints, 9,000 of which were referred to it by Members.</p>

In his constituency alone, &#163;2.9 million was overpaid to people he represents. If he is happy with that record, so be it; I do not think he should be. On child poverty, I know that he likes to do his homework so perhaps he should read the report from the Institute for Fiscal Studies, &quot;Poverty and Inequality in Britain: 2005&quot;, produced earlier this year, which states that owing to the administrative problems with the new tax credits there was an increase in child poverty by 90,000 after housing costs and 80,000 before housing costs.

The Government are committed to halving child poverty by the end of the decade and to abolishing it in a generation. Is the Conservative party committed, like the Government, to the abolition of child poverty and to halving child poverty by the end of the decade? It is a simple question: yes or no?

He made them complicated and intrusive&#151;no one else. He presided over his own Department&#039;s errors and incompetence&#151;no one else. Yet when it comes to admitting his mistakes, it is anyone else but the Chancellor. When it comes to explaining how the Government are sorting our his fiasco, it is anyone else but the Chancellor.

 The hon. Gentleman mentioned figures of 50,000 or 150,000 complaints. My understanding of tax credits is that they have helped&#151;or changed the income of, to put it in more neutral terms for his purposes&#151;6 million families. With a back-of-an-envelope calculation, that suggests an administrative problem of about 3 per cent. on his figures. The Government admit in their amendment to the Opposition motion that there are administrative problems. All hon. Members admit that there are administrative problems. First, will he say what percentage of administrative problems he thinks is acceptable for any Department? Secondly, to change the focus, will he say whether he supports tax credits, because he is arguing that they are putting families into poverty, yet his own motion does not pursue the logic of that and suggest that they should be abolished?

 Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman will catch your eye later, so that he can explain that the error rate is not 3 per cent. He should consider his own constituency. Of the 8,200 tax credit awards there, 1,100 were unpaid and 2,600 were overpaid. That is very considerably more than 3 per cent. Indeed, in total, the overpaid and underpaid awards come to almost half the entire tax credit awards in the country. We are not talking about small amounts of administrative error.

 The hon. Gentleman has obviously not listened to the earlier exchanges. Of course any party that believes in a civilised and compassionate society wants to reduce child poverty. The point of the debate is that many tens of thousands of families have been plunged into child poverty as a result of the tax credit system fiasco. If he has not yet become aware of that in the couple of months that he has been a Member of Parliament, I suggest that he hold more constituency surgeries and he will discover what is going on in his constituency.

At the height of the crisis, there were 1.7 million attempts in a single day to contact the Revenue helpline&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i> The hon. Member for Normanton is muttering. I suspect that he had a special phone line in the Treasury when he was working there, but none of the 1.7 million people who were trying to contact the Revenue got hold of his number&#151;perhaps they would have shouted all sorts of abuse at him if they had.

<a name="stpa_29">What hundreds of thousands of low-income families want to know is not how the Government got into the mess but how they are going to get out of it. That is the second issue.

It was at least a recognition that we were no longer dealing with teething problems. I welcome those proposals&#151;for example, making the award notices more intelligible and improving the helpline service&#151;but frankly the reforms go neither far nor fast enough.

<a name="stpa_30">Citizens Advice agrees with that, as the Paymaster General knows. It explains that even the modest proposed changes could take up to 18 months to implement.

The Chief Secretary should confirm&#151;I assume by his presence that he is now in charge of tax credit policy&#151;that the Government are going to implement in full the 12 specific recommendations in the parliamentary ombudsman&#039;s report.

Indeed, we are now told&#151;perhaps the Chief Secretary can confirm this&#151;that 98 per cent. of overpaid tax credits have been automatically reclaimed. Is that correct?

I am happy to confirm that the system has been performing well in terms of speed and availability for that period. There were, of course, well-publicised problems&#151;we will come on to deal with some of them&#151;in the early days when the system did not perform as expected. With a system of this size and complexity, there are occasional glitches, but I am happy to refute the assertion that my right hon. Friend the Paymaster General misled the House.

There is, however a long-standing principle that official error requires both a mistake on the part of the Revenue and reasonable belief on the part of the claimant that they were being paid the right amount.

The family credit system that we inherited had several problems, as identified in the 1998 report on work incentives by Martin Taylor. In particular, four areas gave us considerable concern: first, it acted as a disincentive to finding work; secondly, it was an insufficiently generous award; thirdly, it was fundamentally inflexible and unable to take into account changes in circumstances; and fourthly, it gave too little assistance with the costs of child care provision.

<a name="stpa_66">In an economy in which people move between jobs more often, and in which their circumstances change more quickly, our challenge is to adjust child tax credits to respond to changing income patterns as quickly as possible. I should like to put that challenge into context. Three million people shift jobs each year in the United Kingdom labour market, and their income changes are often substantial. In addition, some 700,000 children are born each year, each of whom receives a rate of tax credit in accordance with their individual family circumstances. This fast-moving environment requires a balance between flexibility and certainty, while avoiding undue complexity and information overload.

<a name="50712-10_para14">
<a name="stpa_67">That is why one of the decisions that we took at the outset&#151;after consultation, I might say&#151;was to set a disregard for increased income up to &#163;2,500. Claimants do not have to tell Her Majesty&#039;s Revenue and Customs if their income rises in one year by less than &#163;2,500 and, importantly, if their award is not affected by such a change. This allows a cushion, provides incentives and spares people who see some changes in income unnecessary paperwork. It has been suggested&#151;I think that the hon.

That is a bit like describing the personal tax allowance as a failure to collect income tax. It is simply not the case.

<a name="stpa_68">Our families need flexible support such as this to help with the demands of the modern globalised labour market. Tax credits have made a real contribution to halving child poverty by 2010, and to the successful performance of our labour markets, which are the envy of the world. Because of this contribution, those who criticise tax credits need to make clear whether they actually support the stated policy. They must make a choice between a less responsive system that cannot respond to changes in income&#151;which admittedly would be easier to run&#151;or the current approach, which can respond but generates greater complexity.

If they believe that the idea of tax credits is wrong, they should say so. We could then debate the positive and negative impacts of that policy along appropriate lines.

 Much of the debate so far has focused on the incidence and consequences of overpayments. We should not, however, neglect the issue of underpayments. Given that in the hundreds of thousands of such cases there has necessarily been an increase in hardship and indebtedness, will the Chief Secretary confirm that in each and every case, when people get their due, the payment of commercial interest on top will be included as a minimum and, better still, the payment of a substantial sum in compensation for distress and anxiety caused?
</p>





<p><a name="st_81"><a name="50712-11_spnew1"><b> Mr. Browne: </b> 
 I cannot give the hon. Gentleman that undertaking, although I accept entirely why he should ask for it and think that that payment should be made to those who have been underpaid. Underpayments are much rarer than overpayments, however. People are much more likely to report changes in circumstances that they think will result in an increase in their tax credit than it appears that they are to do the opposite. That is why the retrospective balancing needs to be done at the end of the year. My information is that the system reacts quickly to such claims of changes in income circumstances, and that there is no necessity for us to build into it a system of compensation when the Revenue already has a compensation mechanism that can be triggered as appropriate.
</p>





<p><a name="st_82"><a name="50712-11_spnew2"><b> John Bercow: </b> 
 I shall have a second stab at a different aspect of the issue. The Chief Secretary had a spat earlier with my hon. Friend the shadow Chancellor and the hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Laws) on the issue of the responsibility of the claimant to know if he or she was being overpaid. Does he agree, as he is part of the architect team for the policy, that there is a difference between someone who, by computer error, finds that he is paid &#163;20,000 for the year rather than &#163;2,000, and someone who is paid perhaps a few hundred pounds more?

I will come in due course to the implementation of the proposals made by my right hon. Friend the Paymaster General on 26 May. There is a recognition that communication between the Tax Credit Office and the claimant is important, and we are taking steps to improve that. I accept that there are circumstances in which the onus ought to fall more on the Tax Credit Office than on the individual, but since the likelihood of underpayment more probably arises from a reduction in a person&#039;s income, that information is more likely to be known to the claimant than to the Tax Credit Office, and the onus ought to rest firmly on the claimant to report that change of circumstance. I am sure that he understands that this is not a straightforward matter, and that it is yet another one of the complexities that flexibility generates.

Tax credits have played their role in helping parents move into work. There is clear evidence from respected independent commentators such as, ironically, the Institute for Fiscal Studies that our policies to make work pay have helped to boost the number of lone parents in work and, consequently, to lift a significant number of children out of poverty. How can anyone seriously seek to undermine a policy that contributes to such improvements?

<a name="stpa_73">My right hon. Friend the Paymaster General acknowledged the challenges faced by the tax credit system in her statement to the House on 26 May&#151;before, I should add, the publication of the reports that prompted the Opposition to table their motion. On that occasion, my right hon. Friend focused on six measures to improve the operation of the tax credit system.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50712-11_para4">
<a name="stpa_74">First, from April 2006 a much-improved awards notice will be issued, and we will review the information that we give claimants to help them to understand the system better. It is all very well for others to say that that will take time. Of course it will. We are dealing with millions of claimants and, potentially, millions of notices, and it is best to take the time and get the system right. Secondly, from this week we are running pilot schemes, contacting customers and encouraging them to report changes. That is relevant to what was said earlier about proactive engagement with claimants. Thirdly, we intend to improve the service from the helpline. We want to stop people from being passed from one department to another, and to ensure that they are given answers within a reasonable time. Fourthly, Her Majesty&#039;s Revenue and Customs will speed up its identification of IT system problems, which will mean quicker repairs. Fifthly, we will work more closely with the voluntary sector to give more active support to the most vulnerable claimants. Finally, we will spell out more clearly how we define hardship, and we are testing options for suspension of the recovery of disputed overpayments.

 In the case of one of my constituents, the payment award was correct but was withdrawn. Having contacted the helpline, my constituent was advised to contact the local Member of Parliament. I have heard of that practice anecdotally, and have been told of it by a constituent. Will the Chief Secretary confirm that that was the wrong advice, that the problem should have been resolved, and that the first point of resolution is not contacting the Member of Parliament?

If the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Stewart Hosie)&#151;or any other Members who are tempted to intervene to describe examples of such behaviour&#151;bring to my attention, or to the attention of my right hon.

If he brings to my attention the detail of such calls&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i> With due respect to the shadow Chancellor, the fact that something is in the report means nothing; it does not mean that it happened or that it is anything more than an anecdote. If it did indeed happen, it should not have, but it would help if those who have information supporting such assertions were to make it available. We have the advantage that these calls are recorded, and that the official who dealt with a particular call can therefore be identified. As a result, we can look at the circumstances of the relevant part of the conversation, and determine the advice given and whether it was properly understood by the caller. I am not disputing that the report says what it says; I am simply pointing out that if we are given the details of a particular case, we can chase it up.

<a name="stpa_76">All of the proposals put before the House in my right hon. Friend the Paymaster General&#039;s statement of 26 May are in hand. I will say, however, that the system has been through only one full cycle. By that, I mean one cycle in which people applied for the credits, were assessed and received them and had their accounts adjusted to reflect current circumstances&#151;in other words, only one cycle in which the flexibility of the system has been fully applied. The essence of the policy means that, across the system as a whole, there will necessarily be an element of overpayment and underpayment. As it is a system of retrospective adjustment, it shows the value of a flexible system.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50712-12_para1">
<a name="stpa_77">Let me reassure the House that two thirds of the total overpayment figure is due to rises in family income&#151;rises that the House should welcome as further evidence of labour market improvements and employment opportunities today. Nearly &#163;1 billion of the overpayment&#151;around half&#151;is due to increases in income of more than &#163;10,000 a year. In many such cases, Her Majesty&#039;s Revenue and Customs were notified not during the year, but at the end of the year for the reconciliation process. Clearly, our next challenge is to ensure that claimants inform us during the year of any changes to their circumstances on that scale. So while this is not a perfect system and we do want to make it work better, it is neither broken nor in chaos, as some commentators and Opposition Members may have claimed.

Friend the Paymaster General has decided that, subject to further review and consideration over coming months, the migration of the remaining families will begin during 2006.

 This important debate has so far not been very enlightening or useful. I hope that the Government&#039;s policy on tax credits will be a little clearer at the end of the debate than has been the case over the last 10 minutes. This debate is vital in holding the Government to account in respect of a policy area where there have been serious problems, and also because the administrative problems in the tax credit system have hit people on the lowest incomes in the country&#151;the very people whom the Government&#039;s policies are intended to help.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50712-13_para0">
<a name="stpa_82">The hon. Member for Normanton (Ed Balls) has been a big contributor in this policy area and many others. Given the problems of the last couple of years, I can quite understand why he would prefer to concentrate on the big picture rather than on the smaller one. He is entitled to raise some of the matters that he has raised, and I shall touch on some of them at the end of my remarks.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50712-13_para1">
<a name="stpa_83">The hon. Gentleman and the Chancellor introduced tax credits to help people on low incomes, so they must be worried about the problems that have been created. The book by Robert Peston&#151;in which I believe the hon. Gentleman played a part&#151;contains a passage from an interview with the Chancellor on tax credits. The thrust of the Chancellor&#039;s remarks is very similar to what the    hon. Gentleman said earlier. The right hon. Gentleman said:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_19">&quot;I think tax credits have been misunderstood. People have focused on the mechanism, a bureaucratic issue, when it is in the end about citizenship, integrating tax and benefits. In the long term, these will come to be accepted as part of the economic and social framework of the country.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50712-13_para2">
<a name="stpa_84">The Chancellor and the hon. Gentleman may well be right, but meanwhile people suffering from the system&#039;s endemic problems of overpayment and underpayment turn up at advice centres in every hon. Member&#039;s constituency. If the hon. Gentleman intends to give that answer to those who come to see him, I assure him that he will receive pretty short shrift.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50712-13_para3">
<a name="stpa_85">Ministers have been aware of the problems for many months, at least, and have made several statements in an attempt to resolve them, and I acknowledge that the Chief Secretary helpfully accepted a lot of interventions. However, he was depressingly unclear about which recommendations in the ombudsman&#039;s report have been accepted and which have not. When the Paymaster General winds up, I hope she will give a clear answer to that. In her 22 June statement, she gave the impression that she accepted the ombudsman&#039;s report in total. However, when we look at the detail we find that what she actually said was that she accepted the administrative changes proposed by the ombudsman. She did not say that she accepted all the recommendations, and it is of course the non-administrative changes that are the most significant. I thought we were making progress when the Chief Secretary indicated about 10 minutes ago that the Government accepted the ombudsman&#039;s second recommendation. I am happy to take an intervention from the right hon. Gentleman if he wants to clarify that 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>12 Jul 2005 : Column 725</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>point. The recommendation is crucial and touches on whether the recovery mechanism for tax credit is lawful or whether it constitutes maladministration.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50712-13_para4">
<a name="stpa_86">The Chief Secretary clearly indicated that the Government would accept the ombudsman&#039;s second recommendation not to claw back overpayments until an assessment had been made, under the code of practice, of whether they should be clawed back. Now, under pressure, and with notes flying in various directions, the Chief Secretary has gone back on the commitment he made 10 minutes ago. I think all he was saying was that the Paymaster General visited the ombudsman recently and has indicated that she will publish a response to the ombudsman&#039;s report. The ombudsman has told me that she hopes to receive that response shortly. When the Paymaster General winds up the debate, will she confirm that that is the situation and, following the questions from Labour Back Benchers, may we have a clear statement about which of the ombudsman&#039;s recommendations have been accepted? The Government do not seem to have clearly accepted recommendations 2, 6, 10 and 11, yet they are the most important ones, so I hope the Paymaster General will make the situation clear.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50712-13_para5">
<a name="stpa_87">I want to focus on the administrative problems in the tax credit system first and then to make some more general comments in my conclusion. I began by expressing frustration that Ministers are taking so long to resolve the problem. There is frustration not just among Opposition Members but among groups, such as the citizens advice bureaux, which have a deep commitment to tackling child poverty and poverty in the working population. Before the debate, Citizens Advice published a briefing note, which is a good and powerful critique of the existing problems in the tax credit system. I am sorry that the Chief Secretary has not seen it. I shall certainly make sure that he does so after the debate. I shall read from the beginning of the document, which states:
</p>

</p>

<p>
<a name="50712-13_para7">
<a name="stpa_89">Citizens Advice picks out three points, and if the Paymaster General can give us any enlightenment about those it would be most welcome. Citizens Advice states:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_22">&quot;There has been no commitment to place an absolute limit on the amount that can be recovered from families who have been overpaid.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50712-13_para8">
<a name="stpa_90">We need clarification about that. Citizens Advice continues:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_23">&quot;The position regarding writing off overpayments remains confused&quot;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50712-13_para9">
<a name="stpa_91">which has certainly been confirmed by the exchanges in our debate today&#151;
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_24">&quot;as the onus remains on individual families to challenge the decision to recover, leaving unknown numbers of people repaying overpaid tax credits which may have resulted from Revenue errors.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50712-13_para10">
<a name="stpa_92">That was a problem that the ombudsman thought might mean that the recovery mechanisms were in breach of the law. She made it clear that at the very least she considered that it constituted maladministration, which alone is a serious enough assertion.

The people involved are obviously of meagre financial means and we have all had difficult, harrowing constituency cases with people not knowing whether the overpayments will be clawed back by the Government.

That is an enormous problem rate, especially when it comes to clawing back overpayments and paying out on underpayments.

The Chief Secretary said that he saw the disregard as the equivalent of the personal income tax allowance, but I profoundly disagree with that statement. The personal income tax allowance is the amount that the Government set so that people do not pay tax on the initial amount of their income. The &#163;2,500 disregard is designed purely to reduce the extent of the problem of endemic overpayment in such systems, which was seen in Australia years before the UK system was introduced. Of course it would be possible to get rid of most of the overpayments by having a much bigger disregard, of &#163;5,000, &#163;7,500 or &#163;10,000. The Government would be able to say that all the overpayment problems had disappeared, but all that would do is shift the problem from overpayments to the disregard.

 The hon. Gentleman mentioned the Australian experience. The Australians not only had a disregard system, but also realised that once they were in a hole it was best to stop digging, so they wrote off the overpayments up to 1,000 Australian dollars.

<p><a name="st_111"><a name="50712-14_spnew3"><b> Mr. Laws: </b> 
 The right hon. Gentleman is exactly right and has for may years taken a very close interest in the development of tax credits. He draws attention to the problems in Australia that led to an ombudsman&#039;s report there two years ago in which the ombudsman criticised the Australian tax credits system, saying that the system inherently led to a large number of debts, that the debts arising from the scheme were affecting lower-income families, that the debts could be unavoidable and that they seemed to have an unfair retrospective effect. He was also concerned about the manner in which the debts were being recovered. We now find that all those issues are confronting us in the United Kingdom. The Government must have been aware of all those issues when they devised their policy, but they have failed to address all of them with the relatively minor changes to their own policy, such as the disregard.

Thanks to the parliamentary questions that the Treasury has answered&#151;which is unusual on the subject of tax credits&#151;we now know that 65.5 million award notices have been sent out in just two and a quarter years, including 34 million award notices last year alone. All hon. Members will be familiar with the experience of constituents coming to advice centres to describe their problems and reaching into their bags to bring out sheaves of tax credit payment papers. On Saturday, I saw a constituent who had nine separate award notices that had been issued in seven weeks, all with entirely different amounts. That is part of the problem with the system, and it has helped to cause the confusion among individuals who must then anticipate whether or not their award is correct.

<a name="stpa_100">As the shadow Chancellor indicated, there has been a big rise in administrative costs. Four hundred staff have been allocated to handle complaints, and 3,200 staff are dealing with the dedicated helplines. There have been 21,600 compensation payments for bad service in the past year alone. The error rate in the system is 21.4 per cent. for the first year that we know of, as against a target of 10 per cent. and an error rate of 10 to 14 per cent. under the old system. Sir Nicholas Montagu, the then head of the Inland Revenue, told the Public Accounts Committee that he was confident that the error rate would be halved from that under the old system. What has happened instead is that it has doubled.

It is no wonder the tax credit administrators are struggling given that they must now make 271,000 separate judgments without any proper, statutory system of independent appeal. Although the Government&#039;s line on this seems to change from day to day, we have also been told that, so far, only &#163;37 million of the &#163;1.9 billion in overpayments has been written off, but the Treasury cannot tell us how much of the total overpayment has been recovered.

Does he not agree that, although it is right that we focus on these issues and sort them out, the fact that the take-up rate exceeds expectations shows that the system is working better than the old one and that it is worth sorting out those problems so that it can work better in the future?

Many organisations that are worried about the tax credits chaos have asked for a clearer award notice. They have suggested that the notice should contain clear information about the mechanism for appeals in the case of overpayment. I assume that she can confirm that she will be going ahead with a new award notice for 2006&#150;07, so will she place a copy of the draft award notice in the Library? Will further amendments be made to the award notice in the light of the ombudsman&#039;s recommendations?

Can we have a clear answer on whether the Government accept the case for a statutory right of independent appeal, or was the Chief Secretary accurate when he said that that had been ruled out?

On the first point in the submission by Citizens Advice, have the Government decided whether there will be a limit on the clawback of overpayments, which causes extreme poverty?

They said that in plain and simple terms.

The recommendation concerns whether the additional mechanism for recovering overpayments is lawful and, even if it is, whether it constitutes maladministration.

She maintains that the Government&#039;s existing position is lawful. That is not persuasive because the first argument that she advances is that the majority of overpayments are correctly repayable.

The effect of the Government&#039;s existing policy is that someone who has an overpayment through no fault of their own and entirely through the incompetence of the Inland Revenue will have that money reclaimed by the Government. They will then have to try to stop the reclaim. It is clear as well from the Paymaster General that the Treasury&#039;s position is not that there will be an automatic stop but that recovery can be suspended while the dispute is resolved. That there can be negotiation puts an entirely different gloss on the Government&#039;s policy.

It is not a glitch; it is almost life and death. I have had families in my constituency who thought that moving them into work would be a godsend. The figures showed that they would be better off, but they found most of the money snatched away, without any explanation or understanding why it was being removed from them. Worse than that, the system is such a treadmill that one cannot get off it: once one has claimed the credit, it has to run for the duration.

He could not afford bus fares to get to work and had to walk three miles to and from work every day. But because it was alleged that he had been overpaid, he could not sign off from tax credits and sign on for means-tested jobseeker&#039;s allowance as the office claimed that he had the money that took him over the eligibility threshold for the jobseeker&#039;s allowance. There was no escape for my constituent until the end of the claim period.

<a name="stpa_128">Let us be in no doubt about how important this benefit now is to our poorest constituents. More than a quarter of all claims are made by those on under &#163;13,000 a year, who comprise a third of the difficult cases. The problems&#151;the miscalculations, overpayments, underpayments and automatic clawings back&#151;disproportionately affect the poorest. We have to ask whether it is possible to run a system that operates over a time scale of 52 weeks while matching the needs of our poorest constituents, whose financial needs often change very quickly.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50712-17_para1">
<a name="stpa_129">Decades ago, this House debated a tax credits system proposed in a Green Paper by the Heath Government. Those of us in the poverty lobby thought it unworkable, because we had seen from America that one cannot marry a benefit system that operates on a weekly basis and a tax system that is cumulative over 52 weeks of the year. The huge innovation in that proposed tax credits system was to abolish the cumulative nature of individual taxation so that, far from operating over 52 weeks, it would operate on a weekly basis, with last week&#039;s income relating to this week&#039;s tax credit. The question is whether, unless we are prepared to be that radical in changing the nature of the tax system, we can ever have a system that delivers for our poorest constituents, who can most benefit from the wish that the Chancellor clearly has to abolish child poverty as we know it in our society.
</p>

<a name="50712-17_para2">
<a name="stpa_130">In moving towards that goal, there are three reforms in the ombudsman&#039;s report that I most want to hear the Government say that they have embraced. In the previous Parliament, I tabled an amendment to the Finance Bill that would have placed a duty on the Government to issue wage slips to everybody who draws tax credit so that they could understand how it had been computed. For one reason or another, the amendment was not called. If we are to empower our constituents, it is crucial that they know how their tax credit has been worked out so that they can quickly ring up when they think it is wrong.

The Chief Secretary to the Treasury is one of the Government&#039;s heavy hitters. I would normally say that, if we were in difficulties, we would send him out to bat for us.

She goes on to say that she, as a mere official, cannot possibly comment or provide a conclusion on whether the system is salvageable, but she continues by saying that it raises the most profound policy issues.

In many other European countries, the focus is on family poverty, and such a focus might have something to teach us in relation to the administration of tax credits.

<br>&nbsp;<br>poverty fell in 2003&#150;04 by only 100,000. I say &quot;only&quot; because that was the year in which &#163;2.5 billion was spent on tax credits, and all the analysts expected a much more significant fall in that year. Indeed, the figures show that, after housing costs were taken into account, child poverty remained static.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50712-17_para11">
<a name="stpa_139">The figures also show that there was no reduction in the number of poor children living in two-parent or couple families in 2003&#150;04. That is significant because 57 per cent. of children living in poverty live in two-parent families. There are serious and worrying anomalies relating to children living in two-parent or couple families. They make up the biggest cohort of children living in poverty. It is the task of the Government and the Opposition&#151;indeed, of all of us in the House&#151;who are thinking seriously about how to reduce child poverty to ensure that, whatever system we come up with, these perverse unintended consequences are rectified. They are having damaging consequences for our country.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50712-17_para12">
<a name="stpa_140">I shall illustrate that point with some specific examples. In 2003&#150;04, a couple family with two children would have needed an income of &#163;262 a week to get out of poverty, whereas for a lone parent with two children, that figure would be only &#163;182. Those are after-housing-costs and after-tax figures. To get the income necessary to get out of poverty, a single-earner couple in social housing paying rent of &#163;53 a week would need to earn &#163;336 a week, as opposed to only &#163;86 a week after the implementation of the tax credit system. That is nearly four times as much, and it represents a very wide disparity.

<a name="50712-17_para13">
<a name="stpa_141">The former senior Inland Revenue officers, Don Draper and Leonard Beighton, have released figures today showing that, for the tax year 2005&#150;06, a couple with two children in social housing on half average earnings paying a weekly rent of &#163;53 would be left &#163;22 below the poverty line, whereas a lone parent family with two children in those circumstances would be left &#163;66 above it. I am delighted that that lone parent family will be &#163;66 above the poverty line, and no part of my proposals would involve taking money from lone parents in any way. I want to make that very clear to the House. Surely, however, that situation must be of concern. Most children who live in poverty&#151;57 per cent. of them&#151;live in couple families, and according to the example that I have just given, they would be &#163;22 below the poverty line. That is before any child support, which is disregarded for tax credit purposes. My concern is that the Government will not achieve their target of halving child poverty by 2010 because of some unintended, but very significant, flaws in the administration of the tax credit system.

We need to tweak the system in the future&#151;we do not propose taking money away from anyone now&#151;to create a genuinely level playing field.

A quarter of all lone mothers with children have a partner who lives elsewhere. It is those couples who are likely to be discouraged from living together by the operation of the tax credit system, and who could blame them? If they choose to marry or cohabit, they will lose most of their tax credits, which would make many of them worse off, even after the reduced housing costs that would result.

<a name="stpa_147">I have a slightly odd personal history on the issue of tax credits. When I was appointed as a fresh-faced Financial Secretary to the Treasury in the 1990s, I was interested in the question of whether some of the principles of tax credits first espoused in the Green Paper published by the Heath Government, to which the right hon. Member for Birkenhead referred, could be excavated. It may be of some interest to the House to know why, as a Treasury Minister who was relatively benignly inclined towards the principle of tax credits, I was dissuaded from that and persuaded that the costs of that system, in terms of excessive bureaucracy and the risks of genuine injustice to poor people, outweighed any potential benefits. Those costs are now manifest in our constituents&#039; lives, and they should give us pause for thought now along the lines suggested by the right hon. Gentleman.

Those were the two principles that the Chancellor espoused as the primary policy drivers for the introduction of his tax credit system. Indeed, the Chancellor and his acolytes sometimes like to talk as though they were the first people in history ever to be interested in the elimination of poverty and the reconciliation of a benefits system with work incentives.

 As the right hon. Member for Birkenhead reminded us, we have been discussing this issue for 40 years. He referred to tax credits, but he might also have referred to a book that Daniel Moynihan wrote at around the same time on the introduction of a negative income tax. These are not new ideas. What is new is that the Chancellor concluded 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>12 Jul 2005 : Column 741</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>that all the difficulties identified by the right hon. Member for Birkenhead and anyone else who had taken a serious interest in the issue throughout the period could at best be wished away and at worst overridden by mere expression of political will.

 The right hon. Gentleman said almost in passing that of course we all want to get rid of poverty. However, poverty is, by definition, a relative, statistical concept. Will he confirm to the House that in fact he was a Minister in a Government who positively moved away from trying to have a more equitable distribution of income and wealth, and who positively espoused the trickle-down theory that tackled neither of those problems?

<p><a name="st_153"><a name="50712-18_spnew9"><b> Mr. Dorrell: </b> 
 What I will confirm to the House is that I was a supporter and member of a Government who saw huge improvements in living standards across the community and in the working of the labour market. The hon. Gentleman might prefer to see his Government reverse that but as he knows, his right hon. Friends refuse to do so because they know that the labour market changes that we introduced have delivered improving living standards across the piece. He is right that poverty as measured is a relative concept, which is why it is a more accurate definition of policy objectives, in my view, to espouse the raising of living standards across the piece, providing to every section of the community better access to opportunity to improve their living standards. The problem with the tax credit system that we are debating today is that it has not reconciled the dangers associated with excessive complexity and bureaucracy with the delivery of other public policy objectives.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50712-18_para7">
<a name="stpa_149">Why was I persuaded, as a fresh-faced Financial Secretary, that the system was not worth the candle? First, as has been pointed out several times previously, it is simply a fallacy to consider the benefit system and the tax system and to say that they are both to some extent means-related and that they can therefore be merged into the same system. That is the approach that the Chancellor has taken&#151;to imagine that because the Inland Revenue in its old incarnation made an assessment of means, and because the Department for Work and Pensions made an assessment of means, we could somehow merge the two systems into a single tax and benefit system. As the right hon. Member for Birkenhead said, that view overlooks the obvious but fundamental point that the tax system is based on an annual assessment of means, whereas the benefit system, if it is to provide secure income to the benefit recipient, must be based on a much more short-term assessment of the needs of the individual.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50712-18_para8">
<a name="stpa_150">As for all the arguments that we have heard elucidated today about the difficulties&#151;and moreover the injustices&#151;associated with reclaiming overpayment of tax credits, those difficulties arise because the system now seeks to reconcile retrospectively a means-tested benefit system back into the previous tax year. That mismatch between the two systems ultimately led earlier policymakers to conclude that we should not go down that route, and still leads me to believe that the Government might ultimately have to conclude that 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>12 Jul 2005 : Column 742</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>their system must be fundamentally rewritten. I say that as someone who does not think that we should change the rules of such systems every six months, which in itself leads to further complexity and injustice.

<a name="50712-18_para9">
<a name="stpa_151">If Ministers really believe that one more heave will deliver a sufficient improvement in the operation of the system to address all its difficulties, they are entitled to a hearing. But as one who considered it in the past, and who has seen too many of the predictions that were then used to dissuade me from that course come true, I allow myself a certain scepticism as to whether one more heave will in truth be enough to eliminate all those difficulties.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50712-18_para10">
<a name="stpa_152">There is one other aspect, on which we have not touched today, that has made the system even more complex than it probably otherwise needed to be: the Chancellor&#039;s view, with which, again, I have some sympathy, that some of the combined effect of the tax system and benefit withdrawal led to sharp work disincentives as people saw their benefits being withdrawn. The background papers at the time that the tax credit system was introduced referred to the withdrawal ratio for family credit of 70 per cent.&#151;for every &#163;10 of extra earnings that the family secured, &#163;7 was lost in family credit withdrawn&#151;and the Chancellor sought to reduce that rate of tax and benefit withdrawal. There is a tension there, too, however, as whenever one tries to reduce the rate of taper, one extends further up the income scale and includes more families in precisely the problem that one seeks to control. Not only has the system been made much more complex by the merging of the tax and benefit systems, but the reach of the system has been extended further up the income scale, so that more families are affected than were affected by the previous benefit structure. If we stand back, we see that the system is inherently complex, regardless of the set of rules that we operate. We have voluntarily made it more complex by mixing an annual cycle with a much more short-term means-assessment cycle, and we have increased the number of people affected by extending it further up the income scale.

 It is a pleasure to follow the right hon. Member for Charnwood (Mr. Dorrell). He is of course a distinguished Member of Parliament. He was also a distinguished Treasury Minister, and was, I believe, one 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>12 Jul 2005 : Column 743</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>of the Ministers in the last Government who did care about poverty issues. I therefore think that we should take what he says seriously. It is also a pleasure to speak in the same debate as my right hon. Friend the Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field), who, as we all know, has a very distinguished record on tackling poverty both in the House and outside.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50712-19_para0">
<a name="stpa_155">It would have been good if the start of the debate had featured a recognition by both sides of the context in which we are discussing tax credit administration: a context in which, under the Government of whom the right hon. Member for Charnwood was a part, child poverty increased from about 1 million to 4 million. I know that the right hon. Gentleman cared about child poverty, but it increased none the less, by 3 million. Many people were in dire need, and nothing was done. Since 1997 child poverty has fallen, by about 1 million. That is not a bad record: child poverty has fallen, after trebling under the last Government.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50712-19_para1">
<a name="stpa_156">Of course it is right to acknowledge that there are problems in the system, and my right hon. Friend the Paymaster General has acknowledged that. I think that we need to ask five questions. Does the system tackle poverty? Does it encourage people to work? Is it properly taken up? Is it well targeted? Does it take the stigma away from claimants? I believe that those questions are relevant to a discussion of poverty and the means of tackling it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50712-19_para2">
<a name="stpa_157">I have already drawn attention to the impact of working families tax credit and its successors on the tackling of poverty. I am now speaking for the people who have had bad experiences with the tax credit system, but also for the people receiving tax credits&#151;8,000 in my constituency&#151;many of whom told me during the general election campaign that tax credits had had a huge and positive effect on their lives. If other Members are honest, they will say that their constituencies also contain such people. It would obviously be wrong to deny that there are people who face problems, but it would be equally wrong to deny that the lives of many others have been transformed by tax credits. Members need not take my word for it; they need only read the ombudsman&#039;s report. She herself said that the undertaking had been &quot;broadly successful&quot;, and&#151;this is on page 56&#151;

<p><a name="st_155"><a name="50712-19_spnew1"><b> Andrew Selous: </b> 
 May I tempt the hon. Gentleman to add a sixth question to the five that he quite properly raised earlier? It is the question that I posed in my own speech. Is it right to operate a system that constitutes a huge financial disincentive for people who want to live together? They are penalised significantly if they do so, week by week.
</p>





<p><a name="st_156"><a name="50712-19_spnew2"><b> Edward Miliband: </b> 
 I do not believe that people marry, stay together or do not stay together on the basis of how the system works, but the hon. Gentleman made a well-informed speech, to which I am sure the Paymaster General and others paid attention. I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor): if the hon. Gentleman wants to give those with partners a greater incentive, he must find the money from somewhere.

</p>

<p>
<a name="50712-19_para3">
<a name="stpa_158">Let me return to my five questions. I think that the system has worked well in tackling poverty. Obviously there have been significant problems, to which the hon. Member for Tatton (Mr. Osborne) drew attention. My second question was &quot;Does the system encourage people to work?&quot; I think that it has done that, and indeed the figures are there for all to see. We have seen 2 million jobs created, and we have seen the rate of single-parent employment rise.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50712-19_para4">
<a name="stpa_159">I know that the hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Laws) favours a fixed system of tax credit awards, but that creates its own injustices. I do not think that the argument about a fixed versus a responsive system is particularly ideological. However, under an annual system basing awards on the previous year&#039;s income, those whose incomes had fallen for whatever reason would not be told &quot;We will give you and your family more money.&quot; They would be told &quot;We are sorry, but there is nothing we can do. You are stuck with the award based on last year&#039;s income.&quot; As the Paymaster General has said a number of times in the House, we can have a responsive system&#151;a system that responds to changes in people&#039;s circumstances&#151;or a fixed system.
</p>





<p><a name="st_157"><a name="50712-19_spnew3"><b> Mr. Laws: </b> 
 Is it so obvious to the hon. Gentleman&#151;and if so, why&#151;that the system chosen by the Government is superior to a fixed system? Would it not make sense for the Government to review the evidence of the last two years to establish whether a fixed system could be better?
</p>





<p><a name="st_158"><a name="50712-19_spnew4"><b> Edward Miliband: </b> 
 Time will tell, but I am still convinced that a responsive system is better, and I shall explain why shortly.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50712-19_para5">
<a name="stpa_160">My third question concerned take-up. I am surprised that so few Members mentioned it. Take-up of family credit in the first year was 57 per cent.; take-up in the first year of this system was 80 per cent., which is pretty good going for a means-tested, income-related benefit. My right hon. Friend the Member for Birkenhead would know better than I, but I should have thought that it was unprecedented. Six million families and 10 million children have been helped.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50712-19_para6">
<a name="stpa_161">One reason for that is the fact that the system is non-stigmatising: it is part of the overall tax system. There is a significant prize to be gained from not having a system aimed at the poor, providing an income top-up for the bottom third of the population or even fewer people. Under such a system, even those who are working must go to the social security office if they are to have a living income.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50712-19_para7">
<a name="stpa_162">My fourth question was &quot;Is the system well targeted?&quot; Members have mentioned how high up the income scale the tax credit system goes. In fact, 40 per cent. of the benefit goes to the bottom 20 per cent. of families, so it is a reasonably well-targeted system. The shadow Chancellor referred to people on &#163;66,000 a year, but the people at the very top do not get very much money out of the system&#151;if they bother to apply. They get the equivalent of the old children&#039;s tax credit, which is a maximum of &#163;10 a week. The system is about lower and middle-income families. It is true that it is not for the small minority&#151;I am rather in favour of the fact that these credits go to a larger proportion of the population&#151;but no one can deny that this is a well-targeted system.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>12 Jul 2005 : Column 745</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50712-19_para8">
<a name="stpa_163">My fifth question is: is the system de-stigmatising? For many years, we have had all kinds of social security benefits, but huge stigma has attached to them. We sometimes witness the same problem with the pension credit, which is in fact a social security benefit. Some elderly people say, &quot;I&#039;m not sure about claiming it because I do not want to have to claim benefits.&quot; People do not say the same about tax credits, so in that regard we have made a huge advance. In fact, in some ways it is a revolution. We have removed the division between the deserving and the undeserving poor: we have changed a system that required &quot;deserving&quot; taxpayers to pay for &quot;undeserving&quot; benefit recipients. In fact, doing so was the motivation behind the scrutiny of the system that took place in the 1970s.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50712-19_para9">
<a name="stpa_164">I am surprised that this achievement has not been more greatly acknowledged during this debate. I do not want to live in a country in which people feel guilty about claiming a top-up for working. We could have introduced the minimum wage at the level to which tax credits raise people&#039;s income, but as Conservative Members would doubtless have pointed out, doing so would destroy jobs. Indeed, I find myself in a slightly ironic position. I nipped out earlier to have the pleasure of being involved in my first statutory instrument debate, which was on the national minimum wage. What did I hear in the Committee Room Upstairs? I heard great plaudits for the national minimum wage and for tax credits; indeed, there was a progressive consensus throughout the Committee on the role of both. However, I returned to this Chamber to hear diatribes from the Opposition against tax credits.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50712-19_para10">
<a name="stpa_165">The tax credit system answers my five questions and works well. There are significant administrative and other problems, and we should of course apologise&#151;as the Paymaster General has&#151;for the hurt and distress that has been caused. But one thing struck me on listening to the shadow Chancellor&#039;s contribution. We heard from him a 26-minute diatribe against the tax credit system, and about all manner of cases, for which we have sympathy. At the end, we heard the clarion call not to abolish tax credits, but for a far-reaching review. I, too, am in favour of reviewing the system&#039;s working, but there is a very good reason why the shadow Chancellor did not commit to abolishing tax credits at the next election, which he could easily have done, given his diatribe against them. He knows that, fundamentally, the system is popular with the majority of recipients&#151;the majority of recipients in my constituency, for example. That is why he has not committed to abolishing it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50712-19_para11">
<a name="stpa_166">The Government have a responsibility to sort out the problems in the system, but we should all acknowledge the advances that have been made under it. Let us have a rational debate about the way in which it works, but let us please do so in the proper context. This Government have made work pay and tackled poverty&#151;something that was never achieved in 18 years of the previous Conservative Government.

 I thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, for calling me to speak on an issue with which every Member of this House is doubtless only too familiar. I went to the House of Commons Library to research the tax credits system, and the librarian was most helpful. She tapped into her

Suddenly, she screamed, &quot;But it&#039;s all gobbledegook!&quot; I have those 25 pages of complete gobbledegook in my hand. Perhaps the explanation is that there was a glitch in the Library&#039;s computer system. However, as a new Member I have been told that everything produced by the House of Commons Library is always accurate, so I suspect that the librarian&#039;s initial view&#151;that the tax credit system is &quot;all gobbledegook&quot;&#151;might be right. There is one thing, however, of which I am absolutely certain: many of my constituents believe the tax credit system to be complete gobbledegook.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50712-20_para0">

<a name="stpa_168">Has transparency and administration improved? It seems to me that the current system, which largely revolves around the highly fluid concept of what is &quot;reasonable&quot;, has achieved the exact opposite.      Let us consider the forms that claimants must fill in to apply for tax credits. As a chartered accountant, I am not ashamed to say that I find them confusing. I am professionally trained&#151;how on earth is the average person, who relies on the extra income that tax credits generate, meant to understand them? Tax credits are meant to help the most vulnerable in our society. They are meant to encourage people to come off welfare and to go back to work. They are meant to make life just that bit more comfortable for those on low or moderate incomes, yet these are the very people whom the system is penalising by being inefficient, bewildering and incompetent.

<a name="stpa_169">I am very grateful to be able to speak about an issue that affects so many of my constituents in Wellingborough and Rushden. I am sure that I am not alone in finding that a good majority of the constituency postbag consists of letters from constituents who need help with, and clarification of, their tax credit payments. Indeed, half those who ask for help at my weekly surgeries ask about this very issue. I was interested to read the Paymaster General&#039;s own statistics. According to them, between April and December 2004, the Tax Credit Office, Treasury Ministers and members of the Board of Inland Revenue received almost 6,000 letters from MPs who were trying to sort out the many problems that their constituents were experiencing&#151;

<br>&nbsp;<br>alone, who have had to get involved because their constituents have hit a brick wall and cannot get any further by themselves. Thanks to the system&#039;s incompetence, this problem is widespread and affects vulnerable families right across the country, so it is no surprise to learn that the two latest reports on tax credits were less than complimentary about this fundamentally flawed system.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50712-20_para4">
<a name="stpa_171">Given the tax credit system&#039;s very nature, it will always fail the most vulnerable in our society. Because it has so many different elements, it can only confuse and confound those who claim tax credits. Claimants have to estimate their income for the following year, which in itself gives rise to massive complications. But the real problems come when a claimant&#039;s circumstances change. Claimants are asked to notify the Tax Credit Office of certain changes within three months, though for other changes notification can wait until the end of the financial year. However, like many elements of this baffling system, precisely what changes need to be declared and when is just not clear.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50712-20_para5">
<a name="stpa_172">Many of my constituents who contact me for help have told me that, to be on the safe side, they inform the Tax Credit Office of all changes. One would think that that was very sensible of them, but it is here that the problem starts for thousands of families who are being penalised by the system. Much of my tax credit case work is taken up by constituents who have had their tax credits stopped completely due to overpayments in previous months. In some cases, the Tax Credit Office states that the overpayments will not be recovered as it was an error by that office in the first place. Why, then, did it stop the tax credits completely and why are those credits continuing to be stopped? In almost all the cases that I have dealt with, the claimant informed the Tax Credit Office of changes to their circumstances. In many cases, that office failed to update its records either through computer error or inefficiency, yet it is my constituents, along with many others, that suffer. In fact, according to the latest reports, nearly 2 million families have suffered.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50712-20_para6">
<a name="stpa_173">How is a family meant to plan for the future&#151;financially or otherwise&#151;if they never know exactly what is going into the bank account each month? The rules and regulations of tax credits state that people do not need to pay back an overpayment if they reasonably believed that it was a correct statement of what they should have received. However, what is &quot;reasonable&quot;? It is another open-ended, fluid and confusing term, which means all things to all men and penalises the very people that the system is supposed to help. Families often do not know their financial situation from one day to the next and while the correct procedures are not being followed to update the tax credits computer system when changes occur, those families will continue to live in financial limbo.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50712-20_para7">
<a name="stpa_174">As for the cost of bureaucracy and waste, the Government, as usual, do not disappoint. The sheer volume of forms, the fact that payments are made through PAYE rather than directly to the claimant and the vulnerability of the system to massive fraud are all costing the taxpayer dearly&#151;about &#163;400 million a year and with nearly 7,500 people working the system.

<a name="50712-20_para8">
<a name="stpa_175">I would like to finish by giving just one example of how the tax credit system has failed those who need it most. A constituent came to me in desperate need for help&#151;her case comes to the crux of why the system is failing. She was about to be evicted from her council house for being severely behind in her rent and for being unable to keep up her payments on her council tax. It all started when she had to leave work due to illness. She was incorrectly paid working tax credit instead of incapacity benefit. Of course, it turned out that she was being overpaid tax credits and the Revenue asked her to pay the money back. Not only was she not in a financial position to do so, but she was also penalised by the council for receiving tax credits, which counted against her housing and council tax benefit.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50712-20_para9">
<a name="stpa_176">After several attempts to contact the Tax Credit Office to advise it that her tax credits must cease, she was still receiving the tax credit payments 14 weeks later. Because she was receiving no other benefits due to the overpayment, that is all that she and her children had to live on. When she rang that office again, she was told that her case was stuck in processing and that she would just have to wait her turn. Unfortunately, hers is not a unique case, but it is wholly unacceptable. The current tax credit system is, by its very nature, inefficient and fundamentally flawed and it penalises the most vulnerable of our society. Two million families have suffered under that system, which relies on staff regularly updating claimants&#039; information and a computer system that properly processes the correct data. At the moment, we have neither. How long will it be before the Government realise that micro-management and bureaucracy do nothing but penalise the most vulnerable people in our society?

 Looking back on the debate, one realises that this really is a case of the road to hell being paved with good intentions. Back in 1998, when Martin Taylor submitted his report &quot;Work Incentives&quot; after observing the taxation and benefit system, he said:

<a name="stpa_177">The difficulty in reality is that IT systems are never easy. The truth is that the Government&#039;s record on them does not inspire confidence. The Child Support Agency&#039;s computer system, which cost nearly &#163;500 million, failed, leading to the resignation of the chief executive. Staff at the Department for Work and Pensions were unable to process new benefits and pension claims for several days because the system went down. The computer systems of the Passport Service, the Criminal Records Bureau and National Air Traffic Services have also had problems. And so we go on.

<a name="stpa_186">So for these massive sums of money, full parliamentary reporting and scrutiny are not available. More light should have been shed on this very murky issue.

<p>
<a name="50712-20_para20">
<a name="stpa_187">I am very disappointed that the Chief Secretary is not present to hear the end of the debate. I do not know where he is: he is always very courteous in the House, but it was extraordinary that, like the Chancellor of the Exchequer, he has failed to offer any apology for the grotesque misfortune that has befallen many thousands of the most vulnerable people in the country. The right hon. Gentleman gave a bloodless and technocratic performance.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50712-20_para21">
<a name="stpa_188">The Chief Secretary was very unclear about the statutory test for the recovery of excess payments, which he rejected. To answer his challenge, I can say that the Opposition accept the global amount for the provisions of tax credits, but we need clear answers to many questions. The Chief Secretary did not give them, and I hope that the Paymaster General will take this opportunity to do so.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50712-20_para22">
<a name="stpa_189">The hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Laws) said that Ministers were taking a long time to resolve the tax credit problem. He rightly noted that no real action plan exists, and mentioned the exhortations from Citizens Advice. He also talked about error rates and the amount of bureaucracy, and I agree with him that we need very clear answers from the Paymaster General on these matters.

<p><a name="st_163"><a name="50712-21_spnew0"><b> Rob Marris </b> 
: The hon. Gentleman has cited the hon. Member for Havant (Mr. Willetts), who said that most of all he wanted an end to the ludicrous tax credit system that the Chancellor introduced, which he called a failed idea from the 1970s. Earlier, the hon. Member for Tatton (Mr. Osborne) seemed to cite approvingly a report from the Institute for Fiscal Studies that suggested that the tax credit system had led to more rather than less poverty. Do the Opposition intend to abolish the system or not?
</p>





<p><a name="st_164"><a name="50712-21_spnew1"><b> Mr. Spring: </b> 
 My hon. Friend the Member for Tatton made the position very clear. Given the huge bureaucracy and costs of the tax credit system, and the huge suffering that it has caused, we need a full-blown review of its operation. All hon. Members should be committed to that, and I refer the hon. Gentleman to the ombudsman&#039;s report in that respect.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50712-21_para0">
<a name="stpa_190">The right hon. Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field) was right to say that the question is not whether we dislike child poverty or want to deal with it, but how we resolve it. Of course, we are all committed to abolishing child poverty, and the right hon. Gentleman listed three clear reforms that need to be introduced. He asked that the Paymaster General respond to his suggestions, and I hope she will.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50712-21_para1">
<a name="stpa_191">My hon. Friend the Member for South-West Bedfordshire (Andrew Selous) made a very well informed speech. He said that the operation of the system contained imbalances that discriminate against families, and that there was insufficient recognition of that. That is an important point, and it could be part of a review of the whole system.


<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>

<p>
<a name="50712-21_para2">
<a name="stpa_192">It is always refreshing to hear from my right hon. Friend the Member for Charnwood (Mr. Dorrell), who has considerable ministerial experience, and who rightly said that the Chancellor and those closest to him underestimated enormously the policy difficulties involved in a change of this sort, with all the attendant consequences. He asked whether the price was worth paying.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50712-21_para3">
<a name="stpa_193">The hon. Member for Doncaster, North (Edward Miliband) posed five questions. He rightly said that any system that imposes a stigma on people is unacceptable. His questions were listened to with respect, but he must appreciate that the system is failing in a monumental way. It is the responsibility of the Opposition and other hon. Members to hold the Government to account. We have to find a way forward. Although the hon. Gentleman cited the system&#039;s objectives, I do not believe that he can be remotely satisfied with the way it is working out in practice.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50712-21_para4">
<a name="stpa_194">My hon. Friend the Member for Wellingborough (Mr. Bone) made an excellent and very practical speech, in which he spoke about the problems that people brought to his surgery. He brought a sense of reality to the debate, and set out the terrible fact that families in this country have no idea what their income is going to be.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50712-21_para5">
<a name="stpa_195">The parliamentary ombudsman has criticised the application of the system, the customer interface and the IT equipment. The Government must take that on board, but they must also recognise that they have been caught between creating chaos and misery on the one hand, and spending vast sums of taxpayers&#039; money on the other.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50712-21_para6">
<a name="stpa_196">I can only echo what was said by my hon. Friend the Member for Tatton, and many others. There has to be a proper and comprehensive review of the system, to bring order to the problem and to ensure that it never happens again on any comparable scale. It is reported that the head of the HMRC has said that it would cost &#163;5 billion to revamp the system, and we know that the running costs now total more than &#163;400 million.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50712-21_para7">
<a name="stpa_197">The Atkinson review of Government bureaucracy said that the Government were inefficient and that a different system was needed, but no fewer than 3,200 Revenue staff are trying to underpin the tax credits helpline. The Treasury spin machine told <i>The Times</i> this morning that that was due to a massive increase in take-up. That is utterly wrong: it is due to the massive chaos of the system.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50712-21_para8">
<a name="stpa_198">The Chancellor of the Exchequer is the father of tax credits. He is attending a meeting of ECOFIN, and perhaps he will talk about waste in the EU and about our &#163;3.6 billion rebate. Perhaps he will speak about the lack of transparency in the EU, and about the need to fight oppressive regulation and bureaucracy. However, what would the right hon. Gentleman&#039;s credibility be if his fellow Finance Ministers knew that the most recent tax credit overpayments totalled about three quarters of the very rebate he is supposedly so determined to secure? One simply could not write the script.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50712-21_para9">
<a name="stpa_199">Finally, whatever criticism one may make of the Paymaster General, she is the one who has defended the tax credits nightmare, both in this Chamber and in

<br>&nbsp;<br>Westminster Hall. She has acknowledged the hardships that it has caused, and even the Prime Minister has apologised, but we have yet to hear a word of remorse from the person with departmental oversight of this bureaucratic nightmare. I leave it to the House to make a judgment on that.

<a name="50712-21_time0"><h5>6.49 pm</h5>
</p>





<p><a name="st_165"><a name="50712-21_spmin0"><b>The Paymaster General  (Dawn Primarolo): </b> 
 In the few moments left for my reply to this important debate I want to try to touch on all the major points that Members have raised. I start by making clear that the debate must be set in context. As the Minister, I fully acknowledge the problems with the introduction of the tax credit system and the IT system. I have been open with the House about the problems caused for some claimants and I would never wish anybody to suggest that I underestimate them. I have listened carefully to the points that have been made about the recommendations by the ombudsman, the adjudicator and the CAB and I shall return to them. I shall explain to the House how I propose to take forward those recommendations.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50712-21_para10">
<a name="stpa_200">Like my hon. Friend the Member for Doncaster, North (Edward Miliband), I want to start by setting the context. I was interested in what the right hon. Member for Charnwood (Mr. Dorrell) said and, if I may, I will paraphrase him. He said that the Conservatives were very concerned about poverty, but they had been unable to do anything about it and it continued remorselessly to rise under their Administration. When people talk about the misery of poverty, they should consider that context: the rise from 1 million to 4 million in the number of children who fell into poverty under his Government.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50712-21_para11">
<a name="stpa_201">The tax credit system assists and supports the poor. It is important to reinforce that point. As my hon. Friend the Member for Doncaster, North suggested, it is a broad-based system. He referred to take-up, and said that tax credits were well targeted and that the system destigmatised claimants and ensured that most families received support. More than 500,000 children have been lifted out of poverty since 1998&#150;99, and 6.1 million families, with 10 million children&#151;not an insignificant number&#151;are benefiting from tax credits. By October 2005, in real terms, families with children in the poorest fifth of the population will, on average, be &#163;3,200 a year better off. Children&#039;s risk of poverty has fallen from 33 to 28 per cent., after housing costs, between 1988&#150;89 and 2003&#150;04. Of course, more needs to be done, as the Government&#039;s child poverty strategy and the review published last summer clearly indicated. We need to develop that work.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50712-21_para12">
<a name="stpa_202">Members have referred specifically to the administration of the system. My right hon. Friend the Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field) focused on how the system could be made to work and to respond, in particular, to the needs of the more vulnerable. I understand entirely that he wants a wider debate about whether tax credits really are the way forward. He will understand that as a Minister, I am committed to tax credits but those are perfectly legitimate questions and they need to be asked.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50712-21_para13">
<a name="stpa_203">So, what have I done? On 5 July, I met Citizens Advice and the ombudsman, and today I met the adjudicator. I discussed with all of them their recommendations. I have 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>12 Jul 2005 : Column 753</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>agreed that there should be a formal response to the ombudsman&#039;s recommendations, giving a time frame for their delivery where possible. Most important, I was keen to learn from the experience of all three and to discuss with them how we could maintain contact and ensure that the recommendations are properly taken forward, how we can report back to them and how they can assist us in that process. All three organisations acknowledged the value of the tax credit system, but noted the need to deal with the issues that have been raised.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50712-21_para14">
<a name="stpa_204">With regard to the recommendations made by Citizens Advice, the ombudsman and the adjudicator, recommendation 10 in the ombudsman&#039;s report is that there should be a blanket amnesty on overpayments. As I have explained to the House and explained again to those organisations, the Government have a responsibility to balance our duty of care for all claimants with our duty to all taxpayers with regard to the public purse, so we cannot make a blanket decision for all cases where overpayment is vastly out of proportion to the award, and in many cases is not contested. However, we have said that, with that exception, we want to engage with them and to consider all their recommendations and the practicalities of taking them forward. For example, all three organisations made recommendations about award notices. We have been consulting them about the introduction of a new award notice. I have asked that the ombudsman and the adjudicator consider that in the light of the points they made. A draft is available, and I shall be delighted to put it in the Library.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50712-21_para15">
<a name="stpa_205">I can assure the House that I shall work closely with the consultation group, the voluntary sector, the ombudsman and the adjudicator to take that work forward. Many elements in my statement to the House of 26 May preceded the reports, but encompassed many, indeed all of the points, with the exception of the amnesty. That relates to the point made in a slightly different fashion by my right hon. Friend the Member for Birkenhead about the possibilities of what I would describe as playback, whereby the tax credit claimant would receive a playback of all the awards and the changes that had been made through the year, so that they had a clear statement. I have asked that that be taken forward as a matter of urgency.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50712-21_para16">
<a name="stpa_206">The system works for the majority of people, but at every point I try to draw on all the expertise and knowledge of those three organisations and others to improve it, and to deal specifically with the steps that we may need to take for an important group in the tax credit population. For example, I have asked the CAB to engage in discussions with us about how we can develop and enhance its advocacy role, using its expertise especially to reinforce support and advice. I have asked HMRC, in the period of merger, to examine how we can strengthen and ensure access for that particular group in many different ways.

<p><a name="st_166"><a name="50712-22_spnew0"><b> Mr. Frank Field: </b> 
 I am grateful to my right hon. Friend for saying whom she will consult on her new statement explaining the tax credit payments, but the group that she has missed out is poor people. Many poor people are 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>12 Jul 2005 : Column 754</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>very intelligent, and that is how they survive. Might she include some of our constituents when she consults on the design and intelligibility of the form?
</p>





<p><a name="st_167"><a name="50712-22_spnew1"><b> Dawn Primarolo: </b> 
 I have no objection to doing so. Indeed, hon. Members who are consulting their constituents and discussing the issue with them have said that they will report to me. We have to have a wider base for consultation, because we must get it right.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50712-22_para0">
<a name="stpa_207">My right hon. Friend also raised the very important question of suspension of recovery in case of dispute. I spoke to the citizens advice bureaux, the ombudsman and the adjudicator on that point. HMRC now tells me that we can introduce a suspension in case of dispute and, until it is resolved, recovery will not continue. I am simply now awaiting a date from HMRC for that procedure.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50712-22_para1">
<a name="stpa_208">With the recovery mechanisms in place, the strategy of tax credits ensures, as my hon. Friend the Member for Doncaster, North (Edward Miliband) said, that we target poverty, remove children from poverty, and support families in balancing their family responsibilities and their work. The tax credits ensure that we share the burden as a community and give more to those who have least, ensuring that everybody gets something and the most goes to the poorest. That is the basis of the tax credits and that is why the policy is right. That is why we need to move now&#151;as hon. Members have said&#151;to ensure that the administrative and IT problems are corrected and the system delivers for all claimants the very best service that we always intended to provide. I commend the tax credit system to the House. We will continue to eradicate child poverty and take forward the principles enshrined in the system.

<a name="stpa_210">I do not think that the Government will be surprised that we have tabled this motion. We have raised the issue in departmental questions, tabled early-day motions and debated the matter in Westminster Hall. Moreover, the Conservative party opposed the Bill when it was first debated in the House, and we did so because we thought that it was ill thought out and badly targeted, that it failed to address the real problems and that it would be impossible to implement. I pay tribute to the work done by my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Cambridgeshire (Mr. Moss), who, during the passage of the Bill, consistently pointed out to the Government the practical problems that they would face with this badly drafted and ill-thought-out legislation. I hate to say this to the Minister, but &quot;We told you so&quot;.

At every stage, sadly, the Government have ignored our pleas, denied that there was a problem and buried their head in the sand. Their response has been&#151;to paraphrase a former Prime Minister&#151;crisis, what crisis?

Indeed, I was at a dinner in Harrogate only last Tuesday&#151;a mere week ago&#151;when the leader of Westminster city council made a key point in telling me and the others there that it was high time that the Government listened to the issues that were being raised by local authorities about the problems of implementing the Act.

 Would the right hon.

<p><a name="st_181"><a name="50712-23_spnew8"><b> Mrs. May: </b> 
 I am always very happy to visit Hackney and talk to people about the implications of what the Government are doing in the hon. Lady&#039;s constituency.

 The hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Rob Marris) asked first.
</p>





<p><a name="st_188"><a name="50712-23_spnew14"><b> Rob Marris: </b> 
 The right hon. Lady might not know that the third largest pub chain in the United Kingdom is headquartered in my constituency and run by the excellent Wolverhampton and Dudley breweries. I spent last Wednesday evening at a dinner in the company of some of its representatives, and although they said that there were some teething problems, they were entirely happy with the Licensing Act 2003, as far as I could gather. The industry is certainly not entirely against the legislation.
</p>





<p><a name="st_189"><a name="50712-23_spnew15"><b> Mrs. May: </b> 
 The whole point is that the big chains have the personnel, resources and funding to provide support to their pubs. The hon. Gentleman should perhaps talk to smaller brewery chains such as Brakspear, which is an excellent local brewery in Henley. Only last week I met a representative of the company who told me about the real problems that its pubs are having in dealing with the extra cost and additional bureaucracy and time involved in the licence applications.
</p>





<p><a name="st_190"><a name="50712-23_spnew16"><b> Mr. Heath: </b> 
 Just so that the right hon. Lady&#039;s list becomes ever longer, another group of voluntary organisations that is deeply affected by the Act is the carnival circuit in Somerset. She might not know that that massive affair attracts up to 150,000 people a night, but it could be decimated as a result of the Act.
</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm050712/debtext/50712-24.htm"/>




<p><a name="st_191"><a name="50712-24_spnew0"><b> Mrs. May: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman makes an extremely valid point. The Government have completely failed to understand the number of organisations and activities that are affected by the Act and will find matters involving licensing applications rather more difficult than they did in the past.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50712-24_para0">
<a name="stpa_214">I am not sure what I find most galling: the inability and incompetence of the Government, or the arrogance of Ministers about the matter. During Culture, Media and Sport questions yesterday, the Under-Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, the hon. Member for Stalybridge and Hyde (James Purnell), told us that 33 per cent. of expected applications had been received. He said:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_46">&quot;Applications are starting to pick up, although there is still some way to go.&quot;&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 11 July 2005; Vol. 436, c. 555.]</p>

<a name="stpa_215">With 25 days to go, for 190,000 premises&#151;I am setting apart personal licences&#151;an outstanding total of 133,000 applications are yet to be made. As a result of the Government&#039;s deadline of 6 August, local authorities will have 18 working days in which they will be expected to receive and process applications, so they will have to deal with 7,400 a day. That shows the chaos 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>12 Jul 2005 : Column 762</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>out there at the moment. Why do not the Government just admit that they got things wrong and work with us to come up with a solution?
</p>





<p><a name="st_192"><a name="50712-24_spnew1"><b> Mr. Don Foster  (Bath) (LD):</b> 
 Will the right hon. Lady also acknowledge that in addition to the many licence applications that are still to come forward, there will be a large number of appeals? Does she think that the magistrates courts will be in a position to deal with them, let alone that the local authorities will be able to deal with the licence applications?
</p>





<p><a name="st_193"><a name="50712-24_spnew2"><b> Mrs. May: </b> 
 Indeed; the hon. Gentleman makes a valid point. There are three stages to the problem. Local authority officers must first deal with processing. Then local authority councillor panels might have to meet many times a week over the rest of this month to deal with applications. There could then be a problem for the magistrates courts, which was raised with me when I visited my local magistrates court in Maidenhead a couple of weeks ago. People are worried about what they must do to ensure that the Act is properly implemented.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50712-24_para2">
<a name="stpa_216">In a sense, I feel sorry for the Under-Secretary. This was a disaster waiting to happen and it has just been dropped in his lap. Even the <i>Financial Times</i> has documented his annoyance at dealing with the ensuing chaos and the fact that he is becoming fed up with &quot;these ridiculous photo opportunities&quot; that have seen him pictured in every catering magazine from <i>Fast Food & Frying Operator</i> to <i>Masala</i>. I am sure that they are worthy and well-read publications, but even if the Under-Secretary were to appear as the centre spread in <i>Vogue, OK!</i> or <i>The Guardian</i>&#039;s media pages, he still could not meet his 6 August deadline for the applications.

 I am grateful to the right hon. Lady for the opportunity to clarify the fact that I was absolutely delighted to give interviews and participate in all those photo opportunities. Although the <i>FT</i> is a very august and respectable paper, for once it got the emphasis slightly wrong.
</p>





<p><a name="st_195"><a name="50712-24_spnew3"><b> Mrs. May: </b>

<a name="50712-24_para3">
<a name="stpa_217">Of course we accept that applicants, especially commercial businesses, should pay the cost of their licensing applications.

<p><a name="st_196"><a name="50712-24_spnew4"><b> Ms Angela C. Smith  (Sheffield, Hillsborough) (Lab):</b> 
 The Tories have flip-flopped constantly on the Act. They cannot decide whether they want it to be more regulatory, or deregulatory. Perhaps the right hon. Lady will clarify their position.

It is indeed just a matter of a few boxes&#151;97 of them, in fact. Those are just the boxes to be ticked, because another 508 boxes require further information. More than 600 boxes must be completed, yet the Under-Secretary says that the form is simpler than the two pages of application that people had to complete in the past.

 To tick all those boxes, an organisation would have to be a venue with a dance floor that would serve alcohol and late food, in addition to putting on dance, showing films and putting on a wrestling match, indoor sports and plays. If an organisation is just converting, the application form is only seven pages, not 21 pages with 500 boxes, as the right hon. Lady suggests.

 I accept that some local authorities are running workshops.

Far from feeling that they are being consulted, local villagers are saying, &quot;What&#039;s this?

When the Minister says that it will not affect community groups, perhaps he has not heard of organisations like Sonning working men&#039;s club or the Italian Circle in Welwyn Garden City. The committee of the Italian Circle has written to us. It was established a few years ago to provide talks about Italian subjects to members and visitors. It has slide shows, videos and so forth, and offers members and visitors the opportunity to have a glass of wine. The consumption of wine averages four to five bottles a meeting, yet it has been informed that it has to make an application under the Act for temporary event notices.

Will he agree also to review the way in which charges are apportioned to clubs, particularly sports clubs, so that they are based on the rateable value of only the area that is serving alcohol, rather than the club premises and grounds as a whole?

It is an old Act, but every carnival uses it to secure road closures. It refers to

There are about 1.7 million such applications a year. The Licensing Act will sweep away anomalies as well as the need for people to go to a magistrate every time that they wish to apply for a special permission. It replaces that requirement with a system in which people apply for a licence once without further need for form filling. The right hon.

 In the year of the volunteer, does the Minister understand that bureaucracy like this is driving people away from doing important voluntary acts such as being on a village hall committee? It is not that these people have nothing else to do with their time&#151;they really want to do something good for their community, but this sort of thing is stopping them volunteering.
</p>





<p><a name="st_253"><a name="50712-29_spnew4"><b> James Purnell: </b> 
 We completely support and appreciate the work that is done by volunteers across the country, including in village halls. When I met ACRE representatives today, it was clear that many village halls have successfully applied for licences and that many welcome the extra flexibility that they will get, just as pubs welcome it. However, we recognise that some village halls would rather not take out a licence and would prefer us to increase the number of temporary events notices, or TENs. We do not rule that out, but it would need to be carefully considered. During the Bill&#039;s passage through Parliament, we increased the number of TENs from five to 12. It is worth noting that that regime is extremely deregulatory. Essentially, it allows the applicant to put on an event that can last for up to 36 hours without anybody being able to object apart from the police, who can do so only on the grounds of law and order. In effect, people can run events without any closing time and with no opportunity for the local community to make representations. If we accepted the suggestion of the right hon. Member for Maidenhead, we would effectively have 30 of those events happening in any of our constituencies during the year, and they would not be confined to village halls&#151;they could be in pubs or anywhere else. If we did that without properly considering the evidence, our constituents might be rightly concerned that we had gone too far in the direction of allowing flexible drinking.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50712-29_para2">
<a name="stpa_276">However, we do not rule out moving on the issue of TENs, and we are happy to look at submissions on that over the summer when we consult on regulations for the TENs regime. We will also be happy to consider whether there are particular ways in which individual categories of licensees can have the regime apply to them in a different way.

 Does the Minister accept that this problem extends not only to village halls and temporary events but to small village shops? These are small shops, not areas where there is a problem of binge drinking. One in my constituency is only just being maintained by the actions of villagers. It is having to subscribe a very large sum of money in payment to consultants to help it to fill in forms. The village shop is confronting a permanent problem that will not be addressed by the measures that he is suggesting.

 I do not want to test the patience of the House by going on too long. I think that the hon.

Implementing this radical reform was always going to be a challenge, but it is a challenge worth going for. This Act will be better for local communities, better at cracking down on the irresponsible minority, cheaper and more flexible for business, and better for the responsible majority. We should not be subject to curfew because of the problems that people have with the irresponsible minority. I believe that when we look back on this Act in one or two years&#039; time, people will recognise that it is a much better framework of law than the one that we had.

<p>
<a name="50712-29_para7">
<a name="stpa_281">All hon. Members will acknowledge that we have a serious problem of binge drinking. I mention that because the Under-Secretary wanted me to deal with his anxiety about our position. In a recent parliamentary question, I asked about the increase in violent offences connected with licensed premises. In the past 12 months alone, the figure has increased by 15 per cent., so that a staggering 50,000 such offences were committed in England and Wales in the past year. Recent figures show that admissions to accident and emergency departments resulting from alcohol abuse are now a staggering 25,000. A parliamentary question from my hon. Friend the Member for Hornsey and Wood Green (Lynne Featherstone) elicited the response that, in the past 12 months, there has been an increase of 18.5 per cent. in alcohol-related deaths. We are storing up a huge problem. According to the Government&#039;s figures, 44 per cent. of 18 to 24-year-olds binge-drink at least once a month. Again from the Government&#039;s figures, we know that binge drinking costs our society more than &#163;20 billion a year.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50712-29_para8">
<a name="stpa_282">What has been the Government&#039;s response to that? They were elected in 1997 and it took them six years to devise their alcohol harm reduction strategy. In that time, 240,000 people died from alcohol abuse. It took until last year for the Prime Minister to acknowledge that binge drinking was a British disease. The Government did not consider existing legislation to ascertain whether it could help to tackle the problem. Legislation exists to prosecute landlords for allowing drunken or riotous behaviour on their premises. Since 1997, when the Government came to power, there has been an average of only 11 prosecutions a year. That shows how little use is made of existing legislation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50712-29_para9">
<a name="stpa_283">Legislation also exists to prevent people from buying drinks for others who are clearly drunk. Yet how many prosecutions have been brought since 1997? The answer is a grand total of 12&#151;and in 2000 or 2001, none were brought.

 I shall give way to all three hon. Members shortly. I simply want to make it clear that legislation exists to deal with some of the problems.

Similar effects have been reported in Iceland, Ireland and Canada, while a reduction in licensing hours in Norway, Finland and Sweden led a decrease of alcohol consumption among heavy drinkers.&quot;</p>

 The hon. Gentleman is largely right.

Nightclubs contribute equally to the problem in many of our town centres, yet they will get away scot-free. That simply does not make sense. Why will pubs have to pay &#163;1,200 for the first year and &#163;700 in subsequent years, when nightclubs will pay nothing? We know the answer. The legislation defined nightclubs as not being primarily for the sale of alcohol. The Government should have spotted that and done something about it.

However, if they delay applying for their licence for as long as possible, they will not have to pay for their renewed licence until very much later.

If the sitting had been suspended or the building had been evacuated, that would have been a legitimate reason for refusing entry. However, if it is the Metropolitan Police Commissioner who, in contravention of the Sessional Orders, has prevented Members from entering, may I ask for Mr. Speaker to request the Home Secretary to come and make a statement to the House? I believe that that is a serious contempt of Parliament and know of no constitutional precedent for Members being refused entry while the House is in session.

 What we need are more flexible opening hours, and that is one welcome aspect of the Act. Flexible opening hours will certainly be a big improvement on the current position. Few if any establishments will want to open for 24 hours. Indeed, I think the Minister confirmed that none had applied to do so. A more flexible system to replace a single chucking-out time will probably lead to a more staggered leaving of pubs and clubs&#151;if that is the right term to use in this context. It would not work

<br>&nbsp;<br>if some pubs closed at 1 am, some at 2 am and some at 3 am, because people would simply move from one to another, but I think that the later such establishments stay open, the more likely people are to disperse gradually. The current thinking of the Tyneside police is that the appropriate time is 3 am. I do not know whether that is the case, but it is probably about right.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50712-31_para11">
<a name="stpa_307">The Act will be an improvement on the current system because of that greater flexibility and because there will be a single licence rather than the six for which people must often apply nowadays. After the initial registration, there will be less red tape. The Act will also bring more local control and more consideration of the needs of local communities.

 Given the concerns of many chief constables, might it not have been better to trial the arrangements in certain towns to establish whether they would indeed reduce binge drinking and the violence that results from it?
</p>





<p><a name="st_279"><a name="50712-31_spnew7"><b> Mr. Clelland: </b> 
 So far as I am aware, this proposal has been trialled throughout Europe, and notably in Scotland, for many years. The experience is that flexible opening does lead to less binge drinking and to less trouble on the streets.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50712-31_para12">
<a name="stpa_308">The Act will also give local representatives more power to control licensed premises in their area in the interests of the local community, and to tailor activities and opening hours accordingly. For instance, local authorities might treat pubs and clubs on housing estates differently from those in city centres. But there is no doubt that implementation has led to some problems and I hope that the Minister will look again at how some of them might be alleviated. I do not share in the doom and gloom and cries of &quot;Chaos!&quot; from Opposition Members, but there are some issues that need to be addressed.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50712-31_para13">
<a name="stpa_309">Last week, I had the honour to be elected joint chair of the all-party group on non-profit making members&#039; clubs. There are more than 5,000 of these private clubs throughout the country, and they are covered by the Working Men&#039;s Club and Institute Union and the Committee of Registered Clubs&#039; Associations. Such clubs include working men&#039;s clubs, Royal British Legion clubs, RAF clubs, and Labour, Conservative and Liberal clubs. They are run for, and by, the members themselves. The members elect the committees and the committees elect the secretaries. They do not have the resources or the professional expertise of the big organisations. They are run by&#151;dare I say it?&#151;amateurs, although often very professionally. Some do have full-time secretaries, but they are not the professionals whom we expect to see in the big organisations.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50712-31_para14">
<a name="stpa_310">There is no doubt that many club secretaries have found filling in the 18-page form daunting. I agree with the right hon. Member for Maidenhead (Mrs. May)&#151;that does not happen often&#151;that, regardless of the number of boxes that club secretaries eventually need to tick, they still have to read the entire form to decide which need to be ticked and which do not. I spoke to one of my local club secretaries&#151;a very intelligent man who runs an excellent club&#151;as recently as last Saturday, and on first receiving the form, he found it daunting and put 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>12 Jul 2005 : Column 786</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>it away in a drawer. On looking at it carefully some time later, he discovered that it was not as daunting as he first thought. On the other hand, club secretaries are often elderly and not necessarily computer-literate. They have found dealing with these issues difficult, which may explain why less than 25 per cent. of clubs have returned their applications to date. Of course, the rate of return is increasing as 6 August appears on the horizon, but that in itself could cause problems as local authorities struggle to deal with an avalanche of applications. The Minister will doubtless want, as he has said, to stick to the deadline, but it is obvious that there will have to be some flexibility.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50712-31_para15">
<a name="stpa_311">I am afraid to say that there has also been a considerable increase in the associated costs for clubs. A &#163;16 licence will now cost &#163;190, and to that must be added the cost of solicitors. The right hon. Member for Maidenhead said that solicitors have a licence to print money, but they have never needed a licence&#151;they do it without one. Architects&#039; plans are very expensive and we should also consider the cost of advertising. Some newspapers have capitalised on the situation by doubling the cost of such advertising. Clubs are having to fork out as much as &#163;1,000&#151;that is not an unusual sum&#151;to comply with the administration associated with this legislation, so this is a problem. The Minister said that the legislation will save the industry some &#163;2 million a year, but it will not save working men&#039;s clubs and non-profit making members&#039; clubs that sort of money. They do not make a profit, so the extra costs will have to fall on the members.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50712-31_para16">
<a name="stpa_312">On Monday, I asked the Minister whether he would include a representative of clubs on the licensing fees review panel, which Sir Les Elton will chair. The fee structure is a very important issue for clubs, so I hope that he will look at it and that more can be done to help clubs through that vehicle. Will he also look at the way in which local authorities are handling this matter? There is evidence to suggest that some councils and some police forces are pressurising clubs into applying for a premises licence, rather than the club premises certificate. That might make matters easier for local authorities and the police, but it will not be advantageous to clubs. They would be well advised not to take that course and to stick to the premises certificate.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50712-31_para17">
<a name="stpa_313">There are some advantages for clubs in the new legislation. One is that they will be able to hold up to 12 special events in which non-members can participate without having to apply each time for a special licence. That will apply to weddings, christenings, birthdays and so forth and is to be welcomed. That was the intention. However, we now find that some local authorities take the view that if &quot;The Dog and Duck&quot; darts team visits the local club for a game of darts, that represents one of those special events. If that happens, all the special events in most clubs will be taken up in the first month, which I am sure is not what the Minister intended. I hope that he will look further into the problem and ensure that local authorities are advised that that is not the intention behind the Act.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50712-31_para18">

 My right hon. Friend the Member for Maidenhead (Mrs. May) provided us with a long list of complainants and most of the complaints also apply to my constituency. However, I want to focus on one particular aspect&#151;village halls. The Prime Minister gave us a glimmer of hope, and the Leader of the House a faint glimmer of hope the next day, but I have to say that, in a Westminster Hall debate, the Minister brushed aside village halls in about five words. He seems to be a little more amenable this evening. I rather hope that we can secure much more rapid progress than he suggested in his opening speech.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50712-32_para0">
<a name="stpa_315">As I mentioned in an intervention during the Westminster Hall debate, my constituency has about 32 villages, almost all of which have halls as well as churches that also have halls. I estimate a total of about 50 such halls in my constituency.

<a name="stpa_316">I cannot remember receiving so much vitriolic correspondence from so many people as I have received in connection with these halls. I would like to present to the Minister a few extracts from those letters. People from the Leigh village hall, for example, justly proclaimed that the hall was

<a name="stpa_321">Another example is from people associated with the Beare Green village hall. I shall pick out just a few points from a very long letter. The letter explains that the hall has been sustained up to now on the basis of making a tiny profit from each event. It runs a number of events and views a good profit as &#163;100. Presently, six event licences cost &#163;10 in total, but under the new regime, each temporary event notice licence will cost &#163;21, putting the total up to &#163;126, which obliterates more than the profit from one event.

<a name="stpa_325">I am aware that some of my hon. Friends want to add to my comments, so I shall be prompt. Essentially, under the new regime, people associated with my village halls feel that there is excessive bureaucracy. They have to produce plans, but they are not clear why they are required. Some have felt the need, as mentioned earlier, to consult lawyers and they are also required to produce an operating schedule&#151;whatever that is for these tiny little halls.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50712-32_para11">
<a name="stpa_326">Generally, each of these little village halls is run by a small group of people who are bullied and cajoled into serving. No one wants to be the designated licence holder. All the people to whom I have spoken think it ludicrous that the temporary event notice licence has been set at one dozen, and most would like the limit to be three or four dozen. Moreover, all of them feel that the fees are far too high, especially given the minimal profit&#151;if any&#151;that the halls make. The House must bear it in mind that most village halls are run for the community, not for profit.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50712-32_para12">
<a name="stpa_327">Some positive points have been made in the debate. I hope that the Minister will take them forward, and that he will do so quickly, as village halls that do not break even will close and never open again. I am tempted to suggest that Ministers might consider setting a de minimis level for some of the very small halls. Such halls serve very small communities and are run by a very few people, and they could easily fall below the de minimis level.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50712-32_para13">
<a name="stpa_328">In such cases, there is clearly a need for a dramatic reduction in the fees. I hope that the Minister will consider changing the thinking behind the Act slightly and introducing the concept of personal licence holders for temporary events. Under that proposal, the person running an event would apply for a licence, at the previous level of &#163;10. He or she would take responsibility for the event, with the result that the hall would not have to provide a person who would be personally responsible.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50712-32_para14">
<a name="stpa_329">Local halls are vital in rural areas such as mine. Surrey is full of such halls, and they are of enormous value. Events such as Guy Fawkes night, Christmas and new year&#039;s eve will be on us soon, and the House must remember that local halls also present film evenings, opera sessions and so on. Although he does not come from a rural area, I hope that the Minister will accept that they play a very important role. We must save our village halls but, if it is not changed, this Act will destroy them.

I know that this Sir Les is not the same one, but I think that he will live in our minds because of that very identification.

<a name="50712-33_para8">
<a name="stpa_342">I wish to refer briefly to the efforts made by my constituent, Rodney Tate, who has been engaged in long correspondence with both newspapers and others to set out the problems. I pay tribute to him. Like my hon. Friend the Member for Mole Valley (Sir Paul Beresford), I am picking out one example&#151;I could pick out many more, as there are 54 parish councils, well over 70 villages and a lot of village halls in my constituency. Rodney&#039;s criticisms are shared by a good number of others. I am grateful to Sue Norman of the Bedfordshire Rural Communities Charity, who has also been very active on behalf of village halls, which she loves and promotes. She shares with many others genuine concerns about the legislation&#039;s impact.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50712-33_para9">
<a name="stpa_343">Rodney has been mentioned before in a previous speech as bringing the House up to date about these concerns. Swineshead is a village with 125 people in the northern part of North-East Bedfordshire. It has no pub&#151;the pub closed about 10 years ago&#151;and no shop. An active village hall committee is absolutely vital to the village&#039;s well-being. Profits are modest and are used to benefit the village, so the taking away of any profits in extra bureaucracy makes a substantial difference.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50712-33_para10">
<a name="stpa_344">Notwithstanding the review that is sent to Sir Les, I ask the Minister to pay urgent and immediate attention to issues that relate to cost in the first instance. The village hall&#039;s direct licensing costs this year will increase from &#163;10 per annum to &#163;240. As my right hon. Friend the Member for Maidenhead (Mrs. May) mentioned, the annual renewal charge will be &#163;70 for that village hall. Villagers can think of better uses for that hard-raised money than spending it on those extra costs.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50712-33_para11">
<a name="stpa_345">The excessive bureaucracy was somewhat dismissed by the hon. Member for West Bromwich, West, but Mr. Tate tells us that he has spent a total of a week on seminars, form filling and correspondence. He draws attention to the fact that thousands of on-licence premises now need to apply for a variation of their new premises licences so that they can retain the extended opening hours over bank holiday weekends that were previously granted by magistrates&#039; block extensions. As the hon. Member for Tyne Bridge (Mr. Clelland) said in his good and measured speech, that leads to extra fees, advertisements and notices to official bodies, so there is more bureaucracy to do something that is currently achieved with little fuss.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50712-33_para12">
<a name="stpa_346">When the Minister conducts his review, will he consider the different interpretations of the Act by local authorities that is leading to different levels of fees being charged in otherwise similar circumstances? The duties of designated premises supervisors has again been raised because their onerous nature is driving people away from volunteering to do that important social job in their villages.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50712-33_para13">

<a name="stpa_353">I merely point out to the House the nonsense of such a condition even being suggested to a village hall, notwithstanding the fact that now that I have publicised it, I might be inundated with letters from the good people from Swineshead who perhaps do not agree with their chairman&#039;s quick approach on such a condition.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50712-34_para6">
<a name="stpa_354">I shall rest my case. Conservative Members have tried to suggest that elements of the Act are nonsense for village halls. Despite the humour that some objections have caused, the serious point is exactly that raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Mole Valley. The people who run village halls are volunteers, so the burden of their paperwork will be onerous. The money taken out of village halls due to bureaucracy will be lost to communities.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50712-34_para7">
<a name="stpa_355">People genuinely fear that damage will be caused. This is not scaremongering; it is real for those who have been campaigning on the matter for a long time. If the Minister and his colleagues can encourage Sir Les to conduct a rapid review of the circumstances and make some concessions for village halls, perhaps the Bill&#039;s good aspects will not be swept away with concerns about the bad.

 It is a great pleasure to follow the hon. Member for North-East Bedfordshire (Alistair Burt), who put his case in his usual measured way. I feel I now know everything there is to know about Swineshead, and am all the better for it. I can boast more villages in my constituency than he can. I have 88, many with pubs and village halls, and I am doing my bit to publicise the licensing laws by going around as many of them as I can.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50712-34_para8">
<a name="stpa_356">I look forward immensely to 24 November. It will be a great day in our history when we finally sweep away the licensing laws, dating from Lloyd George and the first world war. At last, we will be able to go out and have a drink after going to the theatre or cinema and will not have to pay large amounts to go into a club environment. At last, when I am wandering around some of the 88 villages in my constituency and happen on a pub near to closing time that has its curtains drawn and is staying open after 11 o&#039;clock, I will not have to leave as the Member of Parliament because it will be legal for well-run premises to stay open that late. As chairman of the all-party group on beer, it is almost worth throwing a party to celebrate that day when it comes.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50712-34_para9">
<a name="stpa_357">I noticed two different approaches from the Opposition parties. The Liberal Democrats took a fundamental approach. Unlike some of my colleagues, I like Liberal Democrats. [Hon. Members: &quot;Oh!&quot;] I do. Progressives are few and far between in North Yorkshire. It was once a completely blue county and we had many alliances. It is a cause of particular disappointment to me that the hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster) has gone back to the original Lloyd George position. The logic of his argument is that there should be no flexibility in opening hours. What would that do for binge drinking? People who go out under our current restrictive licensing laws are younger people. Our towns and city centres would remain dominated by them and they would have the same incentives to drink far too much far too quickly.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50712-34_para10">
<a name="stpa_358">According to an incomplete survey by the all-party beer group, more than 2,000 licensed premises have applied for extended hours. They do not want 24-hour opening, but an extra hour or two on a Thursday, Friday or Saturday. Those premises have had no objections and the applications have gone through on the nod. The only controversial application that I have been involved in was for the Charles pub in Heslington village. It is a student pub with a long record of complaints of noise and nuisance, and the application was rejected.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50712-34_para11">
<a name="stpa_359">I worry about the change in the Liberal Democrats&#039; position. The hon. Gentleman said&#151;I am sorry he is not in the Chamber to hear my little critique&#151;that it is a pity that only a fifth of local councils have adopted the saturation clauses. Many rural districts do not have the problems of saturation of licensed premises that might be found in urban areas. It is not surprising that only a few of them have taken up that option.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50712-34_para12">

<p>
<a name="50712-34_para13">
<a name="stpa_361">On village halls and sports clubs, the Minister has not done at all badly in recent weeks in grasping the issues quickly. Perhaps village hall and sports club secretaries are made of sterner stuff in Selby than they are in Surrey, but I have had only one letter on the subject. I do not mean to decry the seriousness of the subject. The one sports group that wrote to me is having to pay a &#163;300 fee. On the other hand, it is getting &#163;17,000 in rate relief from the Government. It is a large sports club. I worry more about the smaller sports clubs and some of the smaller village halls.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50712-34_para14">
<a name="stpa_362">Some interesting ideas have been put to the Minister, such as basing rateable value on the size of the bar and extending somewhat the number of temporary event notices. However, until Sir Les Elton undertakes his study and takes his evidence, it will be difficult to judge the impact of raising the number of temporary event notices from 12 to 15. What difference would that make to village halls? How many village halls would that help? By bringing forward the initial study and the initial review by 12 months so that we have the report by November, I think that my hon. Friend the Minister is responding to criticisms that are real but can be exaggerated.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50712-34_para15">
<a name="stpa_363">In the week that we won the Olympics, I hope that some of the London councils will now adopt a less churlish approach to the Act. The leader of Westminster city council has been quoted in a positive way. I am glad that he is beginning to recognise the potential for the development of London&#039;s entertainment sector in a safe way but also in an innovative way, now that councils have a say in licensing. We do not need a great structure of bureaucracy to implement the provisions in the Act in Westminster or in any of the London authorities, as health and safety and environment provisions are already very much in place. The fire authority is also in place, so those provisions do not need to be replicated.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50712-34_para16">
<a name="stpa_364">We need, however, to get a night life in London that is fit for the Olympic games. One of the first meetings that I went to about licensing laws was held by an organisation called London First. It said that we would never get a great sporting event unless we had a safe and varied night life of which we could be proud. We have six or seven years to get that right.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50712-34_para17">
<a name="stpa_365">The hon. Member for Bath has missed most of my critique, but as someone who went to Singapore and argued the case strongly for Britain, can he imagine having the Olympic games in London in 2012 without having some form of flexible opening hours? Will all the many visitors to London and all the many athletes, unlike in Athens last summer, have to go home at 11 pm? What a laughing stock we would be if that were the case.

<a name="50712-34_para18">
<a name="stpa_366">I share with other Members serious concern about the hard-drinking culture that seems to be prevalent, particularly among young people. I represent a tourist area, and there are concerns about the effects of the Act on small bed-and-breakfast businesses. My particular concern, which I have taken up with the Minister before, relates to the unavailability of Welsh language application forms so close to the deadline of 6 August. This might be a small matter in the grand scheme of things but it is particularly important to my constituency and to other constituencies in Wales.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50712-34_para19">
<a name="stpa_367">As I have said, I have discussed the matter with the Minister previously. I had a useful meeting with him along with my hon. Friend the Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy (Mr. Llwyd) and others. I am glad that the Minister has moved from his initial position with reference to the non-production of Welsh language forms when he said:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_83">&quot;The decision was taken that as most of the applications would be processed in English, it would be better for them to be submitted in English&quot;.&#151; [<i>Official Report</i>, 13 June 2005; Vol. 434, c. 8.]</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50712-34_para20">
<a name="stpa_368">That is decidedly not the case.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50712-34_para21">
<a name="stpa_369">I raised a further question with him yesterday because the situation has moved on in that Conwy county borough council in north Wales has now produced Welsh versions of the prescribed English forms. These Welsh versions are not prescribed, and I take the point that the Minister has made that it will not now be possible to prescribe Welsh language forms for another three months or so. However, the Minister has indicated that the Government are willing for local authorities in Wales to use the Conwy translation for now. That is all right as far as it goes, but some local authorities worry that a precedent might be established. If central Government have not provided the appropriate Welsh language documents, those authorities fear that they may be expected to step in. I hope that the current circumstances are unique and that no such precedent has been set.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50712-34_para22">
<a name="stpa_370">There are, however, further problems. Some local authorities may take the prudent view that they should not use forms that are not officially prescribed. Would they be liable if there were a dispute with an unsuccessful applicant, who could cite the fact that the Welsh forms that they used were not prescribed? More straightforwardly, who would be liable if there was a mistake in translation? Licensees might reasonably expect to use officially prescribed Welsh language forms and could be wary about using locally produced versions. Hon. Members may wonder how the situation has arisen and how the Government have got into a fix so close to the 6 August deadline. Essentially, the problems arise from a deficiency in the Welsh Language Act 1993, which provides for the publication of Welsh language schemes that provide guidance on the production of Welsh language material. It is surprising that, 12 years after the passage of the Act, the Department for Culture, Media and Sport has not prepared a Welsh language scheme. It has not been asked to do so, but I understand that it will now prepare such a scheme, which is most welcome.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50712-34_para23">
<a name="stpa_371">Finally, on a positive note, the Minister will be glad to hear that subsequent to our discussions, my own local authority, Gwynedd county council will adopt and adapt the Conwy forms. Those forms may be used in 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>12 Jul 2005 : Column 797</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>only a small number of cases, but I hope that they will solve the problem. The council will also take steps to publicise the availability of the Welsh language forms, and will target information at applicants who may wish to use them. I do not know whether all local authorities in Wales will take such action, but the positive steps taken by Gwynedd county council are welcome. It has pointed out, however, that Conwy county borough council has translated only five of the 100 or so forms available in English. The sooner that all prescribed forms are available in Welsh the better.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50712-34_para24">
<a name="stpa_372">As I said, the problem has arisen because of a weakness in the 1993 Act. DCMS was not asked to produce a Welsh language scheme, so it was not prompted to produce Welsh language forms. In Wales, that is interpreted as a reason for a further review of the Act and, indeed, as proof that it needs to be replaced. That is certainly my position, and it is the position of my party.

 I am grateful to the hon. Member for Caernarfon (Hywel Williams) for keeping his speech brief and giving me an opportunity to address the House. I have discussed the issue with the Minister on previous occasions because, unlike the constituents of the hon. Member for West Bromwich, West (Mr. Bailey), two categories of people in my area have been inadvertently affected, including small, independent publicans. Much of the Licensing Act 2003 appears to have been drafted to allow major pub-owning groups to comply with the immense additional bureaucracy that, as I have seen for myself, is involved in the initial application. I appreciate that the application may not have to be repeated, but for a publican operating on his own, perhaps with the help of his wife&#151;many of the pubs that are still going in villages in my rural constituency are run in that way&#151;the prospect of having to complete a 77-page application is overwhelming. In a village near Bridgnorth that I shall not name for fear of precipitating problems, the publican is in the throes of deciding whether to carry on, given the challenge of completing the application form, not least the requirement to provide a seating plan of his pub. For what purpose? What on earth has that got to do with having a licence or not having a licence? There may be other health and safety reasons, such as fire regulations, for providing a seating plan showing the position of the chairs, but that has nothing to do with a licence. That is one category about which I am concerned.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50712-35_para0">
<a name="stpa_373">As the Minister is present, I want to raise an issue that was touched on by the hon. Member for Caernarfon&#151;small guest houses. He mentioned bed and breakfasts in his constituency. We have a number of small guest houses in some of the towns in my constituency. I am thinking particularly of Church Stretton, an area that is trying to attract rural tourism. A number of the small houses there might have two or three bedrooms for use as bed-and-breakfast accommodation. They have a licence for the sale of the odd bottle of wine. The Minister said that the legislation would save money for these licence holders. At present a three-year licence costs &#163;30. The licensees now face a tenfold increase in the cost of obtaining a licence. If they are selling only a few bottles of wine a year, I am told they will not bother 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>12 Jul 2005 : Column 798</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>to carry on doing so. So the Act may reduce the services available to the tourists in the area, making it less attractive and reducing economic activity.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50712-35_para1">
<a name="stpa_374">My constituent who runs The Studio restaurant in Church Stretton was unfortunate enough to go up a rateable value band as a result of the change in the rateable valuation. As a result, his fee will increase not just by 10 times the current charge, but more like 20 times, from &#163;30 to &#163;730 for no reason whatsoever, other than that his rateable value just tipped him over into band B.
</p>

<a name="50712-35_para2">
<a name="stpa_375">The second category, village halls, has been mentioned by many hon. Members. Rather than quote at length from the raft of examples raised with me by village hall committees, I shall pick up two points to illustrate the financial viability question posed by the legislation and a point about TENs. Brian Wilkes, who is the chairman of the Cleobury North and district village hall committee, tells me that the village hall
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_84">&quot;is run entirely by volunteers and last year the income was less than &#163;3,000, with expenses of &#163;3,600.

<p>

<a name="stpa_376">He is concerned that the committee will not be able to put on sufficient events to meet its costs.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50712-35_para4">
<a name="stpa_377">The other example comes from Mrs. Mollie Oatley MBE, who is the secretary to the management committee of the Newcastle community centre, which is a thriving centre but has running costs of &#163;10,000 per annum. At present the licence is provided by the village publican, Mr. Tony Burton of the Crown Inn, who runs the community bar and provides the profits as a contribution towards the hall.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50712-35_para5">
<a name="stpa_378">Because the committee has to hold so many events in order to meet its costs, the 12 permits allowed under the temporary events notice are insufficient, so the committee is contemplating having a full premises licence to allow 50 licensed events per annum. The problem is that Mr. Burton, as the first point of contact, is not prepared to undertake responsibility for that number of occasions during the year. As a consequence, he is proposing to pull out of the arrangement with the community centre and none of the other trustees are prepared to take it on. The point is a serious one, which I hope the Minister will address in his concluding remarks.

<a name="stpa_382">The progress of the Act from July 2003 has been dogged by periods of delay and inactivity, accompanied by a refusal by all DCMS Ministers to revisit the timetable although it has been glaringly obvious that the necessary infrastructure has not been in place early enough to move forward to the next stage. It took a whole year for the Government to finalise the guidance to the Act. That guidance, which was acknowledged by both Houses of Parliament as being fundamental to an understanding of the Act, was published only on 7 July 2004, when councils were obliged to draft, consult and finalise their licensing policies. An Act of 201 clauses and guidance of 178 pages takes some understanding. Add to that the fact that at the time none of the secondary regulations had even been drafted, never mind approved, and if ever there was a recipe for confusion right from the start, that was it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50712-35_para10">
<a name="stpa_383">The application in the transition phase runs to more than 245 pages, and copies of the 26-page form that my right hon. Friend the Member for Maidenhead (Mrs.   May) showed to the House have to be sent to eight    &quot;responsible authorities&quot; plus the Licensing Authority&#151;nine in total. The number of pages is the same whether or not one wants to change the licence in any way. Thanks to the Government&#039;s refusal to grant grandfather rights for the provision of live music under the two-in-a-bar rule and the loss of bank holiday extensions, many businesses will have to fill in 18 pages of the 26-page form that relates to varying the licence. The form is complicated and the process itself is complicated. I have had letters from individuals running clubs&#151;experienced retired business people&#151;who say that it took them 200 hours to complete the form satisfactorily to the Licensing Authority&#039;s requirements.

<p>
<a name="50712-35_para11">
<a name="stpa_384">In many cases, the lack of information meant that councils could not release draft policies until September or October, thereby truncating the consultation process and time for consideration. Regulations were finally laid on 13 January to come into force on 7 February, the first appointed day. Even at that stage, the forms on the DCMS website were incorrect and did not conform to the regulations. Corrections had to be made to the forms, which were reissued on 7 February.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50712-35_para12">
<a name="stpa_385">It proved difficult, without the forms, the regulations for the required plans, the advertising requirements and other similar details, for businesses and councils to plan ahead. In March, several interested parties, including the Local Government Association, the Local Authorities Coordinators of Local Services, the British Beer and Pub Association, the Association of Licensed Multiple Retailers, the British Institute of Innkeeping, Business in Sport and Leisure and the Association of Chief Police Officers, wrote to the then Minister to express their concern about the lack of applications to licensing authorities.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50712-35_para13">
<a name="stpa_386">Several issues, which caused delays and obstructions in the system, were highlighted. They included a lack of awareness of the new law among existing licence holders, especially small independent businesses, and the late laying of regulations. Many of the problems could have been avoided by postponing the start of the application process&#151;that is, the first appointed day. That would have given more time for everyone to get to grips with the intricacies of the process.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50712-35_para14">
<a name="stpa_387">The hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster) mentioned the due date for annual fees, which are required to be paid on the anniversary of the granting of a licence. That provides no incentive for early applications. Other problems include: the absence of a slip rule in the regulations, which would allow the correction of minor errors rather than mean the rejection of applications; the implications of alterations to licences after the first appointed day, for example, the change of licensee, and the lack of clarity around aspects of the existing law, which the new Act perpetuates. I refer especially to embedded rights and restrictions about which the DCMS and the Local Government Association cannot agree even at this late hour.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50712-35_para15">
<a name="stpa_388">Several hon. Members mentioned village halls, including my hon. Friends the Members for Mole Valley (Sir Paul Beresford) and for North-East Bedfordshire (Alistair Burt) and my right hon. Friend the Member for Maidenhead. The Under-Secretary&#039;s concession of an offer to revisit TENs is tantamount to accepting that the Act has got it wrong. Although it is reassuring to know that he spoke to representatives of ACRE only today, they must have told him what they told us back in spring 2003. ACRE was not offered meetings then, and the Government arrogantly rejected its sensible proposals for practical implementation of the new licensing regime.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50712-35_para16">
<a name="stpa_389">We tabled amendments to address the key issues of the number of temporary permissions, the special case for voluntary and non-profit-making organisations, increased costs for licensing and the added administrative burdens for volunteers in village communities. The relevant amendment in Committee was No. 213, which was moved at column 456 of the <i>Official Report</i> of Standing Committee D on Thursday 8 May 2003. The Under-Secretary need look no further 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>12 Jul 2005 : Column 801</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>because ACRE gave us that amendment, which deals exactly with the points raised in the debate. It defines a voluntary organisation and it requested the number of TENs to be increased from five to 24. The Government conceded 12. The Under-Secretary&#039;s offer to reassess that is welcome but it is frustrating that that could have been sorted out more than a year ago.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50712-35_para17">
<a name="stpa_390">Many hon. Members raised the time scale for implementation, including my right hon. Friend the Member for Maidenhead, the hon. Member for Bath and the hon. Member for West Bromwich, West. The cut-off date of 6 August for transitional applications is probably set in stone at this late hour. However, the second appointed day is not. We still await the statutory instrument to legitimise the date. Since there is no time, I suggest that, before the House goes into recess, the Under-Secretary must be reserving his option to monitor developments through the recess and well into October. I predict that, if a backlog remains, thereby choking up local authority licensing committees, the statutory instrument will not confirm 24 November but a date that is, as my right hon. Friend requested, well into the new year 2006.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50712-35_para18">
<a name="stpa_391">We can well understand the Minister&#039;s reluctance to indicate any slippage at this juncture, but if the fears of many of those directly involved are realised, the sheer volume of applications sitting with local authorities and the cases queuing up for appeal hearings will force the Minister to do a major U-turn. As with so many sensible and practical suggestions relating to this legislation, &quot;You heard it here first!&quot;

<p><a name="st_295"><a name="50712-36_spmin0"><b>The Minister of State, Department for Culture, Media and Sport  (Mr. Richard Caborn): </b> 
 When licensing and entertainment are on the agenda, we always have a lively debate. We have certainly had one this evening. There is broad consensus that the objectives of the Bill&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i> Well, the hon. Member for North-East Bedfordshire (Alistair Burt), who is one of the more measured Members of the House, made a very sensible contribution&#151;
</p>





<p><a name="st_296"><a name="50712-36_spnew0"><b> Alistair Burt: </b> 
 A short one.
</p>





<p><a name="st_297"><a name="50712-36_spnew1"><b> Mr. Caborn: </b> 
 Yes, but it was a very measured one. He homed in on a problem that has been discussed again this evening, namely that of village halls. We will take those issues on board through the high-level committee. One issue has been taken out of context today: Members said that there had been just one meeting with ACRE. There has been a whole series of such meetings, and ACRE welcomed the fact today that we had moved on temporary licensing. I should like to quote ACRE&#039;s newsletter of June 2005. It states:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_85">&quot;ACRE (Action with Communities in Rural England) has been following the implementation of the Act and working with the Communications and Strategy Team at DCMS who have been very helpful in explaining the new processes and providing guidance and legal interpretation of the new legislation. They have set up the Live Music Forum to encourage the provision of live music in licensed premises . . . and published Countdown to explain the Act in a user-friendly way . . . Training sessions for village hall advisers have also taken place with the support of DCMS&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50712-36_para0">
<a name="stpa_392">I am not going to say that all the problems have been resolved. Clearly they have not, and a great deal of concern has been expressed this evening. However, let us 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>12 Jul 2005 : Column 802</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>be clear that what we are trying to do with this piece of legislation is to modernise in a way that most sensible people would want us to. We are reducing bureaucracy by merging six regulatory regimes into one. That is important for this country. This is about bringing the licensing regime into the 21st century. Central to that is the empowerment of local communities by increasing their right of intervention, which will be particularly important in licensing cases. The Act will enhance the democratic accountability and empowerment of local authorities; that is where we believe such powers should lie.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50712-36_para1">
<a name="stpa_393">On the problems of binge drinking in modern society, we have removed the nuclear option that existed before. We have expanded police powers the better to enable the police to respond in a proportionate way when tackling crime and antisocial behaviour. That has been welcomed by many, particularly those in the police force and in the Association of Chief Police Officers, which recently reaffirmed its support for the Act.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50712-36_para2">
<a name="stpa_394">The Act merges six complicated and, in some cases, outdated regulatory regimes into one. This will affect about 190,000 licensing authorities. We accept that there will be problems with implementation, but we shall be able to implement the provisions in regard to fees and to the operation of the Act, particularly for village halls and sports clubs. The hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire (Mr. Moss) did not choose a very good example of a club. Yesterday at Question Time, the hon. Member for Wimbledon (Stephen Hammond) mentioned Wimbledon cricket club. The club has an adult membership of 1,200, and an additional 800 junior members. It has a 9-acre site and is one of the wealthiest clubs in the country, thanks to the six-figure sum paid to it by its neighbour, the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet club, which uses the site for car parking and corporate hospitality. It is therefore quite a wealthy club. I know that some Conservative Members might want to prosecute their case that such clubs should not pay the licence fee, but that would be wrong.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50712-36_para3">
<a name="stpa_395">The main reason for this major piece of modernisation is something that the Opposition have been crying out for for years, namely the reduction of red tape and bureaucracy. That is what we are going to achieve. We are moving the whole licensing regime in a direction that many people in the tourism industry have been calling for. We have debated the tourism industry many times in the Chamber, and discussed how we want to modernise it and to increase its activity. The Act provides the tools to do that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50712-36_para4">
<a name="stpa_396">In relation to entertainment, which is linked to tourism with regard to central London, it is important that we modernise our licensing regimes. The chairman of the British Beer and Pubs Association said as late as 15 May this year that the Government
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_86">&quot;have delivered flexibility. We have seen the back of the ludicrous 11 pm closing time.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50712-36_para5">
<a name="stpa_397">Therefore, the Act has had tremendous support across the board.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50712-36_para6">
<a name="stpa_398">In terms of sports clubs, no Government have helped truly amateur sports clubs more than we have. We introduced mandatory rate relief, for which there have been calls for more than 30 years, and our investment in 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>12 Jul 2005 : Column 803</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>amateur sports clubs is second to none. If there are problems with genuine sports clubs, we will consider that, as I said that we would with regard to village halls.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50712-36_para7">
<a name="stpa_399">I cannot do justice to all the points raised this evening, but I will respond in writing on those that I do not cover. Let me just respond to the point made by the Opposition spokesman about 24-hour opening not being an issue. The right hon. Member for Haltemprice and Howden (David Davis), who might be the new leader of the Conservative party, said on 30 June,
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_87">&quot;What on earth is the Government doing? In the face of these figures, its policy of 24-hour drinking is nothing short of madness.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50712-36_para8">
<a name="stpa_400">And on 8 June, he said:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_88">&quot;Given that a lot of violent crime is caused by binge drinking, it beggars belief that the Government are going ahead with 24-hour opening&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50712-36_para9">
<a name="stpa_401">How can Opposition spokesmen say that there is no disagreement about 24-hour opening? They ought to get their act together.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50712-36_para10">
<a name="stpa_402">As for the comments of the hon. Member for Bath    (Mr. Foster)&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i> The Yorkshire pronunciation is &quot;Bath&quot;, although I know that it is &quot;Barth&quot; down there. I think it is also &quot;Bath&quot; in Scotland. On the question of delay, the hon. Member for Bath accused me, as the then Minister with responsibility for licensing, of procrastination and of not bringing the measure forward. At the turn of the year, he changed his mind, as the Liberals are prone to do, and now argues that he wants a delay. We never know where the Liberals stand. On the one hand they argue that they want a delay, while on the other they say they do not. But I assure you, Mr. Speaker, that there is no delay. We will make sure that the Act is implemented.
</p>





<p><a name="st_298"><a name="50712-36_spnew2"><b> Mr. Walker: </b> 
 Will the Minister give way?
</p>





<p><a name="st_299"><a name="50712-36_spnew3"><b> Mr. Caborn: </b> 
 No.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50712-36_para11">
<a name="stpa_403">In relation to the points made about the Local Government Association, may I put on record the role that local government and the Local Government Association have played overall in the implementation of the Act? It has been professional, detailed and extremely helpful. I say that from my own experience. As I said at Question Time on Monday, in the case of my trades and labour club, of which I am the honorary president, the volunteer who runs it, Alan Jackson, an ex-National Union of Public Employees steward, has got our licence through without any help from solicitors. That cost under &#163;200, and the club has a turnover of about &#163;500,000 a year. He admitted that it was a little difficult to start with, but once the steward&#039;s wife helped with filling out the form, it was pretty simple. The only mistake that Sheffield trades and labour club made in its application for a licence is that while we have all these extensions, we will only be open until 5 o&#039;clock in the morning on general election night. That is disgraceful&#151;as we will win the next two elections, the extension ought to be until midday the following day.

<p><a name="st_313"><i>Motion made, and Question proposed,</i> That this House do now adjourn.&#151;<i>[Mr. Dhanda.]</i>

</p>





<p><a name="st_314"><a name="50712-37_spnew1"><b> Malcolm Bruce  (Gordon) (LD):</b> 
 I believe myself fortunate to secure this debate on the proposed closure of the Met Office in Aberdeen in my constituency, just a week before the House rises for the summer. The proposal has caused widespread dismay and consternation, as the Aberdeen office is the only civilian weather forecasting operation in Scotland. I express my appreciation for the cross-party support that the campaign to have the decision reversed has gathered.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50712-37_para1">
<a name="stpa_406">I note with satisfaction that the Minister has made it clear that the final decision is his. I am glad that I and others will have the chance to press the case with him tonight, although the campaign will not end with this debate.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50712-37_para2">
<a name="stpa_407">My first concern has to do with the way that the decision has been handled. Staff learned through an internal e-mail that the option to close all six branches had been chosen by the Met Office board. Internal consultation was then initiated on the basis of a done deal. Not surprisingly, that caused anger and resentment, and the information was then leaked into the public domain rather than announced in an orderly fashion by the Met Office management.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50712-37_para3">
<a name="stpa_408">At present, there are six Met Office branches apart from the headquarters in Exeter. The one in Aberdeen is the only one in Scotland, and the others are in Belfast, Cardiff, Manchester, Birmingham and London. Of course, there have been management changes in the Met Office. The decision by Dr. David Rogers to leave following his marriage clearly created a hiatus. I understand that he finishes at the end of this week, and that he may have attended his last board meeting today. It is perhaps worth putting it on record that he stated in his farewell message:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_95">&quot;It has been a privilege to lead the Met Office during this period of transformation&quot;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50712-37_para4">
<a name="stpa_409">an odd word, I think&#151;
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_96">&quot;and I believe that I will leave the organisation strongly focused and committed to meet the challenges in the future. I would like to take this opportunity to relay again my personal thanks to all Met Office staff for helping me to determine the new strategic direction for the organisation and for putting in place a clear vision and robust plan for the future. I wish the Met Office, and its excellent people, every success for the future.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50712-37_para5">
<a name="stpa_410">The Minister will understand that that has a hollow ring with people in Aberdeen. After all, this time last year Dr. Rogers said:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_97">&quot;I want the Met Office to work with Government to help to mitigate the impacts of severe weather. This goal can only be achieved if we maintain a significant regional presence and my wish to focus on services which improve public safety. Aberdeen Met Office is a great example of somewhere this has already happened. Everything they do is focused on protecting life at sea. This is a model.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50712-37_para6">
<a name="stpa_411">What has happened in the past 12 months to produce that complete about-turn? Only last September, a strategic decision was taken to transfer the shipping forecast and gale warnings from Exeter to Aberdeen. In that short time&#151;less than a year&#151;staff at Aberdeen have achieved a 35 per cent. increase in accuracy, for 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>12 Jul 2005 : Column 810</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>which the team recently received a performance bonus, yet management now want to transfer the service back to Exeter.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50712-37_para7">
<a name="stpa_412">I do not know whether the Minister will want to comment, but I can tell him that there is a suspicion that the change of policy was driven by the cost overruns in the move to Exeter. When his predecessor,, Ivor Caplin, accepted the new headquarters at the end of 2003 he described it as
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_98">&quot;within budget and under a strict timetable&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50712-37_para8">
<a name="stpa_413">yet in a recent reply to me the Minister confirmed that there was a cost overrun of &#163;7.9 million. It is estimated that the option recommended by the board&#151;closure of all the branches&#151;will save &#163;3,652,000 over five years and &#163;20,691,000 over 10 years.
</p>





<p><a name="st_315"><a name="50712-37_spnew2"><b> Miss Anne Begg  (Aberdeen, South) (Lab):</b> 
 Has the hon. Gentleman made a similar calculation to the one I made? The savings suggested by the Met Office may not actually happen, because there is no guarantee that, if Met Office functions were centralised in Exeter, the business currently done by the Aberdeen Met Office will follow. It could go to a commercial company.
</p>





<p><a name="st_316"><a name="50712-37_spnew3"><b> Malcolm Bruce: </b> 
 The hon. Lady anticipates one of my points.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50712-37_para9">
<a name="stpa_414">I stress that the difference between the option that the board recommends and option 3&#151;I am not saying that option 3 is the definitive one, but it would retain Aberdeen, London and Manchester as centres of excellence&#151;is a reduced saving of &#163;917,000 over five years and &#163;5.324 million over 10 years, an overall projected saving of &#163;15.367 million. Can the Minister tell us whether it is reasonable to destroy morale and disperse expertise for a projected saving&#151;I take the hon. Lady&#039;s point&#151;of about &#163;500,000 a year? That does not seem to make sense, and more to the point&#151;exactly the hon. Lady&#039;s point&#151;will that saving really be achieved?
</p>

<p>
<a name="50712-37_para10">
<a name="stpa_415">The Minister told me in a written answer:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_99">&quot;It is not therefore possible to provide information on revenue generation by individual civil centres&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 6 July 2005; Vol. 436, c. 477W.]</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50712-37_para11">
<a name="stpa_416">Why not? That is a trading fund and if the Government do not know what those branches cost and how much revenue is generated, how are they competent to make any decision that closing them would be a saving rather than a cost?
</p>

<p>
<a name="50712-37_para12">
<a name="stpa_417">I have already been told that there is a presumption of a revenue loss of only &#163;20,000. Even that implies that more information is available than has been made public. There is evidence that the revenue loss could be far greater and could be even more than the project savings, so the net result of the decision could be to increase the deficit or the loss-making potential of the Met Office&#151;certainly not to boost it. The Minister should take that into account. Over the last couple of weeks, we have already heard that a &#163;1 million contract for Shell has been lost. Other contracts are being bid for, but, against the background that I have described, it is hard for the Met Office to win them, although it is determined to try to do so.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50712-37_para13">
<a name="stpa_418">The situation is odd, because there are three private weather forecasters with substantial staffs operating in Aberdeen and they will certainly take a predatory 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>12 Jul 2005 : Column 811</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>approach to Met Office customers. Indeed, they have already done so&#151;Shell has been won across. Can the Minister give us even the internal estimate of the cost savings from closing Aberdeen and where the main savings will be made? I have spoken to nobody who believes that those savings will be realised or that they can be made without damaging business.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50712-37_para14">
<a name="stpa_419">A management document admits:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_100">&quot;While there is still an important human involvement in the forecasting process this is reducing with time and needs to be used in a way that adds real value to the output. The role has evolved and forecasters are now more involved with service provision&#151;interpreting the likely weather impacts and helping users and customers to make best use of the information available and mitigate risks.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50712-37_para15">
<a name="stpa_420">That is exactly the role in which Aberdeen has excelled in recent years.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50712-37_para16">
<a name="stpa_421">It is also interesting that the Ministry of Defence insists on retaining Met Office operations on its bases in Scotland. If a remote computer can do the job&#151;according to the Met Office&#039;s operation in Exeter&#151;why does the MOD need a local operation? Or is its insistence in fact confirmation that local operations really add value and qualitative information?
</p>

<p><a name="st_317"><a name="50712-38_spnew0"><b> Mr. Mike Weir  (Angus) (SNP):</b> 
 Does the hon. Gentleman accept that many industries in north-east Scotland&#151;fishing, oil and the growing pleasure boat sector&#151;rely on the Aberdeen office and local input?
</p>





<p><a name="st_318"><a name="50712-38_spnew1"><b> Malcolm Bruce: </b> 
 That is true. The Met Office is a public service. I realise that it is a trading fund but people perceive it as &quot;our&quot; Met Office providing the information we need for such activities.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50712-38_para0">
<a name="stpa_422">The very suggestion that Met Offices can be offered remotely without a professional customer interface is itself damaging for business. Forecasters insist that, although the Exeter technology is a huge innovation, they can still add to it and meet the needs of customers in local advice, customisation and presentation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50712-38_para1">
<a name="stpa_423">Safety is an issue. In Scotland, that means mountain rescue, keeping roads open in the winter, fishing, offshore oil and gas, the pleasure boat industry and the tourist industry. The idea that Scotland, with its now fully established Scottish Parliament, should have no direct access to the Met Office within Scotland is an insult to the needs of the Scottish economy.

<a name="stpa_424">Safety is not the only issue, because commercial interests are also important. The Minister should imagine an offshore oil and gas operator trying to plan the installation of a sub-sea system in the North sea. Such an operator will need a local, specific weather forecast that will enable it to determine the weather window to perform that operation. A crane barge can cost $100,000 a day, and two or three days&#039; error in the weather forecast could cost hundreds of thousands of dollars. It would be a pity, in those circumstances, if the Met Office could not continue to provide the service that it has provided in the past.

Will that not leave the service exposed? There may be two computers, but they could both be disabled. I understand that they share cabling tunnels. Does not safe back-up justify maintaining other centres of excellence, especially when the perceived savings are relatively small and may be completely wrong? What contingencies are or could be in place if Exeter failed? Is there not a danger that public agencies will face a reduced service and possibly greater costs in getting relevant information?

<a name="stpa_430">In the light of these arguments, I hope that the Minister will consider all the options during the consultation. Will extra options be considered or is the consultation on the four options previously considered? Will the Minister recognise that opinion across Scotland, as demonstrated in this debate, is strongly of the view that we require our own civilian Met Office operation and that Aberdeen should be retained as our centre of excellence? To be frank, if the Minister were to close that operation, which has achieved great things in the past 15 years, it would be an act of vandalism that the Met Office would ultimately regret. It would not solve the financial problems of the Met Office but compound them. It would devalue the Met Office as a truly national British service, rather than something, however superb, based about as far away from Aberdeen as anyone can get and still be on the mainland of Britain.

 As the Minister knows, I am a great admirer of weather forecasting and, indeed, of weather forecasters. On the science, does he accept that, while the supercomputers are important, there will always be an element of expertise, which other hon. Members have already mentioned? The great strength of sharing that experience across the country is that the local expertise that brings in the business is effectively on site in those regions to deliver results.

<a name="stpa_435">Investments in satellites and weather radars have resulted in significant advances in how the atmosphere is observed. Advances have also been made in numerical weather prediction mathematical models. At the same    time, technological advances, particularly in telecommunications, continue to enable increasing efficiencies in the production process. While the Met Office continues to put a very high premium on the skill of people, the human role in the forecasting process has changed and continues to change significantly. The forecaster is now more focused on providing a service to customers. By interpreting the likely weather impacts, forecasters help people to make best use of the information available, especially when it comes to the risks of severe weather.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50712-38_para14">
<a name="stpa_436">It is important that we build on the Met Office&#039;s investment in technology, telecommunications and modelling. That is the reason for reviewing the production process and is the background to identifying the options for the way ahead. The options under consideration range from no change to the current structure and process, to the full centralisation of forecasting and the full automation of all commercial services. They also include the centralisation of production, but with the creation of two or three centres of excellence to deal with specific sectors of the Met Office&#039;s customer base and the production and services range.

<a name="stpa_439">The hon. Gentleman was concerned about why the costs and revenues of individual centres such as Aberdeen could not be identified.

<a name="stpa_440">The situation at military aviation stations is different from that at civil centres.

 Does the Minister not accept that for people in the environment of the North sea, whether they are involved in fishing, maritime activities or offshore helicopter activities, the same factors apply?
