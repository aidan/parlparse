 My hon. Friend raises an extremely important point. The Government have been at the forefront of the campaign for reform of the common agricultural policy, which in its old incarnation was distorting internal markets and wreaking havoc on producers in the third world. We have now broken that link with subsidy production and moved towards the agri-environmental schemes that my hon. Friend mentioned. About 12,000 farmers are participating in those schemes, which help to make up some of the income that they would otherwise have forgone. In addition, the schemes are benefiting the environment of Northern Ireland, and, therefore, all those who enjoy the beautiful Northern Ireland countryside.</p>

 I have met the leaders of the Ulster Farmers Union on many occasions to discuss bureaucracy and red tape. Recently, my officials worked with the UFU to reduce to three pages a form which, in its first draft, was 11 pages long, so that was a very productive engagement. My door is open to the UFU and I will certainly listen if it wants to discuss any forms or processes that it believes can be simplified and made clearer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o4"><a name="70110-0001.htm_para4"><a name="07011053000049">I must add that we have to balance that against the fact that we are talking about &#163;300 million of taxpayers&#146; money, and it is right that we have proper accountability for that. It is also right that where some practices are impacting on the environment, we take our responsibilities to the environment and future generations very seriously. We need to balance the need to make processes as simple and clear for farmers as possible with our responsibilities for taxpayers&#146; money and the environment.</p>

 Of course, and I said as much to an Assembly sub-committee yesterday. I want the appointment of a justice Minister and a deputy justice Minister to be achieved by a cross-community vote in the Assembly, with the so-called triple lock, to which the hon. Lady referred, in place. The Act passed by Parliament last year made no attempt to change that, but we need to get on with the process. All the Unionist parties, including hers, and all the other parties support the principle of devolving policing and justice. The Government are committed to that, and if there is delivery on policing, we want to meet the St. Andrews time frame of May 2008 for that devolution.</p>

 The House will be grateful for what the Secretary of State has just said, but will he give us another unequivocal assurance&#151;that those who accept ministerial office in any Northern Ireland power-sharing Executive will have placed on them the same requirements and obligations as are placed on those who serve in the devolved Governments in Scotland and Wales?</p>

 I can certainly reassure the hon. Gentleman on that point, but in some respects the obligations in Northern Ireland are greater. The ministerial pledge of office, as amended in the Northern Ireland (St. Andrews Agreement) Act 2006, which this House passed last November, makes it clear that Ministers must support the police, the rule of law and the courts. The Ard Chomhairle motion passed by the Sinn Fein executive on 29 December specifically authorised its members to take the ministerial pledge of office, and that is encouraging for the future.</p>

 Does the Secretary of State accept that words alone are not enough when it comes to policing and support for the courts and the rule of law? Sinn Fein&#146;s support for the police, the courts and the rule of law must be tested against its actions over a credible period. In the past, we have learned to our cost that Sinn Fein&#146;s words are meaningless when it comes to translating them into action. Will the right hon. Gentleman accept that people in Northern Ireland believe that Sinn Fein should sign up for policing and the rule of law without conditions or concessions? That means that the May 2008 date for the devolution of policing and justice cannot apply, as there can be no commitment to any date when we do not know whether Sinn Fein will deliver.</p>

 I of course agree that Sinn Fein should sign up to policing and the rule of law, and to the justice system in every other respect. I also agree that there has to be sustainable delivery. There is no question about that, but the May 2008 timetable agreed in the Northern Ireland (St. Andrews Agreement) Act is a Government objective, to which all parties should work. However, I remind the hon. Gentleman that the date set out in that Act, which was passed by Parliament, is very clear. On March 26, there will either be the restoration of devolution or there will be dissolution. That date cannot be moved.  <br>

We also expect them to join the Policing Board for Northern Ireland and the district policing partnerships.

 I thank the Minister for her reply. Will she briefly explain the relationship between the Bain review and the policy documents issued by the Department with specific reference to the planning of new schools and the rationalisation of schools? Paragraph 9.3 of Bain states that any planning of new schools must reflect the make-up of society in Northern Ireland, but that does not appear in the Government document for consultation. It further states that each sector must be supported in its plans, but only one sector seems to be relevant&#151;the Department, which will dictate exactly what happens. Will the Minister please rationalise that?</p>

 One of the main recommendations of the Bain review&#151;one that will enable us to achieve maximum efficiency in the spending of increased resources&#151;is the concept of area-based planning. It will no longer be sensible or possible for individual sectors to plan only within their sectors, which would be a recipe for pouring our extra resourcing down the drain. It will be important for all sectors to involve themselves, in conjunction with the Department, in planning for schools, and to spend increased resources on an area and geographical basis, not just within sectors.</p>

 I certainly do not agree that integrated or Irish-medium schools are divisive, as they are meeting a need that parents in Northern Ireland want to see met. That is legitimate. However, I accept that we will not get full value from the extra resources going in if we keep supporting extremely small schools, as we have in the past. Bain set out some minima below which it will be important to review the continued educational sustainability of schools, and it is important to take those recommendations forward speedily and in all seriousness. I hope that all education stakeholders in Northern Ireland will join me, and the Department, in taking them forward in a positive and constructive manner.</p>

 The Home Secretary will make a statement in a moment that covers precisely that point. However, let me just make one thing clear. Before May 2006, there were no proper details; indeed, before 1999, no details of any sort whatever were kept. Between 1999 and May 2006, details were sent under the old voluntary system that used to apply in Europe. Very often, however, those details were not sufficient to allow us to identify people properly. That is why I said that those on whom proper information was sent to us by other European countries have been entered on the police national computer. In so far as insufficient details have not been sent to us, that is not, with respect, the fault of the Home Office but of those people who have been sending the details from other countries. All the way through there was, of course, an attempt to improve the system; however, it was only when Europe took a decision to make compulsory what had previously been voluntary that we were able to deal with the backlog satisfactorily.</p>

There are rapists, murderers and paedophiles at large in Britain who could have got through the net and could have been working with children in the NHS, in social services or in our schools. The Prime Minister says that the Home Secretary will give a statement, but is not it the fact that the Home Office is part of the problem? Last night, the Home Office said that details of the serious offenders had all been entered into the computer&#151;that is what it said.

 No, I am afraid that I do not think that that is the right way to proceed on security. Let me just make one thing clear in relation to absconds, which the right hon. Gentleman also mentioned. Absconds from open conditions are at their lowest level since we came to office, and absconds from closed conditions are at their lowest level. <i> [Interruption.] </i>Let me give him the facts. The facts are that, prior to 1997, some 1,300 prisoners escaped. For the 10 years since 1997, the figure is 137. There have, of course, been several category A escapes, including when he was at the Home Office as an adviser, but there have been no category A escapes since we came to power.</p>

As he knows, there has been an operation that the British have been conducting in Basra over the past few months, which will be completed in the next few weeks. That operation, I am pleased to say, has been successful up to now. That will allow the Iraqis to take over more and more control of their own policing and security in Basra. The purpose of the American plan&#151;and it is for President Bush to announce it&#151;will be precisely the same: it is in order to allow the Iraqi capability to take over security progressively, over time. The situation in Baghdad is different from the situation in Basra.</p>

 My hon. Friend makes an important point. I am delighted that the European Commission, following on from the discussions at the Hampton Court informal summit in October 2005, has today put forward important proposals on climate change and protecting the environment, and on energy security and supply. It is important that we as a country ensure that our energy supply is secure for the long term. In my view, that requires a diverse supply of energy and the decisions that we will have to make when the energy White Paper is published in March are, therefore, very important. I say again that we need to ensure that replacing our nuclear power stations is one important part of the deal. In the past few months, we have signed contracts with, for example, Norway to guarantee 30 per cent. of our gas from it in the next few years. We are in the process of replacing our nuclear power stations, but energy security for this country will be as important in the next decade as many of the crucial security issues of past years. If we do not get the decisions right quickly, we will pay a heavy price in future.</p>

 With your permission, Mr. Speaker, I will make a statement on the backlog of unrecorded overseas crimes committed by British citizens abroad. I apologise to the right hon. Member for Haltemprice and Howden (David Davis) for the late arrival of the statement. As he probably saw from the papers being passed along the Front Bench, the inconvenience was mutual.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o14"><a name="70110-0004.htm_para0"><a name="07011053000146">I intend to outline the situation up to May 2006&#151;when the Association of Chief Police Officers became the lead organisation&#151;the current situation, and the further actions for which I have asked today. No hon. Member should be under the illusion that I do not regard the subject as serious.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o15"><a name="70110-0004.htm_para1"><a name="07011053000147">First, let me outline the situation to May 2006. Since 1959, there has been a Council of Europe convention on mutual legal assistance, which established the expectation that the more than 40 member countries would inform each other of the criminal convictions of their citizens while in another member country. That was the position from 1959 until last year. The system had several grave weaknesses.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o16"><a name="70110-0004.htm_para2"><a name="07011053000148">First, implementation of the system for exchanging the information was patchy across Europe. Secondly, much of the information was of poor quality&#151;for example, on some occasions, it constituted just a name. Thirdly, the process for handling the incoming notifications when they arrive in the United Kingdom was fragmented and piecemeal. There were therefore fundamental flaws in both the sending and the receipt of information.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o17"><a name="70110-0004.htm_para3"><a name="07011053000149">It was agreed that this situation should be improved at European level, and in 2005 a European Union Council decision made it mandatory for all member states to have a central authority in each country for receiving and sending such information, to counter the fundamental flaws of the prevailing system. In March 2006, it was decided by my predecessor&#151;in my view completely correctly&#151;that the central authority for this country would be the Association of Chief Police Officers. I think that I am correct in saying that we were among the first in the European Union to appoint such an authority to improve the exchange of such information. A backlog of 27,500 notifications was passed to ACPO, and its team was operational by May last year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o18"><a name="70110-0004.htm_para4"><a name="07011053000150">Since then, ACPO has sifted through all the approximately 27,500 notifications and carried out a priority risk assessment on them. This identified 540 most serious offenders on the police&#146;s own definition. All the notifications relating to the most serious offenders that had enough information to be entered on the police national computer and which were not already on the computer as a result of Interpol work have now been put on it. Together, that means that 260 of the 540 serious notifications are on the police national computer. The remaining 280 cannot be entered on the PNC and are the subject of further inquiries to the notifying country to get more details to try to establish the identity of the offender. I should make it clear that the 280 cases are not necessarily  <br>

notifications received since May last year or, indeed, since this Government came to office. However, we are having their origin checked.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o19"><a name="70110-0004.htm_para5"><a name="07011053000151">I shall now outline the actions that I have asked to be taken. As the House will know, I regard protecting the public as my highest priority, and I know that that view is shared by the whole House. I therefore consider the past failings in the system to be a very serious matter, and I regard the response of my predecessor to have been a correct response to those failings. However, I also believe that the system now operating puts responsibility in the right place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o20"><a name="70110-0004.htm_para6"><a name="07011053000152">I want to express my gratitude to the Association of Chief Police Officers for the action that it has taken and for the assistance that it has given me this morning. I have today met Ministers and my officials, the president of ACPO and the chief executive of the Criminal Records Bureau. I have asked ACPO for an assurance that every one of the more serious offenders that it has identified and on whom there is sufficient information has now been entered on the police national computer. I have been given that assurance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o21"><a name="70110-0004.htm_para7"><a name="07011053000153">Let me now set out the actions that I have taken as a result of the past 24 hours. I have asked the permanent secretary at the Home Office to set up an inquiry into the Home Office&#146;s handling of these notifications. This will include determining a chronology of events, the practices and procedures in place at different times, whether appropriate action was taken, and the lessons to be learned. I have asked that every effort be made to complete this inquiry within six weeks.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o22"><a name="70110-0004.htm_para8"><a name="07011053000154">In addition, I have asked my officials, ACPO, the CRB and the probation service, in liaison with any other Department should that be necessary, to ensure that all appropriate public protection steps are taken. In particular, I have asked the CRB to check whether there are any disclosures to employers in respect of the most serious offenders who have been identified that ought to be looked at again in the light of that new information. I expect to have that information in a matter of days.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o23"><a name="70110-0004.htm_para9"><a name="07011053000155">I have also asked the police and the probation service to ensure that all sex offenders who have been identified through that process are subject to appropriate monitoring in line with the public protection arrangements that would be expected if there had been a conviction in this country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o24"><a name="70110-0004.htm_para10"><a name="07011053000156">Finally, I have asked ACPO and the CRB to accelerate the timetable to process the remainder of the backlog&#151;that is, those cases that have not been identified as serious, which involve less serious offenders. As of this morning, that timetable, due to less serious offenders being involved, was envisaged to be 12 months. I have also asked them, with extra resources, to provide that within three months. They hope to complete it within that time scale.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o25"><a name="70110-0004.htm_para11"><a name="07011053000157">As I hope is now clear to the House, this is a problem that was some years in the making. By May 2006, a better system had been established and was operational. I take full responsibility now for ensuring that that new system operates effectively to protect the public and that the lessons of past failings are properly learned.</p>

<p><a name="st_o94"><a name="07011053000158"><a name="70110-0004.htm_spnew0"><a name="07011053002205"><b>David Davis (Haltemprice and Howden) (Con):</b>
 I thank the Home Secretary for the advance notice of his statement, although I understand entirely why it came not quite as early as normal.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o26"><a name="70110-0004.htm_para12"><a name="07011053000159">The British public today will be wondering when on earth this catalogue of blunders at the Home Office will come to an end. None of the Government&#146;s excuses, I am afraid, explains why the last three years have been the worst in the 200-year history of the Home Office. That is because the Department has been overwhelmed by an avalanche of legislation, regulation, targets and headline-grabbing initiatives, and by strategic failure on immigration, criminal justice, prisons and a variety of other areas. So Ministers have the major responsibility for this, but the responsibility is even more specific and it means that the Home Secretary can no longer go on blaming civil servants or police officers. Nor does the latest excuse that he has no idea what is happening in his Department auger well for the security of the nation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o27"><a name="70110-0004.htm_para13"><a name="07011053000160">This is a database failure. It is the latest in a series of database failures. Five years ago, we had the Soham tragedy, in part because of police and Home Office database failures. There have been failures on the sex offenders register, the police fingerprint database and the CRB&#151;notably, two weeks after the right hon. Gentleman took over as Home Secretary. Did no Minister in the last eight months, as a result of those failures, ask, &#147;Are there any weaknesses or omissions on the police national computer?&#148; That is a straightforward, basic question. If no Minister asked it, why not? I would expect such basic scrutiny from a junior manager working in any business, let alone a Minister working in one of the most important Departments of State.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o28"><a name="70110-0004.htm_para14"><a name="07011053000161">The right hon. Gentleman became Home Secretary on 5 May 2006. On 21 May, the UK central authority for the exchange of criminal records was set up, as we have been told today, transferring responsibility for those records from the Home Office to ACPO. Ministers will have received a submission on that transfer. Did he not ask the simple question whether there were any problems with it? After he took office, he told us that he had conducted a fundamental review across his Department. Did he ask whether all the databases had complete integrity? How fundamental is an inquiry that misses 27,000 files sitting on a desk for up to six years?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o29"><a name="70110-0004.htm_para15"><a name="07011053000162">In practical public safety terms, will the Home Secretary tell the House, first, when the transfer will be complete? In particular, when will the 280 serious criminals be tracked down? I could not quite get that from what he said in his statement. Secondly, when will the sex offenders register, the Criminal Records Bureau and other relevant databases have been updated and checked back to see that no one has been missed in the gap since 1999? Thirdly, has he now checked for any other weaknesses in those databases? For example, if people from abroad who are given the right to work in the UK have criminal records, is he certain that those records are on the police national computer? If not known about, that is a serious issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o30"><a name="70110-0004.htm_para16"><a name="07011053000163">I am afraid that the public will have little faith in yet another review led by a civil servant. The Home Secretary can no longer blame his officials, the police or his predecessors. He has been in the job long enough to have had every chance to put the right questions. He has failed to do so. He assures us that he is in charge of his Department. Is he? If he is, when will he start shouldering the responsibility for it?</p>

 It is normal to start my response by thanking the right hon. Gentleman for those elements of his contribution that were in some way laudatory; I could not find one today, so he will not mind if I go straight to the heart of the issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o31"><a name="70110-0004.htm_para17"><a name="07011053000165">My statement today was not an attempt to lay blame, but to explain. That is what the House and the public want. It was also an attempt to outline the actions, now that I have been informed of the situation, that ought to be taken.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o32"><a name="70110-0004.htm_para18"><a name="07011053000166">First, the right hon. Gentleman said that there are failings in the Home Office. That is the least newsworthy item that could be declared today. I do not think that any Secretary of State has been more open about some of those failings. Had I been told about the backlog, I assure him that I would have added it to the other failings about which I told the Home Affairs Committee in order better to tackle them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o33"><a name="70110-0004.htm_para19"><a name="07011053000167">Secondly, the right hon. Gentleman queried whether I had asked about the integrity of systems in the Home Office. Yes, I explicitly asked all the leading officials, in the first week, to tell me everything that needed to be known about systems failures, precisely so that we could address and share that with the public. Why was I not told? That is precisely why the permanent secretary is undertaking an inquiry. Let us now get away from the process points and move on to the substance of public protection.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o34"><a name="70110-0004.htm_para20"><a name="07011053000168">I would not for one minute like the right hon. Gentleman to give the inadvertent impression that nothing has been done to improve the surveillance, monitoring and registering of people who have committed offences abroad. First, it is a major step forward that a lead organisation&#151;ACPO&#151;was appointed to ensure that the information that we sent to and received from other member states was dealt with in a systemic fashion that had integrity. That decision was taken six months before I became Home Secretary, and I applaud it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o35"><a name="70110-0004.htm_para21"><a name="07011053000169">Secondly, ACPO has now worked through and identified all serious cases in the backlog, and every one of those that it is possible to put on the police national computer, without the entry being useless at best or disturbing the system at worst, has been put on that computer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o36"><a name="70110-0004.htm_para22"><a name="07011053000170">Thirdly, in relation to the Soham question, the protection arrangements for children and vulnerable people have been improved significantly following Sir Michael Bichard&#146;s report. The Home Office and ACPO are now working on a new IT initiative, IMPACT, which will improve significantly the recording and sharing of information. Under the Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Act 2006, we have established a vetting and barring scheme. That is scheduled for implementation in late 2008 and will strengthen significantly the protection of children and vulnerable adults. One of its key features is the continuous monitoring that will be introduced, by contrast with the present arrangements whereby the Criminal Records Bureau is only able to provide what information is currently held in police systems.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o37"><a name="70110-0004.htm_para23"><a name="07011053000171">Therefore, without in any way attempting to paint a rosy picture, the position is much better than it was from 1959 to 2005, during which period Governments of all persuasions have held office.</p>

I do not know whether he meant the date of transfer of the files. It was when ACPO&#146;s role was set up&#151;in the first half of last year, between January and June&#151;that the files would have been established, electronically and physically. I hope, therefore, that the right hon. Gentleman will no longer allude to his colourful but rather misleading proposition that I have been sitting in the midst of all the files since May last year. I have not.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o39"><a name="70110-0004.htm_para25"><a name="07011053000173">Finally, the right hon. Gentleman asked about the date of reform. <i> [Interruption.] </i>I am sorry, but I cannot respond to remarks made from a sedentary position. If the right hon. Gentleman wishes to raise other issues I will deal with them, but let me make this absolutely clear: I have now asked not only for an assurance that all the serious cases on which we have sufficient information have been entered on the computer, but for a retrospective check to be carried out with the Criminal Records Bureau to ensure that no questions have been asked about anyone who ought to have been registered on the computer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o40"><a name="70110-0004.htm_para26"><a name="07011053000174">I am asking the police to accelerate the process of dealing with the other 27,500 cases, and I am asking the Probation Service to give me an assurance that anyone who has now been discovered to have committed an offence as a result of having been entered on the computer will be given the same level of supervision as anyone who has committed an offence in this country.

 The Home Secretary and his Ministers seem to have developed a novel doctrine of ministerial responsibility over the past 24 hours. If a Minister is not aware of something, we are now told, he or she can somehow not be held responsible for it. Let us be clear that ignorance is no excuse for incompetence. The British public have a simple question to ask of the Home Secretary: if he is not to be held to account for the work of his Department, who is?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o41"><a name="70110-0004.htm_para27"><a name="07011053000176">Can the Home Secretary confirm that 27,500 files relate to information collected from Council of Europe countries?

<p><a name="stpa_o42"><a name="70110-0004.htm_para28"><a name="07011053000177">I do not think the Home Secretary gave us a precise date for the completion of the CRB checks on the most serious offenders. Will he do so now, so that parents and members of the public can have a cast-iron guarantee that none of the offenders are working with children or vulnerable people?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o43"><a name="70110-0004.htm_para29"><a name="07011053000178">The Home Secretary may be aware that since April 2005 a pilot project has been running, organised by Germany, France, Belgium and Spain&#151;joined recently, I believe, by the Czech Republic&#151;to establish a fully operational criminal records network. We are told that the United Kingdom has been very reluctant to join the project. Can the Home Secretary explain how he will deal with this crisis on a sustainable basis without committing Britain more fully to this type of international arrangement?</p>

 I will deal with the last question first. Of course we consider all ways of improving co-operation, but no one should believe that because systems have been established they will work perfectly, even now.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o44"><a name="70110-0004.htm_para30"><a name="07011053000180">To the best of my knowledge, under the new system, all Council of Europe countries have notified us of all offences, and all those offences are being entered on the computer immediately by ACPO.</p>

Gentleman, what I cannot tell him is that I was presiding over it from 1959 until last May. I was not. I will accept responsibility for sorting out the problem, but it has developed over many years. Even now, with the new system, when I ask how many notifications we have received from Spain, for instance, the answer is none. I find it very difficult to believe that we have had no one convicted of offences in Spain. That illustrates some of the problems that we are experiencing, even with a strengthened system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o46"><a name="70110-0004.htm_para32"><a name="07011053000182">We will continue to do what we can, and I accept full responsibility. It is a question of establishing the facts, and I have asked the permanent secretary to do that.</p>

I hope and expect that we shall have gone through the backlog of 27,500 less serious cases within a few months&#151;three months, I hope, although I cannot absolutely pledge that. He also asked an important question about the retrospective checking of people who are now on the computer but may not have been for a long time. I am also concerned about that, and I have asked the CRB to check and run it through the systems. I trust that the process will not take months or even weeks; I hope to have received the information by the end of this week. I will in any case present a written statement to the House when appropriate, to update Members on what is happening.</p>

That arrangement was even less systematic that the present one. As I have said, there were two flaws. First, the information that came to the United Kingdom was fragmentary, piecemeal and ad hoc, and secondly the system at this end, in the Home Office, was inadequate to deal with that. Had I known about those failings I would have incorporated them in the report that I gave the Home Affairs Committee, along with the other failings in the system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o49"><a name="70110-0004.htm_para35"><a name="07011053000185">We are remedying those failings now. A huge amount of work is being done by Home Office officials to reform the Home Office, and I praise them for that work. My only regret is that because they did not, apparently, tell me about it at the time, something that happened a considerable time ago is being blamed on officials as if it were happening now. Actually, it is on its way to being remedied now. What has happened is that we have only just found out about a problem that all of us should perhaps have known about some time ago.</p>

We have a problem that is currently being solved; but in the midst of that solution, there have been revelations about the problem as it existed before and as people had to grapple with it then. That is why I say that whatever happened previously, my predecessors were absolutely correct in taking the steps that were necessary for a speedy response to the European Union directive. We were among the first European member states to tender, and then to set up, a central authority&#151;the Association of Chief Police Officers&#151;to deal with the problem.</p>

Even worse, some states appear to have given us no notification of anybody at all, so I will certainly make that one of my priorities as well.</p>

the previous Administration, but less than an hour ago the Prime Minister told the House that the voluntary transfer of information commenced in 1999, and I am sure that the Prime Minister was carefully briefed on that matter. Is not the simple truth that, since 1999, thousands of records of this kind have been received at the Home Office, have been put into boxes at the Home Office and have been left to gather dust at the Home Office?

 I seek clarification on a small point. Yesterday&#146;s Home Affairs Committee sitting was entirely about home affairs issues relating to Europe. My right hon. Friend mentioned Interpol in his statement; yesterday, we talked about Europol. Can I understand from what my right hon.

 Interpol has played an active part. Let me give an example&#151;it is a rather complex one, but Members demand and expect detailed answers to such points. When ACPO received the files&#151;some electronically, others physically&#151;it sifted through them; it conducted what we would call a triage, sorting them into more serious and less serious offences. Of the 540 more serious offences, it transpired that 149 were already on the police national computer because they had been put on it by Interpol. That means that Interpol had already been playing an active role.</p>

That is not, however, quite as simple as we would all want it to be. For example, only three countries in Europe have a sex offenders register: the United Kingdom, Ireland and France. Other countries do not protect the public in the way that we do; we have a standard of protection that has been built up over the years.

However, although that happened five years ago, the Home Secretary said that the IMPACT&#151;information management, prioritisation, analysis, co-ordination and tasking&#151;system is still being implemented. How much longer will my constituents and other people in this country have to wait before there is a system in place that ensures that everybody who has committed crimes that could mean that they are a threat to children in the future are recorded in a manner that is accessible by those who might be considering employing them?</p>

I have made it publicly clear that I do think so, and we are attempting to remedy that. However, as I also pointed out, it is not as though nothing has happened since then. What has come out of that tragedy? Apart from IMPACT, we have established the vetting and barring scheme, which is scheduled for implementation in less than two years; it will significantly strengthen the protection of children and vulnerable adults. We are trying to improve the national offenders management system and the oversight of serious offenders. We have the POCA&#151;Protection of Children Act 1999&#151;register for those who might be a threat to children. We have the POVA&#151;protection of vulnerable adults&#151;register for those who might be a threat to vulnerable adults.

 There is not a deadline because it would be artificial. The cases cannot be entered not only because it would not add anything to put in a name and very little else, but because it would damage the existing system if there were hundreds of cases that were nothing but a name. The problem is that we are moving from a system that was completely piecemeal and fragmentary&#151;quite frankly, it fell into disuse&#151;to one that is meant to involve the systematic and organised transfer of information, although it is obvious that people are not keeping to the basic format for the necessary information that should be exchanged. We have to try to ensure that we go back through the cases with the countries. Some of the files are indecipherable&#151;they just cannot be read&#151;not because they are in a different language, but because of their scribbled manner. The records are not all typed case files; some are written notifications. There is thus a real problem. We will do that work as soon as possible. As soon as the information is in a fit state to go on the computer, it now goes on it. There is no backlog for perusal, other than the remainder of the 27,500 cases, which are the less serious files.

All I can say without prejudging the inquiry is that one of the reasons&#151;not the only one&#151;why I asked for it was that I found it inexplicable that such a backlog had not been brought to my attention when it was pretty obvious to everyone else, including hon. Members, that I wanted to identify the problems in the Home Office that we needed to address quite openly and then deal with them. Although I do not wish to prejudge the inquiry, we will deal with that when it comes out.</p>

 I thank the Home Secretary for his full statement and for initiating the investigation. Will he assure the House that he will ensure that this item will be on the agenda at the next meeting of the Justice and Home Affairs Council of the EU so that our partners are aware of the deficiencies in the provision of information? In respect of countries outside the EU, will he meet the Foreign Secretary to determine whether there is any way in which, through the posts abroad, she can help to lobby other Governments to ensure that they provide adequate information?</p>

 I can say yes to both my right hon. Friend&#146;s points. The Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department, my hon.

 The Home Secretary outlined the situation up until the time of the agreement in 2005 in the European Union and tried to reassure the House that the stricter regime put in place after that, with a single national authority in each member state, would lead to the problem being much easier to control. The original situation occurred under a Council of Europe convention involving 46 member countries. The European Union has only 27 member states, which means that 19 countries, including large ones, such as Russia and Ukraine, and others with a large British expatriate population, such as Norway and Switzerland, are not covered by the arrangements. How many cases in the backlog involve us seeking answers from countries that are not required to have a single national authority and from which we are thus unlikely to get answers?</p>

 We can approach several institutions and we can carry out work through Interpol. I cannot tell the hon.

because about half of the 540 more serious ones were not. If that pattern is repeated, it might well be that many of the cases involve pieces of paper with notifications that are in no condition to go on the computer. However, we will pursue every avenue.</p>

We have the European Union, beyond which there is the Council of Europe. Beyond that we have the world, so a couple of hundred countries will be sending us information that is not as perfect as it ought to be. I merely say that the system is a lot better than it was before and that it is among the best in Europe, along with the systems in France and Ireland.</p>

 I beg to move,</p>
<a name="70110-0006.htm_brev0"><a name="07011053002016"><ul><p class="tabletext">That leave be given to bring in a Bill to make provision for the establishment of a scheme to promote the maintenance and preservation of certain vehicles of cultural value; and for connected purposes.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o65"><a name="70110-0006.htm_para1"><a name="07011053000237">The Bill has its roots in the well-supported campaign to ensure the preservation and, I hope, maintenance of a Concorde in a suitably airworthy condition to enable it to be flown on what might loosely be called ceremonial occasions. As I am sure that you are aware, Mr. Speaker, Heathrow airport is extremely close to my constituency. I frequently raise issues such as the noise and pollution that are an inevitable result of such a large airport and, indeed, my determined opposition to the construction of a third runway there. However, that does not mean that I was not a fan of Concorde. I never failed to be proud of it and concede that watching Concorde fly was a truly spectacular sight, despite its ear-splitting noise.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o66"><a name="70110-0006.htm_para2"><a name="07011053000238">Of course, Concorde has now gone from our skies. The airframes were sold off to museums and collections around the world following its retirement in 2003. None are airworthy, and the ex-British Airways aircraft are in a worse state than the French ones, especially because of the decision by British Airways to order that all hydraulic pipes be drained and the electrical systems disabled on its seven Concordes. Jock Lowe, the airline&#146;s former chief Concorde pilot and fleet manager, described that decision as an act of vandalism. I am not suggesting that Concorde should be returned to regular commercial service because that is no longer a viable option. However, many would like at least one Concorde to be restored to an airworthy condition, in a similar manner to the battle of Britain memorial flight, and would hope for it to be ready to fly in time for the 2012 Olympics. Currently, there is little hope of that happening. British Airways stated in a letter to my colleague the shadow transport Minister, my hon. Friend the Member for Canterbury (Mr. Brazier), that</p>
<a name="70110-0006.htm_brev1"><a name="07011053002017"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;the technical and financial challenges and difficulties of keeping an aircraft airworthy for &#145;heritage&#146; purposes are hugely prohibitive.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o67"><a name="70110-0006.htm_para3"><a name="07011053000239">However, former technicians who worked on the aircraft, and independent observers, have stated that there is no reason why Concorde cannot fly again. If it were protected by vehicular listing, it should be possible to make BA think again about its policy towards what is a British icon.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o68"><a name="70110-0006.htm_para4"><a name="07011053000240">Although I was thinking initially about Concorde, it occurred to me that very little status is given to the protection of certain vehicles of historical and cultural value. Over the years, there have been some notable success stories, such as the preservation of HMS Belfast and HMS Victory, and of the battle of Britain memorial flight that I mentioned earlier. More often than not, however, aircraft, steam engines and ships have struggled to achieve the necessary protection.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o70"><a name="70110-0006.htm_para6"><a name="07011053000242">A prime example of that is the SV City of Adelaide. Built in 1864, she is the last remaining example of a composite-built passenger sailing ship. Although she is located at the Scottish maritime museum, the BBC has reported that her restoration will be abandoned and that she will be broken up and scrapped. Similarly, I am informed by my hon. Friend the Member for Scarborough and Whitby (Mr. Goodwill), who I am delighted to see in his place today, that steamrollers are gradually disappearing. He tells me that owners find that, if they convert them to showmen&#146;s road locomotives by replacing the rollers with wheels, they can double their value. I am never adverse to a bit commerce, but it would be a great shame if there were no way for us to ensure that some examples are preserved for posterity in their original state.</p>

Members could think of many other examples, but I am anxious not to delay the House further as there is some very important business that Opposition Members want to discuss. In a nutshell, the aim of the Bill is to try to prevent any further loss of historic and culturally significant vehicles. Too many have been lost for good. It is time for us to take good care of our vehicular culture, just as we do of our architectural heritage. We owe that to future generations.</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o75"><a name="70110-0006.htm_para11"><a name="07011053000249">Thirteen years ago, in a report entitled &#147;Changing Childbirth&#148;, the previous Conservative Government set out principles for the improvement of maternity care. They stated that the woman must be the focus of maternity care, that she should be able to exercise control over her care, that maternity services should be readily accessible, that they should be planned with the involvement of women, and that resources must be used efficiently.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o76"><a name="70110-0006.htm_para12"><a name="07011053000250">Since then, Ministers have added to those principles. At the time of the last general election, the Labour manifesto stated:</p>
<a name="70110-0006.htm_brev3"><a name="07011053002019"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;We want every woman to be supported by the same midwife throughout her pregnancy&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o77"><a name="70110-0006.htm_para13"><a name="07011053000251">Subsequently, a date of 2009 was set for the achievement of that commitment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o78"><a name="70110-0006.htm_para14"><a name="07011053000252">The Opposition motion effectively reiterates the commitments that I have set out, which I think are shared by hon. Members of all parties. They are based on the following principles: that, wherever possible, childbirth should be normal and governed by the exercise of choice by the mother and her partner; that the services that provide maternity care must be accessible, with continuity of care wherever that is possible; and that that maternity care must be safe and effective.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o79"><a name="70110-0006.htm_para15"><a name="07011053000253">However, good intentions are not enough. We have to deliver. The motion recognises the NHS staff involved in that delivery&#151;the midwives, maternity assistants, obstetricians, neonatologists and others&#151;and thanks them for their hard work, the support that they give to mothers and the quality of service that they provide. But they know&#151;as do we&#151;that there is a long way to go. This week, the Royal College of Midwives expressed its concern about maternity services when it said:</p>
<a name="70110-0006.htm_brev4"><a name="07011053002020"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Maternity services are being pared back...unless midwifery services are expanded there is no hope of these manifesto commitments being achieved&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o80"><a name="70110-0006.htm_para16"><a name="07011053000254">The RCM this week published a survey of heads of midwifery that paints a very worrying picture. It found that two thirds of midwifery units are understaffed, that qualified midwifery posts are being left unfilled or replaced by maternity care assistants, and that training budgets are being cut.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o81"><a name="70110-0006.htm_para17"><a name="07011053000255">The Government have responded to that with complacency. They say that maternal and infant mortality rates are continuing to fall, and that is true&#151;to the continuing credit of those who work in our maternity services. The Government say that that demonstrates the underlying safety of care, but mortality rates are not a sufficient measure of outcomes for the vast majority of mothers. Achieving a reduction in mortality rates is not the same as achieving quality.</p>

<p><a name="st_o135"><a name="07011053000256"><a name="70110-0006.htm_spnew9"><a name="07011053002246"><b>Kitty Ussher (Burnley) (Lab):</b>
 The hon. Gentleman said that outcomes had improved in terms of mortality rates, and of course that is due in part to the dedication displayed by staff. However, does he agree that that is also due to increased funding? Why did his party oppose that increase?</p>

<p><a name="st_o136"><a name="07011053000257"><a name="70110-0006.htm_spnew10"><a name="07011053002247"><b>Mr. Lansley:</b>
 The long-term reductions in maternal and infant mortality rates are due to more than increased funding. There is a long-term trend across the range of mortality rates, and the Prime Minister said as much earlier today when he talked about cancer mortality rates. The matter is much more complex: it involves funding, the organisation and quality of the care that is provided, the technology that is applied and the skills of the staff. I do not accept that the problem is simply one of resources.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o82"><a name="70110-0006.htm_para18"><a name="07011053000258">However, resources&#151;that is, inputs&#151;matter, as do outputs. The availability of midwives is an important factor. The Government amendment says that there are 2,400 more midwives than there were in 1997. That is on a head-count basis, but a calculation based on full-time equivalent staff shows that there are only 896 more midwives than there were in 1997. Full-time midwives now work 37.5 hours as opposed to 40 hours, which means that there are fewer midwife hours available now than was the case in 1997.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o83"><a name="70110-0006.htm_para19"><a name="07011053000259">Moreover, the number of midwives is significantly smaller in relation to the number of live births. To begin with, the increase in the number of midwives under this Government was in the context of a falling birth rate nationally, but what has happened in the past five years? In that time, the number of live births in England has risen from 563,644 in 2001 to 613,028 in 2005. That is a 9 per cent. increase, so it is little wonder that midwives are hard pressed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o84"><a name="70110-0006.htm_para20"><a name="07011053000260">Has the number of midwives risen or fallen in the past year? The answer is that 36 fewer midwives are employed in the NHS, according to the most recent work force census.</p>

<p><a name="st_o140"><a name="07011053000264"><a name="70110-0006.htm_spnew14"><a name="07011053002251"><b>David Taylor:</b>
 I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving way, but is he not distorting the statistics to a certain extent? It is true that the live birth figures have risen since 2001, but they are subject to cyclical trends and remain roughly what they were in 1996. The hon. Gentleman is right that the number of live births oscillates around a slightly rising trend, but he exaggerates the position.</p>

<p><a name="st_o141"><a name="07011053000265"><a name="70110-0006.htm_spnew15"><a name="07011053002252"><b>Mr. Lansley:</b>
 I am sorry but I do not accept that at all. If the hon. Gentleman reads the record, he will find that I said that there was a falling birth rate when the Government took office, but that it has risen substantially since&#151;a 9 per cent. increase.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o85"><a name="70110-0006.htm_para21"><a name="07011053000266">Did we not see in the past couple of weeks just how good&#151;or I should say how bad&#151;Government work force planning is? The departmental internal documents showed how poor it had been. The equivalent documents produced in 2004 were junked within two years, before most of their predictions ever came to pass. The Government are not enabling the service to match the number of midwives to the task in hand. Increasing the supply of midwives is absolutely central to delivering the objectives on which we all agree&#151;for example, one-to-one care and continuity of care from midwives to mothers and the availability of midwives to enable women to exercise choice and have either home births or named midwife-led care. The supply of midwives is instrumental if those options are to be available.</p>

 No one would disagree with the points that the hon. Gentleman has just made. No one would disagree with him in respect of valuing the work of midwives and paying tribute to them. No one would disagree with the words in the motion to the effect that the House</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o86"><a name="70110-0006.htm_para22"><a name="07011053000268">However, it is one thing to value that work, but quite another to show admiration and respect for it by providing the highest ever rate of increase in resources in the history of the NHS. The one thing that has increased massively since 1997 is the rate of salary paid to midwives and other health professionals. Surely, the hon. Gentleman cannot argue with that.</p>

 I have to tell the hon. Gentleman that his point would have been a lot stronger before the publication of the internal Department of Health document two weeks ago, which made it clear that the Department was planning how to reduce the real-terms wages of NHS professionals on account of the embarrassment of financial deficits into which it has plunged the NHS.

<p><a name="stpa_o88"><a name="70110-0007.htm_para1"><a name="07011053000271">We undertook our own consultation to find out what people on the front line of the NHS feel about the future configuration of maternity services&#151;something that the Government need to do and that the motion calls on them to do. The national picture shows that while we talk about and value birth centres and midwife-led units, 19 of them are at risk of closure. While we talk about accessible services, a number of smaller consultant-led maternity units&#151;by our reckoning, 24 of them across the country&#151;are at risk of closure.

 My hon. Friend is making a powerful speech.

My constituents may face a journey of up to 50 minutes to get to a maternity unit. In that case, a poorly resourced midwife service or home births may become not just an option, but a necessity.</p>

 My hon. Friend anticipates a general point that I wanted to make, so I shall make it now in response to him. Changes in the configuration of maternity services are occurring across the country, and they are driven by financial deficits, as in the case of East Sussex, or by the working time directive and staff shortages, as is predominantly the case in Greater Manchester. Those changes are not justified by evidence about clinical safety, yet we should be concerned primarily about quality and safety.</p>

My contention is that we should retain such units, because we need to maintain access and extend to women the sort of choices that we want them to have, but NHS organisations across the country are planning to shut them down. They are doing so because of deficits and the working time directive and not because of issues of clinical safety.</p>

There is a lesson there for Labour Members: the loss of paediatric services leads to the loss of maternity services. Hon. Members representing Huddersfield&#151;none is present&#151;know that. That is what is happening in Manchester and elsewhere.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o103"><a name="70110-0007.htm_para16"><a name="07011053000312">The position in the east of England is astonishing. A document has been released stating that units dealing with fewer than 3,000 live births a year are not supportable. As a consequence Hinchingbrooke hospital, which covers part of my constituency, the Queen Elizabeth hospital in King&#146;s Lynn, the James Paget hospital and West Suffolk hospital may all lose services. In essence, the document states that a maternity unit cannot be maintained with less than 40 hours a week consultant cover on the labour wards, which now requires no fewer than six consultants. It is the working time directive problem all over again. It is astonishing that six obstetric consultants are required to maintain 40 hours a week consultant cover on labour wards. That is not true and it should not be the basis on which the strategic health authority makes its judgments.</p>

When the chief executive of the East of England strategic health authority came here in December, I asked him how many live births there were at Northwick Park hospital in the period after 2002 when 10 tragic maternal deaths occurred. He did not know. The answer is 5,000. What is important is that the unit is well run, that the consultants are on the labour ward and work as a team with the midwives, and that the unit does not have to deal with an unsustainable number of births. Northwick Park hospital was affected by, among other things, the fact that the Central Middlesex hospital had shut and births were transferred to Northwick Park. What will happen in the east of England if the Hinchingbrooke unit or the West Suffolk hospital unit is shut and all the births are sent to Peterborough and Cambridge, or if the facilities at the Queen Elizabeth hospital are closed and patients are sent to the Norfolk and Norwich hospital?

All those things are necessary and there should be a timetable through to 2009, but there is none.

Member for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley), I note that at the Alnwick midwife-led centre in the Northumbria Healthcare NHS Trust, a small midwife and nurse-led unit is providing superb quality care to mothers and their babies, with fewer than 200 births a year. I want to return to that point a little later, but it serves to illustrate the fact that depending on the way in which the local NHS chooses to organise care, and the investment it makes in the training and support of its staff, it is quite possible for a small midwife-led unit to provide high quality, safe care to mothers&#151;in that case, in an isolated, rural area.</p>

 Research from southern California, to which my hon.

Women are generally happy with them; according to my Department&#146;s latest maternity survey, eight in 10 women tell us that they are happy with the care they received during birth. That is down to the superb hard work and dedication of thousands of NHS midwives and other clinicians and professionals. It is down to the increased investment&#151;more than &#163;1.5 billion a year&#151;that we are making in NHS maternity services. It is down to the fact that the number of midwives has increased by about 2,500 over the past 10 years, which is of course reflected in the fact that childbirth is probably safer now, for both mothers and their babies, than at any time in the past.</p>

It is particularly unacceptable at a time when more money is going into the NHS than ever before and, in case the hon. Gentleman has forgotten, his party voted against that extra investment.

 That is precisely the point: we had a new deal for junior doctors, which would have reduced their hours, and it would have been consistent with the working time directive, but the SiMAP and Jaeger judgments completely changed all that. They made it impossible for doctors to be asleep when on call in hospital, and for that time not to be treated as working time.

Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Rob Marris) said, that is better for doctors and safer for the patients for whom they care. As we bring working hours down, initially to 56 hours from 2009 onwards, and then to 48 hours, there will be an impact on maternity services.

In that case, there was consensus across the local NHS that two consultant-led units should be replaced by one consultant-led unit and one midwife-led unit. There was considerable consternation among local people, particularly in Huddersfield, about whether the midwife-led unit proposed for the area would provide good quality, safe care. That issue was referred to me by the overview and scrutiny committee, which plays a critical part in the statutory consultation that we have insisted should take place locally when there is to be any substantial change in services.</p>

 Much has been made of the situation in Manchester, but the Pennine Acute Hospitals NHS Trust provides alternative arrangements, as consultants work across four hospitals to provide the necessary cover.

The independent review panel did an admirable job when it went to Calderdale and Huddersfield, as it listened to local people, clinicians and other professional staff. It thought that the decision to centralise services in one consultant-led unit was right, but it made it clear that the local NHS needed to do more to provide community-based maternity support, particularly for women in disadvantaged areas of my hon. Friend&#146;s constituency. It pointed to the need, too, for closer working between the NHS and the local council to ensure good transport facilities. That is exactly the kind  <br>

 What would the Secretary of State say to one of my constituents, who is desperately worried about the possible closure of Royal Surrey county hospital&#146;s maternity unit? Her child was born within five minutes of her arrival in the unit. The baby was several weeks premature, and needed immediate access to life-saving equipment.

<p><a name="stpa_o119"><a name="70110-0009.htm_para0"><a name="07011053000371">I said earlier that we need to do considerably more. In our 2005 manifesto, we pledged to give women more choice by 2009 about where and how they have their babies, and about which pain relief to use. We want women to be supported by the same midwife throughout their pregnancy. We must do far more to address the deep-seated inequalities that persist both in maternity services and in the outcomes for women and their children. Despite the fact that maternal and neonatal deaths have fallen for several decades, there are still deep inequalities, as women from highly disadvantaged groups are up to 20 times more likely to die in childbirth. We need more services, particularly antenatal services, in local communities to support women during pregnancy and to allow them to choose where they will give birth. We therefore created Sure Start programmes in the most disadvantaged communities to give women, their partners and their babies the most effective support. I have seen that initiative working superbly in the disadvantaged communities in my constituency. In Portsmouth, the maternity outreach programme is caring for the most vulnerable women in the city, including pregnant teenagers. We now have 1,000 Sure Start children&#146;s centres, and we are working to create a centre in every community. Such investment in public services would be put at risk by Tory cuts.</p>

10 students who begin a course, two do not complete it. Of the remaining eight who graduate, only five find jobs. Is my right hon. Friend satisfied that attrition and employment rates can be tackled so that there will be enough qualified midwives in the years to come to deal with the trends that she identified?</p>

 My hon. Friend makes an extremely important point. As I said, there are about 2,500 more midwives employed in the NHS than in 1997. Vacancy rates in most parts of the country are low, although in London some trusts find it difficult to recruit and retain midwives. There are more midwives in training than there have ever been, with an increase of about a third since 1997. As my hon. Friend said, however, many of those midwives have experienced difficulties finding a job this year, and we are working closely with hospital trusts to ensure that everything possible is done to help midwives secure employment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o120"><a name="70110-0009.htm_para1"><a name="07011053000374">That issue emphasises the need for the NHS to continue to change to secure even better value for money. A recent report by the Institute for Public Policy Research confirmed that if every hospital did what the best are already doing, and ensured patients went home as soon as they were medically ready to do so, the NHS would save nearly &#163;1 billion a year. That is more than enough not only to deal with last year&#146;s overspending but to continue to improve maternity services and pay for new drugs and improvements that are needed.</p>

 The Secretary of State has been generous in accepting interventions. She knows that in south-west Hertfordshire, the trust is in dire financial straits and, worryingly for the community, devastating cuts have been proposed. The debate on midwife-led units was conducted four or five years ago, when a huge investment was made in a state-of-the-art, award-winning birthing unit that was opened under the Government. It has now closed, because there is no money to pay the midwives. If there is a surplus of midwives elsewhere in the country, will she enable them to work in Hertfordshire and guarantee that it will reopen?</p>

 I have discussed that issue with the hon.

It needs to reorganise its services to use those record budgets far more efficiently. By doing so, particularly by reorganising its acute services, it will release the money that it needs to continue to improve maternity services.</p>

If the Tories had had their way, &#163;35.5 billion less would have been spent on the health service since 2003.

<p><a name="stpa_o134"><a name="70110-0009.htm_para15"><a name="07011053000408">In its report before Christmas, the Select Committee found that in a desperate attempt to recover financial balance soft targets are often disproportionately affected. It referred particularly to mental health services, to support for voluntary organisations and, crucially, to staff training. There is no doubt that cuts in staff training are affecting maternity services. A recent survey by the Royal College of Midwives found that trusts were cutting training budgets, with one in five reporting that entire budgets had gone and the same proportion saying that three quarters of the budget had gone.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o135"><a name="70110-0009.htm_para16"><a name="07011053000409">It is not only training budgets that are suffering. The RCM survey found that two thirds of units surveyed were under-staffed; that one in five had lost staff in the past year; that trusts were increasingly relying on maternity support workers, not qualified midwives, to fill the gaps; and that trusts are employing fewer newly qualified midwives than a year ago. Those are the midwives recruited to training programmes three years ago because of staff shortages; every one of them who does not become employed in the health service effectively costs the taxpayer &#163;45,000 in wasted training costs, apart from the cost to the future of the student who fails to get a job. The survey also found that fewer students are starting training courses because places have been cut. As a result, there will be insufficient newly qualified midwives to replace those retiring, let alone the need to tackle the growing pressures on the service.</p>

 I entirely accept my hon. Friend&#146;s point. It cuts against the Government&#146;s commitment to increase choice, since if units disappear, choice self-evidently disappears as well.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o137"><a name="70110-0010.htm_para0"><a name="07011053000413">All those trends that are moving in the wrong direction are factors that affect the prospects of tackling the inequalities that the Secretary of State rightly mentioned. They are happening at a time when pressures on the service are increasing. The number of births has started to rise. In 2003-04, there were 5 per cent. more births than in the previous year. There is an increased level of intervention. Birth is an increasingly medicalised practice. Post-natal hospital stays can be longer when intervention is necessary, which inevitably places extra demands on midwives. The percentage of spontaneous births fell from 76.5 per cent. in 1980 to 66.5 per cent. in 2003-04. Meanwhile, the number of caesarean deliveries has increased from 9 per cent. in 1980 to 22.7 per cent. in 2003-04, and the trend is continuing in that direction. It is worth noting that back in the 1980s the World Health Organisation found that there were no additional health benefits associated with caesarean deliveries when they reach more than 10 to 15 per cent. of births. If that is correct&#151;I do not know whether there is any new evidence to counteract it&#151;there are resources to saved by finding ways of reversing the trend.</p>

 The main Opposition made great play of the lack of research evidence in this area, although investigations are being undertaken by the King&#146;s Fund as well as by the national perinatal epidemiology unit. There is an international dearth of evidence in the whole area of maternity. Does the hon. Gentleman agree that it is important to get that research, even if it takes years, so that we can get some of these questions answered?</p>

<p><a name="st_o238"><a name="07011053000415"><a name="70110-0010.htm_spnew2"><a name="07011053002349"><b>Norman Lamb:</b>
 Yes&#151;it is important to get the research so that we can make judgments on an objective basis. It is also worth considering practice elsewhere, as I will explain later.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o138"><a name="70110-0010.htm_para1"><a name="07011053000416">The other pressure that is developing is that increasing numbers of women over the age of 40 are becoming pregnant. Between 1991 and 2003, the number of women conceiving over the age of 40 almost doubled. Midwifery for those women is more demanding. More teenage pregnancies also have an impact on the service.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o139"><a name="70110-0010.htm_para2"><a name="07011053000417">Now we come to the Government&#146;s manifesto commitments. The manifesto said that by 2009</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o141"><a name="70110-0010.htm_para4"><a name="07011053000419">The brutal truth is that choice, far from being enhanced, is being compromised by the cuts that we have witnessed over the past 12 months.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o142"><a name="70110-0010.htm_para5"><a name="07011053000420">I should also mention the national service framework for children, young people and maternity services, which appears to be increasingly marginalised. It was published two years ago, and yet there is still no delivery plan for implementation of its maternity standard element. The Government&#146;s ambition is worthy, but it is undermined by financial crisis, delay and a determination to drive  <br>

everything from the centre. Last September, the NHS chief executive, David Nicholson, declared that there would be up to 60 reconfigurations of NHS services, determined not locally but nationally, affecting every strategic health authority in the land. He specifically identified accident and emergency, paediatrics and maternity services as areas ripe for reform.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o143"><a name="70110-0010.htm_para6"><a name="07011053000421">Let me deal briefly with the case for reconfiguring services. I accept that difficult choices sometimes have to be made. Women with high risk pregnancies must have access to the expertise necessary. Women falling into that category include those having twins, those with a past obstetric history, those with premature deliveries, those suffering high blood pressure and those with other clinical problems such as diabetes. They need the care provided in specialist units, and we will fail them if we do not ensure that they have access to them. That does not mean, however, that we should back away from giving women a real, informed choice. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o144"><a name="70110-0010.htm_para7"><a name="07011053000422">In developing maternity services we should be willing to learn lessons from other countries. Holland&#146;s maternity health statistics consistently rank among the best in the world. It has a national policy&#151;just like the policy in the Labour manifesto&#151;that guarantees every woman a midwife from the beginning of pregnancy through the first year after birth. Thirty to 40 per cent. of births there take place in the home under the care of a midwife. That option is proven to be safe and cost effective, and women choose it. Let us compare the figure with the tiny percentage of women who have home births in this country. Other methods of doing things appear to work and be cost-effective, and the choice should be made available in a positive way to women in the UK.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o145"><a name="70110-0010.htm_para8"><a name="07011053000423">It is remarkable that, in Holland, caesarean births have been kept below 10 per cent.&#151;compared with our 23 per cent.&#151;leading to massive cost savings and a better outcome for women. That shows that we can reconfigure without necessarily imposing an additional burden on the NHS budget.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o146"><a name="70110-0010.htm_para9"><a name="07011053000424">We should learn lessons from elsewhere and be willing to confront difficult decisions to ensure the best care and to empower women. Decisions should not be driven by crisis management because of the legal obligation to clear unsustainable debt.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o147"><a name="70110-0010.htm_para10"><a name="07011053000425">Our vision is of offering genuine, informed choices to women&#151;home care, midwife-led services, hospital delivery&#151;about where and how they give birth; making decisions locally, thus involving local communities in delivering the best framework of care; and ensuring that we have the work force necessary to realise that vision.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o148"><a name="70110-0010.htm_para11"><a name="07011053000428">The Government have already doubled investment in the NHS in the past 10 years, and that has helped hospitals such as Salford royal to achieve excellent results. Millions of pounds have been invested in our local acute services and that has led to extra doctors and nurses, shorter waiting times for operations and better cancer survival rates.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o149"><a name="70110-0010.htm_para12"><a name="07011053000429">I accept the need for the reconfiguration of paediatric, neonatal intensive care and maternity services so that they can continue to deliver the most effective care for patients. However, in the case of the reconfiguration of maternity, children&#146;s and neonatal services across Greater Manchester, I do not believe that the locally recommended option is the right decision. The outcry from my constituents and people across Salford shows that public opinion is strongly against the option that clinicians recommend.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o150"><a name="70110-0010.htm_para13"><a name="07011053000430">On 8 December 2006, the outcome of the &#147;Making it Better&#148; consultation into the future of services for women, babies and children was announced. The Joint Committee of Primary Care Trusts recommended that the future configuration of services across Greater Manchester should not involve Salford Royal NHS Foundation Trust retaining its maternity and neonatal services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o151"><a name="70110-0010.htm_para14"><a name="07011053000431">It is important to note that the Salford Royal NHS Foundation Trust supports the principle of fewer, larger maternity and children&#146;s units and developing three major neonatal intensive care units. I, too, support that. However, I believe that Greater Manchester would benefit more by retaining and developing the existing services at Salford royal.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o152"><a name="70110-0010.htm_para15"><a name="07011053000432">Salford already has one of only three large neonatal intensive care units in the north-west that are accredited by the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health. It is led by a dedicated team of neonatologists and nurses with specialist, advanced roles, and, unlike other hospitals, it has no recruitment difficulties. It takes many years to build such a successful team. It therefore makes sense to retain the hospital&#146;s excellent staff, who are such an integral part of the high quality of service that the hospital&#146;s maternity and neonatal units provide, rather than dispersing the expertise and trying to rebuild it elsewhere.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o153"><a name="70110-0010.htm_para16"><a name="07011053000433">Salford royal&#146;s unique range of specialist services enables it to support high risk maternity cases, thus benefiting approximately 120 women a year. Those services are not found in any other general hospital. Salford women would therefore have to travel elsewhere should the proposals go ahead. Similarly, Salford&#146;s neurosciences centre is the only unit that specialises in care for pregnant women. Continuing to provide neonatal services at Salford royal would be as safe and effective as providing them elsewhere, but&#151;crucially&#151;they would be delivered at lower cost, lower risk and with greater potential for the future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o154"><a name="70110-0010.htm_para17"><a name="07011053000434">The option in the consultation document that involves Salford continuing to provide maternity and neonatal in-patient care is also the best value option. It can be in place in 14 months and it costs &#163;1 million less than the other options. Choosing the cheapest and  <br>

quickest option appears to be common sense as it frees up money that can be spent on other improvements to the health service.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o155"><a name="70110-0010.htm_para18"><a name="07011053000435">Furthermore, Salford already has existing plans for developing children&#146;s services. It planned to establish an observation and assessment unit to support emergency care, which would be staffed by six consultant paediatricians and specialists in paediatric anaesthesia and radiology. Plans also exist to develop paediatric day surgery and community services for children. All those plans would be enormously valuable in a community that contains some of the most deprived neighbourhoods in the country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o156"><a name="70110-0010.htm_para19"><a name="07011053000436">It has been suggested that future neonatal units should be located only next to paediatric units. As Salford royal planned to open the new observation and assessment unit that I have just mentioned in 2008, babies born at the hospital would have access to the best neonatal and paediatric expertise. Retaining maternity services in Salford would be the safest option for Salfordians, as there would be better distribution of maternity units, with each one able to operate above the recommended minimum number of births for safe service.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o157"><a name="70110-0010.htm_para20"><a name="07011053000437">I firmly believe that health services should be situated where there is most need for them and that neonatal units need to be based where there are the highest number of low birth weight babies rather than where the biggest maternity units are. Salford has the fifth highest birth rate in Greater Manchester and the highest incidence of very low birth weight babies, so moving the unit away would deprive local people of a service that they desperately need. It is only right that those babies&#151;and their parents&#151;have easy access to the care that they require.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o158"><a name="70110-0010.htm_para21"><a name="07011053000438">Easy access is a vital matter, especially in Salford, which has the lowest car ownership in Greater Manchester. Travelling to the other proposed locations by public transport is not easy and, for a heavily pregnant woman or one with a small baby, it could be unpleasant and difficult. The length of the journeys would be unacceptable for some women. If the services were moved, some of my constituents simply could not access them as they should.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o159"><a name="70110-0010.htm_para22"><a name="07011053000439">The neonatal intensive care unit at Hope is groundbreaking in the research that it has carried out on tiny babies. Doctors and nurses led an international study to improve the care of very low birth weight babies. That research has been shared with the medical community and will have a bearing on the future care of very low birth weight babies throughout the world. The fact that Hope was the ideal unit to host the study, and the resulting improvements in care that will take place worldwide, prove that it is important for the unit to be able to continue its work and its research, hopefully leading to similar successes in the future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o160"><a name="70110-0010.htm_para23"><a name="07011053000440">Hope hospital is much loved and appreciated by the people of Salford. The trust has been rated as the most successful of all trusts in the north-west by the Healthcare Commission. Attention has been given to maternity and neonatal services at Hope hospital in the past few weeks, but Salford Members of Parliament have campaigned to keep our excellent services for many months.

<p><a name="stpa_o161"><a name="70110-0010.htm_para24"><a name="07011053000441">Our local paper, the <i> Salford Advertiser</i>, ran a campaign, Hands Off Hope, which attracted the support of 26,000 people. I spoke in support of retaining our services alongside my hon. Friend the Member for Eccles (Ian Stewart) at a rally on 25 March last year, organised by the <i> Salford Advertiser</i> and the city council. Those local campaigns for Hope and the massive support that they attracted are a powerful indication of the strength of local feeling about retaining the maternity and neonatal services that people value so highly.</p>

 My hon. Friend makes a powerful case for Salford, especially on access to services. Are not the implications that she describes for Salford exactly the same as for the other highly deprived area of north Manchester, which is served by North Manchester general hospital? If Salford royal hospital stayed open, North Manchester general hospital would probably lose its maternity unit under the plans. I emphasise that I do not accept the basis for the consultation. Would not it make sense to keep open Salford royal and North Manchester general hospitals, which are in the middle of some of the most deprived areas in the country?</p>

 I thank my hon. Friend for that intervention. One of the issues that needs to be considered in the final stage of the consultation is the need to keep services as proximate as possible to the most deprived communities. As I have made clear, the need for the services in Salford is caused by the high birth rate and the high incidence of very low birth weight babies, and it makes absolute sense, given the difficulties of public transport in our conurbations, to keep these services as local as possible.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o162"><a name="70110-0010.htm_para25"><a name="07011053000444">In summary, Salford MPs have argued consistently over many months to keep the local maternity and neonatal services at Hope hospital, and we have argued this on clinical grounds. I have supported the Government&#146;s policies on the NHS and on the need to reconfigure services, but I also support the view that the best option will be to retain services at Hope, because that is the quickest and cheapest way of achieving the aims set out in the consultation, which we endorsed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o163"><a name="70110-0010.htm_para26"><a name="07011053000445">Salford city council&#146;s community health and social care scrutiny committee has been asked to scrutinise the proposal for change made by the joint committee of PCTs locally. The decision may then be referred to the Secretary of State, who can refer the matter to the independent configuration panel. This is an example of the process working as it should when there is disagreement during a consultation. Given that I support the need to reconfigure services, I will support the decision made at the end of the process, but I believe that it is right, while the process is going on, for me as an MP and for other Salford MPs to continue to press the views of local people.</p>

to mention one particular matter that affects my constituency. Before I do that, however, I want to congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley) and his Front-Bench colleagues on choosing this important subject for debate today. I also want to join him in paying tribute to all the professionals involved in the maternity services&#151;the doctors, nurses and midwives, including those who serve my constituents in Hertfordshire.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o164"><a name="70110-0010.htm_para27"><a name="07011053000447">My hon.

Of the 102 maternity departments questioned, 74 per cent. reported that they were facing staff shortages. It is important, from my constituents&#146; point of view, to add that the survey also found that the problems were most acute in London and the south-east. My constituency in Hertfordshire is certainly no exception, in that it is experiencing similar problems to those found elsewhere in the south-east.</p>

I accept the health service&#146;s argument about this change being made for educational reasons, but my constituents see their maternity services as being under the same pressures that other parts of the health service in Hertfordshire are facing. They will not have been altogether convinced by the response of the Secretary of State when these problems were put to her today by my hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire. She said&#151;I hope that I am paraphrasing her fairly&#151;that Hertfordshire was spending too much and that it might need to make economies for the sake of other parts of the country.</p>

There are mothers-to-be there who would have received the antenatal classes who come from disadvantaged backgrounds, and I ask the Minister to reflect on that matter when he responds to the debate.

The antenatal classes have been suspended. I hope that there will be a rethink on that and that the Minister will encourage the Secretary of State to contribute to that rethink, so that we can have those antenatal classes restored.</p>

Are the Government prepared to see health services in Hertfordshire fall substantially below the level and quality of those provided in the rest of the country if that is what it will take to solve the problem of deficits?

 I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on this important issue. I concur with most of the comments made by the hon. Member for Worsley (Barbara Keeley), so I will try not to cover the same ground. I will put an historical perspective and then give a rationale for this matter to be referred by the Secretary of State to the appropriate committee.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o178"><a name="70110-0011.htm_para6"><a name="07011053000462">By 1996 there was a proposal to close the Royal Manchester children&#146;s hospital, also known as Pendlebury children&#146;s hospital, in my constituency of Eccles. The three Salford MPs at that time, and others, campaigned for a solution&#151;a new children&#146;s hospital to be built adjacent to Hope hospital on the Stott lane site in Salford. The other proposal was that it should go to St. Mary&#146;s hospital in Manchester. We lost that battle and the Secretary of State indeed decided that children&#146;s services should be transferred to St. Mary&#146;s.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o179"><a name="70110-0011.htm_para7"><a name="07011053000463">At that time, Salford and Trafford health authority considered whether a new paediatric unit should be set up at Hope. There was sense in that, because Hope hospital&#151;also referred to earlier as the Salford Royal trust&#151;was very close to Pendlebury children&#146;s hospital, which provided the specialist services. Hope therefore had no paediatrics, but it had excellent, well-developed neonatal and other services, including maternity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o180"><a name="70110-0011.htm_para8"><a name="07011053000464">When we realised that the children&#146;s services would move to St. Mary&#146;s, it was sensible for us to consider putting a paediatric unit at Hope. As we moved to the situation in which the Secretary of State had made that decision, there was clearly concern in Salford about putting children&#146;s services at St. Mary&#146;s&#151;so much so that the local council went for judicial review. I might add that Manchester city council had similar concerns about the proposal to put neurosciences at Salford and also, I understand, pursued judicial review.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o181"><a name="70110-0011.htm_para9"><a name="07011053000465">My right hon. Friend the Member for Holborn and St. Pancras (Frank Dobson), then the Secretary of State for Health, had to deal with all this, as is the norm with any serious decision of that nature. The outcome was that children&#146;s services were indeed transferred to St. Mary&#146;s in Manchester, but that Salford Hope hospital children&#146;s and maternity services would be protected. I call this the Dobson settlement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o182"><a name="70110-0011.htm_para10"><a name="07011053000466">The basis of that protection meant that beds at other Greater Manchester hospitals had to be closed. Indeed, there was talk of some of those other hospitals having beds that were clinically unviable. If those beds went, Hope&#146;s provision would be protected. I distinctly remember similar conversations being held in relation to Booth Hall and North Manchester general hospital.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o183"><a name="70110-0011.htm_para11"><a name="07011053000467">The point here is that we have been clear that we had agreement from the Secretary of State that Salford Hope hospital services would be protected. I was informed that it would take several years for the whole reconfiguration plan to be implemented, but by 1998 it became clear that the Salford and Trafford health authority consultation process, which was designed to create a new paediatric unit at Hope hospital, had been stopped by the Department of Health.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o184"><a name="70110-0011.htm_para12"><a name="07011053000468">The then Member of Parliament for Worsley, Terry Lewis, and I complained vigorously about that decision to stop a paediatrics facility being set up at Hope. I was aware that the then chief executive of Salford and Trafford health authority, Dr. Ian Greatorex, had offered his resignation as a matter of principle over the decision to stop the process to establish paediatrics at Hope and other matters.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o185"><a name="70110-0011.htm_para13"><a name="07011053000469">Terry Lewis MP and I were sympathetic to the situation that Dr. Greatorex found himself in, and we both supported his stand. From that point, I believe that the Dobson settlement, as I refer to it, was in jeopardy. Consequently, whenever I met with anyone to discuss health issues, I would ad nauseam state that the Dobson settlement must be implemented in full.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o186"><a name="70110-0011.htm_para14"><a name="07011053000470">In 2000, I attended a meeting of Greater Manchester MPs where I set out my views about the fact that the medically unviable beds at other hospitals not being closed was stopping the implementation of the Dobson settlement and his commitment that Hope&#146;s service would be protected. I continue to promote the Dobson settlement at every opportunity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o187"><a name="70110-0011.htm_para15"><a name="07011053000471">In autumn 2005, I received a letter from the strategic health authority saying that a new consultation process was intended to look at the provision of women&#146;s and children&#146;s services in Greater Manchester and beyond. I believe it was called &#147;Making It Better, Making It Real&#148;. I was astounded that there was no proposal that would maintain maternity provision at Hope in Salford.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o188"><a name="70110-0011.htm_para16"><a name="07011053000472">I therefore wrote immediately to the strategic health authority, saying that the proposed consultation would break the Dobson settlement, that it must include a Salford Hope hospital option and that the proposed financial model was flawed.

council, the PCT and my colleague MPs. Subsequently, a broad-based &#147;Save Hope&#148; community campaign was established, which I and others supported. I continue to work with political colleagues and others on that campaign.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o190"><a name="70110-0011.htm_para18"><a name="07011053000474">In addition to meeting with the council, Hope&#146;s trust, community groups and others, I attended meetings of the joint PCTs to lobby for and press home the Salford case. The strategic health authority was forced to add an option C to the consultation, and indeed to review the financial model. In December 2006, it phoned me to say that the joint PCTs had decided to adopt option A, which meant that the Salford Hope facility would be closed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o191"><a name="70110-0011.htm_para19"><a name="07011053000475">I hear hon. Members mutter, &#147;What about Dr. Ian Greatorex, then?&#148; He has made certain allegations regarding the period in 1998 that I described, which are in the public domain. I make no comment on that, as it is for the Member of Parliament for Salford, not for Eccles, to answer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o192"><a name="70110-0011.htm_para20"><a name="07011053000476">Today, I ask the Secretary of State to refer the case back to the independent reconfiguration panel, but not only on the basis that the original process was flawed. I am told, although I have no written evidence yet, that the financial review shows clearly that option C would be a money saver to the tune of up to &#163;2 million year on year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o193"><a name="70110-0011.htm_para21"><a name="07011053000477">In addition, it is important to realise that the figures on viability quoted by the Conservative spokesman are contested. My understanding is that the maximum that any facility should offer is 6,000 births a year, and the minimum 3,000. I would argue with the way in which the joint PCTs addressed those questions, because, if the order had been changed, and those issues had been addressed first, in the Greater Manchester area Salford Hope hospital would have been found to meet both those criteria. Other hospitals within the plan under option A exceed the 6,000 births by as many as 800, and some have as few as 2,500 births a year. In my view, that would have been enough, had it been considered earlier, to rule out option A. On that basis, I must ask the Secretary of State to review the situation and to refer the decision to the independent reconfiguration panel.</p>

 My hon. Friend makes an important point about distances, which is one of the issues being considered in our consultation launched last month. When I was making comparisons with other countries, I should have referred to the point made effectively in a document published by the think tank Reform in December 2005: one of the reasons that countries on the continent do not have to engage in this kind of centralisation of maternity services is that they have put in place a strong neonatal transport network. We should consider that option, which would allow us not to have to centralise to the extent proposed.</p>

Not surprisingly, it has taken all the changes off the table and is sensibly going back to consult GPs again, properly, over a period to establish whether consensus is possible. However, the people of north Oxfordshire and south Northamptonshire are determined to retain all the general services at the Horton, and for it to remain a general hospital. They are not prepared to see services salami-sliced and cut away bit by bit, while the Horton is undermined and turned into little more than a supra-community hospital. It has been made very clear to me that if local GPs do not consider proposals from the Oxford Radcliffe NHS Trust to be safe, they will continue to argue, publicly and vocally, that the proposed services are unsafe and unacceptable.</p>

 Our debate on maternity services has been good, albeit brief, and I congratulate Members on their contributions, in which they expressed concern about the future of those services. The debate is timely, as many maternity units throughout the country face closure.</p>

Member for North Norfolk (Norman Lamb) raised the issue of deficits and the link to closures, as highlighted by the Health Committee; he was right to do so. The hon. Member for Worsley (Barbara Keeley) made a thoughtful contribution. She said that although she does not support the option recommended locally, which will result in the loss of services at Salford royal hospital, she will stand by the decision. However, she also rightly stated that services should be based near to where need is greatest, and she made the point that Salford has one of the highest&#151;the third highest, I think&#151;birth rate in the country.</p>

He mentioned the effect of staff shortages and cuts in his part of Hertfordshire. He revealed that his local trust is making cuts and closing services because of financial deficits. He also commented on the lack of choice in how and where women can give birth.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o211"><a name="70110-0012.htm_para8"><a name="07011053000503">The hon. Member for Eccles (Ian Stewart) talked about the implications of paediatric services in his area being moved away. He confirmed the powerful case made by Dr. Greatorex in his letter of many years ago; he stated that, under what he called the Dobson settlement, he felt he had been given an assurance that the remaining services at Hope hospital in Salford would be protected&#151;an assurance given to him by a former Secretary of State. However, with option A now being chosen, that appears unlikely.</p>

Friend the Member for Banbury (Tony Baldry) referred powerfully to a survey of 85 local GPs who used the word &#147;inhumane&#148; in describing proposed changes to maternity services in his area. He raised the important issue of the distance to the nearest services in considering the well-being of patients, and he reminded Members that there is often&#151;not only in his constituency, but in constituencies throughout the country&#151;a contradiction between the views of local people and GPs and the decisions made by primary care trusts, which are in many cases under financial pressure and therefore wish to centralise services.</p>

model for safe and accessible care, which is a point that the hon. Member for Worsley made; and, thirdly and overarching the other issues, the shortage of midwives in the NHS at a time of financial difficulty and deficits. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o214"><a name="70110-0012.htm_para11"><a name="07011053000506">The Government often accuse the Conservative party of scaremongering&#151;which is somewhat predictable, but never mind. However, for evidence of the impending crisis in the maternity work force we need look no further than the survey of the heads of midwifery published this week by the Royal College of Midwives, which has been referred to. Two thirds reported that their unit was understaffed, while one in five claimed that midwifery staffing establishment had been cut. I ask the Minister to say in his summation whether that is scaremongering.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o215"><a name="70110-0012.htm_para12"><a name="07011053000507">In the past year alone, the overall head count of midwives working in the NHS fell, while the number of whole-time equivalent midwives&#151;the best measure for the availability of a midwife at any single point in time&#151;increased by a mere 5 per cent. between 1997 and 2005. That has been happening during a period when the birth rate has been rising rapidly, and the maternity case mix is becoming more complex as women choose to give birth both earlier and later in life.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o216"><a name="70110-0012.htm_para13"><a name="07011053000508">The jobs crisis in maternity leads to existing midwives being overworked and, sometimes, unable to cope. Indeed, the RCM has said publicly that midwives are struggling to provide good care. Does the Minister believe that to be scaremongering?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o217"><a name="70110-0012.htm_para14"><a name="07011053000509">There is little doubt that jobs and training posts are being cut for short-term financial reasons, due to deficits. An analysis of the financial outturn figures published in <i> Hansard</i> on 9 October 2006 clearly shows that three quarters of the midwife-led maternity units under threat are operated by trusts with financial deficits. But this short-term fix is highly irresponsible given the ageing profile of the midwifery work force and the impact on newly qualified midwives unable to get that all-important first job in the health service.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o218"><a name="70110-0012.htm_para15"><a name="07011053000510">With the RCM now claiming that NHS trusts are increasingly reliant on maternity care assistants and employing fewer newly qualified midwives, what a betrayal is that of midwives who were encouraged to join the profession to address long-term shortages and have been trained at a cost to the taxpayer of &#163;45,000 but now cannot find that first post. Again, does the Minister believe that to be scaremongering?</p>

 I want to make the House aware of some figures. I asked the Government whether they had figures for the numbers of student midwives getting jobs. They did not, but I can tell the House that of the 36 students who finished last year at Salford university, only three have got a job, and one of those has had to emigrate. That reinforces the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point that these difficulties with training have a financial cause. The midwives are there, but they are not being given the jobs.</p>

 I totally concur with those figures. The University of West of England figures show that about two thirds of those leaving training posts were unable to find jobs in the NHS. That contradicts what has been suggested by Ministers up to now.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o219"><a name="70110-0012.htm_para16"><a name="07011053000513">While I am on the subject, I point quickly to something that the Secretary of State said about the European working time directive. She certainly seemed to downplay the effect that it has had on decisions about services. I refer her to the independent reconfiguration panel&#146;s comments regarding the Calderdale and Huddersfield trust. It says that proposals for a paediatric rota to support consultant-led maternity services at Huddersfield royal infirmary were explored, but were not considered viable in the light of the implementation of the European working time directive. It is clearly wrong for Ministers to go round the country suggesting that the directive has had little or no effect on decisions about reconfiguration and closure.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o220"><a name="70110-0012.htm_para17"><a name="07011053000514">As for the effect on patients, one thing is certain. The Government&#146;s 2005 manifesto commitment to offer every woman one-to-one midwifery support cannot be met unless swift action is taken to improve our midwife numbers. One-to-one care is the gold standard in maternity and places women at the centre of the NHS. It has our support. Will the Minister explain how that promise will be implemented when there is such a shortage of midwives?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o221"><a name="70110-0012.htm_para18"><a name="07011053000515">Further to that, will the Minister make a brief statement, either now or in writing, about the viability of the community midwifery model developed by the Independent Midwives Association? The IMA has been invited to apply for a pathfinder grant to roll out the model in a trial PCT, but so far its proposal has not been given ministerial backing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o222"><a name="70110-0012.htm_para19"><a name="07011053000516">Of course, one-to-one-midwifery support is only one piece in the maternity jigsaw; another is the provision of choice about where a woman gives birth, whether at home, in a midwife-led environment or in a consultant-led unit, and about the methods of pain relief being used. The provision of such choice is clearly important for the promotion of well-being in childbirth. The principle is enshrined in the 2005 Labour party manifesto, in the maternity standard of the national service framework and in the draft NICE guidance on intrapartum care. It is a vital feature of the patient-centred NHS, yet the Government are still complicit in the closure of midwife-led units and birth centres for short-term financial reasons, insisting that it is a matter for the local NHS while doing nothing to promote alternatives. Before Christmas, we were able to identify approximately 20 midwife-led units that were either being closed or facing closure, each of which was a much-loved local institution.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o223"><a name="70110-0012.htm_para20"><a name="07011053000517">The threat of closure hangs over not just midwife-led units and community birth centres, because major reconfigurations are threatening consultant-led units and specialised services and there are proposals of centralisation around maternity super-centres. Communities throughout the country face the loss of much-loved local hospitals. Before Christmas, we identified a further 20 consultant-led units that were facing the threat of closure or being downgraded. That figure was challenged before Christmas, so it was interesting that Secretary of State did not bother to challenge any of the figures on proposed closures during today&#146;s debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o224"><a name="70110-0012.htm_para21"><a name="07011053000518">There is little doubt that the closures in some places are occurring for short-term financial reasons in order to save the Secretary of State&#146;s political skin. In others, however, service redesign is being guided by a confused and often conflicting idea about the best size and style  <br>

of maternity services for the promotion of safety and accessibility. On the continent, large maternity units are the exception. The largest unit in Germany has just more than 3,000 live births a year. However, in this country, we seem hellbent on channelling women into ever larger maternity units. The number of maternity units delivering fewer than 3,000 births a year has halved since 1996, yet there is no evidence-based model of care for maternity services to suggest that that is the right course of action&#151;it is fundamentally wrong. Will the Minister take this opportunity to express his commitment to a consultation and national debate on the topic, or is this another area in which the official Opposition must take the lead and engage professionals and women to develop policy?</p>

The right hon. Member for Salford (Hazel Blears) is a case in point. She sees it fit to stand up for the people of Salford when there is a television crew in her constituency, but not here in the House of Commons. She has said:</p>

Ministers are trying to have it both ways. On the one hand they support the principle of a national service redesign yet, on the other hand, they oppose closures when they affect their constituencies. It is a blatant case of &#147;do as I say, not as I do&#148;, if ever there was one. If these Ministers carry on in that way, they will be beating a path to the Liberals&#146; door very shortly.

What of the past 10 years? Conservative Members have championed policies to encourage people to opt out of the national health service.

 I suspect that that is more a matter of debate than a point of order for the Chair.</p>

<p><a name="st_o263"><a name="07011053000540"><a name="70110-0013.htm_spnew4"><a name="07011053002374"><b>Mr. Lewis:</b>
 The hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley) referred to the closure of the unit at North Manchester general hospital, which I know to be absolute nonsense.</p>

child gets the best possible start in life and every parent has the chance to be the best they can. Our 10 health-led parenting project sites will test out a new approach, which has the potential to make a radical difference to a child&#146;s development and thus their lifelong opportunities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o238"><a name="70110-0013.htm_para4"><a name="07011053000542">The Secretary of State and I will shortly make proposals to support the NHS to deliver our historic promise of real maternity choice for all parents by 2009. Professionals and managers should seek to reorganise services in a way that is consistent with the aims of safety, quality and choice, based on local knowledge and follows proper and authentic engagement with the local community.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o239"><a name="70110-0013.htm_para5"><a name="07011053000543">I want to deal with specific contributions to the debate. The hon. Member for North Norfolk (Norman Lamb) described reconfigurations driven by finance. The requirement for the NHS to get its books into balance is one for which we make no apology, and the reconfiguration that I know best began in Manchester about two and a half or three years ago. It has absolutely nothing to do with any financial challenges that the NHS faces at the moment. The Liberal Democrats say that we should not oppose reconfiguration per se&#151;there is a first for the Liberal Democrats: not opposing things for the sake of it, whatever the best interests of the wider population.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o240"><a name="70110-0013.htm_para6"><a name="07011053000544">My hon. Friend the Member for Worsley (Barbara Keeley) made a good case for Hope hospital and the hon. Member for Hertsmere (Mr. Clappison) talked about the temporary suspension of antenatal classes for first-time mums. I certainly cannot intervene in that, but I will write to him to find out further details about why that happened. The hon. Gentleman might be interested to know that, under the funding formula advocated by his Front Benchers, his constituents would be 9.2 per cent. a head worse off than under the current NHS funding formula.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o241"><a name="70110-0013.htm_para7"><a name="07011053000545">My hon. Friend the Member for Eccles (Ian Stewart) has a longstanding and impressive track record of campaigning for the development of paediatric and maternity services and their maintenance at Hope hospital. He has been a passionate and powerful advocate in that context both publicly and privately. My hon. Friend&#146;s call for it to be referred to the Secretary of State depends on the decisions taken by the overview and scrutiny committees of the individual local authorities affected by the decisions. I know that he has had discussions with his own overview and scrutiny committee in Salford.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o242"><a name="70110-0013.htm_para8"><a name="07011053000546">The hon. Member for Banbury (Tony Baldry) is concerned about reconfiguration. There is a process and professionals will make their views known locally. The overview and scrutiny committee will have an opportunity to make its judgment; if it is unhappy, it has the option under the legislation to refer the matter to the Secretary of State.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o243"><a name="70110-0013.htm_para9"><a name="07011053000547">In conclusion, real hypocrisy in the NHS is claiming support for it at every opportunity, while voting against extra investment. It is championing local decision making and operational independence, while portraying every change to local services as a cut. It is promising to match NHS spending, while having an economic policy that will require millions of pounds of NHS cuts. Real hypocrisy is criticising the Government&#146;s work force strategy when there are 33,000 more doctors and 85,000 more nurses since 1997. Opposition Members have no shame.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o244"><a name="70110-0013.htm_para10"><a name="07011053000548">We should contrast that with the present Government&#146;s policies on the NHS. By 2009, every woman will have choice over where and how they have their babies and what pain relief to use. We want every woman to be supported throughout her pregnancy by a named midwife. By 2008, no one will have to wait for an operation more than 18 weeks from the date of their first GP visit to the door of the operating theatre. By 2008, there will be 2,500 children centres; and there will be 3,500 by 2010.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o245"><a name="70110-0013.htm_para11"><a name="07011053000549">It was the Labour party that created the NHS, it was the Labour party that was asked by the people to save it in 1997, and it is the Labour Government who, fittingly, are charged with its transformation. The NHS is the glue that binds the values of the Labour party and the British people. We have no need to prove that the NHS is safe in our hands, only the awesome responsibility of ensuring that the NHS completes the journey from a third-world health service in 1997 to a world-class health service in time for its 60th anniversary in 2008.</p>

 I am pleased to say that I had my deaf ear towards my hon. Friend, but I will come to the essence of his point.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o256"><a name="70110-0014.htm_para6"><a name="07011053001136">The Government have pointed out that post offices closed under the last Conservative Government too, but let no one be in any doubt that under this Labour Government, post offices have closed at almost three times the rate they did when we were in government. I shall give the House the figures. From 1985 to 1997 post offices closed at the rate of 201 per year, but under the present Government the rate of closure has been over 580 a year. Such massive cuts in the network have deprived thousands of vulnerable people of their vital services. Once again, the Government are ignoring the concerns of millions of people. What assurance can the Secretary of State give the House that the cuts will not be more than the 2,500 that he has already announced?</p>

 As my hon. Friend knows, the permanent post office in Bingley in my constituency has closed and we have only a temporary facility there. Does he agree that a town the size of Bingley should have a permanent post office, and that the Royal Mail and the Government should do everything possible to make sure that a permanent post office facility is maintained in Bingley?</p>

 That is a perfect example of the problem in the network. One would have thought that a town as important as Bingley, represented by my hon. Friend, would merit a post office, but the present system means that it will close, and even his hardworking efforts on behalf of his constituents will come up against the buffers. Perhaps the Secretary of State can explain how large a town must be before it can justify a post office.</p>

 I notice that the hon. Gentleman&#146;s motion calls for greater freedom for the Post Office to develop.

They have gone for easy headlines, but their actions have not matched their words. The problem has been and remains that the Government do not have a long-term strategy for the post office network. They say they want to support it, but in practice they have removed business from it and have failed to make the reforms necessary to underpin the network that exists at present.</p>

 The reforms surely ought also to be in the way the Post Office operates.

The Government have some responsibility for not insisting on a much more up-to-date system.</p>

 My right hon. Friend makes a serious point that is crucially entwined with the issue of the network but also takes us to the question that I shall deal with in a moment&#151;that of ensuring, through its ownership and future investment, that the activities of Royal Mail can marry happily with the post office network.</p>

 An important part of the context is that local communities face the closure not only of post offices but Department for Work and Pensions offices and tax offices. That will be a triple whammy that rural communities in Wales and elsewhere can scarcely bear.</p>

 I am sure that you would caution me, Mr. Deputy Speaker, were I to stray on to the operation of other Departments, but there is a serious point about how they operate in conjunction with the post office network. An essential part of our proposals is that the entire apparatus of government, particularly local government, can consider how it can properly use the post office network and channel much of its activity through it so as to give it a chance to remain in place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o259"><a name="70110-0014.htm_para9"><a name="07011053001147">To see why the network has been declining under this Government, we need to recognise how they have reduced the amount of Government business that post offices can undertake. The Government have not merely given people the option of, say, having their pensions paid into their bank accounts&#151;they have, as is pretty well documented, used strong-arm tactics to press pensioners who wanted to support their local post office by using the Post Office card account into giving up their accounts. Customers no longer have the option of buying a TV licence at the post office or of having a pension book. The Government even considered removing passport services and abolishing the Post Office card account. Such measures not only massively reduce direct revenue for sub-postmasters but reduce footfall in branches and reduce the amount of non-Government business that branches do.</p>

risks to the Post Office&#146;s Government business in future is that when the replacement for the card account is introduced the Government may carry on with the same sort of bullying tactics to try to prevent people from switching to it. Those tactics would have a seriously detrimental effect on post offices, especially in vulnerable areas such as the highlands and islands.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman makes a serious point. The ongoing uncertainty about the size of the network has hindered Post Office Ltd. whenever it has bid for contracts such as the TV licence contract, which it lost. The uncertainty created by the Government hinders its commercial ambition and scope.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o260"><a name="70110-0014.htm_para10"><a name="07011053001150">When Adam Crozier said that he could fulfil Royal Mail&#146;s obligations with just 4,000 post offices, he created huge speculation about the future of the network. The Government needed to put an end to that speculation, but unfortunately the Secretary of State&#146;s statement to the House in December failed to achieve that objective.</p>

 A first step it may be, but the trouble is that there are many more steps to be taken, and with greater certainty than in December.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o261"><a name="70110-0014.htm_para11"><a name="07011053001153">Part of the remaining speculation centres around the Post Office card account. That was designed to be a very simple form of account that can only have benefit payments made into it, but it is used by more than 4 million people, and transactions made with it account for 10 per cent of a sub-postmaster&#146;s net pay.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o262"><a name="70110-0014.htm_para12"><a name="07011053001154">For most of 2006, the Government&#146;s message was that POCA would be scrapped in 2010. In December, the Secretary of State came to the House and promised some sort of replacement card account, although he gave no assurance that the Department for Work and Pensions would end the pressure that it has put on vulnerable benefit recipients to give up their card account. Of course, the U-turn in the face of pressure from Conservative Members was welcome. However, the Secretary of State created further uncertainty by announcing that the operation of the successor system would be put out to tender.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o263"><a name="70110-0014.htm_para13"><a name="07011053001155">If the Post Office&#146;s ability to bid for the contract is hampered by speculation and uncertainty, pensioners may pick up their money from Paypoint outlets in a few years, with enormous consequent losses to the Post Office. The stark truth is that the very plan that the Secretary of State announced to enhance the post office network could prove to be the Trojan horse that poses the greatest threat to it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o264"><a name="70110-0014.htm_para14"><a name="07011053001156">The Government must recognise that continuing uncertainty is doing great harm to the prospects of a sustainable future for the post office network.</p>

 The Government must understand and reinforce the important message that so many people chose the card account because it was a safe way for them to budget. There is no risk of bank charges or accidental overdrafts. It is important that they should not be bullied prematurely into moving into a banking system where those on low incomes are at risk of facing high charges.</p>

 Let me marry all the interventions by converting them into questions for the Secretary of State. Will he tell us today the timetable for tendering for the successor card account? What differences will there be between the current POCA and its successor?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o265"><a name="70110-0014.htm_para15"><a name="07011053001161">Uncertainty also surrounds the social network subsidy. In answer to parliamentary questions, the Secretary of State was unable to give a future figure for that. However, he said that it was not expected to exceed the current annual sum of &#163;150 million. We can only conclude that the Government are planning to cut the subsidy that they provide to maintain the post office network. That is hardly reassuring to the thousands of sub-postmasters who rely on the money. The Secretary of State squints when I say that, so I look forward to a clear commitment that the figure will remain the same.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o266"><a name="70110-0014.htm_para16"><a name="07011053001162">It is worth noting that the Government call the payment to the social network a &#147;subsidy&#148;. When the Chancellor spends billions on the NHS, he never calls it &#147;spending&#148;, it is always described as &#147;investment&#148;. However, when the Government want to get away with reducing their support, even though it fulfils an important social purpose, they call it &#147;reducing subsidy&#148;.</p>

However, Royal Mail&#146;s management is still waiting for Ministers to decide on their proposals for employee share ownership. As the postal services market has been liberalised, Royal Mail, as my right hon. Friend again pointed out, has begun to face stiff competition from technologically well equipped rivals. If it is to compete effectively, it must be able to make significant investment. However, it must also change its methods to respond to a changed marketplace.</p>

 I totally agree with the hon. Lady, and I am happy to echo her comments. One cannot stress often enough that the issue of post office closures is as much an urban issue as a rural one.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o274"><a name="70110-0015.htm_para1"><a name="07011053001178">What the Government should have announced in December was, first, that they would give sub-postmasters greater freedom to find new business opportunities. At present, Royal Mail writes clauses into sub-postmasters&#146; contracts forbidding them to take on certain business opportunities that might transform their finances, if only they had the chance. The long-term future of the network will be best secured if the Post Office is opened up to new markets and new customers. Just as many pubs that were tied to one brewery are now free houses, so post offices should be released from their ties and be allowed to offer a broader range of services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o275"><a name="70110-0015.htm_para2"><a name="07011053001179">We recognise the fantastic service provided by sub-postmasters to their local communities. They tell us that they do not want to depend on subsidy, but instead want the opportunity to do more business and serve their customers, yet that is exactly what the Government are denying them. Conservatives would rewrite the sub-postmasters&#146; contract, allowing them to provide a greater range of products and services, including private mail services. Will the Secretary of State give the same assurance today?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o276"><a name="70110-0015.htm_para3"><a name="07011053001180">Secondly, the Government should be following the lead of Conservatives in encouraging local councils to see what services they can provide through post offices and whether they could use the post office network in their area better to engage with local residents. There have been a number of plans and pilot schemes aimed at using post offices as one-stop shops to provide a wide range of information and services from local government and other local bodies, but the Government, instead of extending the range of service that they allow councils to offer, restrict it. Will the Secretary of State undertake to look at that again?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o277"><a name="70110-0015.htm_para4"><a name="07011053001181">What about using post offices as a hub for government information? We are looking at how we can provide for people who have concerns about a range of Government services to be able to access advice and answers at their post office. The Government have talked about doing that, but the delivery, as so often, has added up to nothing. May I ask the Secretary of State also to look at that again?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o278"><a name="70110-0015.htm_para5"><a name="07011053001182">On both sides of the House, there is an understanding that huge social benefits accrue from the post office network, but it is less well documented that there are clear economic benefits too. Perhaps the Secretary of State will tell the House what research his Department has done on that issue. I understand that the Treasury did a study and found that for each pound of support that the Government have put into the network, there has been more than &#163;2 of economic benefit to the local area.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o279"><a name="70110-0015.htm_para6"><a name="07011053001183">The Department of Trade and Industry should be thinking that if it can make the conditions right for more post offices to be successful, it will reap the economic benefits. Instead, the best that we have seen from the Secretary of State is a plan for the management of the decline of the post office network.</p>

The National Federation of SubPostmasters itself has said that.</p>

 I will deal with that point, but it is not unreasonable for me to point to the conclusion reached not just by the hon.

Like the previous Government, we have been seeing post office closures year after year; I will come on to the question of Government business later. We must, however, address the question of what we can realistically do to ensure that we have a national network. For the avoidance of doubt, I have always been clear that we need many more branches than the number that are commercially viable.

The new chief executive of the Post Office has made it clear that he wants to encourage new business. I think that I am right that the Post Office is now one of the major providers of foreign currency exchange and is selling travel insurance and various other products that are bringing people into post offices. We want to encourage that.

Therefore, the problem has not just started in the past few years: it has been gathering pace ever since direct payments were introduced in, I think, the mid-1980s. As I said in my statement to the House in December, the problem is that over a number of years people&#146;s shopping and banking habits, including their use of the internet and e-mail, have meant that, one way or another, fewer and fewer of them have come into the post office. Let me deal with the point made by the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton and others that the Government are somehow forcing that to happen.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o286"><a name="70110-0015.htm_para13"><a name="07011053001205">For years people have been choosing to have money paid into their bank accounts, such as child benefit and pensions.

 As we said in our consultation document and as I said in my statement, that is our intention. Any Government must put a cap on the amount of compensation that they can pay. When the consultation period ends and we reach our conclusions, the Post Office will look at its network in different parts of the country, come up with proposals and&#151;this is an important point&#151;try to manage the situation to ensure that there are post offices that meet the access criteria. We must not allow a situation to evolve in which people simply sell-up their businesses. It is important to bear in mind that most such businesses are owned by private individuals; they are not Government-owned. In areas such as that which the hon. Gentleman represents we do not want situations to arise in which people retire or sell-up their businesses and there is no longer a post office.</p>

 The Secretary of State is right that if nothing is done there will continue to be post office closures; we all understand that, of course. However, he is proposing a quantum leap in the number of closures, in the hope that that will somehow stop the process for ever and a day so that we are then stuck with what will be a new network. Instead, he should see how sustainable the current number is. He keeps saying that it is not sustainable, but he has not advanced any evidence as to why it is not sustainable. Why does he not shelve the idea of closing 2,500 and concentrate on the measures that have been put forward to enable post offices to develop their own businesses?

 I never thought that I would see this day, but I totally agree with what the hon. Gentleman says&#151;that should finish him off. The approach of leaving nature to take its course is wrong because if one or two postmasters or postmistresses in a particular area, especially a rural area, simply decided to sell up and stop trading, there would be gaps in provision unless things were organised properly. This time, the Post Office is going to examine individual areas and determine who wants to go in each area&#151;quite a large number of postmasters and postmistresses are saying that they want to go. That might match up with what is required to bring about a more coherent network, but it might not. In circumstances in which an individual in one place wants to go while another wants to stay in business, it might be necessary to move the post office so that there is a better distribution of post offices.</p>

 We have not heard much from the Opposition about the fact that pressures of change have built up in recent years. However, we have an opportunity for innovation, such as through mobile post offices, which were proposed in the White Paper. In my neighbouring constituency of Brigg and Goole, the West Halton post office, which had closed, reopened with the involvement of the parish council. Parish councils, community groups, local councils and the Local Government Association can play a role, but we have not heard much about that. When such an approach was proposed for my area of north Lincolnshire by the Labour group, the Conservative council voted against the proposal.</p>

 I am surprised to hear that, given that I understood that the Conservative leader had written to all his councillors saying that they should be looking at ways to put business the Post Office&#146;s way. My hon. Friend is right. An aspect of the proposals that I set out last December was for local authorities to have a greater financial influence over support for post offices. For example, they could see whether they could provide services jointly through post offices, and so on. As for additional business, it is important to recognise that most post offices are private businesses. It is therefore open to postmasters to take on different, non-post office business, and most do.</p>

Some restrictions exist, basically to prevent a postmaster from taking on an activity that competes directly with other Post Office business. I can see the business rationale for that, as I shall explain. For example, the Post Office sells products such as travel insurance. That is subject to national agreements, and helps to bring people into post offices, but a difficulty would arise if someone else were to cherry pick that business, as that would undermine the coherence of the national contract.</p>

If the Post Office has entered into a contract to sell travel insurance or to allow people to pay certain bills, I can see why it would not like to have a competitor sitting alongside. As I said, I am prepared to look at any proposal to enable the Post Office to get more business, but I want to avoid ending up with a situation in which its financial stability is undermined by someone who is able to cherry pick a particular bit of its business. That possibility would throw into question the viability of the rest of the Post Office network. We need to remember that much of that network is not likely to include post offices with valuable contracts; it is more likely to include those that are fairly well used.</p>

 I would want to give the right hon. Gentleman an entirely accurate picture, so I shall write to him about it. He may concede, however, that as long as I have heard him in the Chamber, he has been one of the most severe critics of Governments&#151;his as well as ours&#151;who spend too much. As I said at the start, successive Governments have rightly been under pressure to cut their administrative costs. Part of the administrative costs of the Department for Work and Pensions, where I was the Secretary of State for four years, related to benefit payments. It seems to me that if people choose to get their pensions paid into a bank account, the Government should facilitate that rather than stand in the way. The right hon. Gentleman will know&#151;the James review is relevant&#151;that at the last election, the Conservative Opposition banked those savings.

For older people in my constituency, who still look to the Post Office for their pensions and to pay their bills, the key advantage is that they can do so safely with a known postmaster and postmistress who make them feel secure and can help them access the services that they need.</p>

Financial deprivation is an extremely significant issue. The banking network has little interest in those who are financially excluded or who live on the financial margins, but they constitute the perfect community to be served by post offices. For people who need access to financial services, post offices, perhaps in co-operation with credit unions and others, offer a way in which to access those services and to change their life opportunities. The needs of such people will never be met by the banks, which will deal with them only when dragged, kicking and screaming, by Government regulation. That is not an enthusiastic and positive way of generating the new services that such people need.</p>

 My hon. Friend points out that the access criteria are worth dwelling on. The Secretary of State rightly pointed out that we are discussing only about 14,000 individual businesses. If we are to close 2,500 of them very quickly, the temptation must be to be opportunistic and carry out the easiest closures. An example can be found in Staveley, a large village in my constituency, where the sub-postmistress wants to leave and sell the business. That would be an easy closure if one were being opportunistic, but it would be wrong to do it because there is clearly a massive village community to be served.

If the Government cannot marry those two elements, they are missing out on the great opportunities that we face today.

The Secretary of State will be conscious that previous announcements&#151;I remember them from my time as a member of the Select Committee on the Treasury&#151;were all geared towards ending the Post Office card account in 2010. That contract was worth &#163;150 million a year to the Post Office, and the card is used by 4.5 million people. Anyone who has tried to apply for one, and has gone through the processes involved, knows that one has to be really determined to get a card.

Frankly, I do not think that anybody can guarantee that in a fair tender process. We would all like to hear what the contingency plan is, in case the Post Office is not successful in the tender. It has lost tender after tender because it has not been sure of its future, and because it has not been organised in a way that allows it to offer the most efficient and effective service available. The loss of the BBC licence fee service is a good example of that. The Post Office was not able to compete, in part because of the network uncertainty, and in part because of the many overhanging difficulties that mean that it cannot put together the most efficient, competitive tender.</p>

How much will be targeted on closures, and how much will be used to develop new business? Many of the decisions and the presentation of arguments that would help to end the uncertainty for postmasters and sub-postmasters have been delayed, because the Government cannot decide how to develop their relationship with Royal Mail and whether to enter into an employee share scheme. Presumably, we have to wait until the Chancellor has had an opportunity to challenge for the leadership, as he needs support from Labour Members who are not keen on employee share ownership. It is extremely unfair that changes to such a fragile system should be pending while we await the outcome of those internal changes.</p>

The Secretary of State said that there was a problem about competition that involved Paypoint. Paypoint wants more outlets, but because of the notion that there will be competition, a sub-postmaster who would like a Paypoint machine cannot have one because it is a rival product. The Secretary of State mentioned travel insurance, but if Paypoint provided, for example, only TV licences, I do not understand why that would constitute a rival product. I should therefore like a little more explanation of the restriction on Paypoint.

of payment is too costly, the Post Office needs to start looking at what it is charging such organisations to collect these payments. Perhaps it is not demonstrating as much business sense as it should, if it is driving away custom. In a sense, that is what happened with the payment of television licence fees. The BBC said that collecting those payments through the Post Office was very expensive.

An example was something that a resident of my constituency told me recently. They wanted to send a letter by recorded delivery and went to their local village sub-post office. Unfortunately, it was shut that day, so they went to the shop in the next village. Unfortunately, the sub-post office in the shop was also closed that day, so they had to make quite a lengthy journey to the nearest town. This was not at some obscure time; it was in the middle of the working week. The reason for this happening is that the nature of some of the sub-post offices&#146; contracts means that they are not open at certain times of day.

<p><a name="stpa_o340"><a name="70110-0018.htm_para14"><a name="07011053001356">Selling up could leave a gap in provision. A lot of people have been running sub-post offices for many years, which has skewed the age profile to the top of the range. Many of those people are thinking of retiring. They think that the package is good, and if they want to retire they can do so. Now, we have back-up. In the past, we would not know whether a gap in provision in a village would be filled by another sub-post office, but, due to what the Government are saying, that would now be carefully analysed. If an area was left without a post office, we would look at bringing in another one. That is absolutely vital for the future.</p>

 I thank my hon. Friend for that apt description of some postmasters who want to retire. When post offices are closing, should not the Opposition be a little more responsible in their campaigning with regard to their terminology, language and approach? Should they not try to work with the Government to ensure that there are no gaps in provision for specific areas?</p>

 I certainly think that the difference between what the previous Government did and what we are suggesting as the way forward for the future is the social aspect of the post office in communities. We will try to ensure that we have that coverage nation wide in the network. That is very welcome. I hope that the Conservative party will support that aspect of the proposals.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o341"><a name="70110-0018.htm_para15"><a name="07011053001359">I am going to mention another point as regards the Post Office card account. Of all the issues raised in my postbag, that came up the most. People were very concerned about the possibility of the Post Office card account ending. The announcement that there would be a replacement card account was therefore welcome, and it has eased many of my constituents&#146; fears.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o342"><a name="70110-0018.htm_para16"><a name="07011053001360">I would like the Under-Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, my hon. Friend the Member for Poplar and Canning Town (Jim Fitzpatrick), and my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State to consider ways of linking in credit unions to the future replacement for the card account. The areas in my constituency with high post office usage are often those with fairly high levels of deprivation. There are still people in those areas who do not have access to bank accounts because of their credit ratings, and the North East Lincolnshire Credit Union is working to keep those people away from loan sharks. Links with credit unions therefore have immense potential for tackling financial and social exclusion in the future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o343"><a name="70110-0018.htm_para17"><a name="07011053001361">In northern Lincolnshire, my hon. Friends the Members for Scunthorpe, for Brigg and Goole (Mr. Cawsey) and for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell) and I have always worked closely with our post office network. We heard earlier from my hon. Friend the Member for Scunthorpe that my parliamentary neighbour and regional Whip, my hon. Friend the Member for Brigg and Goole, worked with one of his parish councils to have a sub-post office reopened. That shows how we can work together for the future of the network.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o344"><a name="70110-0018.htm_para18"><a name="07011053001362">I was astonished, however, by the support from the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton (Alan Duncan) for the idea that more local council services could be delivered via the sub-post office network. Perhaps he might like to have a word with his Tory colleagues on North Lincolnshire council. While my neighbouring MPs have worked with our Labour colleagues on the council, his colleagues voted against extending the community use of sub-post offices and the Local Government Association position, in complete contradiction to the policy he espoused today. That is just another example of today&#146;s Tories saying one thing and doing another.</p>

Of course, using the local post office to collect one&#146;s pension or benefit payments is, or was, a choice. It might not be the most efficient choice available to an individual, and certainly not the most convenient choice for the Government, but that is not a good reason to prevent people from making it. The Government, with their considerable resources, could have made the case to all those affected as to why it would be better, more sensible and more beneficial for them to have their benefits or pension paid into a bank account, while leaving them  <br>

the option to do something else. But that is not what happened. The Government put pressure on all those individuals to do what the Government wanted. They must therefore accept some responsibility for what is happening to the post office network now. By removing that choice, they have effectively removed a large part of the post office network&#146;s income.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o346"><a name="70110-0019.htm_para1"><a name="07011053001365">I accept that other pressures, some of which have been mentioned, have been exerted on the profitability of small post offices. Of course, the use and prevalence of e-mail has an effect, and the existence of an online stamp system will have even more of an effect. Ministers cannot, however, escape significant responsibility for loss of post office income through the removal of Government business&#151;last year, in the order of &#163;168 million. Last month, in a spectacular display of adding insult to injury, the Prime Minister said that the closure of post offices would be the fault of customers for not using the services that his own Government had taken away.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o347"><a name="70110-0019.htm_para2"><a name="07011053001366">We now face plans to reduce the post office network again, significantly, and we know where the axe will fall. It will fall on communities where shops and services have already gone, and where the post office may well be all that is left. Those communities could be rural or, as has been observed, they could be urban. Indeed, postmasters and postmistresses in deprived urban areas are among the most pessimistic about their future. However, I want to focus for a moment on the rural communities that I represent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o348"><a name="70110-0019.htm_para3"><a name="07011053001367">The Government talk a great deal about communities. They even have a Department for communities nowadays. But &#147;communities&#148; rarely means rural communities. It rarely means villages where the post office is not just the only shop, but often the only point of social contact for many elderly and vulnerable people. It is sometimes the only reason for them to leave the house, and gives them the only opportunity of human contact. Sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses provide not just stamps and benefit payments, but a smile or a friendly inquiry. It is not surprising that 98 per cent. of those consulted in a recent survey by Age Concern regarded post offices as a lifeline.</p>

the worst thing we could do would be to make it worse. That is why we are saying that the post office network needs to be sustained.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o350"><a name="70110-0019.htm_para5"><a name="07011053001371">As I was saying, the Government argue that life is changing and we must change with it. The problem with their argument is that because of some of those changes in lifestyle, the post office network has become even more important in some of the communities that I am describing. More people now live alone, particularly the elderly. They may be distant from their families, who may have moved away&#151;especially in rural areas, where the movement of younger family members has been caused by the increased cost of living in those areas. The sub-postmaster or sub-postmistress may be the only person who notices that something is wrong when someone does not come in to collect a benefit or pension. The decisions that are being made have commercial implications, but they also have social implications, and we must bear those in mind.</p>

 No, I am not, and I think that the hon. Gentleman has made a fair point. I do not believe that what the Government are doing will compensate for that loss. They must recognise that they cannot simply regard the post office network as a commercial entity; they must also regard it as a social entity, and they must take account of what will be lost in social terms if village and urban post offices disappear.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o351"><a name="70110-0019.htm_para6"><a name="07011053001374">What can be done? I think that the hon. Member for Richmond Park (Susan Kramer) was somewhat unfair in saying that no positive ideas had been advanced on either side of the House. It seems to me that positive ideas have been advanced, and I give the Government a degree of credit for at least mentioning some of the things that might be done. However, I remain sceptical about their willingness to pursue some of those positive ideas.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o352"><a name="70110-0019.htm_para7"><a name="07011053001375">There is certainly potential and opportunity for post offices to deliver more local and central Government services. If this Government have achieved anything in the field of job creation, they have surely achieved a huge growth in the marketplace for those who can help us to navigate the labyrinth of Government benefits and services that now exist.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o353"><a name="70110-0019.htm_para8"><a name="07011053001376">Post offices are already a trusted source of advice, information and help on a variety of day-to-day needs. They are ideal candidates for having that role extended and doing more of such work. For example, the take-up of pension credit is inadequate, and post offices are the kinds of places where we can increase that take-up and give the necessary advice and help. However, they will be able to do that only if they are still in business. If we want them to perform such functions, there is simply no value in the Government pursuing a wholesale closure programme&#151;they have substantially brought that about by their own actions&#151;and in then being worried and disturbed to find that no one is available to deliver the good ideas that Members in all parts of the House are putting forward.</p>

 This summer, I had the pleasure of spending several days cycling around my constituency. I went from village to village, and the post office was, of course, the heart of the community in those villages. As I travelled along the coast to places such as Aldbrough, Mappleton and down to Withernsea, time and again people told me of the importance of the post office to their way of life and their local community.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o355"><a name="70110-0019.htm_para10"><a name="07011053001379">Such small rural villages have had to put up with a lot since 1997. Community hospital facilities have either been closed or had services heavily reduced. Bus services are inadequate, inconveniencing the elderly and those without transport. Farmers&#146; incomes have collapsed, and the single farm payment scheme has descended into chaos due to Government mismanagement. Rural areas feel neglected and question the Government&#146;s understanding of the countryside. Post office closures are, therefore, about as welcome as the Foreign Secretary at a Young Farmers dinner.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o356"><a name="70110-0019.htm_para11"><a name="07011053001380">It is difficult to overstate the importance of the post office to small, remote towns and villages. The poor, the old and the ill particularly depend on it for a wide range of services. As Members in all parts of the House have often said, sub-postmasters act as a focal point for the community. My hon. Friend the Member for Rugby and Kenilworth (Jeremy Wright) mentioned an Age Concern report that showed that most elderly people in rural areas regard the post office as a lifeline. That report also found that 56 per cent.&#151;more than half&#151;of such people thought that post office closures would lead to them being isolated. The current Government have already been the author of 4,000 such closures at three times the previous rate, and they are now proposing 2,500 even more swiftly than before.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o357"><a name="70110-0019.htm_para12"><a name="07011053001381">The Government&#146;s mismanagement of the post office network has had a devastating impact on such communities. In my constituency, eight post office branches have been lost since 1999, and following the Secretary of State&#146;s announcement of last month a further six could soon be shutting their doors.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o358"><a name="70110-0019.htm_para13"><a name="07011053001382">Last year, the sub-postmaster of Burstwick post office in my constituency announced that he would resign his post. The reason was that he was losing money and had to do a second job in order to subsidise his post office branch. He said that he was tired of swimming against the tide and predicted that many more post offices would close in rural areas if the Government carried on their policy of wilful neglect.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o359"><a name="70110-0019.htm_para14"><a name="07011053001383">Residents in Burstwick have now been told that they will have to visit a post office several miles away in a nearby village. That might be fine for a young couple with two cars parked in their drive, but for the elderly, who often live alone and have little or no access to transport, it is asking too much. Such examples are common and are doing untold damage to the social fabric of this country, especially in rural areas.</p>

More and more of them are either going out of business or cutting their losses and leaving the profession entirely. When questioned in a recent MORI survey, 39 per cent. said that they could see no future whatsoever for their businesses. It is not hard to understand why. The average salary for a sub-postmaster is now only &#163;1,000 a month&#151;a fall of 6 per cent. since 2004.</p>

The hon. Member for Vauxhall (Kate Hoey) said that it was a pity that the Secretary of State did not mention that the Government were taking business away from the Post Office. The hon.

Five years ago, according to Adam Crozier, 60 per cent. of post office revenue came from Government business. In two years, that figure will be down to 10 per cent., yet the Secretary of State insults sub-postmasters and this House repeatedly by maintaining that it is nothing but changing circumstances. He says, &#147;It&#146;s the internet.&#148; It is not; it is the way in which the Government have systematically withdrawn business from the network that has affected its viability. That is why closures, which were happening under the Conservatives, have trebled under this Government.</p>

and social value is what Government spending is for. We pay taxes so that the Government can provide services. That is why we have people coming in to look after the elderly in their homes. That is why successive Governments have sought to maintain a post office network.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o365"><a name="70110-0019.htm_para20"><a name="07011053001391">The question is whether the Secretary of State&#146;s statement last month provided a vision, gave stability and created a robust situation in which sub-postmasters can invest. The truth is that it did not. What we have is the continuing managed decline of the network, with the exception of the welcome announcement on the Post Office card account, an issue to which I will return. Conservative Members have campaigned long and hard for that, and it would be good to see the Government put their hand up and say that they have listened to the arguments put forward by the Conservatives and accepted that it will continue, if indeed it will.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o366"><a name="70110-0019.htm_para21"><a name="07011053001392">Does the Secretary of State support Conservative proposals to give sub-post offices greater freedoms to offer a wider range of commercial products? The answer would appear to be no. Does he envisage local authorities offering more council services through the post office? Nothing substantial has been promised. Does he want post offices to be given full access to working with carriers other than the Royal Mail? We appear not to have an answer. We have heard almost nothing on these important issues to try to give stability and a framework within which business could invest. All that people in rural areas can expect is a visit from a van for a couple of hours every week.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o367"><a name="70110-0019.htm_para22"><a name="07011053001393">The Government&#146;s position is that there are no guarantees that closures will be capped at 2,500. The hon.

No guarantee was made.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o368"><a name="70110-0019.htm_para23"><a name="07011053001394">We have heard no guarantees that the Post Office card account will continue to be provided in post offices. There was indrawn breath in the House when I suggested that sending out the message to people that it was continuing and they could relax and plan on that basis, even though it might not go through the post office network at all, was a deceit, especially for sub-postmasters, 10 per cent. of whose income comes from the POCA. Perhaps I used unparliamentary language, but I have heard nothing from Ministers to reassure me that sub-postmasters will be able to rely on that money coming in.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o369"><a name="70110-0019.htm_para24"><a name="07011053001395">We also have no guarantees that post offices will be freer to compete for business. There are no guarantees at all. The situation is far from one of stability and certainty in the post office network. Instead, the post office bike&#151;rather like myself in the summer going round my constituency from village to village&#151;may easily lose its balance and fall in a ditch unless the Government get a proper grasp on the situation and listen to further arguments from Front-Bench Conservative spokesmen, the Government of whom the post office network will have to wait for in anticipation.</p>

 I am grateful that I have caught your eye, Mr. Deputy Speaker.

I am delighted to follow my hon.

I was especially struck by the hon. Member for Richmond Park (Susan Kramer), the spokesman for the Liberal Democrats, when she said that if a rural sub-post office closes, elderly people, especially those without a car&#151;as is the case in many rural constituencies, my constituency has no public transport&#151;often have to rely on the charity of neighbours to allow them to collect their benefits and access the services that such sub-post offices provide.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o370"><a name="70110-0019.htm_para25"><a name="07011053001397">It was disappointing that the Secretary of State did not have a greater vision of what he wanted from the rural sub-post office network. He had nothing to offer to House. Given that he was making a major speech on rural sub-post offices, I would have thought that he would be able to provide greater certainty. I do not envy the Under-Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, the hon. Member for Poplar and Canning Town (Jim Fitzpatrick), for having to wind up the debate. I hope that he will be able to provide greater certainty in his speech. There is no doubt that if the access criteria in the consultation paper are applied to my constituency, nearly three quarters of its rural sub-post offices could be closed, because the criteria are based on averages, not absolute figures.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o371"><a name="70110-0019.htm_para26"><a name="07011053001398">I thought that there was a huge difference between the speech made by the Secretary of State and that made by my hon. Friend the Member for Rutland and Melton (Alan Duncan). One speech was a breath of fresh air that espoused what we wanted to hear: a situation in which sub-post offices are allowed to thrive.</p>

Hon. Members have mentioned that 39 per cent. of sub-postmasters and postmistresses think that their business has no future. That is very bad for morale. I would like to think that we were managing a thriving business that was going forward. The Secretary of State finished his speech by addressing the question of closing post offices, but I want post offices to be opening. Indeed, one or two post offices have opened in my constituency. There has been new, innovative thinking. Post offices have opened in clubs, pubs and on farms&#151;in whatever other facilities are available in rural areas. Indeed, the same thing is happening in suburban areas. The closure of a post office in the suburbs causes as much hardship as a closure in a rural area. The Government need to come forward with a lot more innovative thinking. I disagree with the Secretary of State because I think that Post Office Ltd should treat its network more like a franchise, with a basic range of services that has to be  <br>

provided and an additional range of services&#151;a pick and mix range&#151;that individual sub-postmasters could choose to provide, with their expertise and knowledge of their local area, so that they could make a profit and encourage customers to come to the sub-post office.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o373"><a name="70110-0020.htm_para1"><a name="07011053001400">As my hon. Friend the Member for Rutland and Melton said, the Government could facilitate the availability of a range of extra services. When I intervened on the hon. Member for Richmond Park, I said that one of my constituents had written to me to say that although he would like to buy his television licence in a post office, he had to go across the road to buy it from a pub, even though he had never been in the pub in his life and did not wish to go there. He wanted to buy the licence from the post office and the post office wanted to sell it, but it was not allowed to do so. The Government could have done something about that daft state of affairs, or at least made more of a fuss about it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o374"><a name="70110-0020.htm_para2"><a name="07011053001401">First of all, the sub-post office could become the hub for all Government services. It could provide information about them, and that would bring people through the door. It is all very well to say that people are choosing not to use sub-post offices, but that is bound to happen if the range of services available is getting smaller and smaller.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o375"><a name="70110-0020.htm_para3"><a name="07011053001402">Secondly, as my hon. Friend the Member for Rutland and Melton said, the Government should encourage local councils to allow people to use sub-post offices for their services. There is no reason why people should not be able to perform council tax and housing benefit transactions at sub-post offices, or why a greater range of financial services could not be made available. My hon. Friend was right to say that the Post Office should look at its contract carefully, with a view to allowing an individual office to provide whatever services it chose. For example, there would be nothing wrong with an office contracting with a local bank some distance away to provide some of that bank&#146;s services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o376"><a name="70110-0020.htm_para4"><a name="07011053001403">Thirdly, we live in a changing electronic world, and there is no reason why sub-post offices could not provide various telecoms and IT services. Elderly people may not be able to afford&#151;or may not want&#151;to have computers and broadband in their homes, but they could use their local sub-post office to send or receive e-mails, for example. In addition, for foreign telephone calls, it may well be cheaper to use a Post Office telephone that operates over the internet than it would be to use an ordinary domestic telephone. The Government should encourage sub-post offices to offer a range of such services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o377"><a name="70110-0020.htm_para5"><a name="07011053001404">I want to give the Minister and my hon. Friend the Member for Wealden (Charles Hendry) plenty of time to wind up the debate, so I shall end by saying that we need to provide some certainty for the sub-post office network. The Government should announce, as soon as possible, that they have reached a definite decision on the Post Office card account. That would provide a great deal of certain income to struggling businesses. The longer the uncertainty goes on, the more post offices will close.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o378"><a name="70110-0020.htm_para6"><a name="07011053001405">I hope&#151;indeed, I am sure&#151;that that is not the Government&#146;s intention, but we need as many thriving post offices as possible. In particular, we must make sure that the average age of those who operate them ceases to rise as it has done recently. People feel that they are unable to retire, so we need to encourage young  <br>

 This brief debate has been interesting and well informed, and it has dealt with one of the most important issues affecting hon. Members today. It began with a clear analysis of the decline of the post office network from my hon. Friend the Member for Rutland and Melton (Alan Duncan). He set out the challenges that it faces, and described how the Government were wrong to try to manage the network&#146;s decline instead of developing the new business opportunities that might sustain it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o379"><a name="70110-0020.htm_para7"><a name="07011053001407">My hon. Friend asked the Secretary of State some very clear questions, but the right hon. Gentleman did not answer them. My hon. Friend asked for an assurance that more than 2,500 sub-post offices would not close, but there was no reply. He asked how large a town would have to be to merit its own post office, but we remain none the wiser. He asked whether POCA 2 would offer a greater range of services. That question was endorsed by my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Worcestershire (Peter Luff), the Chairman of the Trade and Industry Committee, but it was not answered.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o380"><a name="70110-0020.htm_para8"><a name="07011053001408">My hon. Friend the Member for Rutland and Melton also asked for the timetable for tenders for the Post Office card account replacement programme, but we did not get that information. Most importantly of all, he even asked for the date when a decision would be made about the future structure of the Royal Mail, but not a single word was given in reply.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o381"><a name="70110-0020.htm_para9"><a name="07011053001409">For those of us who have seen the Secretary of State working in the House over some years, it was perhaps one of his most remarkable performances, because he looked tired and disinterested. Perhaps his mind had moved on to his new job, where he hopes to be in a new environment as Chancellor of the Exchequer and to see his old Department abolished. That is not too surprising because, apart from the remarkable speech of the hon. Member for Cleethorpes (Shona McIsaac), not a single speaker on the Labour Benches offered any support to the Government&#146;s position. We are talking about one of the most sure-footed Cabinet Ministers, but the Secretary of State looked extraordinarily uncomfortable in defence of his policy today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o382"><a name="70110-0020.htm_para10"><a name="07011053001410">The right hon. Gentleman says that he wants to encourage new business in the Post Office, but he simply will not take the steps necessary to make it happen. He says that there are perhaps only two options: to maintain the network as it is without a single closure and at a high level of subsidy; or, alternatively, to reduce the network and reduce the subsidy as the Government have proposed. What he has completely ignored is the third way, which I would have thought would be obvious to him. One would have thought that he would want to explore the amazing range of new business opportunities for post offices in order to make more of them economically viable so that more can stay in business with less subsidy to keep them that way.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o383"><a name="70110-0020.htm_para11"><a name="07011053001411">I am sorry that the right hon. Gentleman is not in his place to hear what I am saying, as we had a remarkably interesting insight into Darling economics&#151;<i> [Interruption.] </i>Here he comes, so I will wait for him to resume his place. I am more than willing to go over the earlier part of my speech again, so that he can hear what he missed. We had an astonishing insight into Darling economics: if one post office closes because the sub-postmaster wishes to take a redundancy package, the Post Office may instruct another post office nearby to close and transfer to the new location.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o384"><a name="70110-0020.htm_para12"><a name="07011053001412">What the right hon. Gentleman is saying essentially is that the Government would tell a private business, which may have been operating for years in a particular location, serving its community and understanding its customers, that it must close and move to a new location in a community that it does not know, losing all the consumer good will built up over time. What if the postmaster declines to do so? What if he says that he wants to stay where he is and carry on serving the community? It is quite clear from what the Secretary of State said that the postmaster may be told that he may not do so, as his branch may be closed and a new person found to set up the other branch.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o385"><a name="70110-0020.htm_para13"><a name="07011053001413">At the heart of the debate is the extraordinary amount of affection that all our constituents have for the post office network. The hon. Member for Richmond Park (Susan Kramer) mentioned it in her speech and almost every intervention and speech by a Back Bencher referred to people&#146;s enormous affection for it. Yet we all know that it goes beyond that: it is not just about affection, but how we can bring new business into the post office network. The hon. Member for Richmond Park spoke about post offices becoming a hub for packages that couriers cannot deliver, but she went on to ruin her argument with an economically illiterate funding arrangement, whereby the Post Office would be separated from the Royal Mail, which would be part-privatised and the funds used to subsidise the separated-off post office network. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o386"><a name="70110-0020.htm_para14"><a name="07011053001414">We have heard significant discussion about the Post Office card account. My hon. Friend the Member for Rutland and Melton, introducing the debate, spoke about the near compulsion on people to have their pensions paid into bank accounts. The hon. Member for Richmond Park talked about the letter sent to people when they retire, urging them not to go to the Post Office, but to use the banks instead. My hon. Friend the Member for Rugby and Kenilworth (Jeremy Wright), who has campaigned strongly on these issues, rightly said that the Government must bear some responsibility&#151;indeed, the lion&#146;s share of it&#151;for the problem.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o387"><a name="70110-0020.htm_para15"><a name="07011053001415">The Secretary of State says that the use of bank accounts rather than the Post Office has been the result of a long-term change, but when we were in government, we never put the same sort of pressure on people to use the banks. People did not get the same letters then, and they were not rung up&#151;as elderly, frail and vulnerable people often are today&#151;and told not to use the Post Office, but their banks. Under the present Government, we have seen an unparalleled level of pressure applied on people to put their pensions into a bank account rather than into the Post Office.</p>

Member for Cleethorpes is not in her place to hear the wind-up speeches or any responses to her remarkable 22-minute speech. She started off by saying that we should close post offices, albeit none in Cleethorpes, and then developed an argument on why post office closures are right. I do not agree with her, but she is a brave person, with a majority of 2,000, to take that position. I hope that her comments will be widely publicised in her local newspapers&#151;in fact, in a spirit of good will, I am prepared to help her by sending a copy of her speech to her local press and pointing out what she is saying on behalf of her constituents about why their local post offices should be closed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o389"><a name="70110-0020.htm_para17"><a name="07011053001417">The hon.

Has she ever written to British Telecom to point out the omission and to ask it to change its practices? Hers was an extraordinarily weak speech&#151;one that was apparently designed to shore up the Government&#146;s position, but failed to do so.</p>

Were I to go on a cycling tour of my constituency, the doctor&#146;s surgery would be the important hub that I sought in every community. He spoke about the social roles that post offices play and highlighted the way in which many sub-postmasters are being ground down and demoralised by the lack of long-term vision for a post office network.</p>

Friend the Member for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown) summarised effectively the sense of disappointment that all of us felt at the Secretary of State&#146;s lacklustre speech and the great contrast between that and the vision set out by my hon.

<p><a name="stpa_o392"><a name="70110-0020.htm_para20"><a name="07011053001420">Some 5,000 post offices have been closed since the Labour Government came to power. That means that, in 10 years, taking into account the announcements made in December, 40 per cent. of the post office network will have closed under Labour. That is a national issue. As the hon. Member for Vauxhall (Kate Hoey) said, closures affect urban areas every bit as much as rural areas. In Wales, 250 post offices have closed; in my constituency, a third have closed in the past five years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o393"><a name="70110-0020.htm_para21"><a name="07011053001421">We know that we owe a huge debt of gratitude to the sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses for the work they do in serving their communities. They deserve better than they are getting from the Government. The Government&#146;s decision on the future of the network has been based on how many post offices they think they can get away with closing, rather than on a real business case or an understanding of what consumers want and need. The Secretary of State&#146;s vision is to have fewer post offices providing fewer services to fewer people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o394"><a name="70110-0020.htm_para22"><a name="07011053001422">A month after the statement, far too many questions are still unanswered.

who is one of the most delightful men in government, has been unable or unwilling to say what proportion of closures would be urban or rural. He cannot give a precise figure for the social network subsidy, which implies that it could well be less than the present &#163;150 million a year. He cannot say how much will be invested in improving Crown post offices or how many Crown post offices will close in the next three years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o395"><a name="70110-0020.htm_para23"><a name="07011053001423">The Minister has made no assessment of the likely environmental impact of closures, despite the Government&#146;s professed commitment to avoid unnecessary car journeys in order to protect the environment. Whatever happened to joined-up thinking? He cannot give us details of the level of support for mobile post offices. We still do not know whether press reports that the Post Office wanted to close 7,000 of the 14,000 sub-post offices were true. He cannot tell us what a local community would have to do to avert a closure&#151;indeed, he does not even tell us whether local communities will have a say.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o396"><a name="70110-0020.htm_para24"><a name="07011053001424">We are seeing a massive missed opportunity. Worst of all, the Government&#146;s policy does not recognise that the problems caused by the closure of the post office often result in the last shop in a community closing as well. The debate is not only about our post offices; it is about the whole of the communities in which so many of our constituents live. The Government should be announcing ways to develop the Post Office, allowing it work with carriers other than Royal Mail. They should end the restrictive practices and enable the problems of unfair competition to be tackled. They should be working with local councils to encourage them to offer more council services through post offices. Conservative councils are already doing that by encouraging people to pay their rent and access other council services at post office counters. We should be doing more to give post offices the flexibility to offer a wider range of businesses services than is currently permitted, and we should be considering imaginative approaches such as those employed in Wales, where the Welsh Conservatives in the Assembly have announced plans to support local post offices through help with business rates and expansion of the post office development fund.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o397"><a name="70110-0020.htm_para25"><a name="07011053001425">The debate has highlighted once again the paucity of the Government&#146;s thinking on the issue. We need a real long-term vision for the future of the post office, not the Prime Minister blaming the consumer alone; the Government have been responsible for many of the problems but they have failed to come up with a vision. We need that vision. We need a long-term structure, but we do not have one and as a result we are destined for more years of uncertainty, decline and dissatisfaction.</p>

As always in these short debates, a number of questions have been raised and I shall try to deal with them in due course.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o402"><a name="70110-0020.htm_para30"><a name="07011053001431">In the proposals now out for consultation, the Government clearly demonstrate their continuing commitment to the post office network. Our proposed strategy between now and 2011 is intended to maintain a national network of post offices, and to enable Post Office Ltd to undertake modernisation and some reshaping to put the network on a stable footing for the future. Since 1999, the Government have committed about &#163;2 billion to support the network. Under our new proposals, we envisage that up to &#163;1.7 billion will be provided between now and 2011 to support the Post Office&#151;to support the social network and to pay for the wider necessary reconfiguration and modernisation that are key elements in achieving a firm basis on which to move forward.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o403"><a name="70110-0020.htm_para31"><a name="07011053001432">At the heart of our strategy is clear recognition of the important social and economic role that post offices play, particularly in rural and deprived urban areas, and of the need for ongoing public funding to support them. We also propose to underpin that commitment to a national network by introducing new access criteria for post office services, which will include specific provisions to protect vulnerable customers.</p>

Within that framework, there will be changes. Up to 2,500 post office branches will close, with Government-funded compensation to sub-postmasters who leave.</p>

Furthermore, Government support will enable the Post Office to open at least 500 new outreach locations, to provide access to services for smaller and more remote communities, using mobile post offices and post offices in other locations such as shops, village halls, community centres, or mobile vans. There will also be changes to the network of Crown post offices to restore that segment of the network to profitability, but Post Office Ltd will consult locally on those changes, as with all other changes in service provision, before taking final decisions on its proposals.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o406"><a name="70110-0021.htm_para0"><a name="07011053001437">During the debate, a number of Members suggested that the network&#146;s problems lie squarely at the door of the Government, as a result of the move to pay all benefits into accounts, including the Post Office card account. It might be convenient to blame the network&#146;s problems on the Government, but the reality is far more complex, as I am sure all right hon. and hon. Members know. The transition to paying benefits into bank accounts began in the early 1980s. The Government introduced the POCA in 2003 to enable people to claim their pensions and other benefits in cash at the post office, and they remain committed to allowing people to get their pensions or benefits in that way, if they choose to do so. A range of accounts are available at the post office to make that possible.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o407"><a name="70110-0021.htm_para1"><a name="07011053001438">The POCA contract ends in March 2010, and the Government have decided that they will continue with a new account after 2010. It will be available nationally, and the basis for eligibility will be the same as it is now. EU procurement rules leave us with no option but to tender competitively for that product, and we must ensure that the best value for money for the taxpayer is achieved, but the Post Office is well placed to put in a strong bid, given the size of the network and the access criteria that we are introducing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o408"><a name="70110-0021.htm_para2"><a name="07011053001439">In addition, cash will be available at post offices through some 4,000 free-to-use ATMs, which are being introduced across the network, as are a range of interest accounts. Those accounts will be attractive to both new, additional customers and those POCA users who choose to build up balances in their access accounts. Our proposals will ensure that people can get their money at post offices, and that there is a national network across the country. Although many people will say that they like their post office and value it highly, we all know that the reality is that many now prefer to pay their bills by direct debit, to use one of the Post Office&#146;s competitors, to do their banking via the internet, to use cashpoint machines, to renew their motor vehicle licence online, and to communicate by e-mail or text message. The result is that in some places too many branches are competing for the same customers. Some 4 million fewer customers use post offices weekly than two years ago.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o409"><a name="70110-0021.htm_para3"><a name="07011053001440">Of the 11 million pensioners in this country, 8.5 million have their pensions paid into a bank account, and most people making new state pension claims choose to have it paid that way. Last year, the post office network lost &#163;2 million a week. This year, it is &#163;4 million a week, and that figure will continue to grow. It is therefore not surprising that both the National Federation of Sub-Postmasters and the Select Committee on Trade and Industry recognised that the present situation is, to use their word, unsustainable. That is why, under the Government&#146;s proposals, we look to Post Office Ltd to take a more active role in ensuring that the right post offices are in the right place, and the National Federation of Sub-Postmasters supports that. Change is clearly needed. Of the 14,300 current businesses, about 4,000 are commercially viable. Many never can be, and we should not realistically expect them to be.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o410"><a name="70110-0021.htm_para4"><a name="07011053001441">Turning to points made in the debate, the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton (Alan Duncan) made much of the accelerated rate of closures in recent years,  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="10 Jan 2007">

<notus-date day="10" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><b>10 Jan 2007 : Column 392</b><br>
but that is very much reflected by the accelerated pace of technological change. Yesterday and today, the media were full of stories about new advances in mobile technology, and that will have an impact on post office services in future. He also made a comparison with public houses, saying that free competition and free houses had saved pubs. It may come as a surprise to him that pub numbers are down by 12 per cent. since 20 years ago, and even free houses have closed in their thousands.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o411"><a name="70110-0021.htm_para5"><a name="07011053001442">The hon. Member for Richmond Park (Susan Kramer) sought assurances that the restructuring would cover the urban network, as well as the rural network, and that the procedure would not be as haphazard as that experienced in some areas under the urban regeneration programme. I repeat that we are much better placed to offer her that reassurance now, as there is new Post Office management and an improved Postwatch, and as we have the experience of what happened last time. She raised the issue of people being forced to use direct payment of benefits, but, as I said, direct payment of benefits was introduced in the &#146;80s. More than 4 million people opened a Post Office card account&#151;a figure that undermines the claim that the account is overly difficult to open. She asked whether post offices could become a hub for postal delivery services. At present, Post Office Ltd&#146;s mail contract is exclusively with Royal Mail. Royal Mail uses the network to satisfy its universal service obligation to maintain coverage of access points. Widening the service to include other providers would create capacity problems and, the hon. Lady will accept, have major strategic implications for the company. In any event, the matter is being considered by the regulator.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o412"><a name="70110-0021.htm_para6"><a name="07011053001443">The hon. Lady asked whether post offices could become storage sites for undelivered items. Royal Mail already offers such a service via the post office network, as its local collect service enables customers who order goods from selected mail order catalogues and internet suppliers that use Royal Mail and the Parcelforce worldwide service to choose to have goods delivered directly to their local post office branch if they do not expect to be at home to receive the delivery. The matter has therefore been dealt with.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o413"><a name="70110-0021.htm_para7"><a name="07011053001444">The hon. Member for Manchester, Withington (Mr. Leech) intervened on the hon. Lady to argue that there was not a level playing field for the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency and post offices, because people had to produce their insurance certificate at the post office, but they did not have to do so for the DVLA. I have to inform him that the renewal form has a DVLA reference number, which is typed into the online link to the DVLA website, which automatically checks that the vehicle is insured and has a valid MOT. No one receives a tax disc without being in possession of the relevant additional documents.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o414"><a name="70110-0021.htm_para8"><a name="07011053001445">My hon. Friend the Member for Cleethorpes (Shona McIsaac) was subject to an uncharacteristically unchivalrous attack by the hon. Member for Beverley and Holderness (Mr. Stuart). <i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> There is some dissent among Labour Members, and I apologise for their remarks. My hon. Friend made some excellent points on technical matters. I do not have time to deal with them now, but I shall write to her.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o415"><a name="70110-0021.htm_para9"><a name="07011053001446">The hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth (Jeremy Wright) made a thoughtful speech in which he confirmed that the Government were open-minded about service delivery options and new business opportunities for post offices. I am grateful for his remarks, and we look forward to his contribution to the consultation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o416"><a name="70110-0021.htm_para10"><a name="07011053001447">The hon. Member for Beverley and Holderness continued in his aggressive, interventionist mode, and attacked the Government&#146;s record on rural affairs. I have to tell him that rural affairs are a key priority for the Government. The access criteria outlined in the consultation document aim to protect services in remote areas and go substantially further than the current universal service obligations. The introduction of new, innovative outreach programmes will help to mitigate the impact of any closures in rural areas. More generally, unemployment under the Government has fallen by 40 per cent. in rural areas, and 50 per cent. rate relief has been extended to village shops. The rural bus subsidy grant, which was worth &#163;53 million in 2005-06 was introduced to support more than 29 million passenger journeys a year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o417"><a name="70110-0021.htm_para11"><a name="07011053001450">The hon. Member for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown) wanted to see post offices opening. We would certainly like that, too, but we must make sure that the network is sustainable and is in sound health so that it can move forward. When I was promoted to the Department of Trade and Industry, I asked my officials to insert in my diary an engagement to open a new sub-post office, but they said that that was not usual practice for postal services Ministers. In response to the hon. Member for Richmond Park, post offices are opening across the country and, as the Secretary of State outlined, we want to make sure that a network is spread as evenly as possible across the country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o418"><a name="70110-0021.htm_para12"><a name="07011053001451">The hon. Member for Wealden asked many questions, some of which we cannot answer, because they will be included in the consultation that we will publish in due course.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o419"><a name="70110-0021.htm_para13"><a name="07011053001452">The Opposition believe that the free market will solve everything, but it will not save thousands of post offices. The short-term solution from the hon. Member for Richmond Park is to privatise Royal Mail and use the proceeds. However, when the money runs out, what would she do? I emphasise that the Government&#151;</p>

 On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. Even at this late stage, is there any way in which it would be possible for the Home Secretary to come to the House and make a statement? This morning, I wrote to the Home Secretary explaining that four people have absconded from Sudbury prison who were charged with either murder or manslaughter, and that there was growing concern about that in my constituency. By the time that the letter had been prepared for me to sign, I had to add an addendum saying that another person, also charged with murder, had escaped, bringing the total to five people convicted of murder or manslaughter who are at the moment out of prison and on the loose. Although I appreciate that the Home Secretary is dealing with a number of other problems today, serious concern has been raised for some time about the people who are being sent to open prisons. Is there any way, even at this late stage, in which the Home Secretary can inform the House of any action that he may take?</p>

 Further to that point of order, Mr. Speaker. I was contacted this afternoon by my constituent, Michael Walker, whose son was killed by one of the fugitives who have absconded from this open prison. In 2002, the judge was so appalled that he sentenced Gary Smith to 10 years for manslaughter with no parole. Less than five years later, he has absconded from an open prison. That has left my constituent and his family in perilous fear about where this man might now be, as well as dredging up appalling memories of what they had to suffer at the hands of a murderer who is now free.</p>

 Further to that point of order, Mr. Speaker. The urgency of the matter is underlined not only by the two points of order that you have just heard, but by the fact that the Home Secretary signed off a memorandum within the Home Office in which he said that he was prepared to take the risk that by removing people from the secure estate and placing them in the open estate such problems might occur. In the light of the points that we three Members of Parliament have brought to your attention, can you arrange for the Home Secretary to come to the House urgently to deal with those concerns?</p>

 It is a great pleasure and honour to have the opportunity to raise the issue of rail level crossing safety in my constituency. I am grateful to the Minister for attending the debate. My hon. Friend the Member for Harwich (Mr. Carswell) is present as well, and I should be delighted if he made a contribution. I am grateful to the Minister for giving his permission for that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o430"><a name="70110-0022.htm_para7"><a name="07011071000558">The question of rail level crossings and their safety is a vexed one. According to a note from the Library, in 2005 there were 7,674 level crossings in Great Britain, of which 79 per cent. were unprotected. I am concerned about the protected crossings. Some 1,623 crossings had manual or automatic gates or barriers, most commonly where vehicles crossed the railway, and there were 253 manual gates operated by railway employees. It is the demise of such crossings in my constituency that gave rise to this debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o431"><a name="70110-0022.htm_para8"><a name="07011071000559">I have been trying to establish the different safety records of different types of level crossing. The accident statistics are thankfully very sparse. For that reason they do not tell us much, except that manual gates operated by railway employees caused precisely zero fatalities and zero injuries in 2005. By comparison with the record of other crossing systems, that is outstanding. Other kinds of crossing produce casualties&#151;both injuries and fatalities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o432"><a name="70110-0022.htm_para9"><a name="07011071000560">I turn to a document entitled, &#147;Development of a programme of level crossing research to improve railway safety in Great Britain&#148;, produced by the Rail Safety and Standards Board on 16 February 2004. It states at the outset:</p>
<a name="70110-0022.htm_brev10"><a name="07011071000611"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Level Crossing Risk is likely to become the largest category of train accident risk on the National Rail network in Great Britain. It is also a significant risk for road users and pedestrians.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o433"><a name="70110-0022.htm_para10"><a name="07011071000561">That is not to say that the risk from level crossings is growing; other safety aspects on the railway are improving, so that then becomes the biggest single issue that the railway bodies have to deal with in addressing rail safety.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o434"><a name="70110-0022.htm_para11"><a name="07011071000562">There are some useful statistics in the document giving some assessment of the relative risk posed by different kinds of crossing. On page 6 of the document, it is stated:</p>
<a name="70110-0022.htm_brev11"><a name="07011071000612"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Risk levels depend to a great extent on the type of crossing protection in place&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o435"><a name="70110-0022.htm_para12"><a name="07011071000563">A chart shows the equivalent fatalities per year for different types of crossing. It shows that manned gates or barriers offer a risk that is equivalent to one fatality per year, whereas automatic half-barriers or automatic open locally monitored barriers offer significantly increased risk.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o436"><a name="70110-0022.htm_para13"><a name="07011071000564">I suspect that those statistics are based solely on fatalities, so I have been looking for other sources to demonstrate the relative safety of different types of crossing, because if we are to remove manned crossings we need to have a better idea of their relative safety.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o437"><a name="70110-0022.htm_para14"><a name="07011071000565">I turn to a more recent document: the Rail Safety and Standards Board document entitled, &#147;Level crossing safety performance report June 2006.&#148; In chart 14 on page 22, that document shows that manually controlled gates offer by far the lowest risk of near misses, particularly compared with manually controlled barriers protected by closed circuit television and operated remotely. It is difficult to describe those findings, but as I have drawn the chart to the Minister&#146;s attention I hope that he will be able to respond to it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o438"><a name="70110-0022.htm_para15"><a name="07011071000566">The particular challenge that my constituency faces is that three manned sets of gates&#151;those at Alresford, Thorrington and Great Bentley&#151;are set to be replaced by alternative crossing systems. It is widely understood among the public that they will be replaced by automatic barriers&#151;barriers that are tripped by the train approaching the level crossing. I fully accept that that might not be the case and that Network Rail is, as is its obligation, looking at alternative systems of monitored automatic barriers, or even at barriers operated by remote control under CCTV surveillance.</p>

 Is my hon. Friend aware that there is considerable concern in my constituency about the possible introduction of automatic gates especially in Frinton, but also at the crossing just outside Clacton?

Friend think can be given on safety grounds, and also in respect of accessibility, if those changes are to be made?</p>

 I am sure that the Minister has listened carefully to what my hon. Friend has said, and I hope that he will be able to respond in due course to the points that he has raised, because I am raising similar points about the crossings that I have mentioned.</p>

<p><a name="st_o431"><a name="07011071000569"><a name="70110-0022.htm_spmin0"><a name="07011071001160"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport (Mr. Tom Harris):</b>
 I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving way to me at such an early stage, but as he has asked about what would replace the currently staffed gate at Alresford, it might be useful if I put it on record that it will be replaced not by automatic barriers but by a manually operated barrier, although one that will be operated remotely. I think that the hon. Gentleman refers to it as being automatic on his website, but it will not be automatic.</p>

<p><a name="st_o432"><a name="07011071000570"><a name="70110-0022.htm_spnew9"><a name="07011071001161"><b>Mr. Jenkin:</b>
 I am grateful for that clarification. I had understood that to be the case. I think that there is an easily confused use of terminology here, which is much more precise to the experts in the industry than to lay people such as myself. I apologise to the House for that. The problem is that in each of these three cases there will no longer be a crossing keeper on the site.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o439"><a name="70110-0022.htm_para16"><a name="07011071000571">Let me deal with the Thorrington case first. The crossing is not in the centre of a village; it is not at a focal point of the community. It is a very busy road, and with the junction improvements that are planned on that site I can see strong justification for having manually controlled barriers, albeit remotely controlled and monitored by CCTV. Incidentally, the same goes for the crossing at Chitts Hill, which I have not  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="10 Jan 2007">

<notus-date day="10" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><b>10 Jan 2007 : Column 407</b><br>
mentioned privately to the Minister. Chitts Hill is to the west of Colchester, and again the crossing is not within a village. It is on a busy rat-run of roads between Colchester and West Bergholt, and I can fully understand that there is a case for Network Rail to replace manned crossings there, provided that there are improvements to the crossing, particularly to the width.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o440"><a name="70110-0022.htm_para17"><a name="07011071000572">I turn now to the Alresford crossing. It is right at the heart of the village, at the end of the station platform. It is by the shops, which are on both sides of the railway, and the local chippy and Chinese takeaway are very nearby. This is a focal point, particularly for younger people in the evening. At both ends of the school day children cross the railway on foot at that point. In the evening, particularly in the summer months, young people tend to congregate near the station and the crossing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o441"><a name="70110-0022.htm_para18"><a name="07011071000573">One of the crossing keepers there told me how he has had to intervene, call the police and deal with the inevitable problems that arise when groups of bored young people congregate late at night, perhaps a little the worse for wear because of alcohol. He wonders who will provide for the safety of those children if there is no crossing keeper. I am looking for assurances from the Minister. It seems that there can be no substitute for having someone on site. Even if the site is being monitored by CCTV, that cannot necessarily provide the comprehensive awareness that someone on the site would have. Even if the CCTV shows young people trespassing on the track, what can the monitors do except perhaps stop trains until the police arrive to deal with the trespass? I cannot see how that will be satisfactory.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o442"><a name="70110-0022.htm_para19"><a name="07011071000574">Secondly, I turn to the Great Bentley crossing. This, too, is right by the station, on the edge of the village but near a pub and shops and next to the local primary school. Again, at both ends of the school day, children will be coming and going across the railway. Great Bentley has the largest village green in the country, and this is another area where young people tend to congregate. I foresee the same kinds of difficulty.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o443"><a name="70110-0022.htm_para20"><a name="07011071000575">Before Network Rail is allowed to proceed with these changes, I simply ask the Minister what assurances he can give me and my constituency that safety will not be compromised. Returning to the statistics that I have talked about, all the evidence suggests that unmanned crossings carry higher risks than manned crossings, and there seems to be a very strong case for maintaining manned crossings in these locations.</p>

and they range from open crossings with no barriers or gates, which are used when a road is quiet and train speeds are low&#151;I shall return to that important point later&#151;to crossings with full barriers that are monitored by CCTV. Level crossings of whatever type are adequately safe when they are used correctly. However, I must make an important point: absolute safety is an impossible goal, as I am sure that the hon. Gentleman appreciates.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o445"><a name="70110-0022.htm_para22"><a name="07011071000578">It is important that the right type of crossing is used in particular locations to achieve adequate safety with minimum delays to road traffic. Account should be taken of factors such as the number and speed of trains, the volume and type of road traffic, the nature of private use, the number of pedestrians using the crossing and the location of the crossing itself. What might be appropriate for a quiet country road or a crossing on farm land might not be appropriate for a busy urban area.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o446"><a name="70110-0022.htm_para23"><a name="07011071000579">The annual reports on railway safety that are produced by the rail safety regulator give details of the numbers of each type of crossing on the national network and details of accidents on all railways, which include heritage lines and the London underground as well as the overland network that is maintained by Network Rail. Copies of the annual railway safety reports are in the House Library. The most recent report, which was for calendar year 2005, showed that there were 27 train accidents at level crossings and that they resulted in 16 fatalities. Those fatalities were made up of nine pedestrians, four drivers of road vehicles, two cyclists and one train driver. More detailed data on level crossing safety are given in the annual rail safety performance reports that are produced by the Rail Safety and Standards Board.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o447"><a name="70110-0022.htm_para24"><a name="07011071000580">Some 96 per cent. of accidents at level crossings are considered to be caused by road driver or pedestrian misuse, whether that is intentional or unintentional. Although the statistics show that the safety record for level crossings in this country is among the best in the world, it is always desirable to try to improve safety. As the hon. Gentleman said, level crossings now represent the single greatest source of the risk of train accidents&#151;that is accidents with the potential for multiple deaths.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o448"><a name="70110-0022.htm_para25"><a name="07011071000581">Network Rail, the operator of the mainline network, is putting a significant effort into improving safety at level crossings. It is focusing on closing crossings altogether whenever the opportunity arises, improving the operation and maintenance of level crossings, running a programme of risk assessment to identify where additional action might be needed and implementing measures to promote the safe use of crossings. The hon. Gentleman may well have seen or heard the effective television and radio campaign that Network Rail ran last year to highlight the very real dangers of misusing level crossings. More generally, Network Rail is working hard to improve the efficiency of its operations&#151;without, of course, in any way compromising safety&#151;with the aim of reducing the substantial costs of the rail network, which inevitably fall on taxpayers and rail users.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o449"><a name="70110-0023.htm_para0"><a name="07011071000582">Let me turn to what is happening in North Essex. Network Rail is installing a new signalling system. The system will improve the network&#146;s reliability, which, in turn, will benefit passengers by improving train  <br>

performance, which I am sure that the hon. Gentleman would welcome. New signalling means more reliable equipment, which means more punctual trains. The new signalling will also provide more operational flexibility. That will mean that when incidents do occur&#151;I am talking about incidents such as a failed train&#151;they can be more easily worked around, thus meaning that there is a better service for passengers. Most re-signalling schemes also deliver faster operating speeds on the line. Modern signals need less maintenance than older ones, which reduces the cost of running the railway.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o450"><a name="70110-0023.htm_para1"><a name="07011071000583">As part of the work to renew and modernise signalling, Network Rail, as the hon. Gentleman rightly pointed out, proposes to modernise crossings that currently require a railway employee to be stationed at each crossing to close the gates across the road manually to allow trains to pass. Perhaps, for the record, we should start referring to those crossings as staffed, rather than manned. The Network Rail proposal would have significant benefits, reducing the length of time for which a crossing was closed and cutting operational costs without compromising safety. It would also reduce the risk of the crossing keeper getting injured by road traffic.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o451"><a name="70110-0023.htm_para2"><a name="07011071000584">The hon. Gentleman said that there were no manned crossing fatalities in 2005, but there is a history of the workers who man those crossings getting injured as a result of drivers being impatient, reckless or irresponsible in their efforts to cross the railway line even as the gate is being closed. The numbers involved are not huge, but the injuries suffered have sometimes been serious.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o452"><a name="70110-0023.htm_para3"><a name="07011071000585">Automated crossings mean that barriers are closed for shorter periods, resulting in the smoother flow of train and road traffic, with fewer delays for both. The hon. Gentleman mentioned the comparative safety performance statistics for different types of crossing. Those comparisons, which I have seen, are produced by the Rail Safety and Standards Board, and they show that manually operated crossings have a better safety record than other types. However, a purely statistical analysis does not take account of the different ways in which trains, motor vehicles and pedestrians use the crossings.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o453"><a name="70110-0023.htm_para4"><a name="07011071000586">Safety is a major consideration, but it has to be weighed against other factors, such as the wider benefits that accrue to rail passengers from more reliable trains, and to motorists from the shorter time for which crossings are closed. Moreover, the statistics to which the hon. Gentleman referred do not compare like with like, as they do not discriminate between high-speed rail lines, urban lines or village lines. That means that it is very difficult to achieve an absolutely accurate picture of the relative safety of crossing types, although I accept that he is right to raise the matter, since the bald statistics, in the absence of context, do paint a particular picture.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o454"><a name="70110-0023.htm_para5"><a name="07011071000587">Manually operated gated crossings may be statistically safer, but it is the considered view of the independent rail safety regulator that other types of crossing are also safe when used correctly. A range of factors needs to be considered when determining the most appropriate type of crossing for a given location. If a crossing is properly monitored with CCTV, that is sufficient to check that it can be used safely by trains.</p>

 Young people are not likely to think about how such crossings should be used properly. Will the Minister say what happens when the camera sees kids messing around on or near a crossing, putting both themselves and train passengers at risk?</p>

 The hon. Gentleman is right to raise that concern. The crossing in his constituency to which I referred earlier will be replaced by a manual barrier controlled remotely from a signal box. When the video screen shows someone trespassing, that is a very serious matter for Network Rail. Lines of communication are available to ensure that trains heading to that location are alerted to the fact. The police&#151;and, if necessary, British Transport police&#151;are also alerted.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o455"><a name="70110-0023.htm_para6"><a name="07011071000590">I assure the hon. Gentleman that the Government would not give a green light to any infrastructure change for level crossings if we believed that it would in any way compromise the safety of pedestrians, especially young ones. It is far better for us to rely on the evidence of the experts. The Network Rail proposals must be approved by Her Majesty&#146;s rail inspectorate, which is part of the Office of the Rail Regulator. That is where the expertise in these matters lies. Although it is of course entirely appropriate for MPs to raise concerns on behalf of their constituents, I do not think that it is up to Ministers, with their shallow technical knowledge, to make decisions about the safety of level crossings and to determine what is safe and what is not. I would much rather allow Her Majesty&#146;s rail inspectorate to make that decision on the Government&#146;s behalf. The vast majority of people in the industry would be far more comfortable with that process than with Ministers making that decision.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o456"><a name="70110-0023.htm_para7"><a name="07011071000591">It is the view of the independent rail safety regulator that each type of crossing is adequately safe when operated and used correctly, as long as the type of crossing is appropriate for the location. The safety of railway employees working manual gates is, as I said, an area of growing concern. There is a need for closer working and better co-operation on level crossing safety between road traffic and rail authorities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o457"><a name="70110-0023.htm_para8"><a name="07011071000592">The hon. Gentleman may be aware that a provision in the Road Safety Act 2006, which is expected to come into force shortly, will permit road traffic measures as well as purely rail measures to be specified in a level crossing order. That will make it easier to control the speed of road vehicles on the approach to level crossings through measures such as rumble strips to alert vehicles to slow down, increased use of warning signs and more enforcement cameras.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o458"><a name="70110-0023.htm_para9"><a name="07011071000593">In the case of the level crossings in North Essex that concern the hon. Gentleman, Network Rail will need to convince the railway inspectorate that the replacement crossings that it wants are as safe as or safer than the existing crossings that they replace. I reiterate my earlier point that if it cannot make that case, the replacement will not go ahead. The railway inspectorate has professional expertise in level crossing safety and I have already said that it is right for decisions on technical areas to be taken by those with the proper technical background.</p>

may not be entirely true, as I doubt whether every Member of every political party will welcome those particular improvements, but most Government Members certainly do. Network Rail is investing heavily in upgrading infrastructure to deliver improving performance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o460"><a name="70110-0023.htm_para11"><a name="07011071000595">There is no point in putting in modern signalling systems in areas such as North Essex if trains and road traffic are then going to be slowed down by antiquated and prohibitively costly level crossings, where crossing keepers are required to open and close gates manually at some risk to their own safety. It would not be in Network Rail&#146;s interests to replace existing crossings with ones that are less safe; apart from the human cost, that would lead to delays and disruption while incidents were dealt with. The decision on what is safe will be taken by the rail safety experts in Her Majesty&#146;s  <br>

<p><a name="stpa_o461"><a name="70110-0023.htm_para12"><a name="07011071000598">I pay tribute again to the hon. Gentleman for raising this issue on behalf of his constituents and for leading this debate in a very measured and considered fashion. I fear, however, that my comments this evening may not be sufficient to reassure him on all the points that he raised. Nevertheless, it is the case that all types of level crossing are safe when used correctly and that safety records at level crossings in the UK are among the best in Europe. Any changes proposed by Network Rail and consequently approved by HMRI will do nothing to change that.</p>
