 I beg to move, That the Bill be now read a Second time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o4"><a name="90227-0001.htm_para4"><a name="09022736000131">I am delighted to have the opportunity to introduce the Autism Bill on the first available Friday for private Members&#146; business. So many people are behind the measure that it feels like an Oscars moment&#151;I have to say an awful lot of thank yous. It is the culmination of so much work that it is important to put on record my thanks and the thanks of all those whom the outcome of the process should benefit.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o5"><a name="90227-0001.htm_para5"><a name="09022736000132">First, I thank my colleagues. When I drew No. 1 in the ballot, I was inundated with proposals. After making a shortlist, I examined the options in detail. The National Autistic Society and the needs of people with autism touched a chord. When I chose the Bill, I robbed other colleagues of the opportunity to introduce it. I therefore thank my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell) and the hon. Member for Dumfries and Galloway (Mr. Brown), who were further down the list and would have been willing to introduce the measure. I thank hon. Members of all parties who back the Bill to the hilt and have given up their precious constituency day to be here. The issue is truly cross-party and all parties seem committed to effecting lasting change for people with autism.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o6"><a name="90227-0001.htm_para6"><a name="09022736000133">Since taking on the Bill, I have been deeply encouraged and motivated by the supportive e-mails, letters and other communications that I have received from throughout the country. The groundswell of support for the measure clearly shows that the time has come to right the wrongs that it seeks to tackle, and that change is long overdue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o7"><a name="90227-0001.htm_para7"><a name="09022736000134">I must place on record my gratitude to and admiration for the staff of the National Autistic Society, who have campaigned and negotiated tirelessly in supporting the preparation and development of the Bill, and have encouraged such a measure for many months and years. I will single out some individuals who may be known to some hon. Members; I should like to mention Matthew Downie, Ellen Broome and Gemma Bent, without forgetting Benet and Amanda, and the new chief executive, Mark Lever. I also thank the other 15 organisations that make up the Autism Bill coalition for their backing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o8"><a name="90227-0001.htm_para8"><a name="09022736000135">I extend thanks to the all-party group on autism and its chair, the hon. Member for Burton (Mrs. Dean), for its excellent work since the group&#146;s inception in 2001. The way in which the debate and the understanding of autism have moved forward is due in no small way to the work of the hon. Lady and her colleagues.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o9"><a name="90227-0001.htm_para9"><a name="09022736000136">Lastly, I thank my colleague and my friend, my hon. Friend the Member for Tiverton and Honiton (Angela Browning), who has worked tirelessly and for such a long time to improve the outcomes and life chances of people with autism. Her passion on the issue has played no small part in what has been achieved so far, and I decided to try to push the measure through the House using the private Member&#146;s Bill process partly because she has announced her intention to leave the House at the end of the Parliament. She will be much missed. She has been a redoubtable friend and champion, and the Bill is partly a tribute to her and her work.</p>

That has led to the privilege that I have today of being able to do something for children and adults with autism and their families and carers, as well as charities and policy makers concerned about the needs of people with autism.</p>

 I congratulate my hon. Friend on introducing this excellent Bill. I, too, have received many e-mails from constituents who feel that it is especially important. What have the Government indicated that they intend to do about the Bill? Do they intend to support it or to try to talk it out or block it? It was rumoured that they wanted to try to stop the Bill because they wished to take the matter further, but does my hon. Friend agree that if the Government want to strengthen the measure, the best way of doing so is to take it into Committee and table amendments there?</p>

 I am grateful to my hon. Friend, who reflects my views, but I will leave the Minister to speak for himself, because he has the option to change his mind, following the discussions that I had with him before Second Reading.

 The hon. Gentleman&#146;s presence in the Chamber on a Friday is ominous because the ghost of past speeches by him hang over Friday proceedings. I am delighted by what the Government have put on the table&#151;I make no bones about that. It is a tribute to the negotiating skills of the National Autistic Society. However, if the Government are to deliver their commitment, they have nothing to fear from examining the Bill clause by clause. The subject has been deserted for a long time and it is about time that the voices of those affected and their families were heard loud and clear. If the promises are as good as the paper on which they are written, there is nothing to fear from having a Committee stage, during which we can examine the Bill in detail.</p>

 Of course, everyone welcomes the Government commitment to taking the matter on board. However, does my hon. Friend agree that Second Reading today has led to that commitment?

mean that we continued talking about the Bill for the next three to four months, and that is no bad thing. If any hon. Member speaks at excessive length today to talk out the Bill, he will prevent Parliament from focusing its attention on the measure, and his constituents should note and remember that.</p>

 My right hon. Friend makes a valid and accurate point. There is no malign intention in pressing the Bill. After it was suggested to me that the Government&#146;s commitments were good enough for the Bill to be withdrawn, I looked up precedents. A Labour Member withdrew a Bill recently after it had gone into Committee and another Member withdrew a measure on a much smaller matter, so there is little precedent for such behaviour. I believe that I would let people down by not trying to get the detailed discussion that having the No. 1 private Member&#146;s Bill affords.</p>

 I am grateful to my hon. Friend for what she is doing today. I declare an interest as the vice-president of the National Autistic Society. Like my hon. Friend, I support and welcome what the Government have said that they will do. The National Autistic Society&#146;s endorsement shows that it has taken the Government&#146;s word about the outcome of their promise, but it is incumbent on us as parliamentarians to ensure that the public know Parliament&#146;s intention and to scrutinise line by line, so that what happens is clear. If I catch your eye, Madam Deputy Speaker, I hope to demonstrate how the National Autistic Society has taken the Government&#146;s word in the past about promises that have yet to be fulfilled.</p>

 It is that questionable track record that leads me to believe that I have a moral imperative to try to press the Bill. If the Government choose not to support the Bill in the Lobby or when we attempt closure later in these proceedings, that will be a matter for the hon. Members concerned, as the Bill is private business.</p>

 I, too, congratulate the hon. Lady on taking the Bill forward, which, as she knows, is something that I, too, considered. As a matter of naked self-interest, I suppose that I would want her not to take her Bill into Committee, so that my future private Member&#146;s Bill would have more of a chance. However, I do not take that view. It is very important that the Bill should get into Committee. In particular, I hope that there will be an opportunity in Committee to consider the important transition arrangements for young people with autism who are reaching adulthood. That is a neglected area that needs proper consideration.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o12"><a name="90227-0001.htm_para12"><a name="09022736000158">Autism is a lifelong and disabling condition that affects how a person communicates, and how they relate to and make sense of the world. It is a spectrum disorder that presents in different ways and to varying degrees in each individual. Some people with autism are able to live independent and fulfilling lives with very little support, while others need specialist support throughout their lives. Estimates suggest that one in 100 people has autism, which means that well over 500,000 in the UK have it. It also means that, together with their families, more than 2 million people are affected by autism every day. There are also suggestions that the prevalence of autism is on the increase.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o13"><a name="90227-0001.htm_para13"><a name="09022736000159">Autism is a relatively recent diagnosis that was recognised only after world war two. Indeed, Asperger&#146;s syndrome became part of international diagnostics manuals only in 1994. That may go some way towards explaining the low public understanding of autism, because although there is a high public recognition of autism and the fact that it is a disability, there is a host of myths and misconceptions about it. One of the most common is that autism affects only children, but one recent estimate put the number of adults with autism at well over 300,000. Often the interest in autism concerns its negative impact and burdens, but there are positive aspects, such as the outstanding talents, which have been considered far less often than the negative impacts. Professor Uta Frith tells me that about 10 per cent. of individuals exhibit special talents, mainly in art, music and memory. Many people also continue to believe, wrongly, that there is a cure for autism.</p>

The headmistress has said that part of the problem is that all the good work being done in the school is lost when the youngsters leave it and enter adulthood.

 As a vice-chairman of the all-party group on autism, I, too, congratulate my hon. Friend on introducing the Bill.

 May I bring the hon. Lady back to the important point that she was making about local authorities assessing need? In Cambridge, a group of parents of adults with autism are worried about what will happen to their offspring after they become too old to care for them. They are trying to set up specialist housing for their offspring to live in for the rest of their lives, but the first thing that the local and regional authorities told them was that they could not be helped because the authorities did not know the level of need involved. That is why there has to be legal force behind the obligation to assess such need.</p>

Only 53 per cent. of young people had been issued with transition plans on the move from children&#146;s to adult services&#151;a point raised by my hon.

Recently, I discovered that a constituent of mine had not come to the attention of social services since leaving school 40 years ago, because of the care provided by his mother. We had difficulty in getting the local authorities to respond to this person, with whom they were not familiar, in order to put together a care package. My hon.

 I am grateful to my hon.

It clearly specifies the actions needed to stop adults with autism being excluded from receiving the services that they need and to which they are entitled. Existing Department of Health guidance states that local authorities should already be working to assess the needs of adults with autism in their area. However, the reality on the ground is that most local authorities are not even fulfilling their obligation to know how many people with autism there are in the local area. Guidance has not had the required impact, and legislation is essential to ensure that people with autism do not continue to be excluded.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o24"><a name="90227-0002.htm_para6"><a name="09022736000188">The clauses relating to children seek to improve the data collected by local authorities on children with autism for strategic planning purposes. The Government have recognised that data collection on disabled children has significant gaps and, according to the &#147;Aiming High for Disabled Children&#148; report, the data on all disabled children across the board are poor. The policy commitments of &#147;Aiming High for Disabled Children&#148; and national indicator 54&#151;NI54&#151;to improve education for children with learning disabilities are welcome measures, but data collection seems to need legal force to make it happen universally.</p>

Children with autism are a sizeable minority population, with chronic needs that are too often overlooked. In addition, the Bill aims to strengthen co-operation between child and adult autism services and ensure that data collected by children&#146;s services are used to inform the development of adult services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o26"><a name="90227-0002.htm_para8"><a name="09022736000190">The clauses dealing with adults focus on the immediate and necessary support that adults with autism need. More than three quarters of primary care trusts do not keep a record of how many adults with autism are in their area, and 86 per cent. of local authorities say that having more information about the number of adults with autism would help long-term planning.</p>

I found that the special NHS trusts dealing with such hospitals did not know how many of their patients had conditions relating to the autistic spectrum, and that those special patients were frequently denied the services they needed because they were simply not available and therefore ended up warehoused, sometimes for many years, before such treatment was made available to them.</p>

I refer to Mrs. Christine Gilliam&#146;s son, Luke, who was not diagnosed with Asperger&#146;s syndrome until he was 10&#151;a late diagnosis. Mrs. Gilliam had to fight for her son&#146;s statement of special educational needs, as so many parents have to do. He had to be accommodated in a mainstream school and was constantly bullied. There was a lack of support for his transition to adulthood and he ended up in Feltham young offenders institute. Mrs Gilliam wrote to me saying:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o38"><a name="90227-0003.htm_para4"><a name="09022736000219">The results of the pressure created by the Bill are admirable, and are largely due to the culmination of support, awareness-raising and campaigning among the wider autism community over the past decade. Let me specifically acknowledge and thank the National Autistic Society for its commitment to championing the causes of children, adults, parents and carers who are affected by autism throughout the country. They continuously face an uphill battle when seeking support and guidance for those in need. The National Autistic Society has truly set a precedent in providing what is needed and expected: information, advice, advocacy, training and support for individuals and their families who are dealing with autism. The presence of the society, which has over 18,000 members and 80 branches across the United Kingdom, is widely felt in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.</p>

Friend the Member for Corby (Phil Hope), who is responsible for care services, and to the Under-Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families, my hon. Friend the Member for Portsmouth, North (Sarah McCarthy-Fry), who is responsible for schools and learners, for the letter that they sent last week outlining the Government&#146;s commitment to improving access to services, opportunities and, I hope, the lives of people with autism. I am delighted to note the Government&#146;s commitment to a new strategy, and warmly welcome the latest developments. Indeed, I want to record my thanks for the efforts that Ministers have made to work with the National Autistic Society to develop proposals whose implementation will surely require an extensive collaboration between groups and individuals in Whitehall and beyond to ensure that the needs of individuals affected by autism are truly represented.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o45"><a name="90227-0003.htm_para11"><a name="09022736000236">In the past nine years, we have commissioned a number of research studies, including our manifesto for autism in 2003. It set out four general principles and 11 specific objectives to deliver better services and support for people with autism, to be achieved in the following 10 years. It was developed as a result of extensive consultation across the autism movement, with contributions from people with autism, parents, carers, local groups and national organisations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o46"><a name="90227-0003.htm_para12"><a name="09022736000237">The general principles of the manifesto called for the following: all people working with people with autism to be properly trained; research to be carried out, especially into causes, costs and effective interventions on autism; improved service provision for those with autism; and improved tracking and planning of services for people with autism at all local and national agencies. In order to raise awareness in Parliament of the manifesto, the officers of the all-party group on autism tabled an early-day motion to enable Members to put on record their support for those objectives, and the overwhelming support it received was most welcome.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o47"><a name="90227-0003.htm_para13"><a name="09022736000238">In October 2008, the all-party group launched &#147;Half way there?&#148;, a mid-term review of our manifesto. It found that in the five years since the manifesto was published the profile of autism had risen among both the general public and parliamentarians and that there had been significant progress towards achieving many of the principles and objectives outlined. The Government&#146;s announcement of a national strategy for adults with autism has been warmly welcomed by the all-party group, as it removes some of the fundamental obstacles to progress.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o48"><a name="90227-0003.htm_para14"><a name="09022736000239">Other key initiatives also delivered progress during the time frame. In the 2005-06 parliamentary Session, the Department of Health published a note to clarify the obligations of local authorities regarding adults with autism. That was the first Government document specifically on adults with autism. It stated:</p>
<a name="90227-0003.htm_brev3"><a name="09022736000830"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The current position whereby some people with an autistic spectrum disorder &#145;fall through&#146; local services&#151;in particular between mental health and learning disability services&#151;is unacceptable and contrary to the intention of Government policy.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o49"><a name="90227-0003.htm_para15"><a name="09022736000240">Additionally, the launch of a Government-funded Autism Education Trust in November 2007 strengthened the focus on training teaching professionals and aimed to improve education support for all children with autism. In 2008, the Department of Health committed to developing an adult autism strategy, with the creation of a senior autism adviser post within the Department to ensure a continuing focus on, and sufficient attention to, autism. That adviser now provides leadership to local agencies in removing barriers that prevent those with autism from accessing the support and services they need. These Government commitments on autism signalled a real commitment to bringing about change. Progress has been hampered, however, by systemic shortcomings in the way information is collected and services are delivered.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o50"><a name="90227-0003.htm_para16"><a name="09022736000241">The all-party group&#146;s current research takes the form of an inquiry into the transition from school to adulthood for young people with autism. We have received an outstanding response from parents, carers, professionals in the autism sector and from people with autism. People have been extremely keen to tell us about their experiences of transition and the changes they would like to see to improve the services so that young people  <br>

with autism can fulfil their potential, lead happier lives and make a positive contribution to society. For this reason, I was extremely pleased to read in the Minister&#146;s letter of last week that the Government had confirmed their commitment to funding further research on transitions for young people with autism. When only 34 per cent. of students in mainstream schools are being issued with transition plans from children to adult services, that is an essential step forward. Can the Minister reassure me that this money will be ring-fenced to look specifically at improving transition for young people with autism? Additionally, as chair of the all-party group on autism, I ask the Minister if he is willing to share with me that strategy, ahead of publication.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o51"><a name="90227-0003.htm_para17"><a name="09022736000242">One of the many themes that appears to be emerging from the all-party group transition inquiry is that, once past school age, many adults with autism&#151;especially those with high-functioning autism or Asperger&#146;s&#151;are not deemed eligible for support by social services. I suspect most Members will have come across cases in their constituencies where that has happened. Many of those individuals are told that they do not fit the criteria for support from their local authority&#146;s learning disability team, nor do they fit the criteria for the mental health team, and they therefore fall through the gap between the two services. Overall, 63 per cent. of adults with autism say that they do not have enough support to meet their needs. I therefore seek the Minister&#146;s clarification about how the new strategy will tackle that issue and so ensure that local authorities and NHS bodies will be obliged to remedy the current failing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o53"><a name="90227-0003.htm_para19"><a name="09022736000246">Many people with autism, particularly adults, also face barriers to accessing services because social care professionals and others have inadequate knowledge of the condition. It is vital that those providing services to people with autism understand the disability and are fully trained to communicate with people with autism effectively and to facilitate them in explaining their needs fully. Can the Minister assure me that the new strategy will address that issue?</p>

 I pay tribute to the hon. Lady and the all-party group for the considerable amount of work they have done on this issue.

 May I start by congratulating the hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham (Mrs. Gillan) on introducing this Bill, and for the vast amount of detailed work she has obviously undertaken? We must also all reflect on the point she made that autism touches many people&#146;s lives.</p>

They cover both children and adults, straddling the Department for Children, Schools and Families and the Department of Health, which is very important. This Government have really taken the agenda for children with special educational needs forward. All that is acknowledged.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o57"><a name="90227-0003.htm_para23"><a name="09022736000255">In the past year, we have had many debates on special educational needs and children with disabilities, and in most of them we have raised issues relating to autism and to children with autism in particular. Let us consider the statistics that I and others have quoted on previous occasions. Some 45 per cent. of parents of children with autism say that it takes more than a year to receive support, and 50 per cent. of parents feel that their child is not in the right setting. More than one in five children with autism are excluded from school, 67 per cent. more than once. More than 40 per cent. of children on the autistic spectrum are bullied. An estimated one in 100 school-age children is on the autism spectrum. It is a developmental disorder&#151;a hidden disability that is particularly reflected in a lack of social skills in certain settings.</p>

 TreeHouse, which is located in my constituency, does excellent work and is pioneering progress with autism and on the various measures available to offer help. It has just hired a transition officer as its first cohort approaches the age of 18. That is not the case throughout the constituency&#151;many parents have terrible trouble and anxiety about transition; the facilities are simply not there. But even in the light of TreeHouse and the transition officer, nothing follows to assure parents that there is something for their children thereafter. Does my hon. Friend agree?</p>

My hon. Friend talks about the patchiness of service provision. Does she acknowledge that in that context, specialist knowledge within schools is a huge issue?

 I thank my hon. Friend for that intervention. Yes, although it is true that the Government have moved forward with initial teacher training on special educational needs, the first cohorts with such training will not come through until 2011; and yet, the Government have been pursuing an inclusion agenda for the past 10 years. These things must marry together.</p>

Ongoing support and appropriate interventions are a requirement&#151;a necessity. Such support has to be tailored to individual needs, and those needs will be very different, given the diversity within this condition. Support must be available at the right time, at the right quality and to all those with needs, so it is not just a matter of identification, important though that is.</p>

of autism. It is not a question of just one or two sessions explaining the characteristics of autism in a particular child&#146;s circumstances, but of continuing support. The more that parents and carers can understand, the more that they can help their children to develop. People with a child with autism cannot just turn to a textbook and look at straightforward processes of a child&#146;s development.</p>

 My hon.

This group has had support from TreeHouse on how to negotiate with the local authority, which is interesting to note. Parents also need respite. I am extremely pleased with the Government&#146;s programme Aiming High for Disabled Children. However, we in Dorset are a pilot for that, and professionals tell me that we have yet to see clear benefits in terms of children with autism being given respite care.

 Before the hon. Lady moves on from support services to parents, may I advise her on one point? In Blackpool, there is a specialist team that offers advice to both teachers and parents, advising them on the issues that they will face, including those as the child grows older. She mentioned earlier that there are examples of good practice. Surely one thing that must come out of the Bill is that, where good practice exists, it must be spread around the whole country, so that the gaps she referred to can be filled.</p>

 I thank the hon. Lady for her intervention and I could not agree more. We all know of examples of good practice and how frustrating it is when they are not spread right across the country. The spreading of such good practice must indeed be an outcome, as I hope it will be, of the Bill.</p>

The situation is incredibly fraught for parents, and even within a given mainstream setting there will be teachers who, as yet, have not had that training. There are children with autism who, by the age of eight or nine, are perhaps struggling with the academic side but particularly with social skills. It has to be recognised that such children will often need a modified application of the national curriculum. They might not be able to cope with whole-class lessons; they need a quieter environment.

 I am extremely grateful; the hon. Lady is generous in giving way. Does she agree that, more widely across the field of policy and in other legislation, the Government have a continuing duty to give particular consideration to people on the spectrum? For example, on the Government&#146;s proposals for apprenticeships, in which I see much merit, does she agree that there should not be arbitrary academic requirements for accessing those apprenticeships? Such requirements might very well cut off opportunities for people on the autistic spectrum who would be well suited to an apprenticeship, but who might lack the formal academic qualifications that the Government have in mind.</p>

 I thank the hon. Gentleman for that intervention and I am looking forward to some productive discussions about young people with special educational needs in the context of the Apprenticeships, Skills, Children and Learning Bill. There is a great deal to be said for offering alternative routes forward for children and young people with special educational needs, and I hope that successful amendments to the Bill achieve that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o67"><a name="90227-0004.htm_para8"><a name="09022736000277">I was very pleased to serve on the cross-party panel of MPs that was established to conduct hearings on services for disabled children. Of course, I should note that the vice-chairman was the hon. Member for Blackpool, North and Fleetwood (Mrs. Humble). Among the horror stories we heard, it came through very clearly that parents felt that they had somehow got through school only to find that, lo and behold, they were faced with the transition stage. Time and time again, we hear that successful outcomes through transition can be achieved only by parents screaming for the services that they need.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o68"><a name="90227-0004.htm_para9"><a name="09022736000278">We hear so frequently of the inadequacy of transition planning and communication between children&#146;s and adults&#146; services, the lack of co-ordination between different services and agencies, and the lack of assurance of support when a statement comes to an end. We must have multi-agency assessment at the right time, and we need transition plans to be developed with families and appropriate goals to be set. I was recently given a local example when a young person on the autistic spectrum had a college placement and was in a class with a group of young people with mild learning difficulties. One might have thought that that would have been all right, but in fact it was not. That young person, because of their difficulties with social skills, could not handle the lack of structure outside class times. It just shows how much thought must go into everything and the special planning for individual needs that is required.</p>

arrangements governing statementing can be appalling in some parts of the country and very good in others&#151;the difficulty of getting proper support in mainstream education and the transition issues. Does my hon. Friend agree that the very fact that there is such diversity of provision across the country&#151;from good practice to appalling practice&#151;is why we need a legislative framework such as that proposed in the Bill to try to ensure that there is a more uniform approach? That is why I hope that the Government will adopt the proposals in the Bill.</p>

It has only recently been set up, but it reflects the problems of such adults very well. Each individual family has different needs. Asperger&#146;s is an unseen condition in which there is no noticeable physical disability and it is mostly not recognised or acknowledged, not even by professionals such as social workers and GPs. The individual has a personality that does not fit in with the norm, with odd behaviour and obsessions, and often has an acceptable IQ that does not come under the definition of special needs, which means that they can fall through the gap between social services and mental health services. These adults can have depression and more extreme psychiatric conditions, and so they need to be seen by the mental health teams. Many live a normal life and can hold a job, but others are employable in a limited way and others are completely unemployable and struggle to fill their days. That can be a great strain on all concerned.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o70"><a name="90227-0004.htm_para11"><a name="09022736000282">I have another local example that I want to mention. A young man got a job collecting trolleys at a supermarket, but he did not react very well to females. On one occasion, a lady customer asked him to move the trolley and he responded with very strong language, as one might imagine. There was a real lack of understanding from everybody. That example shows the support we need to offer: additional job coaching, teaching people how to deal with social gaffes and work with employers. We need to try to fill the social skills deficit.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o71"><a name="90227-0004.htm_para12"><a name="09022736000283">The big problem is that many of those people fall between NHS and social service departments, particularly in the case of those with Asperger&#146;s. The support group also said that those adults and their parents struggle with behavioural problems. Those adults need independence but are unable to be independent. There is a lack of suitable housing, and those with Asperger&#146;s are often unable to claim benefits as many have difficulty in getting a proper diagnosis. What is offered to them is, as I have said, a Cinderella service. Indeed, the new criteria will make claiming the disability living allowance difficult for some of those people. They can also be socially isolated through the lack of facilities that can offer a professional approach and understanding. Once a youngster leaves full-time education, they are on their own. Parents have already gone through years finding the right place in education, often not succeeding, and, sadly, the fight goes on for parents until they die. That sums up some of the problems of parents who support adults with autism.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o72"><a name="90227-0004.htm_para13"><a name="09022736000284">I want to congratulate the Wessex Autistic Society, which is an important organisation that provides valuable  <br>

services in Dorset. I also want to highlight the importance of the voluntary sector. I have a special mission in that I feel that adults with autism need a key worker. I hope that the details of the Bill will reveal that such provision will be made, because I find that in constituency cases my office can become the key worker if I am not careful. It is absolutely essential to have a key worker when an adult is not claiming benefits, is building up debts and needs health and social services support. Somebody has to take ownership of that.</p>

 I understand the right hon. Gentleman&#146;s point. What is needed is a commitment of the whole Government to deliver the measures. I also agree with Opposition Members that we will need some provision in legislation to make that happen. That provision might take the form of statutory guidance, or it might be achieved through other mechanisms or other legislation. What we have to debate today and in Committee, if the Bill reaches that stage, is whether this Bill is the legislation that is needed to make that happen, or whether we can achieve it better by some other means.</p>

We have heard one or two comments this morning from Opposition Members about measures that have not been delivered, and there are questions to be answered about whether the prevalence study has progressed as fast as we would have liked. I hope that the Minister will give us some reasons why we have not yet seen the results of that study; I suspect that they will have to be very convincing, if he is to please the House today.

Local authorities took cognisance of the fact that this Government had passed legislation to ensure that parents of a disabled child had the right to a mainstream school place for their child, and interpreted the legislation to mean that it removed parents&#146; right to ask for a special school place. The legislation did not do that&#151;the Government have made that clear. Parents have the right to ask for a special school place if that best suits their child, but many local authorities deny them that right and are prepared to take such cases all the way to special educational needs tribunals, where they pay expensive barristers to argue the council&#146;s case against a parent, who is doing no more than fighting for their child. We have all seen examples of that and we all want it to stop.</p>

If and when the Bill goes into Committee, we must discuss the problems of transition. Now the transition is defined as that which occurs at the age of 18 but, as many of us know, in many local authorities a gap emerges between the ages of 16 and 18: an autistic child goes through the schools service and reaches the age of 16, and the local authority just assumes that there is nothing it need worry about until the autistic person reaches the age of 18 and suddenly becomes the responsibility of adult services.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman makes a valid point, adding to the comprehensive list that has already been set out by Members on both sides of the House. Surely that is precisely the reason why the Bill should go into Committee. Line-by-line, word-by-word scrutiny will happen only in Committee; our concerns will not be dealt with by any assurances the Minister gives today.</p>

 I thought I had made it clear that, if the Bill goes into Committee, there are matters that need to be discussed. The only possible reason not to send the Bill to Committee would be if the Minister unequivocally addressed today all the points that are being made, but I can see already that, whatever he says, Opposition Members will want the Bill to go to Committee. I have no problem with that, although I would say that serving that Committee would divert the Minister&#146;s attention at a time when he could be moving the agenda forward. I am merely suggesting the areas of additional scrutiny that I want the Committee to cover.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman&#146;s track record on this subject is second to none. He referred to cases that ultimately go to court, usually to challenge the local authority. Increasingly, the pattern is that local authorities settle out of court but, owing to the stress involved, it would be helpful if we did not have to get to that point. When there is legal challenge, the courts often want to know what Parliament&#146;s intention was. If measures have not gone before Committee and are not statutory, that undermines the case put forward by people who need the protection of the courts.</p>

 The hon. Lady says that my record is second to none, but my record is second to hers, and I acknowledge her contribution to the debate. She is absolutely right: if we are to ensure that cases do not go to court, or go to court and are resolved properly, there will have to be statutory force behind what we want to achieve. My only question is whether the Bill is the right sort of statutory force. I note that the clauses are all about the duty to &#147;promote&#148; and &#147;recognise&#148;. Those are mealy-mouthed expressions, in legislative terms. They give local authorities a wealth of opportunities to say, &#147;We are promoting this. You&#146;ll have to prove that we&#146;re not promoting it before you can achieve your objective.&#148; If the Bill goes into Committee, I will  want the Committee to explore whether those are  the right levels of assurance for local authorities and public bodies.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman is actually making the case for allowing the Bill to go into Committee; we could then raise all those issues. Far from distracting the Minister, Committee would be an opportunity for the Minister to hear all the expertise on autism that there is in this place, and to ensure that any legislation that follows really addresses the issue and results in outcomes for people who suffer.</p>

 I agree with the hon. Lady. She seems to be assuming that I am opposed to the Bill going into Committee. I am saying that there is a circumstance in which I would not wish the Bill to go into Committee, and that is the situation in which the Minister gave us cast-iron guarantees today on all the points raised by the Bill. Assuming that he does not give us those cast-iron guarantees today, the Bill will need to go into Committee, and I am setting out the points that I want to hear that the Committee has addressed. I am explaining the key issues that I have in mind that will have to be addressed if the Bill is to come out of Committee in a form that we want to see progressed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o83"><a name="90227-0005.htm_para6"><a name="09022736000315">Let me set out the absolute key issue that I want to have addressed; it will have to be the Minister who addresses it, because I do not think that Standing Orders will allow the Bill to do so. The hon. Member for Buckingham (John Bercow) and I are advisers to the Learning Disability Coalition, which is a coalition of campaigners for and champions of people with learning disabilities of various needs, including those with complex learning disabilities. It is campaigning to make sure that the needs of people with learning disabilities are properly recognised by Government, councils and public authorities. Indeed, next week I am leading a delegation of people with learning disabilities from that coalition to see the Minister and put their case to him.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o84"><a name="90227-0005.htm_para7"><a name="09022736000316">One of the hot topics for those of us who campaign for people with learning disabilities is the fact that nobody knows how many people there are with learning disabilities. Nobody knows how many of those people have complex needs. Local authorities do no survey of people with learning disabilities, just as they do no survey of the number of people with autism in their area. It is not that one disability is in competition with another; we want everybody with a disability to get the support that they need from our public bodies. The Bill may make it councils&#146; responsibility to make a proper assessment of how many people in their area have autism, but it will not do anything for those people with learning disabilities or, for that matter, physical or other disabilities. We need to end up with a statutory requirement on local authorities to carry out a comprehensive assessment of disabilities in their area&#151;all disabilities, affecting people of all ages. That includes children, adults and young adults.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o85"><a name="90227-0005.htm_para8"><a name="09022736000317">Local authorities need to make such assessments for people from cradle to grave. They need to come up with a proper strategy to support people with all disabilities, based on that assessment. That assessment needs not just to include the services provided by a council, but to cross boundaries into the services provided by the health service, the courts and jobcentres. As it stands, the Bill will certainly improve circumstances for people with autism but, if we are to legislate, I would like us to legislate more comprehensively so that we can make sure that the assessment is carried out for all people with a disability.</p>

 Is the hon. Gentleman not in danger of making the perfect the enemy of the good? Two years ago, Ministers promised us a prevalence study on autism; we have not had it, but the Minister is now saying that he will ensure it. He says that he will produce a consultation on a strategy for autism. Surely the hon. Member for South Thanet (Dr. Ladyman) is not seriously saying that we should not take that, but should instead wait for some grander plan dealing with all disabilities. Let us bank what we can get now for those who suffer from autism.

 Of course they need something now, but so do people who are responsible for children with all other disabilities&#151;learning disabilities, including complex learning disabilities, and physical disabilities. Those children, too, need people to assess their needs properly and build a proper local strategy for supporting their needs. All I am arguing is that we should not ghettoise those areas of disability. I agree that if, at the end of the day, we get something for autistic people out of the process, that will be a step forward, but it is not where we ought to be as a country. We ought to require a proper, comprehensive assessment of disability. We require a proper strategy to be put together to support people with disabilities in our local communities. We also need a requirement to be added to the Bill requiring all authorities to co-operate on producing such a strategy. At the moment, I do not read such a duty in the Bill; authorities are simply to promote the cause in their own little ghetto. That is not good enough.</p>

 That may well be the case. The promises that the Minister gives, either today or in Committee, must have statutory back-up; that is the touchstone.

It is true that a lot has been done over the years, and I pay particular tribute to children&#146;s services and the field of education. We are not there yet; I am not complacent in any way. However, I am often invited to schools for children with autism and sometimes to residential care institutions for such children. When I compare those children with their counterparts of 20 or 30 years ago, I see a generation who have an autistic spectrum diagnosis but who are more confident because of the more appropriate care and support that they get.

than 70. However, we know that members of the Asperger&#146;s syndrome population can be of average if not high intelligence. Indeed, I venture to say that many of our academic university departments&#151;particularly those specialising in maths and physics&#151;are highly populated by people with the syndrome. They are very bright, intelligent people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o94"><a name="90227-0006.htm_para1"><a name="09022736000335">However, the horror of the condition is that those people may have that academic ability but they still have what is referred to as the &#147;triad of impairment&#148;. There are three characteristics that are common to all people with autism, wherever they are on the spectrum, including their ability to communicate and the impairment of social imagination and interaction. That means that there is the anomaly of people who at first sight appear to have nothing wrong with them. There is no white stick, but, like an iceberg, two thirds of their lifelong disability is below the surface. We know from well- defined research&#151;including papers produced over the years by the National Autistic Society&#151;by many people around the country, that such people, who are bright or of average intelligence, can see how the rest of the world turns and society behaves and try to be part of it. But, however hard they try, there is always a glass wall in front of them that they cannot break through. They are only too acutely aware that friendships, social relationships and all the things that make up how everybody else lives their lives are not available to them. If such people try and try and cannot break through that, there are consequences. The consequence, often among adults in their early 20s, who have made the effort to be part of the world and society, is that they develop serious mental health problems&#151;not because they have autism, but because of their effort to try to be part of society. According to one National Autistic Society report, the suicide rate is 8 per cent. among the Asperger&#146;s syndrome population. That is incredibly high.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o95"><a name="90227-0006.htm_para2"><a name="09022736000336">We are talking about a condition that involves a spectrum and that on first sight might appear to many people not to warrant the support and attention from the statutory services that would help them through. We are also talking about a lifelong condition that is a life-and-death situation. Some of us have constituents who have experienced the death of an autistic child&#151;not because the child had autism, but because life became too unbearable for them and they gave up. We would all give up if we had to experience such a condition without the right support.</p>

 The hon. Lady has made an extremely powerful point, particularly in relation to people of substantially above average intelligence. In the work that I do with those in the IT industry, I come across many highly intelligent, even brilliant people who find it very difficult to relate to what the rest of us would call normal behaviour. Right at the heart of this at the moment is the case of Gary McKinnon. I personally think it would be a tragedy if he were extradited to the US, because the courts have failed abysmally to take his Asperger&#146;s syndrome into account.</p>

Floor of the House on more than one occasion my concern about people with Asperger&#146;s syndrome who fall foul of the mental health services when they are inappropriately treated, and that can also involve the criminal justice system. We are talking about support for people who need very specialised expertise, which is available to them in this country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o96"><a name="90227-0006.htm_para3"><a name="09022736000339">Many people with Asperger&#146;s are highly intelligent but have difficulty coping with everyday life. The social services and the Department of Health have &#147;tick lists&#148; as to who will and who will not get some support with their everyday needs. Sometimes something as simple as providing a befriending service so that the person has somebody&#151;age-appropriate, it is to be hoped&#151;to have an evening out with socially can make all the difference to their sense of well-being.</p>

 I agree with the hon. Lady, whose knowledge of this subject is of extremely long standing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o97"><a name="90227-0006.htm_para4"><a name="09022736000342">That brings me back full circle to where I started, with the Department of Health circular. I am concerned that in order to deliver his promises on regulation, the Minister is going to lean on section 7 of the 1970 Act, as the Department did back in 2001. The circular that it produced told health and social services that they must now take account of Asperger&#146;s syndrome and make assessments for it available. Whenever I am invited to talk to an audience of people interested in autism, I have made a habit of taking about 20 photocopies of this circular with me because increasingly it is totally ignored, yet it has statutory weight behind it. If this is the legislation that the Minister is going to rely on for his regulation, he will have to convince me that he will ensure that this can be implemented. To my certain knowledge&#151;I am not exaggerating&#151;I have given away hundreds of copies of this circular, not just to parents but to professionals, because they were not aware that it existed, and people have been denied access to services as a result. I know that this circular has been used in several court cases that have been brought to try to get packages for people with autism.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o98"><a name="90227-0006.htm_para5"><a name="09022736000343">I know that many people in the House want to speak on this subject, although I hope they do not speak for too long. I want to give them a chance to do so but will just finish with this point. The Minister will know that the National Audit Office is concluding an extensive report on the subject of autism. As a member of the Public Accounts Committee, I was fortunate enough to visit Sir John Bourn and his team in January last  year and ask them if they would report on autism, because the PAC has seen some excellent reports from them in recent years on subjects such as strokes and dementia. The PAC is of course interested in value  for money in public expenditure, but those reports on dementia and stroke flagged up not only the economics of dealing with this population of people but the  gaps in the system that have been mentioned many times today, and the human dimension of not doing something properly.</p>

We look forward to its findings. However, if he does not let a Committee sit to scrutinise the Bill, I can assure him that his permanent secretary will appear before the PAC before too long, and we are not an easy bunch when it comes to letting people off the hook. The choice is his&#151;he can either come and face the music in Committee himself or put it off until later in the year and let his permanent secretary do the job for him. I have always believed that ministerial office means that the buck stops on the Minister&#146;s desk. It would be very good if he would think again about allowing the Bill of my hon. Friend the Member for Chesham and Amersham to be scrutinised so that the meaning of the words can be examined and the legislation got right.</p>

 I apologise, Madam Deputy Speaker, for not being here at the beginning of the debate. I have just come from one of my local primary schools, where the head teacher commented that the numbers of children being identified with conditions on the autistic disorder spectrum is growing, particularly among boys. There is therefore an absolute need for the provisions in the Bill, and we must get it into Committee.</p>

 I agree about the scale of the problem. I am not 100 per cent. certain in my own mind&#151;I say this as a lay person&#151;whether there is a greater prevalence now than there was before. I think that we are identifying more people on the spectrum than we did before. The hon. Member for Ealing, North (Stephen Pound), who was in the Chamber earlier, asked my hon. Friend the Member for Chesham and Amersham to define autism. It is not new. It is relatively new for it to be talked about, and wonderful that so many MPs are talking about it. However, it is relatively new in this country in this context. It was first identified in the 1940s by a German called Kanner, and at about the same time an Austrian called Hans Asperger identified Asperger&#146;s syndrome. Speaking as a parent who has a child who was born in 1971, I find that people understood autism in its most profound sense of Kanner autism, particularly at the most extreme end of the spectrum where children would have to be looked after for 365 days a year, might self-mutilate and would never have language. However, the other end of the spectrum&#151;Asperger&#146;s syndrome&#151;was known in other parts of the world but was not recognised here until much later, long after we started the statementing of children in schools and suchlike. It is not new in that sense, but it is relatively new in this country for us to have a greater understanding of the spectrum and the condition. That is why we are now recognising that there are more such people, although I remain to be convinced that there are more now than there were.</p>

House to understand the financial and economic scale of this problem? In November 2007, the Foundation for People with Learning Disabilities produced a report estimating that the aggregate cost of supporting people with autistic spectrum disorder was already at that time &#163;27.5 billion per year in the UK. That is the scale and the order of the issue that we are discussing.</p>

 Yes, and the Martin Knapp report that was published a little while ago considered the economics and the cost of this situation. I hope that the NAO report will address it as well, and that we will be better informed by that report. The interesting thing about the amount of money that is spent by social services is that when they provide nothing, or something that is inappropriate, at a lower level, they end up dealing with people in crisis later on, which costs them huge amounts of money. I worry about the associations local authorities make with autism&#151;some of them, not all, as some of them are very good. Because they only ever hear about the crisis of autism, which means big bucks, they are terrified of the subject. As for low-levels of input, I mentioned something like a befriending service. Such a service would come low in the list of priorities in the assessments of most social services, but it could be a lifesaver for someone with Asperger&#146;s syndrome.</p>

 I would like to start on the theme that the hon. Member for Tiverton and Honiton (Angela Browning) just touched on&#151;the causes and prevalence of this condition&#151;because it is an interesting area. Her instinct is probably correct. There has been no increase in the prevalence of the condition, but there has been undoubtedly an increase in its recognition and diagnosis. That is true of a lot of illnesses. There is a view that certain things happen more frequently today, but it is actually a question of science moving on, and we now have the capacity to diagnose certain illnesses.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o101"><a name="90227-0006.htm_para8"><a name="09022736000353">I congratulate the hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham (Mrs. Gillan) on introducing the Bill, and  I would like to touch on a couple of things that she and I have done in the past&#151;before she slips out for a well-deserved cup of tea. She and I served on the Select Committee on Science and Technology during our first parliamentary Session, and one of the things we looked at was the development of human genetics. In our third report of the 1994-95 Session, we looked at a huge number of conditions that had by then been identified as having a possible genetic component. The order of incidence of most of these was one in 500, or one in 8,000&#151;for example, one in 500 was diabetes type 1.</p>

Just a few years ago, a Select Committee, with all the expertise that it has at its disposal, did not bother to look at the matter because it had not come to our attention. It has crept up on this House rapidly in recent years, and it is only people such as the hon.

 The hon. Gentleman takes me back to those happy days when we were looking at the human genome project. We were concerned that identifying a genetic trait or a certain sequence identified with a disability might lead to people being discriminated against. We were concerned about protecting people and enabling them to have the best services that they could. Is this debate not just a continuance of those days back in 1992 and 1993? In this Bill, we are looking for the vehicle that will provide protection to people we can now clearly identify as having Asperger&#146;s, and also, importantly, to those yet to come.</p>

 I totally agree. I hope that this debate will help us to get the legislation right, in whatever form it emerges, and to improve public understanding to the degree that we start to influence the way in which other Departments that may not be directly affected by her proposals react when dealing with cases&#151;for instance, those of the bright people to whom the hon. Member for Tiverton and Honiton referred&#151;where people get into trouble with the system. One example of this is when they go to job interviews, a point which the hon. Member for Buckingham (John Bercow) raised in relation to apprentices. Those are hugely important matters.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o103"><a name="90227-0006.htm_para10"><a name="09022736000357">As I said in an intervention, I strongly believe that we need to ensure that magistrates and judges fully understand their responsibilities when dealing with cases that come before them. That is terribly difficult, because when somebody has done something illegal, the natural position to take is that they must be punished. Surely, however, in a civilised society we ought to take into account people&#146;s mental state and their conditions. After all, nobody knows why the brain develops in the way that it does in the case of people with autism. Not having that knowledge does not give us a justification to lock people up and throw away the key, as society did at one stage. It gives us a responsibility, as a civilised society, to work on finding out the cause of autism. That is an extraordinarily challenging area of medical science, and we should seek to promote it. I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will ensure that our science budget for that is properly protected and that the Ministry of Justice and the Department for Work and Pensions take autism issues into account.</p>

 No, I will not give way, because the right hon. Gentleman has annoyed me intensely. I am making a serious point based on my knowledge, and I have no intention of trivialising the debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o104"><a name="90227-0006.htm_para11"><a name="09022736000362">I indicated in my exchange with the hon. Member for Tiverton and Honiton my experiencing of dealing with people working in high-end occupations who are very difficult to manage. I recall meeting a bright young man who was a leading researcher in a big IT company in California. I shall not mention the name of the company, because his name could be identified if I did. His leadership did not want the delegation that was visiting the company to meet him. When I asked why not, the response was deeply worrying. The company employed him and had respect for his abilities, but his leadership said to me, &#147;You can&#146;t meet him because he&#146;s an animal.&#148; His behaviour was particularly odd, but his technical output was extraordinary. Even in that case, the company had not quite got it right. I see the grimace on the hon. Lady&#146;s face, and indeed that is not the way to treat such people. Yes, they should get such high-end jobs, but they need to be treated with dignity. All people with such conditions deserve that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o105"><a name="90227-0006.htm_para12"><a name="09022736000363">Autism is no longer attributed to how parents behave and so on, as it used to be: it is properly recognised. There is some interesting work on this on the  websites of the NHS and the World Health Organisation. However, it has come to the fore only recently, because of the advance of medical science. The United Nations General Assembly recognised the condition only on  18 December 2007, as a result of a motion proposed by the state of Qatar, and it is among only three illnesses to have been given world awareness days. Those are  hugely important changes. Similarly, developments are occurring locally.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o106"><a name="90227-0006.htm_para13"><a name="09022736000364">Let me now refer precisely to the Bill. The problem is real because local authorities and Government agencies let down people on the autistic spectrum. I have already mentioned the courts, the Department for Work and Pensions and others that can do better. The Minister must ensure, by engaging with his colleagues, that other Departments buy into the policy. I agree that the statutory guidance issued under section 7 of the Local Authority Social Services Act 1970 works only if it is properly policed and followed through rigorously.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o107"><a name="90227-0006.htm_para14"><a name="09022736000365">I want to ask my hon. Friend the Minister several specific questions. Will there be extra money next year to ensure that proper research can be undertaken into the prevalence of adult autism in particular? Will guidance issued to local authorities under the Bill or section 7 of the 1970 Act have statutory teeth? As the hon. Member for Tiverton and Honiton pointed out, it should not be a case of simply putting something on to the statute book&#151;just having it there does not deliver. Policing legislation properly means resourcing it, and I expect the Minister to confirm that that will happen. Like my hon. Friend the Member for South Thanet (Dr. Ladyman), I am not worried about how things are tactically managed as long as the outcomes are correct. It is important to ascertain how statutory guidance to children&#146;s trusts develops. The hon. Member for Buckingham is nodding. As my hon. Friend said, the guidance that we expect to cover children&#146;s trusts will&#151;by definition, I hope&#151;cover a range of disorders, but we need to be assured today that that includes autism and the autistic spectrum.</p>

Some authorities, which deliver well on children&#146;s services, have no provision for proper transition. As my hon. Friend the Member for Blackpool, North and Fleetwood (Mrs. Humble) pointed out, they can fail even at the basic level of sharing information within departments.

 My hon. Friend and I agree that there needs to be communication between children&#146;s services departments and adult social care departments, but we need more than that. Children&#146;s services departments have developed appropriate services for many children with autism, but one of the problems facing adult social services departments is that the services are not there for them to purchase and offer to adults with autism, so another outcome that we want from the legislation is the building up of such provision.</p>

 I fully understand that and respect my hon. Friend&#146;s expertise. Transition is fraught with difficulties, which arise largely because local government, like central Government, has a silo structure. We have to avoid that. Support for an identified client of social services or educational services should travel with them, irrespective of their age or which part of the service deals with them. By focusing services on the individual client, we can ensure that bureaucratic obstacles do not get in the way.</p>

 I am not familiar with that project, but it sounds like the kind of thing that needs to be developed throughout the country. It also fits with the observation that the hon. Member for Buckingham made about the Government&#146;s apprenticeship programme. There could be a role for organisations in the third sector that can help that kind of transition to take place. That is quite an important area to consider.</p>

 My hon. Friend is suggesting that when the Minister makes the case to the Treasury for those resources&#151;resources that he says the whole House would want&#151;he should make certain arguments. Is not the best way for the House to amplify the Minister&#146;s arguments to give the Bill its Second Reading and then test the issues further in Committee? That would allow the Minister to make a compelling case to the Treasury and others about the priority that the House attaches to the issue and its proper resourcing.</p>

 I totally agree with that. Clause 8, which refers to expenses, says:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o112"><a name="90227-0007.htm_para4"><a name="09022736000376">My hon. Friend the Minister will have found, when he has tried to negotiate for clauses to go into a Bill, that there is always pressure from those in the Treasury who say, &#147;We can&#146;t have that because of the cost.&#148; Here, there is prima facie evidence from the work of Professor Knapp to demonstrate that the enormous cost to society could be reduced if we managed our services better. So I am making a plea to the Minister not to be suckered into a discussion with the those in the Treasury about how much these measures will cost, and instead to convince them that the work of Professor Knapp and others adequately demonstrates why this would be a wise thing to do, financially.</p>

I hope that he will take on board all the points that have been made by colleagues on both sides of the House, and ensure that the House takes a leading position&#151;it would be a leading position, because not many countries have really taken on board the needs of people on the autistic spectrum&#151;so that we can say that we have done this by working together and with the National Autistic Society in the interests of people on the spectrum and their parents and families, as well as of the whole of society.</p>

 I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Tiverton and Honiton (Angela Browning), who has worked tirelessly throughout her time in Parliament to introduce measures to support children and adults with autism. Parliament, and Members of Parliament, attract a lot of criticism these days, but the work that she has done is a shining example of what still can be done by this place to improve the lives of others.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o114"><a name="90227-0007.htm_para6"><a name="09022736000385">I also congratulate the National Autistic Society on all its work, and the many other charities that are involved in this area. The &#147;I Exist&#148; campaign is one of many that has contributed significantly to raising awareness and achieving some of the changes that are needed. Of course, I also congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Chesham and Amersham (Mrs. Gillan) on introducing the Bill. I know how hard she has worked, into the small hours, preparing for today and gathering the cross-party support that we have seen.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o115"><a name="90227-0007.htm_para7"><a name="09022736000386">Autism is different, because there is no other condition of such complexity that affects so many, and about which so little is still known. We have heard many statistics today, but one of the most striking was the figure of 2 million. It referred to the 2 million people who are affected by autism, including the parents, the siblings, the carers and the families. No one who is unaffected can truly understand what these people&#146;s lives are like: the wide yawning gap they fall through between learning disability and mental health when autism is neither of these. For some parents caring for children with autism, there are no holidays and no time off&#151;just 24-hour care every day of every week. This private Member&#146;s Bill provides an opportunity to make that better.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o116"><a name="90227-0007.htm_para8"><a name="09022736000387">Shortly after I was elected, I met some parent carers locally who were looking after children with profound disabilities. They felt angry and let down and were utterly exhausted. With the help of Carers Support Guildford and Carers Support Waverley&#151;I pay tribute to their work&#151;we set up a group locally. Carers Support was fantastic; it had an open day last year and intends to repeat it. It provides an opportunity for parents to drop in and meet some of the local charities and statutory services, attend workshops and meet other parents. Not  <br>

all these parents have children with autism, but many do. Despite the best efforts of charitable and statutory services, many are isolated, lonely and struggling on their own.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o117"><a name="90227-0007.htm_para9"><a name="09022736000388">The Bill would change all that. It would combat the lack of information about children and young people with autism. It would give local agencies obligations to include their needs when they plan their services. It would ensure that services around transition&#151;a crucial area as children move towards adult-focused provision&#151;are maintained seamlessly. For young people&#151;and not just those with autism&#151;this period is a trap door through which many fall, as hon. Members have mentioned today. The Bill would ensure that the needs of adults with autism were truly recognised. In a word, it would give people&#151;children and adults&#151;a chance for a good quality of life: the physical and mental well-being that most of us take for granted.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o118"><a name="90227-0007.htm_para10"><a name="09022736000389">I would like to highlight a few important issues for the Minister. The section 7 agreements, much debated today, have not worked for people with Asperger&#146;s. The 2006 Department of Health guidance requires local authorities to nominate a strategic lead or team on autism, but only 39 per cent. have done so&#151;in other words, more than half have failed to do so. The costs due to loss of income from employment and the direct costs to families are estimated at &#163;27.5 billion, as my hon. Friend the Member for Chesham and Amersham mentioned.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o119"><a name="90227-0007.htm_para11"><a name="09022736000390">Another statistic to pick up is that, because of the lack of support, a third of adults with autism suffer from severe mental health problems. My hon. Friend the Member for Tiverton and Honiton referred to the 8 per cent. who commit suicide. If we drill down into the repercussions, they are truly dreadful. People with autism not only lack support, but suffer from mental health problems&#151;severe mental health problems&#151;on top. We then need to turn our attention to the fact that people with mental health problems have significantly worse physical health. What this third of adults lacking support face is a spiral of deteriorating mental and physical health, dreadful misery, hardship, loneliness, poverty and isolation, sometimes ending in suicide.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o120"><a name="90227-0007.htm_para12"><a name="09022736000391">I pay tribute to the hon. Member for Burton (Mrs. Dean) and the all-party parliamentary group. I hope that she will decide to support, not block, this Bill. She failed to explain in her interventions why she objects to the Bill going into Committee. The bottom line is that it will be on the record and easy to see who wanted the Government commitments examined with the Bill as a vehicle and who blocked the Bill and walked away from scrutiny of the Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o121"><a name="90227-0007.htm_para13"><a name="09022736000392">The hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole (Annette Brooke) covered many points and the hon. Member for South Thanet (Dr. Ladyman) raised the interaction between people with autism and the police, pointing out that the Bill fell short in some ways. I think that my hon. Friend the Member for Chesham and Amersham accepts that, but this is precisely the point. The Committee stage would offer all of us the opportunity to work through the detail and add and subtract in order to get the very best possible services. A Committee stage could only add to services. It would take nothing away. There really is no downside.</p>

 That is an interesting point, which I had intended to discuss later. I can see no way in which proceeding with the Bill would make anything more difficult, and I hope the Minister will take account of that in his response.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o123"><a name="90227-0007.htm_para15"><a name="09022736000396">The hon. Member for South Thanet said that he wanted cast-iron guarantees. The only way in which to secure such guarantees, and to secure the very best for people with autism, is to give the Bill a Committee stage. The hon. Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston (Andrew Miller) referred to the criminal justice system, and pointed out that section 7 orders were effective only if enforced. Along with the hon. Member for South Thanet, who asked for those cast-iron guarantees, I do not doubt the Minister&#146;s commitment. It is not that  I do not trust him or what he says; I just feel that unless the Bill goes into Committee we will not maintain the impetus or secure the legislation that is needed, because section 7 orders simply are not good enough.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o124"><a name="90227-0007.htm_para16"><a name="09022736000397">The details of the Government&#146;s proposals need to be examined properly. As we have heard today, debate on them is crucial, and can only enhance the services that are eventually provided. We need an opportunity to go over every detail of the proposals, and to flesh out precisely what they will mean for a child or other person with autism.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o125"><a name="90227-0007.htm_para17"><a name="09022736000398">In his letter to all Members, the Minister said that he would launch a consultation on a strategy on services to support adults with autism, that it would have bite, and that he wanted outcomes to be delivered. He said that the strategy would include statutory guidance, which would, however, be subject to consultation and assessment of benefits. I note that slight qualification. Let me say this to the Minister: do not hold back. Join the cross-party consensus on the Bill, and let it go into Committee so that it can be examined in detail. I am not sure that any statutory guidance will work, and I hope that today&#146;s debate has raised doubts in the Minister&#146;s mind as well.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o126"><a name="90227-0007.htm_para18"><a name="09022736000399">The Government have nothing to fear if they have nothing to hide. They should welcome the opportunity that the Bill gives them. If they do not support the Bill, we have to ask why. What exactly is worrying them? Why do they not welcome the opportunity to put their proposals on record and showcase them in the open in Committee? My fear is that they are allowing politics to get in their way and are playing a rather shoddy political game because they cannot bear the fact that the Bill has been introduced from the Conservative Benches. That would be a terrible shame, because I see no reason at all for them to block it. My hon. Friend the Member for Chesham and Amersham&#151;backed up by some generous observations from the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath)&#151;has gone to great lengths to demonstrate that this is a cross-party issue. It is not about politics; it is about people with autism.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o127"><a name="90227-0007.htm_para19"><a name="09022736000400">I ask the Minister to put aside his politics. I ask him not to block the Bill and sell people with autism short, but to put his shoulder to the wheel, welcome the Bill  <br>

Member for Chesham and Amersham (Mrs. Gillan) on choosing the Bill, running with it, and putting a real Government focus on all the issues that it raises. I also hugely congratulate the hon. Member for Tiverton and Honiton (Angela Browning). I suspect that, before I came to the House, she was a lone voice on autism. We have made significant progress over the past few years, however, and she has particularly flagged up the issue of people on the autistic spectrum who happen to be adults. That is what I also wish to focus on. There are two reasons why. First, I am a Parliamentary Private Secretary in the Department for Children, Schools and Families, so I cannot stray too far&#151;I am merely moonlighting from the Minister today. Secondly, I recognise that there is a long way to go in respect of adults with autism, as I stated when I had the honour to second the Loyal Address.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o129"><a name="90227-0007.htm_para21"><a name="09022736000403">It is worth putting on the record that there has been progress and that the agenda has moved forward, especially since the setting up of the all-party group in 2000 by my hon. Friend the Member for South Thanet (Dr. Ladyman), who has spoken in this debate and to whom I pay tribute. From the outset, the group has received invaluable support from the National Autistic Society. Rightly, every Member who has spoken has paid tribute to it, and I do, too; its skills, knowledge, encouragement and utter professionalism are second to none.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o130"><a name="90227-0007.htm_para22"><a name="09022736000404">One of the first steps the group took was to survey Members. I recall the feedback from that, and it was quite shocking. A significant number of Members in the year 2000 had not even heard of the word &#147;autism&#148;, and quite a few of those who had heard of it had no idea what it was. I recall that a Member&#151;who is still a Member, and actively campaigns on a range of disabilities&#151;asked me at one of the first meetings: &#147;Can it be cured?&#148; We were on&#151;and we remain on&#151;a learning curve. Although autistic spectrum disorder has been known about for some time, it has only come under the spotlight, and therefore been a little more understood, relatively recently.</p>

We were operating then from a pretty low base, but the 2008 &#147;Half way there?&#148; mid-term review makes it clear that there has been progress, although much more in terms of services for children with autism than in terms of adults. There have been one or two green shoots in that regard, however. For me, the most welcome announcement came last year when the Department of Health announced an adult autism strategy and the creation of a senior autism advisory post within the Department to keep the focus constant.

<p><a name="stpa_o132"><a name="90227-0008.htm_para1"><a name="09022736000406">We have heard this morning some shocking statistics on adults with autism, such as that 63 per cent. say their needs are not met and only 15 per cent. are in full-time work, out of an estimated population of 300,000. We all know from having met people on the spectrum in our surgeries and communities&#151;and, indeed, in our families&#151;of the entire further dimension of the thousands of adults out there in the country who are in their 20s, 30s, 40s, 50s, 60s and way beyond who have never been diagnosed.</p>

The strategy sits alongside other announcements that feed into the process. I know this has been mentioned several times, and that the Minister will cover it when he winds up the debate, but I want to say that the prevalence study must go ahead as we have to get a grip of the quantity issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o134"><a name="90227-0008.htm_para3"><a name="09022736000408">Publishing the good practice commissioning guidance in April is also a very good step. However, a note should go with it to every authority and NHS body saying that a strategy with teeth&#151;however it arrives&#151;is coming down the track, and that this guidance should not just be stuck on a shelf; people should actively get on with it. The National Audit Office study on the extent of existing services and how they meet the needs of adults regarding health, social care, employment and carers is timely in the context of this process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o135"><a name="90227-0008.htm_para4"><a name="09022736000409">The scope of the strategy itself has to be broad enough to deliver the service&#151;&#151;which is currently not being delivered in a comprehensive way&#151;&#151;that we want to see. I want my hon. Friend the Minister to assure me on this issue and to be guided by those whom he asked to define the boundaries. The question of scope is extremely important; it can be narrowed but it cannot be widened, so let us have everything of concern in that remit as we go forward.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o136"><a name="90227-0008.htm_para5"><a name="09022736000410">Nobody has said very much today about the process that the Government intend. When I spoke to the Minister privately on seeing this debate coming up, I was particularly interested in the question of who was going to be guiding the process. The external reference group is incredibly impressive. It consists of the chief executive of the NAS, Mark Lever; parents; people with autism; local authorities; mental health services; the voluntary sector and academics. The group needs to be as wide as that because we have to have that expertise in this process. Autism is a hidden disability and the issue is as much about culture as it is about practice and making practice work.</p>

52 per cent. of people with particularly high-functioning autism being told by mental health and learning disability teams that they do not fit the bill. That is shocking.</p>

 Does my hon. Friend agree that it is important that local authorities be encouraged to collect information not only on the number of adults with autism, but on their actual needs?</p>

 Absolutely, and that brings me nicely on to training.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o139"><a name="90227-0008.htm_para8"><a name="09022736000415">Training is also a central part of the approach. However much we manage to improve services for adults with autism, training is absolutely key and must be delivered&#151;both initially and ongoing&#151;in professional development. We are talking about GPs, psychologists, psychiatrists, social care workers, mental health services, Jobcentre Plus&#151;I could go on but I am not going to as I am mindful of the time. Part of the issue is the huge cohort of people who remain undiagnosed and who need to get support within the system.</p>

We can have a Bill, translated into an Act, and we can have regulations. We can have clause 7 and statutory guidance but both can be flouted simply because of ignorance, or because of lack of understanding and leadership in the organisations that we want to push this agenda forward in order to improve services for adults with autism. I wait with bated breath to hear what the Minister has to say, but I think that the outcome of the process could be more wide-ranging and robust than could be achieved by going into Committee at this point. However, I shall listen carefully to what the Minister has to say.</p>

 I want to make an extremely brief speech. The debate today has not actually been about the Autism Bill, and I have not yet heard anybody who suggests that it is anything other than a very good idea. The subject of the debate has been about whether the Bill is necessary, about the Minister&#146;s claim in his letter, to which I referred in an earlier intervention, that</p>
<a name="90227-0008.htm_brev0"><a name="09022736000833"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Legislation could make delivery of change more difficult&#148;,</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o142"><a name="90227-0008.htm_para11"><a name="09022736000419">and about whether the Minister has a better method of doing it through statutory guidance. His claim is that there will be statutory guidance, that there will be money behind it, as detailed in his letter, and that it will be a more effective method.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o143"><a name="90227-0008.htm_para12"><a name="09022736000420">First, there is no evidence that such a method will be more effective. My hon. Friend the Member for Tiverton and Honiton (Angela Browning), who has a long record of interest in these matters, is extremely clear, as I have been from my constituency activities, that the existing statutory guidance often produces no effect. Why not? Many of those on the ground do not know that it exists. My hon. Friend pointed out that if it is invoked in court, it is effective, but the problem is that the Department conspires through inaction to allow it not to be known by many of those on the ground. That would probably also be true of further statutory guidance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o144"><a name="90227-0008.htm_para13"><a name="09022736000421">Secondly, and more importantly, there will probably never be any statutory guidance or, if there is, it will probably take a very long time. Why do I say that? I accept that I am being slightly more rebarbative than some of my colleagues, who have been very generous to the Minister, but I have some personal experience of this in the recent past. I spent some hundreds of hours on the Sustainable Communities Act 2007 and we negotiated extensively with a parallel and equally admirable and well-intentioned junior Minister. The officials in the Department were extremely resistant to the Act and a series of documented assurances were reported in <i> Hansard</i>, each of which has been falsified. In particular, an assurance was given that a detailed spending assessment would be produced for all the money spent by central Government in every locality in Britain. That has not been produced. Not only has it not been produced, but a total travesty of that assurance has been produced. Are the Government embarrassed? Not in the least. Where is the junior Minister? Somewhere else. What is the Secretary of State saying? Nothing. She will not attend meetings or answer questions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o145"><a name="90227-0008.htm_para14"><a name="09022736000422">To quote an earlier intervention during a speech by a Labour Member, &#147;cast-iron&#148; guarantees were given but they have been falsified in practice. Does that and can that apply to the present case? Certainly it can. We have the evidence of the prevalence studies, which have not happened. No mention of them is made in the Minister&#146;s letter. There is no explanation of why the prevalence studies have not happened.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o146"><a name="90227-0008.htm_para15"><a name="09022736000423">The fact is that the junior Minister does not have the capacity to deliver, the Department shows no sign of the will to deliver and&#151;this is my main point&#151;however well-intentioned the Minister, the Secretary of State and the Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families are, the Government have all sorts of other priorities. I do not blame them for that. We are in the midst of an enormous national crisis.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o147"><a name="90227-0008.htm_para16"><a name="09022736000424">Only one person matters in this Government. It is usually the case that the one person who most matters in a Government is the Prime Minister, but in this Government only one person matters and that is the Prime Minister. We have had neither sight nor sound of the Prime Minister&#146;s being involved in this matter, and I would not expect that, because he is concerned with a major national crisis. The idea that the junior Minister can stand at the Dispatch Box and guarantee to the House that provisions including the expenditure of significant sums of money, legislative time and his Department will be delivered is plainly ludicrous. We do not know whether they can be delivered and the Minister does not know whether they can be delivered.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o148"><a name="90227-0008.htm_para17"><a name="09022736000425">I now come to my fourth and final point. The truth is that if the Government as a whole were genuinely signed up to delivering what the Minister says that he wants to deliver, they would allow the Bill not only to go into Committee, but to come out of Committee and to become an Act. All it does is seek to deliver the same things as the Minister says that he wants by other means to deliver. Nothing about the Bill would prevent the Minister from issuing statutory or other guidance if he wished to do so once the Bill was an Act. The only basis that the Minister has for trying to prevent the Bill from becoming an Act is the statement in his letter that</p>

Friend the Member for Guildford (Anne Milton) said during her excellent speech, there is no evidence that legislation will make the delivery of change more difficult. Indeed, there is every reason to suppose that legislation will make the delivery of change easier. Why? Because there will be better understanding on the ground of what is required; the Government will be subject to a stronger requirement to enforce what is required; and, in the final analysis, it will be easier for people to take cases to lawyers and the courts, because what is required will be clear in primary statute.</p>

children with disabilities. Children with autism and their parents came to us and explained the problems they had encountered at a series of levels, from getting the initial diagnosis through getting the health care and support they needed and then getting appropriate education provision. Above all, they described the real problems with the transition from children&#146;s services to adult services. We need to get this right, because, as other speakers have said, although there are examples of good practice, gaps in provision remain and we have to fill them.</p>

 Order. Perhaps I can be helpful. It might be sensible if, rather than getting into the mechanics of the debate, we carried on discussing the Bill.</p>

 As always, I am grateful for your advice, Mr. Deputy Speaker. I intend to address the purpose of the Bill. There are three main areas: information gathering, the delivery of services to people with autism, and the transition to adult services. The Government have already addressed many of those issues, but clearly there is still some way to go. We do not have a national register of people with autism, and even if one were set up, it would be extremely difficult to maintain. As hon. Members have said, some people, especially some people with Asperger&#146;s syndrome, are never diagnosed, and so are never included in any information. However, we ought to make the effort.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o154"><a name="90227-0008.htm_para23"><a name="09022736000442">Some effort has been made; a variety of organisations have attempted to get statistics through epidemiological studies or surveys. More efforts are now made by local authorities to try to collate information via schools. However, we need to do more, so I welcome the Minister&#146;s announcement&#151;I am pleased to see that he is back in the Chamber&#151;that he will address those issues, and I welcome the Department of Health&#146;s &#163;300,000 investment in the prevalence study, which will give us some sound information. The information is wanted not just to satisfy the needs of statisticians, but to enable us to develop appropriate services to meet the needs of people with autism.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o155"><a name="90227-0008.htm_para24"><a name="09022736000443">The excellent House of Commons research paper on the subject gives an account of the range of existing statutory support for people with autism. There are few references in legislation to the needs of people with autism, but through guidance, the Government have made sure that legislation applies to people with autism, or people with autism spectrum disorders. I note that there is guidance on how direct payments and individualised budgets for people with an ASD can be used. That will be an interesting way forward, because if people on the autism spectrum&#151;or their carers or family, in certain circumstances&#151;are given control of budgets, they will have a say in the sort of services that they want. If a theme has run through the debate, it has been the paucity of services for adults. If, through individual budgets, new services can be developed, it will certainly help to plug the gaps that we have all identified.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o156"><a name="90227-0008.htm_para25"><a name="09022736000444">As has been mentioned, standard 8 of the national service framework for children also has an autism spectrum disorders exemplar, which illustrates how children with an ASD are to be covered by the NSF. The Department of Health has made special reference to children with autism in its document &#147;Healthy lives, brighter futures: The strategy for children&#146;s and young people&#146;s health&#148;. The document was accompanied by a practice guidance note for local authorities. In spite of that, however, there are still gaps in service.</p>

That research focused on young people&#146;s experiences, including their mental health needs, social care and housing needs, further education needs, opportunities for leisure and access to transport, and the ease of their access to services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o161"><a name="90227-0009.htm_para3"><a name="09022736000451">I ask the Minister also to consider the impact of different funding arrangements on the choices that local authorities sometimes make about the provision of services for people with autism. I ask because I know of some problems for young people who are in specialist residential provision. They usually stay in such provision until they are 19. However, given the split between children&#146;s and adults&#146; services, they are sometimes asked to leave the specialist provision, in which they have often done well, when they reach 18. Their situation is then taken over by adult services, which do not include similar specialist provision for them. We need to look at who pays for the continuation of service during that transition stage. We must make sure that if the young person still needs education once the budget of the children&#146;s department has been used to deliver education until 18, the adult services budget is allowed to deliver that education so that there is continuity during the run-in to adult services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o162"><a name="90227-0009.htm_para4"><a name="09022736000452">There is also an issue of placement in adult services. If an adult with autism is placed in their own tenancy, supported by care workers, they will have access to housing benefit and a series of welfare benefits that reduce the cost to the local authority. If they are placed in a specialist residential provision, they do not have similar access to the range of benefits. I hope that the needs of the individual will come first, not money. Will the Minister consider that point? Transition arrangements can be very difficult. Sadly, all too often adults with autism are expected to fit into existing provision, but they cannot do that. They may have the external characteristics of many people with learning disabilities or mental health problems, but autism is different, and so the response has to be different. That is why we need to ensure that there is more specific provision for people  <br>

However, those at the more severe end of the spectrum need their particular needs to be properly addressed. That is why local strategic planning is essential. There are incentives in the Government&#146;s document, &#147;Aiming High for Disabled Children&#148;; we have to aim high for children with autism.</p>

What will that mean in practice? For adults as well as children, the commissioning guidance will be vital in ensuring that the outcomes that we all want are put into practice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o164"><a name="90227-0009.htm_para6"><a name="09022736000454">Let me say a few words about good practice. The hon. Member for Ribble Valley (Mr. Evans) referred to a school in his constituency, Hillside school, which serves children from Lancashire and elsewhere. I visited that school, many years ago now, and I know what good work it does. Lancashire county council has a whole series of initiatives, including an under-fives autism programme, the Stone Hey unit attached to Broadfield special school, support for parents through an early bird programme, and a Portage scheme, which can help families with children with autism. I also see good practice in Blackpool, which has a long-standing complex disabilities team who now liaise much more closely with the child and adolescent mental health services. The team has four members, who are trained in an autism diagnostic schedule. They train teachers and help parents. They work closely in the community in a multi-disciplinary way, including joint working with Connexions and the adult health services in Blackpool to provide a youth service for children with ASDs. They have a youth club for young people with Asperger&#146;s syndrome.</p>

I support the Bill, because we are all on the same side in wanting to improve services. I look forward to the Minister&#146;s comments and the reassurances that he can give us on the way forward. We are all, I hope, practical politicians, and we want to put in practice the things that we have been debating. I look forward to the advice that he can give us on how best to proceed.</p>

 I start by congratulating my hon. Friend the Member for Chesham and Amersham (Mrs. Gillan) on introducing the Bill, and on the way in which she spoke this morning&#151;eloquently, sincerely, knowledgeably, movingly and with the legendary courtesy for which I think I can safely say she is renowned in all parts of the House. I would like to echo, too, the tribute that she and others have rightly paid to the National Autistic Society, TreeHouse and the miscellany of other organisations&#151;13, I think&#151;that form part of the coalition to drive forward the Bill.</p>

For the avoidance of doubt, I say to the Minister of State with responsibility for health and social care, whose integrity and commitment he knows I do not doubt for a moment, that the reason we need these measures in legislative form is simply stated. We are talking about a minority of people. They are an important minority and an increasingly articulately represented minority, but a minority nevertheless. Unless there is statutory provision for their entitlements, the danger is that, inadvertently if not calculatedly, because of all the other priorities of local, national, statutory and voluntary agencies, the interests and needs of the autistic child, young person or adult will tend overwhelmingly to be either relegated or ignored. That is why, in the absence of a critical mass of such people to trigger change on a regular basis, we need to take the opportunity to proceed with the Bill and to extract a series of legislative commitments. That is the statutory fail-safe that the autistic community seeks and is entitled to receive.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o167"><a name="90227-0009.htm_para9"><a name="09022736000458">I want to be brief, and specifically to pose a series of questions to the Minister, with whom I have engaged over a long period on issues of this kind, and in whose answers I am profoundly interested. First, the Minister has said that the Government will commit &#163;200,000 from the transition support programme to the funding of research into transition from childhood to adult services for people on the autistic spectrum. Will the Minister today guarantee in terms that that &#163;200,000 will be explicitly ring-fenced for that purpose and that purpose alone? Would he be good enough to tell me and the House when the money will be made available, through whom it will be channelled, and what assessment of the nature, extent and results of the work will be made?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o168"><a name="90227-0009.htm_para10"><a name="09022736000459">Secondly, the issue of training has rightly been addressed by the Minister and his hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families. He will know that in practice it has often been difficult to get explicit commitments on particular training programmes. Will the Minister guarantee to meet the professional bodies to advise on how, in practice, the training commitment can be taken forward, and will he bear in mind that there is a difference between saying that there are opportunities for, and an availability of, training on the one hand, and saying that in practice the children&#146;s work force, the health service work force and the other individuals who are relevant to delivering better services will attend training courses with the back-up funding of staff required to translate the aspiration for training into the reality we seek?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o169"><a name="90227-0009.htm_para11"><a name="09022736000460">Thirdly, the draft strategy in April and the intended final autism strategy in December are an ambitious project. I do not sniff at it, but it is an ambitious project with a tight time scale. Can the Minister assure the House today that the time scale is not such as to inhibit the strategy, or to put it another way, can he confirm that the strategy will be absolutely comprehensive, so that we do not go full circle on the issue?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o170"><a name="90227-0009.htm_para12"><a name="09022736000461">Fourthly, I ask the Minister in all courtesy to make one other commitment that would offer some reassurance. Will he undertake in his contribution to answer every point that has been made by a right hon. or hon. Member today, and in so far as time prevents him doing so, would he be good enough to undertake to write to Members whose questions or challenges he did not answer, and to place a copy of what I am sure will be an illuminating and comprehensive reply in the Library?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o171"><a name="90227-0009.htm_para13"><a name="09022736000462">I conclude by saying that there are two reasons why we have to address these issues, rather in the superb manner that my hon. Friend the Member for Chesham and Amersham did, and do so in legislation. First, it says something important about the political DNA of our society if we are prepared to commit to a vulnerable section of the population whose needs and interests have for too long, under successive Governments, been inadequately recognised. Secondly, it is not just a matter of being nice, decent and compassionate. It is also a matter of the authentic self-interest of UK plc. If we can address the problems, deficits, weaknesses and denials of opportunity from which people on the autism spectrum suffer, we will be playing into many other agendas as well. Tackling those issues is relevant to the fight against antisocial behaviour and the challenge of improving mental health. It is important to the objective of securing better educational outcomes and bolstering the qualifications, training and expertise of the work force. It is profoundly relevant to the future prosperity of UK plc in an age in which a job for life is a relic of the past and the premium placed on knowledge, skills, practicality and the ability to communicate and engage is greater than ever before. I look forward with interest and respect to what I am sure will be a comprehensive response from the Minister.</p>

 I am very pleased to follow the hon. Member for Buckingham (John Bercow), although his speech was rather shorter than I would have liked. I enjoy his speeches, but I totally understand why he kept his remarks short. I do not intend to speak at great length, but I am a sponsor of the Bill, and anybody who knows me will know that I take a great interest in special educational needs and disability. I have therefore prepared a thorough contribution, and I will resent any accusations that I am playing Friday games, which I am certainly not.</p>

She has shown great skill and endeavour in achieving what I believe to be an excellent package of measures to support those in our society with autism, and I congratulate her on doing so. Incidentally, I watched her on &#147;Question Time&#148; last night, and I thought that she looked remarkably perky this morning considering the busy schedule that she has had this week. I commend her for her warm and moving comments on that programme about Jade Goody, with which I concur entirely.</p>

difference, and the consequences of the hon. Lady&#146;s work will have a positive impact on thousands of lives and families up and down the country in the years to come.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o175"><a name="90227-0009.htm_para17"><a name="09022736000467">The case for more action on autism is clear-cut and compelling. It is a condition that affects how people relate to the world around them, as numerous Members have said. People with autism can find it difficult to empathise and communicate with others. Communication, interaction and imagination can all be difficult. It can also have other behavioural consequences such as a love of routines as well as learning disabilities. It is understandable that society is lagging behind in fully supporting and including those with autism, given that they often find it difficult to express for themselves the steps that would improve their quality of life and access to wider opportunities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o176"><a name="90227-0009.htm_para18"><a name="09022736000468">Public understanding has been stinted because autism exists on a spectrum and is manifested in varying degrees. Today marks acknowledgement of the lack of information about autism and the lack of awareness by schools, the Government and members of the public. No studies have been carried out on adults to ascertain the prevalence of autism. The only existing estimates are worked out from the 2001 census. As part of the National Autistic Society&#146;s &#147;I Exist&#148; campaign, I contacted my local authorities to find out how many adults with autism lived in each of them. One did not hold such information and the other could tell me only how many attended a specialist day centre&#151;fewer than 20, if I remember correctly. That is obviously not representative of the  1 per cent. of society that we understand to be autistic.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o177"><a name="90227-0009.htm_para19"><a name="09022736000469">We should not&#151;thanks to today&#146;s debate, we cannot&#151;downplay the wider impact of autism. Approximately 500,000 people are estimated to have autism and around 2.3 million people are affected by it. They include family members and professionals, who are involved in the care of people with autism. Yet a deficiency remains in the information that the powers that be hold about the prevalence of autism among adults and children and its effects on them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o178"><a name="90227-0009.htm_para20"><a name="09022736000470">When I was researching my private Member&#146;s Bill, the autism charity, TreeHouse, researched a series of parliamentary questions from the past 10 years. The results show that 551 questions were asked about autism, relating mostly to health and education. The questions reflect the consensus about the great need for diagnosis, research, treatment and data collection. The report recommends that the Government consider collecting information centrally to gain an understanding of local authorities&#146; needs. Although the report was originally published to support the aims of my private Member&#146;s Bill&#151;now the Special Educational Needs (Information) Act 2008&#151;it is clear from the National Autistic Society&#146;s &#147;I Exist&#148; campaign that concerns remain about the quality and quantity of the data that are available and their use to benefit those on the autistic spectrum.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o179"><a name="90227-0009.htm_para21"><a name="09022736000471">Lack of information has been highlighted through a difficulty in diagnosis in schools. Forty per cent. of all children with autism wait more than three years for a clear diagnosis. Boys are four times more likely to develop autism than girls. The condition can also lead to behavioural difficulties, and 25 per cent. of children with an autistic spectrum disorder have been excluded from school at least once.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o180"><a name="90227-0009.htm_para22"><a name="09022736000472">More than 40 per cent. of children with autism have been bullied at school. According to an Office for National Statistics 2005 study, 42 per cent. of children with autism have no friends, compared with only 1 per cent. of other children. Recognition of those saddening and shocking statistics has already led to action by the Department for Children, Schools and Families.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o181"><a name="90227-0009.htm_para23"><a name="09022736000473">In May 2008, the Department published guidance on how to prevent and tackle the bullying of children with special educational needs and disabilities. The National Autistic Society was consulted about developing the guidance, and one of the case studies focuses on an autistic pupil being provoked by bullies and how a school successfully responded to that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o182"><a name="90227-0009.htm_para24"><a name="09022736000474">The Department funds the Anti-Bullying Alliance and the national strategies to work with local authorities and schools to ensure that the guidance is effectively implemented. It is also producing a DVD to be launched in 2009 for use in schools to show why pupils should not bully disabled peers. I know that the Department is already working with the National Autistic Society, Mencap and other disability groups to examine the characteristics of young people who are bullied, and it will publish a report in the autumn.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o183"><a name="90227-0009.htm_para25"><a name="09022736000475">The existing statistics also reveal an urgent need to focus on training staff in our schools to identify children with autism accurately. I was pleased to secure a commitment from Ministers to undertake a review of the effectiveness of the inclusion development programme in upskilling teachers to support the needs of SEN pupils. The university of Warwick will independently evaluate the use of the IDP materials, reporting in 2011, with interim reports in the meantime, and I welcome that action from the Government, which shows a commitment to finding out what is working and what is not.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o184"><a name="90227-0009.htm_para26"><a name="09022736000476">In addition, in June 2008, the Training and Development Agency launched a comprehensive training resource for providers of undergraduate primary initial teacher training. It included 18 taught sessions, including one specifically focused on recognising and supporting children with autism. This summer, the TDA will launch a resource for secondary initial teacher training, which will include a taught session on autism and self-study tasks for primary and secondary postgraduate certificate in education courses covering the same ground. A similar approach will be taken in materials for newly qualified teachers, which are due out next January. Work is under way, therefore, but we all agree that it is not enough.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o185"><a name="90227-0009.htm_para27"><a name="09022736000477">A lack of public knowledge about autism has led to a general misunderstanding of the condition, which has often been left aside. Parents and people with autism are frequently confronted with a lack of understanding of autism. Improved data collection would lead to a better understanding among organisations, educational services and local authorities. Such information would enable a stronger evidence base for long-term planning and help to allay concerns that the existing approach is too short-sighted.</p>

spread of services. Parents giving feedback to TreeHouse shared fears that children with autism would fall through the net because of a lack of co-ordination among services, the inadequacy of transitional arrangements between children&#146;s and adult autism services, and a lack of education and employment opportunities. That is why there is a clear case to be made for local authorities and patient care trusts to work together to secure the best interests of children.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o187"><a name="90227-0010.htm_para1"><a name="09022736000479">The Autism Education Trust was launched in November 2007 with funding from the Department for Children, Schools and Families. Its role is to raise awareness of the importance of appropriate educational provision for children with autism, to bring organisations in the autism education sector together and to include children and young people, together with their families, in the planning of improvements in autism education. That fantastic remit is capable of delivering fantastic results. The Autism Education Trust held its first national conference yesterday, which I understand was well received, and it will have my full support in the years ahead.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o188"><a name="90227-0010.htm_para2"><a name="09022736000480">Although education dominates much of the discussion about how to support those with autism and improve their life chances, there are people of all ages on the autistic spectrum. Finding employment is often difficult. It is estimated that there are about 332,600 people of working age in the UK with an autism spectrum disorder. Of that number, just under half are of average or above average intelligence. Despite that, research by the National Autistic Society has shown that only 6 per cent. of all people with an ASD have full-time paid employment and that only 12 per cent. of those with high functioning autism or Asperger&#146;s syndrome have full-time jobs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o189"><a name="90227-0010.htm_para3"><a name="09022736000481">The problems with social interaction can prove a barrier to people searching for a job. The National Autistic Society suggests that the best way to recruit is not always by through an interview, but through a work trial. Not enough is known about the help that is available to employers who take on a person with a disability. The DWP access-to-work programme aims to meet the additional employment costs arising from disability, and there are other schemes out there to help. However, we need to let potential employers know about it. We also have to burst the myths about autism to secure fairer access to the workplace.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o190"><a name="90227-0010.htm_para4"><a name="09022736000482">There are many myths about autism. One quarter of people think that it is mostly children who are affected, yet we know that in an average constituency, around 3,000 people will have autism. Many people think that autism sufferers have special abilities in English or maths, but this is normally untrue. Only two in five people know that there is no cure for autism.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o191"><a name="90227-0010.htm_para5"><a name="09022736000483">As I mentioned earlier, last year the National Autistic Society launched the &#147;I Exist&#148; campaign, which highlighted the lack of information available for adults and the misconceptions about autism, which can lead to poor treatment in society. The aim of the campaign was to make people think differently about autism. It involved adverts, campaigning and sending information to local and national Government. But how long will it take for people to begin to think differently about people with autism.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o192"><a name="90227-0010.htm_para6"><a name="09022736000484">Given the low numbers of adults with autism in employment, TreeHouse estimates that the annual cost of autism to the UK is &#163;27.5 billion, as the hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham, who is not in her  <br>

place now, said. It is unacceptable&#151;not just for our society and our economy, but for the thousands of lives that are not being fulfilled&#151;that those who can work are unable to do so because of societal ignorance. Given all the recognised problems that we face, the focus that the Bill places on the shortfall in service provision for people with autism is as timely as it is welcome.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o193"><a name="90227-0010.htm_para7"><a name="09022736000485">The Bill introduces a requirement for the collection of data on people with autism by local authorities. Data on children will be registered annually by each local authority, and shared with the relevant partners, as set out in the Children Act 2004. This will allow for local flexibility. The Bill also places on the Secretary of State a duty to advance the provision of services by local authorities and the NHS, and requires local authorities to work for a smooth transition from child to adult autism services, allowing for data collection by children&#146;s services to be used for adults.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o194"><a name="90227-0010.htm_para8"><a name="09022736000486">The Bill also covers the provision of staff to deal with child autism, and provides for diagnostic services for adults, work force training requirements and sharing good practice at regional and national levels. Only two local authorities currently have a system in place to collect the relevant information, and the NHS and local authorities must, as far as possible, work to promote independent living for people with autism. All this is needed. As I have already said, I hope that the requirements to collect data will be fulfilled in a way that makes constructive use of the Special Educational Needs (Information) Act 2008, which will mean that data collected in our schools do not simply fall into a void once children leave school.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o195"><a name="90227-0010.htm_para9"><a name="09022736000487">The impetus that the Government are placing on co-operation between local authorities and primary care trusts will help to ensure appropriate data sharing. This stage of transition is crucial in ensuring that the benefits of identification and support are not lost, which is why an extra &#163;200,000 is being found for more research into the subject, to ensure a good transition between these groups. With improvements in teaching and many of the obligations set out in the child health strategy, there will also be a growing focus on earlier identification and intervention.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o196"><a name="90227-0010.htm_para10"><a name="09022736000488">Wider measures, including child and adult mental health services, services for children with speech, language and communication difficulties, and the &#163;770 million invested in the Aiming Higher for Disabled Children programme, will all help to improve the status quo. At this point, I would like to commend the sterling work done by the hon. Member for Buckingham (John Bercow) on the Bercow review.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o197"><a name="90227-0010.htm_para11"><a name="09022736000489">Further improvements must come through a greater understanding of what achieves the best results. This is a problem that needs to be tackled, and it involves engaging with local communities, voluntary sector experts and carers to work out strategies that can overcome the existing difficulties with local information collection. Joint strategic needs assessments will be critical in providing better services for people with autism, and I hope that the Government can offer an assurance that autism, as well as other high-incidence special educational needs, can and will be included in such assessments.</p>

bones of contention over the Bill concerns the teeth of the national strategy for autism. That is why I am pleased that the National Autistic Society will now be so closely involved with the development of such a strategy.</p>

I know that the National Autistic Society has been keen to confirm that there will be specific mention of autism in such guidance, and my understanding&#151;which perhaps the Minister could confirm, if he has heard me&#151;is that there will be. I am more than happy to take him at his word on this one.</p>

Member for Chesham and Amersham and driven by the National Autistic Society. I know that thousands of people have lobbied their MPs on this matter, and I congratulate everyone involved. This is a great achievement, and the measures that the Government have set out make it clear that they have listened to what is needed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o201"><a name="90227-0010.htm_para15"><a name="09022736000493">The Government aim to drive improvements on local services. There is not one aim of this Bill of which I do not approve, and I am delighted that the National Autistic Society and TreeHouse are so pleased with what this process has secured. Of course, one or two things need ironing out of the commitments that we have been given. The situation relating to section 7 guidance under the Local Authorities Social Services Act 1970 is unclear, and we will need to give greater clarity on how it should be interpreted. I share the hope&#151;and, in fact, fully believe&#151;that the national autism strategy will be comprehensive and that it will deliver the opportunities of the 21st century to those with autism. It should contain references to the fact that all children on the autism spectrum, including those with Asperger&#146;s, need to be on the register for children with disabilities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o202"><a name="90227-0010.htm_para16"><a name="09022736000494">In the light of the Government&#146;s proposed measures, I wonder whether the hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham, along with the Minister, might like to consider one or two questions, whose answers could set a precedent and carry ramifications for any future Government. It is right for the Bill to prioritise needs, but is it right to prioritise them with a Bill that deals with a single impairment, when we could help many more people by tackling the barriers to learning and life that people with a wide range of disabilities and special educational needs need to overcome? Much has already been achieved by the Bill and Second Reading is not yet complete; and I do not think that so much success has been won at such an early stage before.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o203"><a name="90227-0010.htm_para17"><a name="09022736000495">I am delighted that the need to address weaknesses in services for people with autism has been highlighted. It is gratifying to see that the need for better information has been emphasised yet again and I cannot stress enough the urgency with which those responsible for implementing change must ensure that information held locally is used locally in order to deliver improvements nationally.</p>

 First, I congratulate the hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham (Mrs. Gillan) on securing this Second Reading for her Bill. As many Members have already remarked, her efforts have built on those of the hon. Member for Tiverton and Honiton (Angela Browning), who introduced a similar ten-minute Bill previously.</p>

Every Member with an interest in these matters wants to thank the hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham for raising the profile of this important issue. I also want to thank the Under-Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families, my hon. Friend the Member for Portsmouth, North (Sarah McCarthy-Fry), who could not attend today. I have worked closely with her to develop the Government&#146;s proposals in this area. Between us and across our respective Departments, the Government certainly need no persuading of the need for action on autism.</p>

What they said has sometimes been based on their personal experiences, sometimes on the views of their constituents who have autism and their families and carers. Quite rightly, Members have called for more to be done in their constituencies. I particularly congratulate Members who have been, or are involved in or have chaired, the all-party group on autism: my hon. Friend the Member for Burton (Mrs. Dean), my hon. Friend the Member for South Thanet (Dr. Ladyman), a former Minister, and my hon. Friend the Member for Erewash (Liz Blackman).</p>

I certainly want to take the opportunity, like others this morning, to record my thanks to the third sector organisations that provide services, advise on policy and campaign for change. I particularly thank the National Autistic Society, with which both the Department of Health and the Department for Children, Schools and Families have worked in close partnership to develop the new policies that we have the opportunity to debate today.</p>

I shall do that by describing our autism strategy in detail. I want to put on record what that strategy will contain, what it will achieve and how we will ensure that it delivers on its promise. I am not sure which Member said &#147;We are all practical politicians and we want to establish the best way to proceed in order to do what works&#148;, but that is absolutely right. We need to ask what action we can take following today&#146;s debate to assure individuals with autism, their families and their carers that we are taking action swiftly and effectively to address the concerns before us.</p>

 That is exactly what I intend to elaborate on, by explaining how the statutory guidance that we wish to provide, which will flow from the national strategy for adults with autism, will address key issues at local level without creating the risk of rigidity, inflexibility and inability to deliver change that might be unintended consequences of other measures.</p>

country, so that pockets of excellence become the mainstream norm in meeting the needs of adults with autism. The new strategy that we will launch in April will be subject to a major consultation in which many such questions and issues can be addressed. Once the strategy has been developed, we will be able to issue statutory guidance based on it, enabling every local authority to understand its obligations and the work that it must do to assess need, provide services, involve people in the development of their local strategies, and improve their work forces.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman is right. I shall say a great deal more about the guidance that we will publish, but the key question is whether it is statutory. I shall be describing the range of measures that we will introduce to ensure that best practice is replicated so that individuals with autism, and their carers and families, receive the services that they need. Those measures will include not just statutory guidance but back-up in the form of leadership, delivery mechanisms and relentless pressure across all regions to ensure that what we talk about happens in practice.</p>

 I rise to seek clarification from the Minister. There has been a lot of confusion in contributions on this matter. Irrespective of whether we have this Bill, there will have to be guidance in order for the Minister to fulfil his promises. With the Bill, it would be guidance issued under clause 5, under which the Secretary of State must set out regulations. Without the Bill, regulations will still have to be made. Either way, it is vital that it is statutory guidance.</p>

 My hon. Friend is absolutely right. We can argue about which primary legislation the regulations sit under, but the fact is that we wish to introduce that statutory guidance, and I will address the detail of which Act we wish to use for that statutory guidance when I reach that point in my remarks. I should, perhaps, add that this is only in regard to adults. In addition to that statutory guidance, my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families intends that the Bill on apprenticeships, children, schools and learners will also be the Bill from which will flow statutory guidance on children with autism. In that case, there will be statutory guidance on children and young people&#146;s plans&#151;not the adult side, but the children side&#151;that will flow from different legislation. That statutory guidance will spell out what is expected from local authorities in respect of children with autism when they draw up their children and young people&#146;s plans.</p>

In other words, will he confirm that he is giving his personal undertaking as a Minister of the Crown that he has already set out what he will deliver, notwithstanding anything we do with this Bill and whether or not it goes into Committee?

 If this Bill proceeds to Committee, I cannot say what effect that will have because we do not know what the outcome of the debate there will be, but what I can say is that all those measures that I have written to every Member about, and that I wish to repeat here at the Dispatch Box, are cross-Government policy&#151;they are what we wish to implement as a Government. I also have to say how inordinately proud I am to be the Minister of State for care services announcing these measures&#151;building on the success of the past, which I wish to refer to later&#151;and putting forward what I think will make 2009 a year of profound, massive and substantial advances in meeting, and developing services to meet, the needs of adults and children with autism, their families and their carers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o210"><a name="90227-0011.htm_para0"><a name="09022736000519">As a starting point, I want to describe an experience that made a great impression on me, and I hope it will have a similar effect on other Members. Several Members have spoken very eloquently about why the matters under discussion are important. Earlier this week, I visited an arts exhibition that showcased the winners of the National Autistic Society &#147;I Exist&#148; creativity competition&#151;various Members have referred to this excellent campaign. All the winners have work shown at the exhibition and they all deserve tremendous credit, but I was particularly struck by one image. It was a photograph by a gentleman called Danny, whom I was lucky enough to meet on the day. He is 48 and has Asperger&#146;s syndrome, and he is clearly a hugely talented photographer. His winning picture is truly exceptional. In the foreground, there are four children, all silhouetted, and partially shrouded by a thick mist so that it is not quite clear what is going on in the picture: are these children sheltering from something, or queuing, or playing? If we look closely, however, we can just make out other people in the background&#151;a group of adults, some of them so faint they look like ghosts in the swirls of the mist. The impression of this photograph is enigmatic, haunting, exotic and thoroughly mesmerising&#151;it is a brilliant piece of photography, and a deserving winner.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o211"><a name="90227-0011.htm_para1"><a name="09022736000520">However, what really hit home&#151;what knocked me for six, in fact&#151;was Danny&#146;s reply when I asked him what inspired him to take that shot. He said that the image summed up his life with autism. The photograph, by the way, is called &#147;Children in the mist&#148;, and that, for me, sums up why we need more action on autism. That is the human cry that I believe we must answer. We must bring people such as Danny out of the mist. We must provide new clarity, confidence and certainty to their lives. We must help them to escape the feelings of isolation and fear and the dislocation that that picture embodies. I am sure that no one in this House would disagree with that aim. It is what the hon. Lady&#146;s Bill seeks to achieve and that is entirely commendable, but the question is: what is the right way forward?</p>

The hon. Lady said that she was delighted and thrilled by those measures, and I am glad that she said that. I will go into them in more detail later, but let me give a summary of the measures as they stand.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o213"><a name="90227-0011.htm_para3"><a name="09022736000522">First, as I have said, new statutory guidance is promised for children and young people&#146;s plans that will specifically refer to children on the autistic spectrum, and which will flow from the enactment of the Apprenticeships, Skills, Children and Learning Bill. We want to create robust systems to ensure that data collected on children with autism are then shared with adult social services to bridge that transition gap. There will be extra resources&#151;an issue on which the hon. Member for Buckingham (John Bercow) pressed me. There will be &#163;200,000 to research the challenges faced by young people with autism in their transition to adulthood, and yes, we will of course make sure that those resources are spent on that task.</p>

 We will be spending that money this year. The hon. Gentleman can get further details on exactly when and how from my hon. Friend the Member for Portsmouth, North, who is responsible for that issue in the Department for Children, Schools and Families. That is an important area of expenditure for researching the challenges faced by young people with autism in their transition to adulthood.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o214"><a name="90227-0011.htm_para4"><a name="09022736000525">There will be extra funding next year for the Autism Education Trust&#151;a total of &#163;500,000 in 2009-10&#151;to promote better commissioning skills among local authorities and primary care trusts, particularly in the field of education. There is also funding&#151;&#163;300,000&#151;to research the prevalence of autism among adults. In answer to my hon. Friend the Member for Gateshead, East and Washington, West (Mrs. Hodgson) and others, we will be researching that prevalence because unless we have that information, how can we plan the way forward? In April, we will publish new commissioning guidance for PCTs and local authorities on the strategic planning of health and social care services to meet the needs of adults with autism. I make that point because of the importance that others have placed on the need to join up health and social care, making sure that the organisations are working together.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o215"><a name="90227-0011.htm_para5"><a name="09022736000526">In April, we will launch the consultation on a new national strategy for adults with autism. There will be four pillars of reform in that strategy. They have been developed not by the Government but by an expert external reference group to which other Members have referred, led by Mark Lever, the chief executive of the National Autistic Society. The four pillars of reform for adults with autism are, first, better specialist and mainstream health services, and secondly, tackling social exclusion, including employment. I will say more about how we go about that; some excellent examples were given earlier  <br>

of activities to help adults with autism get into voluntary and paid work. The third pillar is improved choice and control for adults with autism, not least through the much better personalising of services&#151;we discussed individual budgets and the value that they bring&#151;and the fourth is improving the skills and knowledge of the staff who work with adults with autism.</p>

<p><a name="st_o187"><a name="09022736000527"><a name="90227-0011.htm_spnew4"><a name="09022736001156"><b>Dr. Ladyman:</b>
 Surprisingly, the four pillars do not include law and order and the criminal justice system. Will my hon. Friend get hold of a copy of the Maryland curriculum, which is the programme used in the state of Maryland to train its courts and police officers, and send it to the Home Secretary and the Lord Chancellor? Will he ask them to use their powers to issue the same sort of guidance as he is talking about for the health services and social care to the people responsible for dealing with autistic people when they enter the criminal justice system?</p>

<p><a name="st_o188"><a name="09022736000528"><a name="90227-0011.htm_spnew5"><a name="09022736001157"><b>Phil Hope:</b>
 My hon. Friend has raised an excellent point. That goes to show that we need to have a big debate this summer as we roll out the national strategy. I dare say that members of the external reference group, who will be watching this debate and reading <i> Hansard</i> afterwards, will take into account both the plea that he has made about a possible further pillar of reform and his suggestion of what that pillar might be. The national debate will be a vital vehicle for taking forward exactly these kinds of contributions so that we have a strategy for autism that meets the needs of adults who have those experiences. The national external adviser we have appointed to help us, Elaine Hill, who is a very experienced person, is particularly concerned about what happens to those people with autism who end up in our criminal justice system as offenders. Their needs are not understood and they are in completely the wrong place to deal with the issues that they have to deal with in their lives. My hon. Friend is knocking on an open door, and I will ensure that his comments are drawn to the attention of the appropriate people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o216"><a name="90227-0011.htm_para6"><a name="09022736000529">The strategy and the pillars of reform for adults with autism are underpinned, as I said earlier, by statutory guidance under section 7 of the 1970 Act subject to consultation and assessment of benefits as we take through the development of that national strategy. We might have disagreements in this Chamber about which statutory footing to use, but I am convinced that this is the right way forward and I want to say more about that in a second.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o217"><a name="90227-0011.htm_para7"><a name="09022736000530">Strong leadership is needed to back all that up. It is vital that nationally, regionally and locally we drive forward the implementation of change. However, as has been asked, even with statutory guidance, is change actually delivered? It is vital that at every level we have people driving forward the action that we need to ensure that the good practice that we have heard about in the Chamber today is replicated around the country. I remind the House of our recent announcements about the delivery of plans and resources that will benefit children with autism through our new child health strategy, the review of our children and adolescent mental health services, our work on &#147;Aiming High for Disabled Children&#148; and better training and support for professionals in mainstream education.</p>

speech and those of other Members, not least that of the right hon. Member for West Dorset (Mr. Letwin), but I am still left with the impression that the proposals are not the best means of securing the outcome that I have been describing&#151;<i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> If hon. Members will allow me, I shall now say why I believe that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o219"><a name="90227-0011.htm_para9"><a name="09022736000532">We all know that legislation can be a very blunt and crude instrument for driving through change, especially when the end we seek is better awareness and better use of the expertise and resources that are already in the system. We need to preserve for councils the freedom and flexibility that they need to meet the complex web of local needs&#151;not to avoid them, but to meet those needs in ways that are relevant to them in their area. We need an approach that ensures appropriate and relevant action on autism in every area and that complements the ambitious work that is already under way across mental health and social care. I want to say more about that in a moment. We need to give local authorities the scope and skills that they need to zero in on the specific needs of people with autism.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o220"><a name="90227-0011.htm_para10"><a name="09022736000533">I shall make it clear later that we are not working from a standing start. Other Members have been kind enough to highlight examples of where the Government have made a difference.</p>

 I have had lengthy discussions with my local education authority, primary care trust and other agencies. Specifically on providing local information and more effective support, which is outlined in the Minister&#146;s document, they have told me that having that provision on a statutory footing would set an obligation on them that they would have to fulfil. At present, it is a voluntary matter.</p>

<p><a name="st_o190"><a name="09022736000535"><a name="90227-0011.htm_spnew7"><a name="09022736001159"><b>Phil Hope:</b>
 I agree&#151;the hon. Gentleman is absolutely correct. That is why we intend to issue statutory guidance for children and young people&#146;s plans as part of the apprenticeships Bill&#151;if I can use that shorthand. Statutory guidance will also flow from the national strategy for adults with autism, which we will launch in April.</p>

 That is certainly one approach that we could take, but people are asking for two things: a strategy that has bite and a debate to take place so that we can deal with all the details.

This Bill is dear to the hearts of not only my hon. Friend and many in the Chamber, but many of our constituents. I am thinking especially of the parents of the young people&#151;18 and 19-year-olds&#151;who have over the years regularly been sent unsolicited applications for credit cards and greater loans with absolutely no advice.

A survey in October by Which? showed that 46 per cent. of respondents had been sent unsolicited credit card cheques in the past. These cheques tend to have higher APRs and handling fees and offer less favourable repayment conditions, and they are often targeted at the most vulnerable consumers.</p>

 I thank the hon. Gentleman for his intervention.

However, the issue of unsolicited credit charge cheques remains. Unlike credit cards, these cheques are not subject to protection under section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974. Individuals have found, to their great cost, that as well as interest rate levels being much higher, the interest kicks in as from the time that the cheque is cashed.</p>

 Does the hon.

People who are already in difficulties over credit card payments are finding the situation absolutely intolerable. Will he want to cover that in his Bill if it gets into Committee, if it ever does?</p>

That is permitted under the banking code, but the result of a Which? survey in October showed that 58 per cent. of respondents had had their credit card limit increased without even requesting it. That can, regrettably, lead to unaffordable amounts of credit being made available to consumers.</p>

 My hon. Friend has done the House a real service in introducing this Bill, because it plugs an important gap, even if it is a little late for some who have got themselves into debt. The answer to the question he was asked is that we do not really know, because when credit limits are extended, people might nibble at them a bit at a time, rather than using all the money in one big hit. One of the risks is that people may drift into spending more than they can afford a bit at a time, without realising that they are getting themselves into a mess.</p>

 My hon. Friend is absolutely correct. People tend to escalate into levels of debt. Not everyone goes out, has one massive splurge of purchasing items and winds up in debt they cannot afford.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o234"><a name="90227-0012.htm_para3"><a name="09022736000730">The provisions dealing with unsecured loans in clause 2 are there because it is important that individuals who are taking out loans recognise, if they are home owners, that there is a potential for court action under the Charging Orders Act 1979, which may result in their ending up in court and thereafter having to sell their property to make up for debts that have become unaffordable. The courts in England and Wales in 2007 showed a tenfold increase since 2000&#151;97,000 charging orders were made during that period. The method of calculating interest rates is a complex issue that confuses most consumers. I would dearly like something to be done through this Bill to standardise that process.</p>

 I do not know whether the hon. Gentleman is about to finish, but he has not mentioned credit unions, unless I have missed something. I am seeking to set up branches of credit unions in my constituency precisely for the reasons that lie behind a lot of his thinking. Credit unions offer those who can least afford extravagant interest rate arrangements the opportunity to avoid loan sharks, and to live a reasonable and fair life with very modest amounts of money passing one way or the other.</p>

<p><a name="st_o211"><a name="09022736000735"><a name="90227-0012.htm_spnew13"><a name="09022736001340"><b>Mr. Mark Prisk (Hertford and Stortford) (Con):</b>
 I begin by commending the hon. Member for Dumfries and Galloway (Mr. Brown) for introducing the Bill and for the way in which he did so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o235"><a name="90227-0012.htm_para4"><a name="09022736000736">As we have heard, the Bill is intended to address one of the most important and, I suspect, long-lasting problems that this country faces, namely debt. Personal debt is now more significant here than in any other major economy. Estimated as standing at, I believe, &#163;1.4 trillion, it is now larger than the UK&#146;s entire gross domestic product. Of course, the Government themselves have been borrowing and spending recklessly, leaving us with a national debt in excess of &#163;1 trillion. During the good years, they failed to prepare for the downturn, and as we know, the result is a burden that will fall on us and on future generations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o236"><a name="90227-0012.htm_para5"><a name="09022736000737">The Bill addresses one aspect of personal debt, namely credit card debt. I know that many Members will, like me, have seen appalling instances of individuals finding themselves with dreadful debts that they have no prospect of clearing. Whether those debts came through momentary weakness or, on occasion, financial ignorance, people are beginning to realise just how burdensome consumer credit card debt can be.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o237"><a name="90227-0012.htm_para6"><a name="09022736000738">Although individual borrowers are primarily responsible for the situation in which they find themselves, the hon. Gentleman is right to highlight the responsibilities of the credit card industry. Sharp practice must be identified and tackled effectively. That is why, a few weeks ago, my party set out a clear plan of action that mirrors many of his concerns. For example, our approach would include the provision of a free national financial advice service, funded by the financial services sector. We would also clarify and improve the standard of information provided for credit card customers and end excessive store card interest rates. Those measures would be part of a package that would relate to many of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s points. Essentially, they would be about informing, empowering and protecting the consumer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o238"><a name="90227-0012.htm_para7"><a name="09022736000739">That is why the Opposition will not seek to oppose the Bill. We share many of the concerns of its sponsors, but I say to the hon. Gentleman that we are not yet convinced that, as currently drafted, it is necessarily the right way forward. I shall give a couple of examples of  <br>

why that is the case. First, it would ban unsolicited credit card cheques and unsolicited increases in credit limits. That aim is laudable, but my concern is that that would not necessarily tackle the fundamental problem. Inevitably, the unscrupulous would find other ways to entice people to borrow. If we are to deal with the fundamental problem, we need to address the reason why some people make bad borrowing decisions. After all, when there is an unsolicited increase in credit limit, not everybody uses it, at least according to the evidence that I have seen. Only some people spend the extra money. Sadly, as the hon. Gentleman said, it is often those who can least afford to do so. To really help, we need to ensure that people are better informed so that they can learn to borrow within their means.</p>

<p><a name="st_o212"><a name="09022736000740"><a name="90227-0012.htm_spnew14"><a name="09022736001341"><b>Mr. Cash:</b>
 My hon. Friend will have heard my comments about the proposed European regulatory arrangements and my concerns about them, which I set out in a letter to the <i> Financial Times </i>today. In line with our party policy, will he reaffirm that the sort of arrangement that we are discussing should be kept in the framework of Westminster legislation, as the shadow Chancellor and the shadow Economic Secretary have said, and not be subsumed into European legislation? Does he agree that we should ensure that the House retains its supremacy?</p>

 Absolutely. I make a habit of never disagreeing with the shadow Chancellor. I am sure that he is right about the issue, and I am happy to confirm that for my hon. Friend.</p>

The Bill targets the right outcome. Transparency of information is vital so that people understand the exact consequences of their actions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o240"><a name="90227-0012.htm_para9"><a name="09022736000743">Clause 3 deals with the standard method of calculating interest rates on credit cards. There is undoubtedly a bewildering range of different interest rates and terms, and consumers need help. However, I am not convinced that Whitehall&#146;s determining a single methodology would prove practical. Indeed, it could restrict innovation and consumer choice. The Bill needs to be careful: it is one thing to provide for standardisation and transparency, but we would be worried about a narrowly prescriptive measure.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o241"><a name="90227-0012.htm_para10"><a name="09022736000744">The Bill rightly tries to tackle the problem of credit card debt, and we share the promoter&#146;s concerns, but we have reservations and believe that the measure has missed an opportunity to deal with financial information. Perhaps the Minister will deal with that important point in his response. We will not oppose the measure, which deserves further parliamentary consideration. We look forward to participating in that process to help those in debt and empower consumers generally.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o243"><a name="90227-0012.htm_para12"><a name="09022736000747">The Government believe that the provisions are compatible with the European convention on human rights.

I welcome my hon. Friend&#146;s commitment to work with us on the detail, so that we would consequently be happy for the Bill to make progress.</p>

<p><a name="st_o215"><a name="09022736000748"><a name="90227-0012.htm_spnew16"><a name="09022736001344"><b>Mr. Cash:</b>
 The Minister may know what I am about to say, but I shall say it none the less. Does he agree that the proposals in the De Larosière report and the European Commission proposals, which will come forward next week, to regulate the whole banking and financial services sectors at European level&#151;it is proposed to implement them and put them into legal form between the end of this year and 2011&#151;are completely alien to the way in which we should legislate in this House, on our own terms? Does he agree that it would be disastrous for the City of London, for financial services, and indeed for the Bill, if we allowed that to happen?</p>

<p><a name="st_o216"><a name="09022736000749"><a name="90227-0012.htm_spnew17"><a name="09022736001345"><b>Mr. Thomas:</b>
 I am sure that the hon. Gentleman understands that those matters are for my colleagues in the Treasury, and that Ministers who tread on the Treasury&#146;s turf do so at their peril. However, I agree with him that the matters that we are debating today are in the House&#146;s purview, and I hope that will support me and others to make progress.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o244"><a name="90227-0012.htm_para13"><a name="09022736000750">Let me try to deal with the specific issues that hon. Members have raised. Clause 1 deals with unsolicited credit card cheques. As my hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries and Galloway has noted, there are a number of concerns about the use of such cheques. They are usually sent to consumers unrequested, tempting them into spending that they might not be able to afford. Such cheques typically carry a fee and a higher rate of interest. There is now worrying evidence that, rather than borrowing for what is referred to in the jargon as &#147;discretionary purposes&#148;, consumers are using such cheques for essential expenditure and to deal with cash-flow shortfalls. In the light of that evidence, the Government welcome the measures proposed by my hon. Friend.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o245"><a name="90227-0012.htm_para14"><a name="09022736000751">Clause 1 also refers to unsolicited limit increases. It seems clear that the ease of access associated with credit that is granted automatically offers greater scope for irresponsible borrowing than credit for which customers must actively apply. Unfortunately, some consumers will take the view that since the lender has offered a limit, it must be affordable and within their means. It is right that we should seek to protect them from that risk. However, I should make it clear to the House that we have not held the usual period of consultation on the matter. The Government would therefore seek amendments to the Bill as drafted to take powers to address the issue in secondary legislation, once consultation had occurred. That is consistent with the approach to regulation taken in the Consumer Credit Act 2006 and would allow a proper period of consultation and analysis.</p>

Friend has given expression this afternoon, that home owners may not realise that defaulting on an unsecured loan could eventually lead to the forced sale of the family home. I am therefore supportive of the principle that underpins clause 2. However, we are already able to take such a step through existing legislative powers, so primary legislation is not required.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o247"><a name="90227-0012.htm_para16"><a name="09022736000753">We will soon be amending many of the statutory information requirements relating to consumer credit agreements, when we implement the new European consumer credit directive. The Government will consult later in the spring on our proposals on how to transpose that directive. I propose to consult then on whether to require warnings about charging orders to be part of that exercise. In the light of that, we should like to encourage my hon. Friend to withdraw the relevant provisions, should the House grant the Bill a Second Reading.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o248"><a name="90227-0012.htm_para17"><a name="09022736000754">Clause 3 deals with the standard interest rate calculation methods, which my hon. Friend also talked about. He will know that the issue was raised in a super-complaint to the Office of Fair Trading which resulted in an extensive market study. In its final report in February 2008, the OFT rejected the proposal that had been made. Therefore, the issue has been considered recently and I am not aware of any new evidence that has been presented. In the light of that, the Government cannot support that provision. Measures are being taken to strengthen consumers&#146; ability to make an effective comparison among credit cards and products, so that they can shop around with confidence.</p>

 From what the Minister is saying, it seems that he wants a complete re-write of clause 1, in order to make the power a provisional power, and that he wants clause 2 to be considered further and brought back sometime in the spring in some form as determined by the Government. He is saying that he wants the Bill to go through, but not in any recognisable form. That does not seem entirely fair to the Bill&#146;s promoter, whose original intention I support.</p>

 With all due respect, the hon. Gentleman is being slightly unfair in his description of what the Government are seeking to do. We support the principles underlying the Bill.

 I start from a disadvantage, in not having any notes to explain fully what the Bill is about.

 The stone age did not end because of a lack of stone, and the oil age will end long before the world runs out of oil. In fact, the oil age is clearly already coming to a close, and three things have precipitated that. First, we have either just arrived at, or, as is more likely, just passed peak oil&#151;the point on the Hubbard curve at which the maximum rate of global production has been reached. Secondly, and directly related to that, is the challenge of climate change and the need to stabilise average global temperatures to no more than a 2° celsias rise. Although the report produced by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in 2007 equated that with a concentration of 450 parts per million of CO2 equivalent in the atmosphere, more recent research from our own Hadley centre and NASA&#146;s Goddard institute suggests that that might be over-optimistic. That has led the European Commission, in its January communiqu&#233; on a post-2012 framework for the spring Environment Ministers Council, to suggest that a 350 ppm CO2 equivalent stabilisation target might be better.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o263"><a name="90227-0013.htm_para11"><a name="09022736000778">The third factor is political risk. This is what some people call security of supply, but it is effectively the political risk to which Governments are so acutely sensitive, owing to the fact that they are unable to control a resource that is essential to their economy functioning well. Energy is the lifeblood of the economic body, and the moment it stops flowing is the point at which the economic body begins to die. Perhaps the most striking example of the effect of the convergence of those three factors came earlier this week, when Stephen Tindale, a former head of Greenpeace, announced his conversion to the need for a new generation of nuclear energy plants in the UK.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o264"><a name="90227-0013.htm_para12"><a name="09022736000779">I should make it clear that I am not in any way suggesting that the world is about to run out of oil. The International Energy Agency would suggest that there are enough proven and probable reserves of conventional oil left to supply the world with oil for a further 40 years at current levels of consumption. That is about 2.4 trillion barrels over and above the 1.1 trillion barrels that the world has produced so far. Beyond that, it makes sense to account for new discoveries of fields as yet unknown and for oil sands and oil shales, along with coal to liquids and gas to liquids, which, combined with extra-heavy oil, could account for a further 9 trillion barrels, although at significantly increased production costs, ranging from $50 to $115 a barrel.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o265"><a name="90227-0013.htm_para13"><a name="09022736000780">None the less, the IEA outlook predicts annual production decline from now on, at a rate of 6.7 per cent. It is important to realise that there are significant limiting factors apart from price. We do not seem to be discovering significant new fields quickly enough. Data on existing reserves are suspect, particularly in the middle east, and depletion rates may be more rapid than some Governments are prepared to admit. Unconventional resources such as ocean floor or Arctic oil shales are proving technically more difficult as well as more expensive to develop.</p>

As global supply is projected to fall from 80 million to 40 million barrels a day by 2030, while global demand is projected to rise to 104 million barrels a day, the shortfall of 64 million barrels is the equivalent of finding six new Saudi Arabias. No doubt in such an scenario, an oilfield or two in the cupboard might prove very profitable for the lucky children. On the other hand, King Abdullah&#146;s children will need these resources like a hole in the head, as their release is the equivalent of injecting an extra 13 gigatonnes of greenhouse gas emissions a year into the atmosphere in 2030&#151;at a time when to stay within our stabilisation targets, we should be achieving a 17-gigatonne-a-year abatement instead. That abatement would be required simply to achieve our 450 ppm target. The 350 ppm target would require reductions far in excess of that level.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o268"><a name="90227-0013.htm_para16"><a name="09022736000783">Oil, of course, is comparatively benign in comparison with coal, and the increase in coal generation is perhaps the single most acute threat that we can predict with some certainty. It is calculated that more than a third of the total 45 per cent. expansion in world energy demands by 2030 will be supplied by coal. Unless carbon capture and storage can be put in place for all new coal-fired power stations within the next five to eight years, that expansion of coal alone would make it highly unlikely that we could prevent dangerous climate change.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o269"><a name="90227-0013.htm_para17"><a name="09022736000784">The Minister knows as well as I do that the current state of CCS technology and the reluctance to invest in it make this potential sequestration route about as reliable as a derivatives banker in a bull market. In her response, I ask my hon. Friend to outline the current time scale on which UK CCS might be rolled out, according to her Department&#146;s best estimates.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o270"><a name="90227-0013.htm_para18"><a name="09022736000785">Because of the very different rates of emissions that different fuels produce per unit of electricity, I ask my hon. Friend to establish a carbon priority in UK energy policy that would give precedence to lower-carbon fuels and back that up with an appropriate structure of incentives and penalties. I understand the transport premium that oil commands, but she knows that in electricity generation, the ratio between coal, oil and gas is that for every 10 emissions from coal, there are seven from oil and only five from gas. Surely it cannot be right for Government policy to take account only of the financial costs of these different generating methods, and ignore the environmental costs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o271"><a name="90227-0013.htm_para19"><a name="09022736000786">Naturally, I am amazed that significant further investment of Government resources is not being put into the very lowest carbon and renewable technologies. The Government&#146;s stated position is that they will not in any way subsidise the new generation of nuclear facilities that this country so desperately needs over the next 15 years simply to replace older stations coming offstream at the end of their production line. That shows a level of complacency that would have qualified any Minister for a seat on the board of RBS over the past few years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o272"><a name="90227-0013.htm_para20"><a name="09022736000787">To meet the UK&#146;s increasing energy demands, we need not simply to replace existing power stations, but to install many more new ones. The Government rightly,   <br>

but not yet adequately, incentivise renewable technologies such as wind and marine power. It is illogical to refuse to do the same for nuclear. That must change. I look forward to hearing my hon. Friend&#146;s response on that particular point.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o273"><a name="90227-0013.htm_para21"><a name="09022736000788">No Member would expect me to speak about energy and climate change without mentioning the essential role that trees and forestry can play in leading the world out of the environmental problems that it faces. Those who are familiar with the McKinsey global abatement cost curve will know that it has identified an abatement potential of 19 GT. What is extraordinary is that of that total, which includes insulation, technological efficiencies, carbon capture and storage and literally hundreds of other components, forest mitigation alone accounts for a massive 6 GT. Most of that forest mitigation comes at a very attractive average price, lower than &#8364;15 per tonne. All the forest-based opportunities will have to be taken if the world is to reach even its 450 ppm target.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o274"><a name="90227-0013.htm_para22"><a name="09022736000789">The Government have a wood fuel strategy for England. I know that because I was the Minister who produced it. However, it is one thing to have a strategy and quite another to have a programme. The Minister will be aware that the biomass currently available in under-managed broadleaf and conifer woodlands in England is respectively 2.7 and 1.5 million tonnes. If even half that available biomass were incorporated in a wood fuel programme, it would save the United Kingdom the equivalent of 3.6 million barrels of crude oil every year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o275"><a name="90227-0013.htm_para23"><a name="09022736000790">According to the Government&#146;s own cost-benefit analysis, a pump-priming investment of approximately &#163;120 million&#151;million, not billion&#151;over eight years would show a return of approximately &#163;70 million in carbon benefit during that initial pump-priming period. Thereafter, the benefits over costs would grow to an estimated &#163;35 million each year in savings to the economy. Those figures relate to just half the biomass that we know to be currently available. They do not include the potential for plantation of new woodlands managed for biomass, or even the potential of using sawmill co-product. Significantly, they do not even include what is known as &#147;arboricultural arisings&#148;&#151;the wood that comes from tree pruning and safety operations by highways authorities, 68 per cent. of which currently goes to landfill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o276"><a name="90227-0013.htm_para24"><a name="09022736000791">Given those added sources of biomass, in less than 10 years Britain could have a wood fuel industry that saved it hundreds of millions of pounds and approximately 10 million barrels of crude oil each and every year. That would also improve the biodiversity of much of the woodland in the country. If used strategically, it could also create migration corridors allowing species to adapt to the climate change that is already in the system, as well as a wonderful human resource of rest and relaxation. I ask my hon. Friend to ensure that the Department starts turning that strategy into a programme as soon as possible.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o277"><a name="90227-0013.htm_para25"><a name="09022736000792">My intention in recommending a move from a global to a small-scale national programme is to make one essential point. Just as the enormous scale of the global challenge that faces us is not unitary, with peak oil, climate change, population growth to 9 billion by 2050 all combining to create the problems of unsustainability, the nature of the responses that we put into effect must not be unitary. The creation of my hon. Friend&#146;s Department was a welcome step forward in Government, bringing together old adversaries from the Department  <br>

of Trade and Industry and the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and cementing them into allies, but in my view it failed to identify the real focus of the problem that we need to tackle.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o278"><a name="90227-0013.htm_para26"><a name="09022736000793">The Department is called &#147;Energy and Climate Change&#148;, and my hon. Friend lost her old title of Minister for biodiversity when she was transferred to it. It would have been far better for her to bring it with her. The real crisis is one of biodiversity and ecosystems failure, not of climate change. Let me emphasise that, in and of itself, climate change would not matter. The real problem is that biodiversity cannot keep pace with the rate of change, and as a result biodiversity is depleted and ecosystems break down. It is the loss of biodiversity, along with the loss of the ecosystem services that it provides, that represents the real threat to human well-being.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o279"><a name="90227-0013.htm_para27"><a name="09022736000794">The economics of biodiversity and ecosystems is a new and difficult enterprise for politicians. We are struggling to identify the true nature of value as we broaden the concept of capital to include not just social capital and human capital, but natural capital. Today, most of the benefits provided to our civilisation by ecosystem services bypass the marketplace, escaping the pricing mechanism, and they are therefore lost to the political and economic process as a mere externality. This inability to capture the value of ecosystem services is the acutest market failure in our world today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o280"><a name="90227-0013.htm_para28"><a name="09022736000795">My hon. Friend the Minister would perhaps laugh if I told her that I had put off upgrading my mobile phone for the past 16 months because a little girl was stung by a jellyfish on a beach in Devon in 2007. However, it is the growing demand for the latest mobile phone that has made coltan so valuable. Mining for this resource has fuelled the conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo and central Africa. That conflict has led to deforestation. This has seen the loss of habitat and a reduction of forest mammals. That has resulted in an increased demand for an alternative animal protein. That has seen the depletion of high-trophic fish stocks. That has resulted in fishing down the food chain. That has led to blooms of jellyfish, which have replaced fish as the dominant planktivores. And that has resulted in the beaches of south-west England being invaded by jellyfish.</p>

Governments around the globe still have mechanisms of intervention and engagement that are segregated and compartmentalised. We have a Department for the environment and a separate Department for international development, when it is clear that it is impossible to achieve the millennium development goals without securing the ecosystem services that provide the poorest 1.4 billion people on this planet with 50 per cent. of their GDP. We have a Treasury that understands over-leveraging of companies and credit bubbles, but that cannot see a connection with a world population consuming resources that the planet takes one year and four months to renew or replace, and a Treasury that refuses to put a value on ecosystem services and sees value only in the context of financial markets.</p>

 I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Brent, North (Barry Gardiner) on what was an absolutely fascinating speech. It was wide-ranging, and I can say both that I agree very much with what he said about biodiversity and that my thinking does cross all Departments. I believe that the Government are beginning to accept the imperative of looking at biodiversity and ecosystem services and that value is being placed on them. Perhaps I should also add that I, too, have resisted having a new mobile phone, and for similar reasons&#151;although my phone is now becoming so poor that I have managed to miss a few messages from the Whips Office, so I suspect it will have to be replaced.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o283"><a name="90227-0013.htm_para31"><a name="09022736000799">The objective of our Government energy policy is to deliver affordable, secure and clean energy to UK businesses and consumers. In order to ensure security of supply now and into the future, the Department of Energy and Climate Change monitors potential risks to supply. Clearly, one potential threat to UK energy security is that the global supply of oil is not sufficient to meet future demand. There is a wide range of views as to why oil supplies may become insufficient, including geological constraints, insufficient investment, political instability and resource nationalism.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o284"><a name="90227-0013.htm_para32"><a name="09022736000800">Typically, the risk that oil supplies will run out due to geological constraints is characterised as peak oil. To monitor this risk, DECC looks at a wide range of academic and industry studies that analyse future world oil supplies. DECC also meets experts to discuss this and other oil market issues, including investment in and exploitation of new oil reserves. However, assessing peak oil is extremely complicated due to limited data and the importance of assumptions made about future developments in the energy sector. Consequently, risk assessments vary widely by source. We look at the different sources, but we do not estimate the timing of peak oil production ourselves. We realise that a number of factors influence the balance of supply and demand of crude oil, and that these are not limited to the amount of available recoverable conventional oil resources. They also include the global demand for oil in the future, access to and investment in the development of existing resources, and technological progress that may allow us to extract more oil from current sources.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o285"><a name="90227-0013.htm_para33"><a name="09022736000801">My hon. Friend quoted the International Energy Agency and he is correct, in that its most recent report states that</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o287"><a name="90227-0014.htm_para0"><a name="09022736000803">This is based on a detailed analysis of, among other things, 580 of the world&#146;s largest oil fields, but the IEA also recognises&#151;again, as my hon. Friend has said&#151;that decline rates in maturing fields will increase, and that large investments are needed to make up the decline at existing fields. It estimates that total investment of $6.3 trillion might be needed on oil supply infrastructure between 2007 and 2030. Thus the IEA takes the view that it is not the level of oil reserves but of investment in production that is the more serious risk to future oil supplies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o288"><a name="90227-0014.htm_para1"><a name="09022736000804">Like the IEA, the Government have always recognised that additional investment will be required to meet oil demand in the future, and that the challenge lies in bringing these resources to market in a way that ensures sustainable, timely, reliable and affordable supplies of energy. We recognise that having oil reserves is only a start, and that converting these reserves into a global energy supply is fraught with challenges.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o289"><a name="90227-0014.htm_para2"><a name="09022736000805">We are aware of the increased need to reduce barriers to timely and adequate investment in the oil sector. Having recognised those barriers, the Government used the London energy meeting in December as an opportunity for consumer and producer nations to discuss these issues. In particular, the transparency of global oil markets, the need for investments in production and the impacts of the financial crisis on future energy supply were discussed. At the meeting, participants emphasised the importance of stable and transparent investment regimes and agreed to work collaboratively to reduce barriers to investment. Participants also discussed the potential for innovative technologies to enable more efficient and effective use of energy resources. So we are not complacent about energy security.</p>

Friend the Member for Croydon, North (Malcolm Wicks) to review international energy security, and he may wish to include within his review consideration of supply and demand in the oil markets. Secondly, we are already putting in place policies that will reduce the energy intensity of the UK economy and help to increase its resilience to shocks in energy supplies. It is a fact that the UK is one of the least energy intensive countries in the G7.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o291"><a name="90227-0014.htm_para4"><a name="09022736000807">My hon. Friend raised with me, quite properly, the threat of climate change from continuing use of fossil fuels, so let me address alternative technologies and energy efficiency. Tackling climate change and ensuring a secure supply of affordable energy are the key goals of our energy policy. Increasing our use of renewable energy is an essential part of our strategy for meeting those goals.</p>

The Government are therefore working towards improving efficiency in the transport sector and within the 2020 EU package to achieve a target of 10 per cent. renewable transport fuels by 2020. The Government are also keen to promote the uptake of new technologies when they arrive and, as part of the recent announcements on transport strategy, we made a commitment of &#163;250 million to deliver consumer incentives to promote electric vehicles.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o296"><a name="90227-0014.htm_para9"><a name="09022736000814">My hon. Friend asked in particular about carbon capture and storage. The timetable is that we expect to have a demonstration project operational by 2014 and that we want to see commercially viable CCS in this country by 2020. Indeed, a European programme will assist with that. We are also considering additional policies that will take us from demonstration to deployment.</p>

Friend&#146;s point about nuclear, I think that he is very aware, as he suggested, that the legislation has been designed and passed in such a way that it does not create a Government subsidy for the industry. That has obviously been done because the Government believe that the industry will progress and that it will do so on a commercial basis. Of course, that is the assurance that the companies have given over time.</p>
