 The Secretary of State will have seen the report from the Institute for Public Policy Research only last week which shows that there are still 1.4 million children in households in poverty&#151;the same figure as 10 years ago&#151;and that there are 200,000 more households with children in poverty than there were 10 years ago. Given that failure over 10 years, and the fact that the target date for the Government&#146;s goal is only two years hence, what is being done to ensure that the Government target not only those in families with no work, but those who may have someone in the household in work but for whom the benefits reduction means that they are trapped in a position as bad, if not worse, than before?</p>

 As the hon.

The hon. Gentleman is right to press me on that, and we shall address the issue with couple parents, especially whether it is worth the while of the second parent to work. I remind him of what we are doing in London, which affects his constituents. We are rolling out the in-work credit, which will be increased to &#163;60 for lone parents for the first year to encourage them to go into work. We know that the child of a lone parent out of work is five times more likely to be in poverty than the child of one in work. We are extending child care, and we are making sure that couple parents also have access to the new deal. So we are addressing the issues, especially in London, but we have more work to do. However, we have made massive progress, compared with what we inherited.</p>

Some 600,000 children are already out of poverty and another 300,000 will be lifted out by policies that we have recently announced.

However, we may still have a real problem for many two-parent families who are in work and poor, because the formula does not take account of the second adult in the household. Now that my right hon.

However, as my right hon. Friend said, we are light years away from the situation we inherited. We would have been in dire circumstances if we had continued the old Conservative policies.</p>

 As I have just explained to the House, including the hon. Gentleman, if he looks at what we are doing compared with the policies that would have been implemented if his party had stayed in power, he will see increasing numbers of children coming out of poverty. More and more parents are getting work, with a higher employment rate and a lower benefit level than under the Conservatives. That is the trajectory we are set on, and we are reforming all the time to make sure that we deal with some of the bottlenecks that have been in place for a long time.</p>

 My hon. Friend is absolutely right. Under our Bill, employers will for the first time be required to contribute to workers&#146; pensions. The employee will contribute 4 per cent., the employer 3 per cent., and the tax system about 1 per cent. We estimate that more than 1 million workers who are already saving will see their employer&#146;s contribution raised as a result, and millions more who have no occupational pension scheme will get the benefit of an employer&#146;s contribution. Overall, annual pension contributions from employees and employers are estimated to increase by about &#163;10 billion by 2015.</p>

 For the new personal accounts to be successful, those on lower than average earnings will need to be persuaded that it is in their interests to invest in the new pensions. If they are not so persuaded, there is a danger that they will opt out, and that the whole system, and the benefits that it is supposed to bring, will collapse. The Pensions Minister himself said today that there was an issue in that respect; what can he say today to allay fears that those on lower than average earnings may opt out, and that the system may be fundamentally weakened?</p>

 I can reassure the hon.

 I share with my hon. Friend and the TUC the objective that this should not be artificial job substitution. It must lead to a full-time job, and I am grateful to the TUC for the representations it made during the consultation on the Green Paper. Employers offer work trials genuinely to try to fill available vacancies, and the trials often open up full-time jobs for disadvantaged peoples, especially those on benefits. They often last only a few weeks, and we have put in place protections,  <br>

 The test of success or otherwise of local employment partnerships is not the number of employers the Government sign up but the number of people whom those partnerships get back into work. How many people have got back into work so far as a result of local employment partnerships?</p>

 We have only just started, but only last Wednesday I met a company with the Prime Minister in Marylebone jobcentre that recruited 147 people when it opened a retail business. Those people came straight off benefit as a result of the local employment partnership. I have talked to Tesco, which is opening new stores around the country, and is doing exactly the same thing. It sees a win-win situation: employers can get people straight off benefit, and British benefit claimants take up British jobs to become British workers. It is win-win for society, and it is win-win for employers as well, as partnerships have proved to be extremely popular in filling job vacancies. There are about 660,000 job vacancies in Britain, and we want people to come off benefit to fill them. Local employment partnerships will help us to achieve that.</p>

 The Secretary of State has just talked about filling job vacancies with British workers.

How does abolishing part of the resident labour market test help British workers to find British jobs?</p>

We are seeking to make sure that local employers try to get people off benefits and into work. The issue that the hon. Gentleman raised has nothing to do with that objective.

 I thank my hon. Friend for his answer. He will be aware that there are more than 20,000 members of the Glasgow credit union in Glasgow; it is one of our successes. However, there are still 2 million people in the country without a bank account. The Association of British Credit Unions is asking for more calling points throughout the country. Given the planned closures of post offices throughout the country, particularly in Glasgow at this time, access to credit union facilities will be reduced. Will my hon.

He will also know that there have been post office branch closures in the past four years; however, during that period, 800,000 more people have gained access to basic banking services.

Is it better for them to pay interest of 1,000 per cent. on their loan or to take out a much more affordable form of credit from their local credit union?

In his constituency, as elsewhere, whether in Wales, Scotland, England or Northern Ireland, people are being paid benefits more quickly than at any time in recent years. The number of outstanding claims has reduced significantly over the past year. I am pleased to say that today we have a record number of people going into work, and the numbers of people on all the main out-of-work benefits, whether income support, jobseeker&#146;s allowance or incapacity benefit, are falling, as are the numbers of new claimants of those benefits. Clearly, in a period of change&#151;certainly over the past 10 years&#151;we have tightened procedures. We expect more people who can work to work; that sometimes creates complaints as well.

 I thank my hon. Friend for his contribution and for his warm remarks about the services in his local area. We are seeing huge improvements across the Jobcentre Plus service. Anybody who compared walking into a Jobcentre Plus establishment today with doing so 10 or 15 years ago could only comment on how professional, modern and user-friendly it is. Yes, we have looked to centralise benefit delivery services, because we want to make best use of technology and to have better standards of best practice across the piece. That also allows us to consider how face-to-face interactions can better be served, whether in Jobcentre Plus, a children&#146;s centre or a community centre. I encourage our regional managers to engage with their local authority partners, employers, the voluntary sector and local communities to see how best that service can be provided, and I hope that we can give them greater flexibility to do just that.</p>

 I thank the Minister for that reply. The new deal plus pilot project for lone parents in Cardiff and the Vale has been successful in not only getting lone parents into work but sustaining them there. One of the key elements has been benefits such as the &#163;300 in-work benefit, which can help lone parents to stay in a job and assist with, for example, child care, which is many working parents&#146; nightmare. What does my hon. Friend propose to do to extend that sort of benefit more universally?</p>

 I thank my hon. Friend for her question. The number of lone parents who claim in her constituency has fallen by 39 per cent. since 1997 compared with a national drop of 25 per cent. I therefore give due credit to those who work on the matter locally for her constituents.</p>

We are considering the way in which we extend the right to flexible working for parents of older children. The human resource director of Sainsbury&#146;s, Imelda Walsh, has undertaken that review. We are also considering much more closely earlier skills assessment of lone parents&#151;when they come on to income support&#151;regardless of whether they receive jobseeker&#146;s allowance or income support. The vacuum in their skills and basic education often inhibits lone parents. Again, we are providing support on several different fronts, but, as I said earlier, from next autumn parents whose youngest child is 12 will be expected to move on to jobseeker&#146;s allowance. That is right because it is a something for something approach to our welfare system and the right mixture of rights and responsibilities.</p>

Both countries face violence and terrorism, and both are undergoing political transition. They are working to embed democratic systems and structures, but struggling to overcome the tribal or dynastic allegiances which have fed personality politics.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o12"><a name="80107-0003.htm_para6"><a name="0801075000143">In these circumstances, there is a temptation to turn away. However, there are 800,000 British people of Pakistani origin; there are an estimated 13,000 British citizens resident in Kenya, and over a quarter of a million British tourists visiting each year; the United Kingdom is Kenya's largest foreign investor, and our bilateral trade with Pakistan is worth some &#163;1 billion; and, of course, both Pakistan and Kenya are key partners in the fight against al-Qaeda. That is why the Government are committed to using all their assets to help those countries on the path to peaceful and prosperous development.</p>

There is cross-party condemnation in this House of terrorism and a determination to stand with the people of Pakistan against the power of the bomb and the bullet, and I welcome that.</p>

The target of her assassins is all those committed to democracy in Pakistan and it is vital that they do not succeed. The courage shown by Mrs. Bhutto is now required of others as they take forward the drive for democracy and modernisation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o16"><a name="80107-0004.htm_para1"><a name="0801075000147">The second priority is to promote free and fair elections. The delay in the elections as a result of the assassination is regrettable but the period between now and 18 February needs to be used to build confidence in the democratic process. When I spoke to the House on 7 November, I made clear my conviction that democracy and the rule of law were allies of stability and development in Pakistan. Since then, President Musharraf has retired from the military. He has lifted the state of emergency. Almost all political prisoners have been released and most media restrictions have been rescinded. But more needs to be done, and we have continued to stress the Pakistani Government's responsibility to create a level playing field under which credible and transparent elections can take place. This means that all remaining political detainees need to be released and the remaining restrictions on the media must be lifted.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o17"><a name="80107-0004.htm_para2"><a name="0801075000148">In my last telephone call with Mrs. Bhutto on 9 December, I pledged that the UK would work on the details of the election process. In recent days, the Prime Minister has discussed the elections on three separate occasions with President Musharraf. I have also spoken to interim Pakistani Foreign Minister ul-Haque. We continue to call on the Government of Pakistan to improve the prospects for credible elections, particularly by increasing transparency, both now and on election day itself. This includes setting out clearly and early where all of the approximately 54,000 polling stations will be, posting the results for each station publicly immediately after the count and ensuring that the media's ability to report is untrammelled.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o18"><a name="80107-0004.htm_para3"><a name="0801075000149">I am glad that the EU is now working to put together a full-scale election observation mission. I understand that the American International Republican Institute mission may also be reinstated. I believe that the Commonwealth can make an important, positive contribution and I hope that Pakistan will decide to invite an observer mission.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o19"><a name="80107-0004.htm_para4"><a name="0801075000150">Our third priority is further to improve counter-terrorism co-operation. The deadly attack on Benazir Bhutto shows terrorism to be a threat to Pakistan, not just to the west. Over the last year, hundreds of innocent civilians have been killed in shootings and suicide bomb attacks in that country. We have reiterated the UK Government's commitment to build on the already significant counter-terrorism support that we provide to Pakistan. A team of cross-Government UK experts will travel to Pakistan next week for further consultations. This will be a precursor to a further British visit to deepen our counter-terrorism relationship.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o20"><a name="80107-0004.htm_para5"><a name="0801075000151">Fourthly, we are determined to ensure that British citizens of Pakistani heritage and Pakistanis resident in the United Kingdom are informed about developments and engaged in the drive to build a decent society in Pakistan.

Kenya had seen. Daniel Arap Moi's party accepted the result and ceded power. Tribal and ethnic divisions were overcome as the population rallied behind the new Government. It was a moment of great optimism. It is a marked contrast with the situation that has unfolded since the election on 27 December. I know I speak for the entire House in condemning the appalling post-election violence in Kenya, particularly the brutal killing of Kikuyu women and children in the church near Eldoret on 1 January.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o22"><a name="80107-0004.htm_para7"><a name="0801075000153">Let me deal with the three issues that have preoccupied the Government and indeed the whole international community over the last week: violence and the resulting humanitarian crisis; the elections; and mediation. I have arranged for the nine statements put out by myself, the Prime Minister and the Secretary of State for International Development over the last week to be deposited in a single file in the Library.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o23"><a name="80107-0004.htm_para8"><a name="0801075000154">I have spoken to our high commissioner in the last hour and I can confirm that his view is that of the media reports: that the urban violence of the middle of last week has subsided. That is obviously welcome, but the reporting from rural areas suggests that there are up to 250,000 refugees, and there is the potential for violence to erupt again. That is why since 2 January our travel advice, along with other countries&#146;, has advised against non-essential travel to Kenya. That advice will remain in place until the security and political situation is clarified. We are advising Britons in Kenya to exercise extreme caution, to remain indoors in the affected areas, and to seek local advice, from the tour operators or local authorities, if they need to travel.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o24"><a name="80107-0004.htm_para9"><a name="0801075000155">The humanitarian crisis we have seen unfolding on our television screens is due entirely to the post-election violence. The UN, World Food Programme and Red Cross are leading the international effort. The Department for International Development is monitoring the situation closely and has had a team on the ground in western Kenya. A &#163;1 million contribution to the Red Cross was announced by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for International Development last week, and it has helped to provide shelter for those displaced and to facilitate major food shipments from Mombasa, which took place over the weekend. DFID stands ready to provide more assistance if it is needed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o25"><a name="80107-0004.htm_para10"><a name="0801075000156">In respect of the election itself, millions of Kenyans queued for hours, peacefully and with dignity, to cast their votes for parliamentary and presidential candidates after a relatively calm election campaign. It is vital not just for Kenya, but for the whole of Africa with important elections over the next 18 months, that the democratic process works and is seen to work. However, the counting of votes in the presidential election, and particularly the reporting of votes from local to regional and then national centres, has, according to reliable European Union observation, been plagued by irregularity. Those irregularities stand in the way of the formation of a stable Kenyan Government who would have the confidence of their own people and the international community. All allegations of fraud need to be investigated and the perpetrators brought to justice. That requires due legal process, but there is also a need for political mediation. While individual acts of fraud are reprehensible, there is a deeper issue. Whatever the actual result, the country  <br>

was deeply split. Yet when Kenya needs the diversity of its views to be respected, the presidential system is designed to concentrate power when Kenya&#146;s immediate and medium-term future requires the sharing of power.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o26"><a name="80107-0004.htm_para11"><a name="0801075000157">Kenya&#146;s political leaders must be willing to make the necessary compromises to find a way forward. They are more likely to do so with external help. That is why at the heart of all our conversations&#151;with Kenyan, African, EU, Commonwealth, US and UN partners&#151;has been the need for a credible mediation process. I am pleased that President Kufuor of Ghana, the current chairman of the African Union, is due to arrive in Kenya soon, and he will do so with our full support. He needs Kenyan leaders ready to engage. On 2 January Condoleezza Rice and I called for a &#147;spirit of compromise&#148; from those leaders. If they fail to compromise, they will forfeit the confidence, good will and support of their own people and the international community. The stakes are high for the Kenyan people, and we will remain fully engaged on the political and consular track.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o27"><a name="80107-0004.htm_para12"><a name="0801075000158">May I conclude by thanking staff in the Foreign Office and the Department for International Development, in-country and in London, for their outstanding consular and political work around the clock in the very trying circumstances of the last 10 days?

 I thank the Foreign Secretary for taking the earliest opportunity to make a statement on the situation in these two countries, as we requested last week. In both cases a flawed democratic process has given rise to tragedy, but in both cases democratically elected leaders and democratically enshrined institutions are the best hope for overcoming extremism, instability and corruption.</p>
<a name="0801075000352">
<p>I echo what the Foreign Secretary said about the horror with which we have greeted the butchery of innocent people, including children, in the aftermath of the Kenyan elections. The result of that ethnic strife in the case of Kenya is a humanitarian tragedy, and providing urgent assistance to the 250,000 displaced both within Kenya and across its borders must be at the forefront of our concerns. On that subject, the Conservatives welcome DFID&#146;s contribution of &#163;1 million to the Kenyan Red Cross. Will the Foreign Secretary tell the House what is his latest assessment of the relief effort? How is that being evaluated? Given that the medical charity Merlin yesterday warned that Kenya faces a health crisis &#147;within days&#148; as &#147;dangerously low&#148; supplies of food and water are putting many people at risk of infection and dehydration, is it likely that international aid will need to be increased?</p>

we fully support the mission of the President of Ghana. It has been reported that the US Assistant Secretary of State has secured an offer from President Kibaki to form a coalition Government, and a concession from the Opposition leader that he will negotiate without preconditions. Can the Foreign Secretary confirm those reports? Is it not important that the EU monitoring mission issue a formal public report on the elections as soon as possible? Is the Foreign Secretary aware of any findings or recommendations from that mission, or from the Kenyan electoral assistance programme that Britain helped to fund?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o30"><a name="80107-0004.htm_para15"><a name="0801075000162">Ethnic conflict is now threatening the decades of stability that have set Kenya apart from so many of its neighbours. In this situation, Kenya&#146;s leaders have a clear responsibility to compromise and work together&#151;whether this means joint rule or an eventual rerun of the elections under international supervision. Is it the Foreign Secretary&#146;s view that a recount or re-tally of the election is not practical, given the likely destruction of ballot papers and records, and will he assure the House that he will not entertain the idea of sanctions at present, as some have suggested? Kenya is not a country hostile to Britain&#146;s national interest, but a friendly country that needs our assistance.</p>

The whole House will agree that the assassination of Benazir Bhutto is a sickening and appalling crime and that such violence is a major threat to the stability and future of Pakistan.

The Foreign Secretary said in November that a decision would be made about some &#163;3.5 million of UK funding for the elections on the basis of the conduct of the Government of Pakistan.

 I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman for the content and tone of his remarks.

Yesterday, the food convoy from Mombasa did get through to western Kenya without alarm or difficulty. That is obviously encouraging, but we will follow the situation very carefully. The ongoing assessment to which he referred is made partly by our staff or by DFID staff on the ground, working closely with the high commission in Nairobi. I am happy to keep the House informed on that basis.</p>

A balance needs to be struck, because it is for the Kenyans to decide the nature of their power sharing, not for us to prescribe a particular type of coalition Government or constitutional arrangement. He reiterated the word that I use, &#147;compromise&#148;. It relates to compromise between the two main political parties, and it is important to stress that clearly. Of course, Kenya has a history of so-called &#147;Governments of national unity&#148;. It had such a Government in 2002, which did not lead to the sort of power sharing that is needed. I hope that he will understand my saying that at this stage we do not want to prescribe a particular type of constitutional or other reform, but we will all know it when we see it: when a Government reflects the divided will of the Kenyan people in respect of the political parties for which they voted.</p>

 I thank the Foreign Secretary for his statement and associate these Benches with both his tribute to Benazir Bhutto and his sadness at the violent deaths of so many others in the recent crises in Pakistan and Kenya. Benazir Bhutto was a politician of great courage. She put her life on the line for the restoration of democracy in Pakistan and her death presents the world with the nightmare of an unstable, divided Pakistan.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o44"><a name="80107-0004.htm_para29"><a name="0801075000180">The Foreign Secretary has described well why we should all be alarmed at recent events in those two countries and the urgent need to restore law and order through democratic means. I pay tribute to his efforts and those of the Prime Minister and many British diplomats in these difficult and often frustrating days. May I say how strongly we agree with much of what the Foreign Secretary has said today&#151;for example, about the decision to send Scotland Yard detectives to assist the investigation into Miss Bhutto&#146;s murder and the humanitarian aid through the Red Cross for parts of Kenya cut off by the violence?</p>

On Pakistan, why have the British Government failed to be more critical of the Musharraf regime and its deeply damaging actions, most recently in its attacks on the independence of the judiciary, which the Foreign Secretary failed to mention in his statement? Is it not the case that Britain has been totally complicit with the US policy of bolstering President Musharraf over the years? Does not this crisis show how mistaken that policy has been, with extremism having spread and democratic institutions having been so undermined?</p>

While it is good that the EU is sending 50 so-called long-term observers for the new elections, does he believe that the increase of just seven on the monitoring mission for the 2002 elections is really sufficient, given the heightened tension and especially given that the Commonwealth election monitoring operation was suspended in November and has yet to be invited back to Pakistan? Is there not a danger that the February elections will have less international scrutiny than the flawed 2002 elections? Given the crucial role of the judiciary in supervising elections matters, what representations are being made to President Musharraf to insist that he reverses his recent dismissal of critical judges and ends the intimidation of the entire legal profession?</p>

 My right hon. Friend raises the key issue. Her experience in Kenya and that of others in the House will be relevant. In the end, the spirit of compromise has to come from the top; that is why our messages have been direct from the Prime Minister to President Kibaki and Raila Odinga, the Leader of the Opposition. There is also a need for a strong civic society, and political institutions at the local level that are able to bring people together. That process seemed to be starting in 2002.

 One of the many tragedies of Pakistan is the pathetically small amount of money spent on education&#151;just 1.8 per cent. of gross domestic product. Illiteracy rates in Pakistan are more than 50 per cent., and are increasing. With the collapse of the Government school system, ever more parents simply have to send their children to madrassahs because there is nowhere else to send them. Pakistan is a good ally, but it could turn into a nightmare, as an increasingly illiterate nuclear state. When the Department for International Development engages with Pakistan through its country programme, will we make sure that we are encouraging Pakistan to spend more of its resources on education? Otherwise, it will be an increasingly faltering state.</p>

 The short answer to the hon. Gentleman is yes. He will know from what my colleague the Secretary of State for International Development and I have said that we raise both publicly and privately the fact that less than 2 per cent. of national income is spent on education. Education is at the centre of DFID&#146;s programme in Pakistan, and I discussed the matter last July when I was in Pakistan.

 The Foreign Secretary was right to say that what we need for Pakistan is free and fair elections, but also not to let up on counter-terrorism. He briefly mentioned Afghanistan. Even in more stable times, there are hundreds of thousands of people crossing the borders, both ways, on any one day. In the run-up to the elections, the role of Afghanistan will be even more important than it has been.

 My hon. Friend raises an important point, which was discussed at the NATO Foreign Ministers meeting in December. It is always discussed when I meet NATO and other colleagues, because obviously the problem with the Afghan-Pakistan border needs to addressed on both sides of the border.

at the murder of Benazir Bhutto. As the Foreign Secretary knows, nearly every serious al-Qaeda plot since 7/7 in Britain has had some connection with Pakistan, so what monitoring arrangements do his Department and the Government have in place to measure the effect of incidents such as the murder of Benazir Bhutto, or the recent storming of the Red Mosque, on communities in Britain who follow very closely what happens in Pakistan, and who are often influenced by what occurs there?</p>

 The hon. Gentleman is right that not least through media that are watched both in Britain and in Pakistan, there is a common political discussion and discourse across the two countries. We try to stay in touch through our contacts both with community leaders and with ordinary members of the community. Personally, I am suspicious of opinion polls that are bandied around as definitive, and I prefer to rely on more qualitative information. I am sure, however, that he would agree that anything that helps to build a decent society in Pakistan that respects all its different communities can help to lessen tensions and contribute to the notion that the vast majority of Pakistanis, whether in Pakistan or Britain, are dedicated to fighting against al-Qaeda, rather than to fighting for it. That is the battle for hearts and minds in which we are all engaged.</p>

 Yes; of course, independent electoral commissions that have the confidence of different communities in different countries are important.

It would be quite wrong for any cloud to hang over the chairman of the Kenyan commission, who is long-serving and has done a very good job in difficult circumstances.

 The Foreign Secretary will be aware that Britain&#146;s Pakistani community is extremely exercised by events in Pakistan, and the circumstances of Benazir Bhutto&#146;s death remain extremely contentious. We are glad that British police are going out to support the Pakistani police, but does he accept that most people in Pakistan have no confidence in an inquiry led by the Pakistani authorities, whose first act was to hose down the crime scene?

We have been very active, however, in ensuring that British expertise is available, without fear or favour, to report on the details obtained from a wide range of evidence&#151;not just local forensic evidence, but the detailed video images that many of us have seen on our TV screens that was taken with mobile phones and other mechanisms.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman raises a really important point, which I have discussed regularly with the high commissioner. As he probably knows, there is a system of ward outreach to British nationals in Kenya, as in many countries, whereby we try to ensure that the vast bulk of them, if not all, are registered with the high commission. The best means of contact, whether that be telephone or other methods such as e-mail, are established so that they can be kept in touch with actions. If the hon. Gentleman has any contact with missionaries whom he thinks might not be part of that telephone or e-mail tree, I am happy to recognise that. However, we are determined to try to ensure that in all countries, such as Kenya, we have rapid systems for making contact with as many British citizens as possible. So far, the system seems to be working, because although we have put on call a series of crisis teams, the number of calls to the Foreign Office in London and to the British high commission in Nairobi has been relatively limited, usually to single figures on any one day. That suggests that the mechanisms that we have in place are working, but we are always happy to try to improve them.</p>

Would he care to reflect on the fact that the world is now seeing on its television sets the appalling poverty in the slums in Kenya and the failure of the democratic system to provide any sort of equality of opportunity for many people in Kenya, and that in Pakistan successive military Governments have spent a vast amount of the nation&#146;s resources on weapons of mass destruction, which have obviously had an impact on many people&#146;s lives? Does he have any hope that a restoration of a proper democratic system in both countries will help to close this yawning gap, which is at the heart of an awful lot of these problems?</p>

 My hon. Friend is right to draw attention to this matter, and I am pleased that he does so. Yes, I do have hope, but there is no point in looking at this through rose-tinted spectacles. Hope needs to lead to decisions that make a difference. Economic growth is the first precondition for tackling the endemic poverty that he and I abhor. In 2005, I saw for myself in the Kibera slum in the centre of Nairobi the sort of conditions to which he refers. Hope needs to lead to choices, which are best made on the basis of a democratic mandate, in the interests of stability and equality. However, no one who visits Kibera can say that this is anything other than a long-term challenge and one that it would be absurd to be glib about. That is why it is right to talk about five, 10, 15 or 20-year challenges, not just five-day or five-month challenges.</p>

 The Secretary of State talks about combating terrorism, but fails to mention the one thing that links Pakistan to events in Afghanistan and to 9/11, 7/7, Bali and Madrid&#151;the al-Qaeda training camps that are on the Pakistani border. Does he agree that Pakistan should now hold up its hands and say that it cannot contain that 400-mile mountainous border and that international help is needed, because otherwise we will continue to see a conveyor belt of suicide bombers coming out of that area, causing mayhem not only in Pakistan but in other places around the world?</p>

 The hon. Gentleman does not need to find division across the House on that point. He will have heard in my statement the reference to the joint fight against al-Qaeda. He will also know that we are strongly committed to the international support for the Pakistan and Afghanistan Governments that will be necessary. However, that cannot merely be military support. In the end, there needs to be a political solution in both Pakistan and Afghanistan. A military element is needed, but it will not do the trick on its own. There is room for common ground across the House on that point, and that is what I am determined to try to seek.</p>

 On Kenya, how will my right hon. Friend, who said that it is down to Kenyans to decide, and the international community assess the validity of any coalition Government? How will they expect such a Government to perform on power sharing and tackling corruption, and what will they expect the possible duration to be?

<p><a name="st_o140"><a name="0801075000240"><a name="80107-0006.htm_spmin0"><a name="0801075000526"><b>The Secretary of State for Justice and Lord Chancellor (Mr. Jack Straw):</b>
 With permission, Mr. Speaker, I should like to make a statement on industrial relations in the Prison Service, and on my tabling amendments today to the Criminal Justice and Immigration Bill. The amendments are for debate on Report this Wednesday.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o60"><a name="80107-0006.htm_para1"><a name="0801075000241">The aim of the amendments is to provide for a reserve statutory restriction on industrial action by prison officers. The powers in the amendments would be applied only in the absence of a suitable trade union dispute resolution and recognition agreement between the Prison Service and the relevant trade unions. As I will explain, tabling the amendments fulfils clear undertakings given to Parliament by Ministers over six years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o61"><a name="80107-0006.htm_para2"><a name="0801075000242">The Prison Service is an essential public service. Prison officers do a difficult and demanding job. They deal with some of the most dangerous and vulnerable people in our society. Their work is often unseen by the general public. I pay tribute to their endeavours and those of all other staff in the service.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o62"><a name="80107-0006.htm_para3"><a name="0801075000243">Prison officers are in a uniformed and disciplined service. When on duty, they are officers of the law with the powers of a police constable. They have a clear duty to uphold the law, protect the public and safeguard the welfare of the prisoners in their care.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o63"><a name="80107-0006.htm_para4"><a name="0801075000244">In those respects, their position as officers whose role is essential to the security of the state and the communities in it is similar to that in other essential services, such as the police and the armed forces. Parliament has made it clear and laid down in statute that the risk to the public in each of those services is simply too great to allow them to take industrial action.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o64"><a name="80107-0006.htm_para5"><a name="0801075000245">At the same time, it has been well recognised that, without that form of influence, staff need other legitimate means of pursuing grievances and concerns with their employer. In 2000, I established a pay review body for prison governors, prison officers and related grades. Subsequently, in 2001, my right hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett), the then Home Secretary, introduced proposals for a comprehensive voluntary agreement with the Prison Officers Association. In 2005, this agreement was replaced by a joint industrial relations procedural agreement, or JIRPA, which provides mechanisms for resolving disputes between the POA and the Prison Service, including binding arbitration.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o65"><a name="80107-0006.htm_para6"><a name="0801075000246">Under the JIRPA, the POA voluntarily agreed to legally enforceable constraints on its ability to take industrial action. It was explicitly on that basis that the Government sought parliamentary approval to disapply the statutory prohibition on industrial action in section 127 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 for public sector workers in England, Wales and Scotland. The disapplication was made by an order under the Regulatory Reform Act 2001. In making that order, with the Opposition&#146;s broad support, my noble Friend Lord Bassam, on behalf of the Government, said in terms that in the event of notice of termination of the JIRPA the Government would have</p>

<a name="80107-0006.htm_brev2"><a name="0801075000357"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;If the POA gives notice to terminate the agreement with no alternative arrangements being in place, the Secretary of State would ask Parliament to reintroduce statutory constraints such as existed prior to disapplication of section 127.&#148;&#151;[<i> Official Report</i>, 4 September 2006; Vol. 449, c. 1897W.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o68"><a name="80107-0006.htm_para9"><a name="0801075000250">Regrettably, in May last year the POA gave 12 months&#146; notice, expiring on 8 May this year, of its intention to withdraw from this agreement in respect of England and Wales. An equivalent agreement remains in force in Scotland. Experience underlines why there must be sufficient protection against industrial action. Most recently, on 29 August 2007, despite being bound by the terms of the voluntary agreement banning industrial action, the POA initiated a 24-hour strike, giving the service just one hour&#146;s notice. As the JIRPA was still in force, that strike action was constrained by an interim injunction, but nevertheless it had a substantial impact on the operation of the public sector Prison Service. That included the cancellation of court appearances, transfers of prisoners and the extended use of police cells. The action led to serious disturbances at Her Majesty&#146;s young offender institution Lancaster Farms, resulting in significant damage to cells that cost &#163;220,000 to repair.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o69"><a name="80107-0006.htm_para10"><a name="0801075000251">The public&#146;s safety has to be my primary consideration, but it cannot be acceptable for prisoners to be locked in their cells for an indeterminate period, with great uncertainty about when they will next get a meal, exercise or medication, and with serious risks to their welfare. It has always been, and continues to be, my hope that the Prison Service and POA can agree a new trade union dispute resolution and recognition agreement that would be binding on both parties.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o70"><a name="80107-0006.htm_para11"><a name="0801075000252">Early last summer, the Government asked the Trades Union Congress to initiate talks between the Prison Service and the POA, aimed at improving industrial relations and at reaching a new agreement. The talks were conducted under the auspices of Mr. Ed Sweeney, a then senior member of the TUC General Council and now chair of the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service. Mr. Sweeney&#146;s report on the talks has now been sent to both parties and a copy has been placed in the Library. I am extremely grateful to him for his work. His recommendations offer a sound basis for further discussion and a framework for future agreement. I very much hope that the POA will continue to engage with that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o71"><a name="80107-0006.htm_para12"><a name="0801075000253">However, Mr. Sweeney also recognises that, given the current industrial relations climate, in which public safety cannot be guaranteed in the event of industrial action, the Government will need to consider what mechanisms must be put in place should an agreement not be achieved. I very much hope that between now and May a new and acceptable voluntary agreement can be made. I would much prefer the reserve powers in the amendment never to have to be used, but in proposing them I am fulfilling clear and explicit undertakings given to this House and the other place. I emphasise  <br>

that the amendments reflect the wording of the current joint industrial relations procedural agreement, which defines industrial action as</p>
<a name="80107-0006.htm_brev3"><a name="0801075000358"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;any action likely to affect the normal working of a prison&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o72"><a name="80107-0006.htm_para13"><a name="0801075000254">This provides no greater constraint than the one to which the Prison Officers Association voluntarily signed up in 2005.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o73"><a name="80107-0006.htm_para14"><a name="0801075000255">The House will also wish to know that legislation of this nature is in accordance with European Union and international law. Similar measures can be found in the constitutions and laws of many other European countries, including France, Germany and Italy. I have placed a copy of a report in the Library that summarises the position in European and other OECD countries.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o74"><a name="80107-0006.htm_para15"><a name="0801075000256">I repeat, however, that I am mindful of the need to establish a sound platform on which to secure constructive industrial relations between the Prison Service and the Prison Officers Association. That is why the amendments provide a reserve power, to be activated or suspended by order of the Secretary of State. Should a suitable trade union dispute resolution and recognition agreement be reached&#151;one that includes protections against industrial action&#151;the statutory prohibition would be suspended. That is in line with Mr. Sweeney&#146;s recommendation to make any reinstatement of section 127 of the 1994 Act what he calls a passive change, rather than an active way of conducting employee relations in the Prison Service.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o75"><a name="80107-0006.htm_para16"><a name="0801075000257">Mr. Sweeney also recommends that an independent review take place two years after any agreement is signed between the Prison Service and the Prison Officers Association. This review would re-examine the balance of arguments for and against allowing forms of industrial action by prison officers. If a suitable trade union recognition agreement is agreed and sustained, I will commit to this further review after a period of stability.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o76"><a name="80107-0006.htm_para17"><a name="0801075000258">This year provides an important opportunity for us all to build a new and positive industrial relations climate for the Prison Service. We are committed to engaging constructively with all Prison Service trade unions on a programme of work force modernisation, and we are ready to pay for it. My right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer has already made available significant additional funds from April 2009 to support the programme, which could be underpinned by a multi-year pay deal. I very much hope that the Prison Service and the Prison Service trade unions will engage to make the best use of those funds, in order to provide a brighter future for all staff, develop new and more flexible working practices, and create more stable industrial relations within the Prison Service. I commend this statement to the House.</p>

Prison officer numbers have risen at half the rate of the prison population, chronic overcrowding is putting immense strain on the service, assaults on prison staff have soared by 80 per cent., and now budgetary cuts mean the prospect of prisoners&#146; being locked in their cells throughout weekends.

 Let me begin by wishing the hon. Gentleman and the House a happy new year. [Hon. Members: &#147;The same to you.&#148;] I thank Opposition Members for reciprocating.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o86"><a name="80107-0007.htm_para8"><a name="0801075000269">Let me say to the hon. Gentleman&#151;while parenthetically advising him to change the pitch of his voice a little when he is making statements&#151;that I do not suggest that the operation of the Prison Service over the past 10 years has been perfect or anything like it. If, however, he wants to establish whether it has been better during the past 10 years than it was during the previous 18, I shall be happy to engage in a contest, and I look forward to his using one of the Opposition Supply days for precisely that purpose. The level of industrial disruption within the Prison Service involving, for example, the use of police cells&#151;which involved 3,500 cells at one stage and continued, more often than not, throughout those 18 years&#151;makes our record pale into insignificance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o87"><a name="80107-0007.htm_para9"><a name="0801075000270">The hon. Gentleman mentioned the timing of the statement. Last May, we were given notice that the Prison Officers Association intended to abandon the voluntary agreement that it signed in 2005. We decided, I think rightly, not to rush to reintroduce these powers, notwithstanding clear undertakings that they would be reintroduced if notice was given of intention to terminate the JIRPA. Instead, following an initiative from the Minister of State, Ministry of Justice, my right hon. Friend the Member for Delyn (Mr. Hanson)&#151;the Prisons Minister&#151;we involved the TUC. Mr. Ed Sweeney has produced an important report, on which we are acting. I did not want to make my statement before we had received Mr. Sweeney&#146;s report; I am conscious that it does not allow a great deal of time for debate, but I thought that this was the best possible moment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o88"><a name="80107-0007.htm_para10"><a name="0801075000271">As for the hon. Gentleman&#146;s nonsense about an emergency statement, when I gave evidence to the Constitutional Affairs Committee in October, one of his hon. Friends asked whether I intended to reintroduce section 127. I said that it was under active consideration, and that remains the position.</p>

If the hon. Gentleman bothers to read the report of the debates that were held at the time, he will see that the allegation that we fought the proposals &#147;tooth and nail&#148; is hardly an accurate description of the criticism expressed from both the Liberal Democrat Benches and ours. My right hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth (Alun Michael), who led for the Opposition, made the point that if there were to be a restriction on prison officers&#146; right to strike, it had to be balanced by other measures. Moreover, in the three years when I was shadow Home Secretary, I never gave a single undertaking that we would repeal section 127; neither did I do so at any stage when I was Home Secretary, nor did my successors.</p>

Friend the Member for Sheffield, Brightside would have preferred, as would the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee, that the change to section 127 be made by way of its suspension, rather than its repeal. That was not possible in the circumstances, but when the measure came before the other place&#151;with the support of the Opposition, who were not making these nitpicking points at the time&#151;clear undertakings were given that in the event of termination of the JIRPA, we would re-introduce the ban.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o91"><a name="80107-0007.htm_para13"><a name="0801075000276">I have dealt with the point about chronic overcrowding. There is a degree of overcrowding, but it is nothing like that within the Prison Service in the 1980s and early 1990s. The ratio of prison staff to prisoners has remained stable at between 1:21 to 1:22. However, quite a lot of the duties previously undertaken by prison officers are now undertaken by operational support grades&#151;for example, people working in gatehouses who do not have direct contact with prisoners. Before the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs next makes that point, the question for him is whether he is proposing that a future Conservative Government, whenever that might be, would reinstate those jobs to prison officers. If not, what on earth is the point he is making?</p>

 I thank my right hon.

I hope we can move from the regulation and the statutory provision that he has proposed back to proper negotiation. Is he aware that from the point of view of the Prison Officers Association, there is a sense of imbalance in the relationship between it and the management of the Prison Service? Will he say a little about what the Sweeney report recommends in relation to that imbalance, if it is recognised?</p>

 I am very grateful to my hon. Friend for the terms in which he makes his point. A copy of the quite lengthy report is available, but essentially Mr. Sweeney is seeking to produce a more effective voluntary agreement with different forms of arbitration; for example, to reduce the arguments about whether an issue is suitable for arbitration, which has been one of the problems of the JIRPA, and to make the arbitration more acceptable. Along with work force modernisation, for which more money is available from April next year, these and other improvements should lead to a major change in the industrial relations climate within the service, which is my commitment. As I said, I would much prefer us to achieve a situation&#151;I think that this is possible&#151;where these statutory powers do not have to be used.</p>

Is not that exactly the problem of trust between many in the public service&#151;particularly the uniformed branches of the public service&#151;and the Government? They do not trust the Government not to misapply the arrangements in these areas and there is a strong feeling that they are increasingly taken advantage of as a result.

The Lord Chancellor is now interpolating yet another section into the Bill. Does he really believe that this House is being properly dealt with in being provided with a single day to discuss the Bill&#146;s remaining stages? Is it not inevitable that large parts of important proposed legislation will remain undebated by this House, and that the attentions of the other House will be required to put that right, as is so often the case?</p>

 While I accept the action that the Lord Chancellor hinted was going to become necessary when he appeared before my Select Committee, did he note the view in Mr. Sweeney&#146;s report that relations at local level were generally reasonable or good and that it was at national level that relations between the Prison Officers Association and the Prison Service were at a particularly low ebb? Have there not been failings on both sides over the years that have brought this about? Is it possible to change them, given the background of the pressures of overcrowding and the mishandling of the police arbitration settlement, which has created a lack of confidence that the Government will stick to their side of the bargain when no-strike provisions are in force?</p>

The issue of relations at national level needs to be addressed. I hope that the House will acknowledge that my statement did not seek to start allocating blame; I want a different industrial relations climate for the future.

 One would hope that the Lord Chancellor of England would always have an instinctive sense of what is fair. Governments of all persuasions have taken away the right to strike from various public sector workers, but in consideration of that, they have set up either independent pay review bodies or independent arbitration bodies. Surely what is fair about that is that the Government should then honour what those pay review bodies recommend. I am sure that the Lord Chancellor will recognise that it is not fair for payments then to be staged, because that does not honour the pay review body&#146;s agreements. Governments can take that approach but, as someone whose constituency, like that of many hon. Members, contains a prison, I must tell him that it leads to a sense of frustration, betrayal and mistrust, it is bad human relations and bad labour relations, and it is also inherently unfair.</p>

 I accept the hon. Gentleman&#146;s basic point that where a work force is prevented, by one means or another, from taking industrial action, the Government have a double responsibility to ensure that any disputes, including those in respect of pay, are dealt with extra fairly. In normal circumstances we would accept the recommendations of the Prison Service pay review board, but these were not normal circumstances for reasons that I have already explained and they involved difficult judgments. I know that they were not popular with prison officers, and I understand why. However, if we had gone down the alternative route across the public sector as a whole, it would have been that much more difficult to have convinced the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of England that we were getting a grip on public sector pay-led inflation. The result would have been that interest rates would not now be on a downward path, and everybody would suffer.</p>

Co-operation and Development countries, with an analysis of our obligations, and he will then see why I am so confident about saying that. Almost all jurisdictions have prohibitions on the police and armed forces taking industrial action and many, across Europe and other OECD countries, have similar restrictions, which are entirely lawful internationally, in respect of prison officers, for the same reason. Of course I understand the argument that my hon. Friend makes, but it must be balanced against the impact on public safety and the welfare of prisoners if industrial action is taken in that particular case. I have asked the Prison Officers Association time and again what it would do were it in my position and faced with industrial action by prison officers that meant that prisoners could not be fed, would not know when they would next be able to exercise and, in the case of many prisoners who unfortunately have mental health problems, would not know when they would next receive medication. Those are the considerations that have to be balanced, and that is why we have now reluctantly reached a consensus across the Chamber that such industrial action must be restricted by one means or another. At the same time, we have to put in place better and alternative arrangements.</p>

There are two prisons in my constituency, one of which&#151;HMP Downview&#151;was a leading centre for treating addiction in male offenders. Under the Lord Chancellor&#146;s time as Home Secretary, the Government managed, at only two weeks&#146; notice, to turn it into a women&#146;s prison with the complete destruction and loss of the valuable programmes in the prison. Changes at HMP Highdown mean that the prison has to accept 360 new places in three months, with a vast increase of detached duty officers going to the prison to make the changes work. That is a consequence of the Government&#146;s inability to cope with wholly predicted increases in prisoner numbers, male and female. The decision today is a reflection of the Government&#146;s mishandling of the Prison Service and the consequent anger of the Prison Officers Association.</p>

At the end of last year I set out how that contract will be renewed through welfare reform, as we move from a regime of passive benefits to one of active benefits. The Bill will enact the remainder of the landmark pensions reform package set out in May 2006 in the White Paper, &#147;Security in retirement: towards a new pension system&#148;, the first part of which became legislation in the Pensions Act 2007.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o114"><a name="80107-0008.htm_para6"><a name="0801075000341">The Government have achieved a lot since 1997. We are spending &#163;11 billion more on pensioners each year than would be spent if the policies of the last Conservative Government had been followed. This year we have spent &#163;75 billion on provision for pensioners&#151;around 13 per cent. of all public spending. Pension credit, winter fuel payments, free TV licences and above-inflation increases to the basic state pension have brought more than 1 million senior citizens out of relative poverty. Rolling out free bus travel right across Britain has also extended opportunities for pensioners. However, the challenges posed by our ageing society mean that we have to look ahead not a year at a time, but decades at a time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o115"><a name="80107-0008.htm_para7"><a name="0801075000342">Our changing demographic profile opens up increasing opportunities for baby boomers&#151;those of us born between 1945 and 1965&#151;in the &#147;active ageing&#148; category. Looking around the Chamber, I see that we are well represented. However, those changes also present immense challenges, not least in preparing for the future. The reality, and perhaps the irony, is that as our society gets older, pensions increasingly becomes a young person&#146;s issue. In the next 50 years the number of people over pension age will increase by more than half, meaning that there will be only two people working for every one person in retirement, compared with four working people today, and 10 working people 100 years ago.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o116"><a name="80107-0008.htm_para8"><a name="0801075000343">The cost implications of that increasing longevity for our children and grandchildren are arrestingly stark. Many more people expect to be active longer in retirement and need the resources to fund that. Unless we act now, and act decisively for the long term, we will bequeath a nightmare for future pensioners plunged into poverty, and for future taxpayers, grappling with the consequences. We have already addressed some of the issues identified by Lord Turner&#146;s commission. We have legislated for a simpler, fairer and more generous state pension system. In addition, about 75 per cent. of women retiring in 2010 will receive a full basic state pension, and by 2025, over 95 per cent. of men and women will retire with a full basic state pension.</p>

The Government currently do so in a different scheme, so could that principle not be applied in this case?</p>

If we could find a way&#151;we are open to suggestions, and we looked carefully and sympathetically, as I said, at Baroness Hollis&#146;s proposal&#151;of targeting such a provision at women on low incomes, preferably living in this country, although that does not exclude others, that would be our priority.

That is a considerable boost to retirement income.

I do not want that event to pass&#151;perhaps I will catch Mr. Speaker&#146;s eye later and be able to say more&#151;without saying that the Secretary of State and his team have delivered what previous Secretaries of State and their teams failed to deliver to that group of workers, and we should put on record what an achievement that is.</p>

 In my constituency, 4,000 people receive pension credit, which affects more than 5,000 families.

 That is the fundamental objective of the Bill and of the policy that will be delivered around it. My hon. Friend is right; like her, many of my constituents had low incomes when they worked, and life in retirement would have been dire for many of them without the pension credit. Life was dire for such people before 1997, but they have had a major increase in prosperity since then. We must join together, because the consensus around the Bill, which was assembled carefully, has been important in taking the Bill forward.</p>

 Will the Secretary of State consider ways to remove the disincentives on personal responsibility?

Sixteen per cent. of 20 to 24-year-olds are saving for a pension, compared with about half of those aged over 35. Less than half of moderate to low earners with incomes from &#163;5,000 to &#163;35,000 are saving towards a pension, compared with three quarters of those earning more than &#163;35,000.

Evidence suggests that automatic enrolment is one of the most effective ways to combat people&#146;s tendency not to act when faced with difficult financial decisions.

Many employers are already making substantial contributions to pension schemes and supporting their employees in saving for retirement. To make the package of reforms successful, however, the Government need all employers to play their part. That is why all employers will be required to contribute to their workers&#146; pensions a minimum of 3 per cent. on a band of earnings for defined-contribution schemes, as recommended by the Pensions Commission.</p>

However, there will be a legal duty on employers, who would disobey the law and who would be liable to prosecution if they were to use an underhand method, such as recruiting somebody on the basis of a nod and a wink that they would not be in a pension scheme.

 I am going to deal with that problem in a few minutes, and the hon. Gentleman can come back to me at that point. We are doing something very radical; I do not think that there is anything like this anywhere else in the world, which is why it is so important to get it right and deliver it with the maximum consensus.</p>

That includes more than 1 million people currently in workplace pension schemes who are getting either nothing or less than 3 per cent. from their employer. We anticipate that up to 7 million individuals may join the new national scheme of personal accounts. It will be a simple, low-cost pension saving scheme targeted where the need is greatest: moderate to low earners currently without access to a workplace pension scheme.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o129"><a name="80107-0010.htm_para3"><a name="08010718000052">The scheme will have low charges, allowing employees to keep more of their savings, and their contribution, combined with that of employers and tax relief from the Government, means that their own pension contributions will be at least doubled up front. All employees will now have the chance to save, and having a pension will be the norm. That will transform the savings culture in the UK, boosting overall pension contributions by around &#163;10 billion annually by 2015. Automatic enrolment into a pension scheme is widely recognised as the most effective way of combating inertia and myopia.</p>

The Bill will extend that opportunity to those currently without such access. We recognise that designing and delivering such a pension scheme is not a job for the Government and therefore we have set up the Personal Accounts Delivery Authority&#151;PADA&#151;to advise on, design and bring about the implementation of the reforms. We intend to extend the remit of PADA to enable it to design and build the infrastructure for the personal accounts scheme. We will also ensure employers&#146; compliance with the new duties through the pensions regulator, who has proved to be a very effective regulator of UK occupational pensions over the last two years. The regulator is best placed to deliver an effective compliance regime that does not overburden employers. It will be a light-touch regime, but it will deal effectively with those who refuse to comply.</p>

 It is because people who contribute to the personal accounts will be better off. The position that the hon. Member for Epsom and Ewell has adopted represents a breach with that of his predecessor, the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge, who I think understood the impact of the savings credit&#151;the hon. Lady needs to look that up&#151;to reward pensioners on low incomes who have saved for their retirement, which contrasts with the situation that we inherited. I still do not understand, first, why the hon. Member for Epsom and Ewell has changed his party&#146;s position from that adopted by his predecessor, who supported the Bill&#151;he has provided no explanation for changing it, except opposition for opposition&#146;s sake&#151;and, secondly, what the alternative policy is. Logic suggests that the alternative policy is to say, &#147;Well, it&#146;s up to people just to take their chances. They&#146;ll have the safety net of pension credit, but they won&#146;t contribute to their own pensions and they won&#146;t have the chance of getting a much better pension outcome,&#148; which also answers the hon. Lady&#146;s question.</p>

 The Secretary of State made an interesting point about trivial commutation, whereby people could collect up to &#163;16,000 as a lump sum, rather than losing it in a means-testing arrangement. That is worth knowing, but I am concerned that a lot of that money could be eaten up when housing benefit or council tax benefit is taken into account. Would my right hon.

I have responded to a good many interventions, but I have spoken for quite a long time as well. I said at the outset that we were renewing the contract between the Government and the individual on the basis of shared responsibilities in the most fundamental reform of the pensions system since the state pension was inaugurated in 1948. Looking back further, I note that 2008 marks 100 years since Lloyd George&#146;s Old Age Pensions Act, which resulted in a non-contributory pension of five shillings a week payable to those aged over 70&#151;subject to a means test.</p>

These radical reforms are necessary to the establishment of a sustainable, affordable and trusted pensions system, which will meet the needs of the country and future generations by delivering security and dignity to all in retirement on the basis of on new responsibilities: employer responsibility through contributions to a pension scheme, employee responsibility through employee contributions to the scheme, and Government responsibility through an improved state pension linked to earnings.</p>

 It was disappointing to hear the Secretary of State demonstrate so little understanding of what are serious issues. Later, I shall explain in detail why we are so concerned about the aspects of the Bill that we have been discussing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o147"><a name="80107-0011.htm_para5"><a name="08010718000097">Yesterday, the Secretary of State issued a press release warning of the danger of a future pensions crisis. Has he not noticed that, under this Government, we have experienced a pretty significant pensions crisis for the past 10 years? When the history of the Government is written, their stewardship of our pensions system will be remembered as one of their greatest failures. Indeed, the word &#147;pensions&#148; should be chiselled in large letters on the Prime Minister&#146;s eventual political tombstone.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o148"><a name="80107-0011.htm_para6"><a name="08010718000098">In 1997, the Prime Minister took over what was widely regarded as one of the strongest pensions systems in Europe. Although the right hon. Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field) and I regularly engage in discussions about what took place before that, the reality is that in 1997 we had a strong pensions system. The then Chancellor, now the Prime Minister, made grandiose promises about how it would transform the lives of our pensioners, and&#151;just for a change&#151;the opposite happened. Millions fewer people are saving for retirement, the latest Government figures show that the poorest pensioners are getting poorer, and we have a system of means-testing so complex that many elderly people do not know how to gain access to the money that they need. We have seen that once strong pensions system damaged beyond repair, and we have seen the Government&#146;s great response&#151;their first response&#151;to the pensions crisis, stakeholder pensions, fail before even taking off.</p>

The problem is straightforward; the interaction between means-testing and these reforms means that some people who are encouraged to save for retirement, or are auto-enrolled to save for retirement, will derive no benefit from doing so because they will not be able to save enough money to provide them with a pension income that is greater than they would have received anyway from means-tested benefits. The point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Bromsgrove (Miss Kirkbride), who is no longer in her place, was that that issue will become more pronounced because of the link between earnings and the pension credit threshold. That is a fact; it is not a statement of intent one way or the other about the pension credit threshold increasing in line with earnings. We do not know how many people will be affected.</p>

 I am listening in bewilderment. Today, one in six people are automatically enrolled into their pension schemes. Many of those who have been automatically enrolled today on pension credit because their second pension has not put them above the levels to which they should be entitled. Is the hon. Gentleman now suggesting, as he did on Radio 4&#146;s &#147;Money Box&#148;, that every pensioner in that position today and from here on would have to have their contributions refunded?

 My hon. Friend is absolutely right. Interestingly, my next remark was to be precisely what the Minister just said; &#147;Ministers will say that this is a problem for everyone who saves for retirement.&#148; This is different, because people are being auto-enrolled for personal accounts.

 Let me just repeat for the hon. Gentleman&#146;s benefit that, today, one in six pensioners are automatically enrolled. It is a gold standard that we want to provide universally. That is not a major change. It is a change in numbers, but it does not change the basis of his argument. Is he saying that all those people who, under previous Conservative Governments and under this Government for the past 10 years, have been automatically enrolled into a pension scheme ought somehow not to have been automatically enrolled and should have some sort of compensation?

 I fear that the Minister still does not understand the issue. Parliament is legislating to auto-enrol everyone in this country who is not currently in a pension scheme in a system that the Secretary of State says is designed to make it difficult to opt out from. These are low-cost products in the pensions market. No one will be able to afford to provide these people with personal advice about whether they should or should not save. They have to take the decision themselves. We live in a country where, as we know, people have a propensity not to save.</p>

column in our local papers will not write stories saying that because of means-testing some people will lose out if they save in a personal account? Does anyone honestly believe that that will not happen? Does anyone honestly believe that some small employers faced by an unwelcome increase in their wage costs will not quietly show those stories to their employees? Does anyone honestly believe that employees generally will not chat about these issues in the pub or the sandwich queue? Does anyone honestly believe that the number of people who decide to opt out of personal accounts will not increase as a result, with the consequence that future generations and future Governments will have to bear a much larger cost for means-tested benefits than they would have done had these reforms worked as intended?</p>

Having a proper debate about solving the problem would not undermine the consensus; it would strengthen it. Ministers seem convinced that providing generic advice to potential savers will do the job, but how much real advice do they think they can provide to people from a low-cost product that will have to pay off the start-up costs of the first years of its operation and that will be at the lowest possible end of affordability within the pensions market?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o166"><a name="80107-0012.htm_para5"><a name="08010718000144">The Minister asks what we should do. Many alternatives have been suggested to the Government. Two detailed approaches have been produced by the Pensions Policy Institute, looking at potential options such as raising the limit for trivial commutation. I have suggested to Ministers&#151;it is only a suggestion and I would happily talk privately to them about it&#151;that we might be able to offer those who lose out some form of money-back guarantee, perhaps through a higher lump-sum entitlement. However, Ministers do much to undermine the concept of consensus by not saying in response, &#147;That&#146;s an interesting idea; we&#146;ll take a look at it&#148;; instead, they accuse us of making uncosted commitments and coming up with ideas without foundation. They do not seem to understand that nobody except them has the ability to work all this through in detail&#151;not Her Majesty&#146;s Opposition, not the Liberal Democrats, not the right hon.

Will he look at the cost implications of higher or lower levels of take-up, and the impact on the cost of means-tested benefits in the future? Will he do that work, because he has the teams of people to do it&#151;I do not have them, and neither do the Liberal Democrats? After he has done that work, will he lay a paper before this House? We could then have private and public meetings; let us discuss these issues and between us try to work out a solution.

 The trouble is that whenever we try to engage in a constructive discussion of what we might do, a Labour Member pulls the debate back to a simplistic option. None of us has any desire to reduce the amount that our pensioners, and particularly our poorest pensioners, receive. I happen to think that the Government have introduced a means-testing system that is much too complex, but I have no desire to remove money from the pockets of the poorest pensioners; they struggle enough as it is. Nevertheless, it is important to get this matter right. The hon. Gentleman should understand that; he should have a private chat with his colleague the right hon. Member for Birkenhead, who understands these issues far better than any other Labour Member. There are many other aspects of the Bill that need to be properly debated, but this is one that they must get right.</p>

 Does my hon.

This is not insincere indignation on our part; it is a genuine concern. It is extremely disappointing that the Secretary of State fails to take this issue seriously&#151;and, perhaps, to give figures at the Dispatch Box today&#151;not least for those who may well lose out if we do not get this right.</p>

We&#146;re happy to open our books and have a dialogue, and to work through models and alternatives, and to make all that public and let the Committee discuss it, so we can really work through this issue properly.&#148; I still hope that they will offer to do that.</p>

 I am genuinely puzzled. The hon. Gentleman does not make a sufficiently clear distinction between state pension provision and occupational pension provision. Let us consider any modelling or any actuarial assumptions that he might choose. Employment patterns, for example, have changed over the past 10 years. Even the Government Actuary has had to keep changing assumptions over the past 10 years. There is a notion that if we talk for long enough we will arrive at the proper answer. The Turner report tried to reach a compromise between what the state does and what the individual does. Tapering of benefits has always been a problem. The hon. Gentleman needs to be a little clearer about what he considers to be the alternative to the Government&#146;s answer to long-recognised problems.  <br>

Essentially, he has slagged off the Government. The hon.

 If the hon. Lady really had taken an active interest in pensions for all those years she would understand both the difference between a DB scheme and a DC scheme in terms of the issue of mis-selling and that the original Turner report made its recommendations on the assumption that there would be no expansion of means-testing&#151;indeed, that the opposite would be the case. I have made a request to the Secretary of State and the Minister in the spirit of the consensus of us all wanting these reforms to work. I hope that that will be taken up in the winding-up speech or at any stage over the next few weeks, as it is essential that we get this right.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o169"><a name="80107-0012.htm_para8"><a name="08010718000153">Let me turn to other areas where there remain issues that need to be debated. Ministers need to explain in much more detail how they are addressing the issue of levelling down. Concerns have been raised about that in the debate, and it has been raised as a concern by the PPI and actuaries over the past few weeks. Ministers have not had that much to say about it. The Secretary of State tried to reassure us but did not address all the issues. There is a danger that many small employers will choose to close down existing provision, including some of the stakeholder schemes that got off the ground as part of the Government&#146;s last set of reforms. The risk is that if levelling down does take place the amount saved will be affected and there will not be the increase in overall saving levels that we want to see.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o170"><a name="80107-0012.htm_para9"><a name="08010718000154">Ministers should remember that the success of these reforms will depend not only on attracting more savers, but on generating higher overall saving. That is why the Secretary of State must do better in ensuring a level playing field for different types of pension provision, and particularly different types of pension product. It would be disastrous if existing provision was downgraded because it was easier to operate a system of personal accounts.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o171"><a name="80107-0012.htm_para10"><a name="08010718000155">That is why the Government&#146;s failure to sort out the issue of auto-enrolment for group personal pensions is so disappointing. There is no logical reason why auto-enrolment should be acceptable for personal accounts but not for group personal pensions. We know that, in fact, the reason that has not happened is European law, but why have not Ministers sorted this out in Brussels? Does anyone actually believe that the Secretary of State&#146;s French counterpart would not have sorted things out by now? There might even be solutions that avoid Brussels altogether. There have been detailed discussions between the Secretary of State&#146;s Department and the industry, which has identified possible solutions to this problem, but he and his team have not acted on them. Why not? Will he introduce amendments to the Bill in Committee that will address this issue?</p>

 It is disappointing again to hear a Labour Member trying to divert attention from what are, as the Secretary of State rightly pointed out, serious issues relating to a serious Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o172"><a name="80107-0012.htm_para11"><a name="08010718000158">A number of important technical aspects of these reforms also need to be debated in detail, and I hope that Ministers will be ready to listen to sensible advice on them. We know that this Bill has been rushed into the House for entirely unrelated parliamentary reasons, and, as a result, too many details remain unresolved and too many clauses leave most of the important elements to subsequent regulations. We will need a lot more information as it is considered in Committee. Let us take the example of lump-sum contributions to personal accounts. Many groups are arguing that people who save in personal accounts should be able to make one-off contributions to them. I understand the logic of, for example, allowing people who take a career break to make catch-up contributions, but Ministers must not forget the nature of the product that they are launching. A pension plan that allows only 0.3 per cent. for running and marketing costs is going to be as basic as basic can be in the pensions world. Proper advice to savers is not going to be available. I am not convinced that it would be right to encourage payment of lump sums such as an inheritance into a personal account when proper independent advice cannot be obtained first. I hope that Ministers will address that issue as the Bill goes into Committee.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o173"><a name="80107-0012.htm_para12"><a name="08010718000159">Ministers must handle the enforcing of auto-enrolment&#151;the Bill does not contain all that much on this&#151;with extreme care. There is rightly a duty of auto-enrolment on employers, and there will rightly be a sanctions regime for those who do not comply; equally, we know that employers are going to be at the sharp end. They will receive questions from employees about what to do, and they will be unable to avoid ending up in some form of discussion with them. There is precious little in the Bill to explain how those conflicting pressures will be balanced.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o174"><a name="80107-0012.htm_para13"><a name="08010718000160">There is also far too little in the Bill about the role and remit of the personal accounts delivery authority. We want to see a much clearer definition in the Bill of the role of the authority and its successor body. We want clear provisions that prevent mission creep in the years ahead. The authority will become, if not the biggest, certainly one of the biggest pension organisations in the UK. If we are not careful, it could have a significant and disruptive impact on other aspects of the pensions market. It has an important role to perform, but that role should be properly defined and set in statute.</p>

to provide the protection that investors rightly expect, but it is not our job to do the pensions industry&#146;s job for it. Over the past decade, the Government have interfered much too much in the detailed management of pension schemes. They have made it more difficult to run schemes, more difficult to adapt to changing circumstances and more difficult to innovate. That should change. Many of the professional bodies in this field have put forward ideas that have the potential to help pension provision evolve and improve; some of them require deregulatory measures of a kind that this Bill simply does not address. We will press the Government in Committee on such improvements, and I hope that Ministers will respond constructively to those discussions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o177"><a name="80107-0012.htm_para16"><a name="08010718000163">My second point relates to the timing of the measures set out in the Bill. As the Secretary of State knows, the reform package introduced by his predecessors had a specific target start-date of 2012, and he is required to set a date for the re-linking of the basic state pension to earnings by the end of this Parliament. Given that this Parliament came within one green bottle of ending last October, can he confirm definitively to the House today when the full reform package will come into force? Will it be introduced in 2012? We now know about the discussions that have taken place on personal accounts, but will the rest of the package&#151;in particular, the re-linking of the state pension to earnings&#151;start in 2012? I will happily take an intervention now from the Secretary of State if he wants to answer that question; if not, I ask the Minister to address it in his winding-up speech.</p>

They have presided over the rapid decline of our pension system and let down many of our most vulnerable elderly people. Their past efforts at reform have failed abysmally. The one man on the Labour Benches who appeared to have any idea how to tackle our pensions challenge had his ministerial career summarily terminated by the then Prime Minister&#151;probably because he is smarter than him. I want these reforms to work and this Bill to make a difference not just because they are right for the pensions of tomorrow and for all our futures, but because we fully intend that a Conservative Government will implement these reforms in four years&#146; time.</p>

Through the actions of the Secretary of State and his team, the lives of those people and their families, although not put back together exactly as they were, have been massively changed. Many people will now go into retirement without having heart attacks and various other terrible illnesses brought down upon them through the feeling of injustice that they were suffering in not getting the due deserts of their pension savings.</p>

the wider debate on pensions. Although we might say that only 140,000 families were affected, every one of those families were affected 100 per cent. All those families had children, grandchildren, neighbours and friends, and they all went about their business cursing the day that they saved, either voluntarily or because they were told to, for their retirement pension. Newspapers were putting forward the message throughout the country that it is not sensible to save for old age through any pension scheme. We could not have had a serious debate on pension reform until we brought justice and closure to that group of people. Although those wounds will take some time to heal, those people are not now instructing their children and grandchildren not to behave like their parents and grandparents, who foolishly saved for their retirement income. They now know that although they had to wait&#151;as we, in a lesser sense, had to wait&#151;for justice to be done, it has been done. Not only has justice been done for the individual; a different atmosphere has been established for people who are thinking about planning long-term savings for their retirement.</p>

However, I do want to sound a genuine note of caution about the consensus that even the Opposition share on this measure, because I do not share even their sense that the Bill is going in the right direction. Whenever we discuss pensions, we wind ourselves up into a moral fervour because we are desperately anxious to get them right, and to do well by our constituents and our country. Not that long ago, we were debating stakeholder schemes and being told that they were the great solution that would solve everything. I disagreed with my party on that, because I did not think that they would do anything like the claims that were being made for them. I did not think them dangerous; I just did not think that people would buy the damn silly schemes, and, to a large extent, they have not done so.</p>

If we are to be responsible to our constituents, we must address two dangers. First, we do not know where we will be in the business cycle when the new scheme comes into force. The Government have been extraordinarily well judged in running the economy. The 10 years of growth, which follow growth from 1992, are a remarkable achievement of governance and the benefits to our constituents have been enormous, but we might be foolish to think that we have abolished what used to be called the trade cycle and has more recently been called recession.</p>

An official Government-sponsored scheme that lays down a modest contribution from employers towards the pension coverage of their employees will be coming on stream, and I fear that many employers, who at the moment would not think of cutting their contribution to their occupational pension scheme, or even to personal  <br>

They would, in a sense, feel justified, in that this is the new state scheme and they would still be fulfilling what is required. What the Government rightly judge to be a minimum floor on which to build may become a horrendous ceiling over which contributions do not rise. Thus, the big issue that the Government are genuinely grappling with and have put a huge effort into&#151;I admire the way that they have gone about their task&#151;might result in even less saving being undertaken than happens now.</p>

Labour Members would all be jumping up and down saying that this is the beginning of the next horrendous mis-selling scandal. It will be different from the previous one in that it will be Government inspired, and our poor constituents will not be able to take the Government to court in the way that they have tried to do over previous mis-selling.</p>

They may have high hopes that they will one day climb the occupational ladder and make returns for their labour that ensure that they get a fantastic pension in retirement, but we know that many who start out at the bottom sadly too often end there. Tonight, we might be beginning to introduce legislation that will require compulsory savings by groups of people who would not see things in such terms. They want to look after themselves, to save and to be independent&#151;they have all those noble aspirations&#151;but at the end of the day they will not be able to save anything like enough to take them free of means tests and make themselves one penny better off. Before the Bill passes this House and receives its Third Reading, we owe it to those people, the most vulnerable in our community, to address that issue and that group of workers seriously.</p>

The PPF could be given the role of speeding up the administration of the FAS and its new characteristics. I press the Secretary of State, if he has not already done so, to consider that option urgently as a way of ensuring that those pensioners get the money that they are now due to receive as quickly and as happily as possible.</p>

Some of the features embodied in the Bill are welcome&#151;for example, the principle of automatic enrolment, the principle of compulsory employer contributions and the principle of low charges, although I have concerns about how we can be sure that that will continue once the personal accounts board takes over from the Personal Accounts Delivery Authority&#151;based as they are, in part, on the only relevant international example, the New Zealand KiwiSaver scheme, which is delivering some benefits in that country. The Liberal Democrats have proposed such a scheme with such characteristics for a number of years, so it would be churlish not to recognise that the Government have come forward with a proposal that has many welcome features.</p>

 The Secretary of State is of course right to point out the history of the debate, which goes back&#151;as he mentioned in his speech&#151;to the days of Lloyd George. The more recent history shows that this consensus has taken some development, although the proposal in the Bill is different in some respects from that made by Adair Turner&#151;and rightly so, because the position has evolved with arguments from industry, political parties and so on.

suggests an attitude that is not especially open to new ideas. It does not suggest that the Government are willing to put their shoulder to the wheel to find new ideas to resolve the problem. It is not a question of scare tactics, but of a debate between people who want to try to find a way to make the scheme work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o189"><a name="80107-0013.htm_para10"><a name="08010720000015">I warn the Secretary of State that the slightly shrill tone that he adopted in parts of his speech was unfortunate, because it will give some people outside the House the impression that the Government are trying to hide something. We should avoid that impression.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o190"><a name="80107-0013.htm_para11"><a name="08010720000016">The key question is whether the scheme will work for the target audience. As the Secretary of State outlined in his speech, the benefits are potentially huge. Estimates vary, but between 6 million and 9 million&#151;even up to 10 million&#151;people could benefit from a properly constructed personal account scheme. So the prize is significant. I draw the Secretary of State&#146;s attention to some groups that will not be able to take part in personal accounts, such as the very low paid, for perhaps obvious reasons, as well as those who may have several jobs that are paid below the minimum threshold. In my constituency, for example, many people work in the tourist industry on a seasonal basis, with one job in the summer and another in the winter in the ski industry&#151;for as long as climate change allows that to continue. Each job may pay less than &#163;5,000, but the total earnings over the year may take them well above the threshold. The way in which the scheme is set up&#151;I understand the reasons behind that, such as cost minimisation&#151;means that such people would not be able to benefit from a personal account. The tourism sector might be one in which the benefits will not be as widely felt as perhaps they should.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o191"><a name="80107-0013.htm_para12"><a name="08010720000017">The key issue is means-testing. Since 1997, means-testing for pensioners has substantially increased. The Pensions Policy Institute estimates that overall levels of eligibility for any means-tested benefit are likely to be 50 per cent. in 2050, although they could be as high as 65 per cent. Its estimate suggests that 40 per cent. will be in receipt of pension credit, but other means-tested benefits at stake include council tax benefit and housing benefit. I realise that making predictions about the benefit system in 2050 is hard, but we have to base our approach on where we are at the moment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o192"><a name="80107-0013.htm_para13"><a name="08010720000018">In addition to the potential problems for personal accounts, the means-testing strategy has wider problems. Many people do not claim means-tested benefits because of their complexity. For example, more than 1.5 million pensioners eligible for pension credit do not claim it. In recent years, council tax bills have gone up substantially, but only 53 per cent. of pensioners claim the council tax benefit to which they are entitled. Means-testing also erodes the returns from saving and reduces incentives to save.</p>

are entitled, and using the fact that some do not as an argument in favour of the scheme seems wrong. It does however reinforce the importance of a basic state pension that raises people above the poverty line and forms the firm foundation that is needed to make the personal accounts workable for everybody.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o193"><a name="80107-0013.htm_para14"><a name="08010720000021">The Pensions Policy Institute analysis shows that the people who run a high risk of personal accounts being unsuitable are likely to receive back less than the value of their contributions. The institute has highlighted several groups, including single people who are likely to rent in retirement and have no additional savings. Those people are likely to qualify for less means-tested housing benefit as a consequence of saving in a personal account. In 2005, 20 per cent. of pensioner households were eligible for housing benefit, which is likely&#151;according to the PPI&#151;to place them in the high-risk group. The latest projection suggests that that figure could fall to 15 per cent. if current home ownership trends continue, but the interaction between personal accounts and housing benefit is a critically important part of the argument that must not be lost in the debate.</p>

 That is an important point which we would all be more able to understand if we were given access to the Government&#146;s model. That would be a start to a more open approach to building a consensus. The hon. Gentleman is right.</p>

Those people could lose entitlement to pension credit, council tax benefit or housing benefit as a consequence of saving, depending on their circumstances.</p>

Therefore, to argue that everybody, no matter what their personal circumstances, should save risks the sort of mis-selling scandal that the right hon. Member for Birkenhead predicted. The question is what can be done about that problem, and several ideas have been floated, such as increasing the trivial commutation limit. The PPI has suggested a disregard. Both ideas have been knocked down by the Secretary of State on the basis of what he calls affordability, but it is inconceivable, in circumstances in which the number of people of pension age rises significantly in the next 30 to 40 years, that the proportion of our national income that we spend on pensions should not also rise.</p>

next 20 to 25 years, but the number of people claiming pensions will rise. That suggests that the cake is being divided in such a way that pensioners will receive ever smaller crumbs. That is not the way to provide a firm foundation so that people can save for themselves. That is why the Liberal Democrats propose a citizen&#146;s pension, so that the basic state pension raises people above the poverty line, whereas at the moment people have to rely on pension credit for that in most cases.</p>

 Does the hon. Gentleman accept that the point about the citizen&#146;s pension is not how much it is but that everybody receives it? One of the fundamental issues on which his party is wrong is that people have a sense that they should contribute towards their pension. Initially I was attracted to the idea of the citizen&#146;s pension, but the contributory principle is important.

 Given the fact that over recent years Governments have dramatically eroded the contributory principle in a range of ways, the idea that it should be treated as a shibboleth in the pensions world is wrong. The proposal is that the citizen&#146;s pension should be based on residency. One of its benefits would be for women. The hon.

The UK pensions system is hugely complicated&#151;the most complex in the western world&#151;with all its ifs, buts, caveats, contributory principles, means tests and so on, to exclude a relatively small number of people from a pension that would keep them from poverty in retirement.</p>

It would be nice to know, but as we said at the time of the last Pensions Bill, uprating in line with earnings should be introduced now. Why should the basic state pension, which is lower in real terms than it was in the 1950s, continue to fall in real terms until 2012 or 2015?

 I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his interest, but we need to aim for what is defined as the poverty line&#151;the minimum income guarantee in the current pension credit. My maths is not quick enough to work out whether that would be 25 per cent. but it probably does not quite reach that amount. The hon. Gentleman&#146;s proposal is a further degree of ambition, from a policy and financial point of view, to which I cannot agree at this stage.

A wide range of factors will affect people&#146;s decision about whether it is worth their while to save: age, future earnings, whether they plan to take time off work, the sort of work they do and their level of personal indebtedness. Advice will be required on all those factors. It may be relatively straightforward to reflect some of them in a generic advice system, but it will be much harder to do so for others, such as the affordability of contributions, indebtedness or likely future earnings.

The Government should actively work with the financial services industry to achieve a national roll-out of independent advice centres, providing financial health checks and advice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o204"><a name="80107-0014.htm_para6"><a name="08010720000042">At present, following the new polarisation rules, it is difficult for many consumers to obtain independent financial advice. The CAB provides advice, but usually only for people who are already in debt difficulty. A network providing genuinely independent advice would be in the best interests of the financial industry, the pensions industry and particularly the Government in relation to personal accounts. It would help to restore confidence. Clients could be offered advice on a wide range of issues, including personal accounts. Setting up such a network, with proper resources from the taxpayers, not from personal account holders or through the Personal Accounts Delivery Authority, would enable us to offer the range of advice people need.</p>

He was talking about the Government&#146;s disgraceful decision, sneaked out on 17 December in the House of Lords, that they had decided to make no change in the current rules to allow individuals to buy additional national insurance contributions&#151;to top up their contributions to take advantage of the new rules that are coming in.

Committee, shows that 30 per cent. of employers contributing 3 per cent. or more say that they will level down to 3 per cent., with a further 19 per cent. saying that they have not yet decided how they will respond. The Minister may well have new evidence, but the Secretary of State said in his speech that half of employers would maintain or improve the conditions for new entrants to their pension schemes. That prompts the question: what will the other half do? The serious issue of levelling down therefore needs to be addressed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o208"><a name="80107-0014.htm_para10"><a name="08010720000046">Under the Bill, the resolution on the issue of workplace personal pensions is highly unsatisfactory. We are talking about an argument that the Government could win in Europe. It is simply not good enough for the Minister to put his hands up and say, &#147;We cannot persuade other European Governments.&#148; There is very little evidence to suggest that the Government have really tried. I suspect that if a proper effort were made to persuade other European Governments, it could be done quite simply, given the common-sense argument being advocated on automatic enrolment. The situation is perhaps evocative of the Government&#146;s attitude to matters European. Their attitude is to turn up to meetings with exceedingly bad grace, if they bother to turn up at all, not to contribute in the way that they could at the European level, and not to put forward the arguments for what they want. The argument is one that we could win.</p>

However welcome, well-thought-through and well-constructed they are, they have to benefit as large a section as possible of the target audience, which is people who do not currently save. That is why the arguments on means-testing and advice are so important. The Minister will have to do better in his reply than the Secretary of State did, and will have to do better throughout Committee to ensure that the issue is resolved, so that we can ensure a scheme that can genuinely be recommended to everyone in the target audience.</p>

worth having. If they had not intervened effectively to restore the stolen pensions of the 125,000 pensioners affected, the House would have had to understand what my right hon. Friend the Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field) said, which is that huge numbers of walking newspapers across the country would have been saying to their families, friends and communities, &#147;You&#146;ve got to be a mug to save.&#148; If the pensions guarantee was not a guarantee, it would have been worthless. The changes that the Secretary of State has been able to make really transform the context in which the debate takes place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o211"><a name="80107-0014.htm_para13"><a name="08010720000052">Between them, the Secretary of State and the Minister have done what none of their predecessors were willing to do. Predecessors did the House, and the Labour party, a disservice by requiring Labour Members to parade through the Division Lobbies making fools of themselves by claiming to support a financial assistance scheme that never did, and never would, work. We all owe both the Ministers of State and the Secretary of State a huge debt of gratitude for getting us out of a hole. However, let us try to put that in the context of where the Bill takes us. I have no doubt that as a society we need to save more and spend less. In a society that increasingly expects to live longer, the issue is more a biological than a political one. The question is how we make good provision for the increasing length of the part of our life that we expect to spend in old age, and in receipt of a pension. The question is how we get there.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o212"><a name="80107-0014.htm_para14"><a name="08010720000053">My worries about the Bill concern what it does not address, rather than what it tries to address. In a sense, it does not address the failures&#151;the legacy of successive Governments who have messed about with pensions provision and retreated from a policy that would genuinely be fit for the 21st century. We are still not addressing our collective failure to restore the value of the state pension, as well as its link with earnings. We are not addressing our failure to halt the retreat from defined-benefit schemes, and the drift into defined-contribution schemes. We are not addressing questions about the ability of the poor to pay into schemes&#151;a concern that a number of Members have legitimately raised&#151;and we are not addressing the failure to challenge our naive presumption that the market is a mechanism that will get us out of the pensions crisis, rather than take us into another one. I want to concentrate on those two final points.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o213"><a name="80107-0014.htm_para15"><a name="08010720000054">The question of who will save is inextricably linked to the issue of means-testing. We need to understand where we are, as a society and as an economy. The Institute for Public Policy Research has reported that 51 per cent. of those in low-income families have working parents. Some 2.5 million households need tax credits to give them a living wage. In addition, Britain is in the midst of our own credit and debt crisis. Last year, personal credit debt rose to &#163;1.35 trillion. UK gross domestic product stands at &#163;1.33 trillion. For the first time in our financial history, personal debt exceeds personal created wealth. That will present us with huge challenges in the year&#151;and years&#151;ahead.</p>

We will have to take a long, hard look at how we expect those who cannot afford to live to be in a position to afford to save. That is a practical, day-to-day issue, precisely as fuel poverty is: as we have expressed it, people are faced with a choice between heating and eating. The question is: how will those whom we wish to include in the new Pensions Bill schemes be able to afford it? We need to look at new mechanisms that address the question of affordability, and the most sensible starting point may well be tackling the current provision of &#163;20 billion a year or more that we give in pension credits to the wealthiest in the land. If we have to dip into that money to provide access for the poor, that would be a genuinely progressive and relevant measure.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o218"><a name="80107-0014.htm_para20"><a name="08010720000059">The question of who pays is likely to be dwarfed, however, by the question of where the money goes. How short a set of memories we seem to have. In 2002, there was a pensions and investment crisis. In that year alone, &#163;250 billion was wiped off the value of UK pension funds, because the deregulation of world financial markets resulted in pensions being increasingly drawn into short-term, speculative markets. When the bubble of those markets burst, inevitably what people thought were secure savings disappeared. We have not learned from that that there is an increasing incompatibility between short-term speculative markets and long-term, secure pension aspirations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o219"><a name="80107-0014.htm_para21"><a name="08010720000060">If we doubled the amount of money that went into UK pension funds in 2002, we would simply have doubled our losses. To double them today using the same mechanisms would throw petrol on the fire. We cannot pretend that by introducing a new mechanism while shovelling the money in the same direction would do anything other than accelerate the drift into the next crisis. The global credit crunch has been driven by precisely the same mechanisms that took us into the crisis in 2002. Sadly, creative accounting is used extensively in the banking and investment world, and Northern Rock is just the tip of the iceberg. Commentators in the United States have tried to analyse what happened in the off-balance sheet accounting world, which has transformed international banking. They have calculated the impact of what is referred to as &#147;toxic waste&#148; in the banking industry&#151;loans made upon insecure loans upon insecure loans. Using a mechanism outside accounting rules, the banks have created their own credit default swap clubs, in which they swap bad debts and spin them round the table to allow themselves to create more debt.  <br>

The scale of that activity is estimated to be &#163;45 trillion, or three times the size of the US economy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o220"><a name="80107-0014.htm_para22"><a name="08010720000061">It is no wonder that while central banks, whether in the US, the UK or Europe, have intervened to create credit for the banking world, banks will still not lend to one another, because they know how shaky the foundations are. Throwing more money into that crazy pot will simply accelerate the drive into the next crisis. We have to move the rules about where money goes in a different direction. In 2003, I helped to write a pamphlet on people&#146;s pensions that looked at the ways in which the allocation of pension savings had changed in the past 50 or 60 years. I shall give the House just one set of figures. In 1962, 51 per cent. of the total pension fund assets in the UK were invested in UK Government bonds. Today, that figure stands at 9 per cent. Some 80 per cent. of pension fund contribution goes into private equities or corporate bonds, both of which have become increasingly short-term, speculative, mythical and, in some cases, illegal. The danger of throwing money in that direction is that it would simply accelerate the next crisis, which would be a repeat of the last one.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o221"><a name="80107-0014.htm_para23"><a name="08010720000062">We do not have to go down that path, and I should like to offer some suggestions to the Minister and the Secretary of State. Some 99 per cent. of share transactions trade in second-hand shares, and are decades away from the principal investment that built anything. They are just swap clubs for second-hand financial entities. If we genuinely want mechanisms that invite people to save, and if we want that saving to be a productive investment in their future security, we must direct those savings into investments in infrastructure, health, education, housing and environmental improvements and security. We could do so extremely easily. We contribute about &#163;50 billion a year to personal pension schemes. If the Bill delivers the Secretary of State&#146;s expectations, it will add another &#163;10 billion a year. If we used that money for infrastructure investments, we would not need a single private finance initiative scheme in the land. Last year, the Government received &#163;3.6 billion in capital receipts for the privatisation of public services. Across the piece, we pay an average of 16.6 per cent. interest on PFI schemes, which is an absurd charge on the taxpayer for the next 30 to 50 years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o222"><a name="80107-0014.htm_para24"><a name="08010720000063">If we paid half that rate of interest to bond holders, we could halve the rate of tax for taxpayers, and we would all be better off. Do we have the courage not only to include the poor in a comprehensive, 21st century pension package but to redirect how and where our savings are deployed? The Bill does not do so. It does not address the question of how the poor will participate, and it does not address the question of how those resources will be deployed productively, creatively and constructively to deliver long-term security for pensioners and society as a whole. If we fail to do so, we will end up passing a Bill that favours the City but not savers, which would be a tragedy for which the present generation and those who follow it would not forgive us.</p>

to do so, but this is an issue of which I have some knowledge as a result of my long association with the insurance industry and my chairmanship of the all-party insurance and financial services group since 1992&#151;a long period, throughout which issues relating to pension reform have been high on the agenda, and have often been raised by the industry and pension groups.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o223"><a name="80107-0015.htm_para0"><a name="08010720000065">I wish to begin by telling the Minister that there is genuine good will among pension providers towards the initiative, and they want it to succeed. In the spirit of the contribution by my hon. Friend the Member for Epsom and Ewell (Chris Grayling), however, may I tell him that good will is not enough? We have to face the fact that the issue of pension reform has dogged successive Governments for 25 years, and it is critical that we learn the lessons of past mistakes. It is not yet clear whether all the lessons of past failures have been fully taken on board in the Bill. When the previous Secretary of State, the right hon. Member for Barrow and Furness (Mr. Hutton), announced just over a year ago, in December 2006, the Government&#146;s intention to proceed with the Turner proposals for personal accounts, I asked him two questions. First, who would be responsible for information, advice and explanatory literature under the regime? Secondly, what would be the impact on existing schemes of the new floor of 3 per cent. of contributions? It is absolutely clear from today&#146;s debate that the answers to both questions remain unclear, so I want to concentrate on them in my brief remarks.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o224"><a name="80107-0015.htm_para1"><a name="08010720000066">The issue of information and advice is crucial. People need to make properly informed judgments about how much to invest in their pensions, whether to invest at all, or whether, difficult though the Secretary of State has reminded us it will be, to opt out of auto-enrolment altogether.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o225"><a name="80107-0015.htm_para2"><a name="08010720000067">Much has been said in this debate about the impact of means-tested benefits, and that is undoubtedly important. However, there will be a deterrent if people think that saving is not worth the sacrifice. We must address the issue, and I hope that the Minister will have something more positive to say in his winding-up speech.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o226"><a name="80107-0015.htm_para3"><a name="08010720000068">We should be in no doubt that it is difficult to judge in advance whether low-paid employees should stay in the schemes, because there are so many unknown and imponderable factors. What will the contributions during a working life be worth come retirement age? How much income will those contributions then generate? What will annuity and interest rates be like? What will be the impact of inflation at that time? What type of annuity should people buy? Will employment experience and record over a long period enable an individual to build up a worthwhile investment record through their fund? Those questions are critically important, but the answers are extremely difficult to predict in this debate today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o227"><a name="80107-0015.htm_para4"><a name="08010720000069">Not only the Government but Parliament and the country are in a Catch-22 situation on the issue of means-tested benefits. It is clear to me&#151;and I think this was what the Secretary of State was trying to hint at in his robust exchange with my hon. Friend the Member for Epsom and Ewell&#151;that unless people make provision for their retirement in much greater numbers, pressure to provide help through means-tested targeted benefits will remain. It will be there for all Governments. However, affordability will eventually be the issue. How much  <br>

longer can we afford our expectations, given that there will be two employees per pensioner to fund everything on pay-as-you-go? Clearly, we will not be able to.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o228"><a name="80107-0015.htm_para5"><a name="08010720000070">In a sense, we should not be debating whether the existing structure of means-tested benefits will continue indefinitely but whether the principle and philosophy should be that people must realise that they should save for their own provision because there will be limits on what the state can provide in the future. That has nothing to do with whether one political side or the other wants to be more generous or has a greater feel for low-income pensioners&#146; problems; it is the reality that we are beginning to face.</p>

However, today we face what in principle is a good idea and scheme, but one that, if we are not careful, will be wrecked or undermined because of the expectation that the state will always provide in the end. The right hon. Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field) was exactly right, and I shall come to his point in a moment. We have to address the issue before this Bill leaves the House. Unless people who invest in the personal accounts and choose not to opt out believe that they will be better off as a result, the provision will fail&#151;for exactly the reasons given by the right hon. Member for Birkenhead. It is not rocket science. The Help the Aged briefing note makes clear a number of ways in which the issue could be resolved. I urge the Minister to take them on board.</p>

Advice also adds to cost, which undermines return and value. The Government themselves were criticised by the parliamentary ombudsman for the misleading nature of Government leaflets on occupational pensions. The Secretary of State made a comment about sending messages, and that is precisely the point. The Conservative Government in office in the Parliament before I was elected, when I was working in the financial services and insurance industry, actively encouraged people to get out of occupational pensions and into personal pensions. Even the state said that portable pensions were the things to have. However, that turned out to be completely wrong and we are in danger of doing the same thing again.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o232"><a name="80107-0015.htm_para9"><a name="08010720000074">Ideally, advice should be available, but it is unlikely that it can be given on an individual basis in the current regulatory framework. The all-party group on insurance and financial services keenly awaits the outcome of the Thoresen review on generic financial advice. I am not as pessimistic as some of my hon. Friends, including my hon. Friend the Member for Epsom and Ewell; I think that Thoresen may provide a solution. We need to foster greater understanding of what people do with their pension investments, insurance products and so on. They should be absolutely clear, but for that the detail must be right.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o233"><a name="80107-0015.htm_para10"><a name="08010720000075">My hon. Friend made a point that concerns me. There is an opportunity for people, without advice, to put lump sums into personal accounts instead of, with advice, putting lump sums into other investments that may not be pension investments at all. That concerns me.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o234"><a name="80107-0015.htm_para11"><a name="08010720000076">I shall deal briefly with my next point, because my time is going. The Secretary of State said that most employers were unlikely to reduce existing contribution levels. I would like to share his optimism but, as the right hon. Member for Birkenhead clearly said, the future is less certain and if employers are under financial pressure, they may reduce them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o235"><a name="80107-0015.htm_para12"><a name="08010720000077">However, my greater concern&#151;and the point that I made in my intervention on the Secretary of State&#151;is the continuing demise of defined-benefit provision. There may be reason to believe that the haemorrhage has been stemmed for the moment. However, the signs are crystal clear: remarkably few young workers in the private sector&#151;our children&#151;will enjoy a final salary or defined-benefit pension. That is an appalling shame, because such pensions were the bedrock of employment for the generation that preceded ours and our generation. What is the result? Comparisons with the public sector are already putting pressure on the retention of defined-benefit schemes, our parliamentary pensions included. In defined-benefit schemes, the employer takes all the risk; in defined-contribution schemes, the employee takes all the risk. There must be a middle way. The Association of Consulting Actuaries proposal may not be perfect, but I say to the Minister that the Bill is an opportunity for further reform. Conditional indexation works in Holland; I am about to get married to a lady from Holland, and I recommend all things Dutch to the Minister.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o236"><a name="80107-0015.htm_para13"><a name="08010720000078">Time does not allow me to address the many other issues. I agree with all that has been said about the group personal pension problem, which must be resolved. However, there is a lesson there as well. I believe that that problem is an unintended consequence of European Union rules on distance selling. Nobody thought that the rules would have that effect when they were approved in Statutory Instrument Committees. Similarly, we need to be clear that there will not be unintended consequences from the existing provision for the new personal accounts, the Personal Account Delivery Authority structure and the regulatory framework.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o237"><a name="80107-0015.htm_para14"><a name="08010720000079">If good intentions and an aspiration for consensus and progress were sufficient, we would not be in this position. We have one last chance to get this right, and if we fail this time, we fail a whole generation and beyond of future pensioners. As many colleagues who know me are aware, I am an optimist&#151;a glass-half-full person, not a glass-half-empty person&#151;but the half-empty glass needs to be filled in Committee; otherwise, I share the concern of the right hon.

has suggested that there has been a lot more criticism than one gets a sense of from all the briefings from various organisations in the financial sector and charities that work with older people. In most cases, those briefings welcome the principles of the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o238"><a name="80107-0015.htm_para15"><a name="08010720000081">As the Secretary of State said, the issue of pensions is not about old people; it must be a young person&#146;s issue. For the first time in this House, the Bill looks far into the future, dealing with how future generations will make provision for the pensions system. As my hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham, South (Alan Simpson) said, this is about demographics and biology as much as anything else. As the hon. Member for Ryedale (Mr. Greenway) pointed out, we must make it easier for people to save for their retirement and make their own contributions to the pension pot. If the demographics determine that more and more people are not paying into their own pension provision, the state will not be able to deliver anything, no matter whether one believes that the state pension should be linked to earnings, that it should exist at all or that it should be uprated. We must ensure that it is as easy as possible for future generations to pay as much as they possibly can into their pension.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o239"><a name="80107-0015.htm_para16"><a name="08010720000082">I want to concentrate on two areas that the Government have to get right in order for the system to work: first, preventing any kind of levelling down; and secondly, getting the costs right by ensuring that they are as low as possible. Several hon. Members have mentioned their fear of levelling down. Personal accounts will work only if they are targeted at the particular audience that they are aimed at, which is not the 40 per cent. of people who already have occupational or private pensions, but the 60 per cent. who have no extra provision other than that which they pay through national insurance contributions or the state second pension. The Bill will have done nothing if all it does is transfer people out of very good or even quite reasonable occupational pension schemes and into personal accounts. The scheme is not for them. We must be clear that the Government are not saying that all occupational pension provision should be delivered through personal accounts, because those who are in good occupational schemes with contributions of 16 per cent. or more are able to deliver up to two thirds of their earned income as their retirement income. Personal accounts must be a floor, never a ceiling. Eight per cent. is only half of 16 per cent. I hope that once the system beds down in the years to come, if the consensus is right and this is the way forward for pension provision, Governments of the future will try to raise the contribution level beyond 8 per cent. For the time being, however, it must be seen as a floor, and it is clearly not aimed at employers who already provide good occupational schemes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o240"><a name="80107-0015.htm_para17"><a name="08010720000083">The scheme will be aimed at those who are on low or medium incomes. A large number of the people who are missing out on occupational schemes are women. This will improve the coverage that women have in terms of pension provision. The whole system will fail if few people enrol in the new personal accounts and the savings ratio does not shift at all. We need more people to enrol and to make higher contributions than at present.</p>

<p><a name="st_o313"><a name="08010720000084"><a name="80107-0015.htm_spnew2"><a name="08010720000180"><b>Mr. Graham Stuart:</b>

workers with broken employment records, contribute to the scheme when they can least afford it because they are auto-enrolled and end up at the end of their lives no better off as a result. That would be the true disaster, not the fact that yet another Government initiative, like the stakeholder pension before it, has failed, because we are well used to that with this Government.</p>

<p><a name="st_o314"><a name="08010720000085"><a name="80107-0015.htm_spnew3"><a name="08010720000181"><b>Miss Begg:</b>
 Obviously the hon. Gentleman can see into the future far better than I can. We do not know what kind of Governments will come in, whether they will continue with any kind of means-testing or whether the pension credit will survive. We are looking up to 50 years into the future, not at the next 10 years or so. As we do not know what will happen, it must be right that we encourage young people to save as much as they possibly can today in order that the scenario that the hon. Gentleman describes does not happen in future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o241"><a name="80107-0015.htm_para18"><a name="08010720000086">Whatever the system with regard to the state pension, if we are dependent on all pension provision in future being down to the state, means-testing will grow, not lessen. To ensure that means-testing develops a much narrower focus, we must encourage more and more people to invest in their pension today so that when it comes to retirement they will already have lifted themselves out of any kind of means-testing. People do not know what their employment record is going to be. Since the second world war, there have been huge changes in the working patterns of women. The Bill moves us ever closer to individual entitlements and away from the old dependency culture that existed under the married person&#146;s allowance and the basic state pension. Pension provision and the working lives of women and men have changed so much in the past 60 years that I foresee that in the next 10 or 20 years they will change a huge amount more. The basic message that we have to get over is that it is important that individuals who are working today continue to save in an occupational scheme so that they will have more than just what the state is able to provide through the basic state pension.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o242"><a name="80107-0015.htm_para19"><a name="08010720000087">It is important that we understand that this is about deferred wages. Many people have not opted into some of the very good occupational schemes even when they have not had to pay anything themselves. I remember speaking to one young man who had lost out on 10 per cent. of his wages because he had not got around to signing the form, although he was not even expected to add anything to his employer&#146;s contributions. Compulsory opt-in is very important in terms of getting over that inertia. We must ensure that there is auto-enrolment and that people do not have to make such decisions. We must also bear in mind low earners who have multiple jobs. As the hon. Member for Beverley and Holderness (Mr. Stuart) said, they are mostly women who have to find some way of increasing what they can contribute. I can understand why there is currently a contribution cap of &#163;3,600&#151;it is obviously because the Government do not want people who are sitting in fairly good schemes to move their contributions across into personal accounts, which are not aimed at that market. I hope that once the scheme beds down, the contributions cap can be lifted.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o243"><a name="80107-0015.htm_para20"><a name="08010720000088">The cost must be as low as possible. I would like it to be as low as three basis points. People say that 1 per cent. does not sound very much&#151;it does not, but that  <br>

was probably partly the death knell of the stakeholder pension. It is 1 per cent. not as a flat rate of contributions but 1 per cent. of the pension pot; once someone has built a big pot, 1 per cent. becomes a viable amount to be taking out of it every year. I hope that we can get it down to 0.5 per cent., but if possible it should be even lower. If the scheme is going to work, it is crucial that costs are kept as low as possible.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o244"><a name="80107-0015.htm_para21"><a name="08010720000089">I welcome the Bill. I am glad that there was generally consensus on its principles, although other areas will have to be worked through as it proceeds through this House and the other place.</p>

 It is a pleasure to follow the hon. Member for Aberdeen, South (Miss Begg). She is right to mention the special problems that women face with regard to pensions, but perhaps that is not a debate for tonight.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o245"><a name="80107-0015.htm_para22"><a name="08010720000091">Giving pensioners a fairer deal, which means a greater share of the nation&#146;s wealth, is long overdue. I warmly congratulate the Government on the pensions review and their response to the Turner report. However, let me set the Bill in context. The incoming Labour Government in 1997 took over one of the strongest pension systems in Europe, which is now one of the poorest. They committed an appalling robbery on people&#146;s private pensions, which still costs pensioners some &#163;7 billion every year and has added to the downfall of many schemes. One of the most damaging and surprising failures of the Labour Administration since 1997 is that their policies have led to a fall in the share of British national wealth that goes to pensioners. Frankly, I expected better from Labour on that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o246"><a name="80107-0015.htm_para23"><a name="08010720000092">Pensioners see &#163;25 billion thrown at the Northern Rock problem and wonder at the absence of the financial constraints that the Government always claim to be under when pensioners need help. What about the Government&#146;s failure on the Equitable Life debacle and their breach of trust on police pay? I put it to the House that this is no time for politicians to say, &#147;Trust me, I&#146;m a fairly straight sort of guy&#148;, as Mr. Blair once infamously did. It is time to get all-party consensus on a decent system to take politics out of pensions and to take more pensioners out of relative poverty. It is particularly galling to see, as we do, our pensioners&#146; share of Britain&#146;s wealth falling, when they built Britain&#146;s institutions and national wealth after they won national and international security in world war two. Hon. Members do not see things in that way, but pensioners do. It is against that legacy that people&#146;s trust in Government policies, particularly on pensions and savings, must be viewed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o247"><a name="80107-0015.htm_para24"><a name="08010720000093">I acknowledge and welcome the fact that the Government have followed the Pension Commission&#146;s recommendations on the broad scheme design. While the Bill needs fine tuning, I support its key objectives to encourage more people to save in workplace pension plans and to create a new system of personal accounts.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o248"><a name="80107-0015.htm_para25"><a name="08010720000094">I turn now to the specific principles of the Bill. It is right legally to force employers automatically to enrol their eligible employees. The Government should guarantee the quality of those workplace pension schemes and, through the Bill, deliver a strong framework for the introduction by 2012 of well-governed personal accounts.  <br>

The scheme must be flexible and avoid the baffling complexity that dogs the current pension saving systems. That will help to target specifically the needs of below-average earners, thereby ensuring the highest economically sound levels of participation. Savers must not lose because they have saved. That issue must be addressed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o249"><a name="80107-0015.htm_para26"><a name="08010720000095">It is crucial to ensure that the interaction between means-tested benefits and personal accounts does not lead to benefit losses and thereby act as a disincentive from saving for low earners. I accept that if it is designed correctly the scheme can give millions of low to moderate earners first-time access to secure and worthwhile workplace pensions savings with decent and affordable contributions from their employer. I believe that the 3 per cent. level given in clause 18 is right at the moment. There must be stability on that point, at least in the medium term if not for ever. As the hon. Member for Aberdeen, South and the right hon. Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field) pointed out, the Government must find a way, if possible, to prevent employers from reducing the current contribution levels.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o250"><a name="80107-0015.htm_para27"><a name="08010720000096">Clause 53 will enable the Secretary of State to set an annual contribution limit for personal accounts. I believe that &#163;3,600 has been mooted. That may be inadequate; the figure should perhaps be higher. In addition, there should be flexibility so that individuals can, from time to time, pay in lump sums when they can afford to, if it is financially sound for them to do so and providing that they receive proper independent advice. The Government should find a way to ensure that they do. That would help people who start saving for a pension later in life, and who need to make up for lost time. Those people represent a significant number of workers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o251"><a name="80107-0015.htm_para28"><a name="08010720000097">I agree with Help the Aged, Age Concern and the People&#146;s Pensions Coalition that there should be a distinct lifetime lump sum limit alongside the annual contribution limit. That would allow people to pay money into their pensions from small inheritances, divorce settlements, redundancy payments and other windfalls. I do not see how that could be wrong provided that the people&#151;particularly low earners&#151;who chose to do so received proper advice. We should also consider the transfer of limited existing pension pots into and out of personal accounts to help people with various small pension funds. Again, that is not an unusual situation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o252"><a name="80107-0015.htm_para29"><a name="08010720000098">The Government must deliver on consolidating people&#146;s existing state pensions, including the state earnings-related pension scheme, graduated retirement benefit and the state second pension.

<p><a name="stpa_o260"><a name="80107-0016.htm_para7"><a name="08010720000107">The Bill represents the second stage of implementing the sort of proposals that emerged from the Turner review, and it has much to commend it. The problems, as many hon. Members have said, are stark: more than 7 million people do not save enough for their retirement, and only half those aged 35 or over and only one sixth of 20 to 24-year-olds are saving for a pension. The problem is most acute among low and medium earners.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o261"><a name="80107-0016.htm_para8"><a name="08010720000108">The Bill introduces several measures to tackle the problem, including reforming private pensions saving to ensure that qualifying workers are enrolled automatically into workplace pensions and providing for compulsory minimum employer contributions. There is much to commend both proposals, but I ask my hon. Friends on the Front Bench to take seriously some of the points that have been made, especially about the level of contribution. As my hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeen, South (Miss Begg) said, there may be a case for staging the amount, but it is important that we take seriously the point that my right hon.

There are no easy answers and anyone who pretends that there are has missed the point. In addressing the problem, I ask my hon. Friends on the Front Bench to consider a couple of matters. First, when the pension credit was introduced, its main thrust in the 1997-2001 Parliament was an incentive to save. Over time, it was merged with the minimum income guarantee, so that when people refer to the pension credit today, they tend to mean the lower rather than the upper element of it. There may be scope for reconsidering and perhaps rediscovering some of the early purposes of the pension credit to try to deal with the problems.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o263"><a name="80107-0016.htm_para10"><a name="08010720000110">Secondly, and perhaps more radically, I was struck by the point that my hon. Friend the Member for Blackpool, North and Fleetwood (Mrs. Humble) made when she rightly asked the Secretary of State to examine the position in Sweden and the value of good pension forecasts covering all elements of pension provision. The answer given was that, although there was something in her point, the pension structure in Sweden is different, and based much more on state provision. There are times when we should reassess the balance between state and private provision. Perhaps we can learn one or two things from the position in Scandinavia.</p>

I especially thank the current ministerial team, but I want to say something about previous Work and Pensions Ministers&#151;one of them, now the Minister for Competitiveness, has just sat down on the Front Bench&#151;because although I, and doubtless others, crossed swords with them for many years about the need to do more, it is fair to  <br>

It was partly to do to Ministers and partly to do with colleagues in this place, who maintained the pressure, month in, month out and year in, year out; it was certainly to do with the unions, which kept up the pressure and the campaign from outside, and with the tireless campaigners outside this place. It is worth mentioning Ros Altmann and her campaigning. Her representations were not always comfortable, but she was tenacious and her commitment is unquestioned. Ros Altmann urged us for years to consider the position of the existing assets of the failed schemes and putting them to use. That became a vital part of the Young review.</p>

Kalamazoo, one of the firms whose pension fund collapsed, is in my constituency. Members of that pension fund and those of other schemes, such as that of ASW, put in effort at which many of us can only marvel at a time when they were worried about not only their futures but security in retirement for their families. They kept up the pressure and refused to take no&#151;or even maybe&#151;for an answer. People such as Peter Wheeler and Brian Mealings, former Kalamazoo employees, were at the centre of the campaign from the word go. It is right to pay tribute to them.</p>

Members referred to the detail&#151;doubtless, many issues will be considered further in Committee. The measure will provide a framework for stronger pension provision than we have had for some time. However, difficult decisions will still need to be made, not only about what is right but about the protections that will be needed&#151;not tomorrow or next month, but in 20, 30 and perhaps 50 years. That will need to be combined with decisions about what is affordable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o269"><a name="80107-0016.htm_para16"><a name="08010720000116">There are many issues to consider, but I want to refer briefly to Baroness Hollis&#146;s proposal in another place. The Government presented a powerful argument about the affordability of her proposal and whether it would achieve the intended aims. However, the problem of women&#146;s pensions remains. If the method of tackling it in Baroness Hollis&#146;s proposal is not correct&#151;it may not be&#151;it nevertheless remains unfinished business. I hope that, as the Bill proceeds, Ministers will revert to the issue and tackle it in the coming weeks and months.</p>

strongest pension systems in Europe. As my hon. Friends have said, we have witnessed the calamitous loss of defined benefit pension schemes, partly as a consequence of such undermining. The hon. Member for Nottingham, South (Alan Simpson) powerfully showed that under this Government a massive escalation in personal debt has eclipsed the amount of national wealth created in a year.

Surely Labour Members have some care and some concern&#151;the old Labour party would have done so. Perhaps Labour Members of 20 years ago would have shown more social conscience.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o274"><a name="80107-0016.htm_para21"><a name="08010720000124">Few current Labour Members have worked in the private sector.

Commission report stated, but ultimately it will come out of what would have gone in pay to the employee. The money will not magically appear from the employer&#146;s secret pot. Employees of small businesses are often on low earnings and might have student debt or credit card debt, which has been promoted in the past few years. The employer will have a conversation with an employee who earns &#163;16,000 a year about whether that employee should take out one of the pension schemes. Can any hon. Member on either side of the House say that they would advise someone who earns &#163;16,000 a year and whose career trajectory does not suggest that they will ever earn vastly larger sums that they would be better off contributing towards the scheme, when we have no vision of a future picture of means-testing?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o276"><a name="80107-0016.htm_para23"><a name="08010720000126">The Secretary of State lashed out angrily, but he gave us no light. We need certainty and a consensus on what will happen with means-testing over the next decade so that people can make a rational decision about whether they should proceed. The truth is that many people who should be saving for their pension will not do so, because it will become known that it is not a wise thing to do. Ministers have singularly failed to tackle that issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o277"><a name="80107-0016.htm_para24"><a name="08010720000127">Turning to the powerful and devastating speech by the right hon. Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field), we are at risk of a double whammy. Ministers are laughing, because they are so out of touch with ordinary people that people making contributions and losing out is of no matter to them. They say, &#147;The consensus is all. We must be seen to take action.&#148; We face levelling down, because the minority who currently have decent pension provision in the private sector will see it decrease and the contribution by employers reduce in tough times. At the same time, those who should not be contributing to such a pension will be doing so out of very low earnings, when they have high levels of personal debt and their personal situation does not suggest any long-term benefit to them. They will do so, and will lose out. If Ministers do not take some of the issues raised across the House seriously, we could end up with a Bill that causes double damage to the British pension system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o278"><a name="80107-0016.htm_para25"><a name="08010720000128">Another topic that we have not heard anything about&#151;I will be interested to hear from the Minister about it later&#151;is protection. It is easy for us in this House to say, as the hon. Member for Aberdeen, South (Miss Begg) and other hon. Members did, that pensioners must be protected. Quite right. We all want them to be protected, but how will they be protected? What is there in the legislation that gives them protection? We have heard the rosy views of Ministers about what the return will be on the investment of the moneys put into this fund, or some aspects of it, but what if those returns prove to be disastrously poor? What guarantees are there? We could end up with a triple whammy, where people on low earnings who have made a contribution receive very little back, and who end up finding that the money they have invested has also done extremely badly, so that they lose out yet again. It is a serious issue, and I hope that the Minister will return to the question of what we can do to guarantee the benefits for people who invest in such a way.</p>

say, to be fair, that they should do so with the right advice. Having read the Bill, and on the basis of the provisions we have seen so far, we can have no certainty about such advice being properly available for those who are most vulnerable and likely to take a bad decision. Without that certainty, and reassurance on that point, we should not support a measure involving lump sums.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o280"><a name="80107-0016.htm_para27"><a name="08010720000130">The Secretary of State talked about auto-enrolment. He said that it would be extremely difficult for someone to opt out. We have just talked about the many people who could find that it is not in their financial interests to opt in finding it extremely difficult to opt out. I would like the Minister of State to expand on what is meant by that, and on what the mechanics will be to prevent it from happening. I expect that there will be a form. Many employers of people on low earnings, or of part-time workers, women workers or people with broken careers, would be quite likely to have such a form available in a filing cabinet. They will pull it out, put it on the table and say, &#147;What do you want to do about this reduction of 4 per cent. from your earnings, then?&#148; The answer will be, &#147;I&#146;d rather not have that loss of 4 per cent. when I&#146;ve got credit card debts, Christmas coming up and I&#146;m in serious financial difficulties trying to look after my family.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o281"><a name="80107-0016.htm_para28"><a name="08010720000131">The truth is that such a form will be on the table. It will not be extremely difficult; people will just sign it. We then have the prospect of Ministers of this Government&#151;it would be sad if they were still in power&#151;desperately going round trying to prosecute employers for their irresponsible encouragement of people opting out of a scheme, which, as far as their employees are concerned, is highly unlikely to be of benefit. I will be interested to hear the Minister respond on that point.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o282"><a name="80107-0016.htm_para29"><a name="08010720000132">It is in the detail that we will find out whether more people will benefit from the scheme than lose out because of it. Much of that detail is left to regulation, and we could do with hearing from the Minister&#151;we did not hear from the Secretary of State&#151;about whether regulations will be subject to affirmative resolution, or whether the Government will be able to push such measures through. This matter will be of enormous importance for millions of people for a long time, and it is important that the House scrutinises any regulations made by Ministers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o283"><a name="80107-0016.htm_para30"><a name="08010720000133">The right hon. Member for Birkenhead described this Bill as dangerous. He suggested that there was a chance of a serious mis-selling scandal, but there would be no one to take to court over it, apart from a discredited Government who would be long gone. That is no position from which to move forward on the basis of consensus for the long-term benefit of people in this country, not least those who have least, whom we should be concerned about the most. One would have thought that a Labour Government would be concerned, but, as my hon. Friend the Member for Castle Point pointed out in his powerful speech, the amount spent on the elderly by the Government as a percentage of GDP has reduced over time. This Government need to take seriously all the contributions made, and the criticisms of the current situation, if we are to have a proper set-up for the future.</p>

 If the previous two contributions from the Conservative Benches reflect a wish to take politics out of pensions, I would not like to see the Opposition in partisan mode.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o284"><a name="80107-0017.htm_para0"><a name="08010720000135">One thing that has not been said yet is that we should give credit to Adair Turner, as well as to the Government, for the degree of consensus that has been achieved. Despite all the criticisms that we have heard today, they focused on the detailed implementation of the scheme, but a couple of years ago I would not have put money on our achieving any consensus on the structure at all. It is worth recording that before moving on.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o285"><a name="80107-0017.htm_para1"><a name="08010720000136">I should like to make three points. The first is about the issue that has preoccupied many hon. Members who have spoken&#151;the interaction with pension credit, housing benefit and council tax benefit. We are all familiar with the arguments about means-testing in general. There will always be a trade-off between spreading whatever money we have thinly and concentrating it on the people most in need, with the risk of creating a trap if they then receive additional income. That is a long-standing issue. It is not trivial and it will reappear in other contexts. However, we should be clear that all such devices are designed as a safety net. Nobody sensible aspires to ending up on housing benefit and council tax benefit, which are there in case things go wrong in people&#146;s lives.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o286"><a name="80107-0017.htm_para2"><a name="08010720000137">A constituent once told me that it was not fair that she contributed so much in tax to the national health service, because she had never been in hospital. I told her that it was good news that she had not been in hospital and that the NHS was there as a back-up in case of bad news. We do not tell people considering signing a personal account that a huge profit is guaranteed at the end of their lives; rather, we say that if their careers follow a normal pattern&#151;even a low-earning pattern&#151;and they contribute over their lifetimes, the probability is that they will be glad that they did so. However, if things go horribly wrong, either in people&#146;s investments or their personal lives, that safety net is there.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o287"><a name="80107-0017.htm_para3"><a name="08010720000138">That is a reasonable package, although I appreciate that there are issues for people who are close to retirement when the scheme comes in. In the interests of securing a high take-up for the scheme, we should try to address the concerns that have been expressed today.</p>

<p><a name="st_o321"><a name="08010720000139"><a name="80107-0017.htm_spnew1"><a name="08010720000188"><b>Mr. Gregory Campbell (East Londonderry) (DUP):</b>
 The hon. Gentleman talks about the safety net and I take his point on board. He refers to our telling vulnerable groups&#151;women, low earners and people in part-time employment&#151;that the safety net is there, but does he not understand that, for various reasons, those people do not listen whenever we say such things? All our cogent and logical arguments are lost on many people, for an abundance of reasons that we all understand. Therefore, however logically we put the case, many tens of thousands of people will miss it.</p>

pension scheme, rather than staying outside because of misplaced or other fears and just hoping for the best. However, as I was saying before the hon. Gentleman&#146;s intervention, we need to do what we can to reassure people on those points.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o288"><a name="80107-0017.htm_para4"><a name="08010720000141">The second issue that I should like to raise is employer evasion. We are making the scheme compulsory for employers, but we are all aware that some employers will, for good or less good reasons, seek to minimise the number of employees for whom they pay a 3 per cent. contribution. As I mentioned in an intervention on the Secretary of State, it seems reasonable to ask in Committee why employers are being given a financial incentive to encourage their employees to opt out. Why should not every employee be part of the national scheme? The optional element would be paying the 4 per cent. and receiving the 1 per cent. tax rebate; the 3 per cent. would be paid by employers regardless. From the employers&#146; point of view, the issue would be entirely neutral. They would not be concerned about whether or not people signed up&#151;that would be a matter for the people concerned&#151;and there would be no risk of the &#147;wink and nudge&#148; influencing people. I agree with the hon. Member for Beverley and Holderness (Mr. Stuart): employers will have a sheaf of forms to offer employees asking them whether they want to be part of the scheme, and the less good employers will nudge them in a way that is impossible to prove or to catch.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o289"><a name="80107-0017.htm_para5"><a name="08010720000142">I am pleased, as I know my trade union colleagues will be, that agency workers are covered by the proposals in what I consider quite an elegant way, but there remains the problem of self-employed workers. We all know of the increasing tendency for some companies to farm out important elements of their operations to people who are at least nominally self-employed, and we do not want to reinforce that tendency by giving an additional incentive for the establishment of such arrangements. However, it would be helpful if there were ways of bringing self-employed people into the scheme.</p>

Friend the Member for Blackpool, North and Fleetwood (Mrs. Humble) referred to the Swedish &#147;yellow envelope&#148; scheme. In today&#146;s debate, we have still subliminally accepted the traditional model according to which people spend most of their lives working for one employer, but that is now very much the exception. The norm is that during their lives people work for a number of employers, perhaps a dozen or more, experiencing voluntary or involuntary interruptions in their employment. In such circumstances, it is easy for people to lose track of their pension rights. The attraction of the Swedish scheme, as I understand it, is that people receive annual statements providing an overview of their position.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o291"><a name="80107-0017.htm_para7"><a name="08010720000144">I appreciate the Secretary of State&#146;s point that in the absence of a defined-benefit scheme it is not possible to tell people that, in the present circumstances, they will receive X pounds a week. However, they can be told &#147;Here is an overview of what we have on record for the pension schemes to which you have contributed so far, and a statement of the current assumptions of what that could lead to&#148;, with all the usual provisos issued by pensions firms; only the Government, or a Government-appointed agency, could do that.</p>

Last summer, the Government were defeated in another place in the attempt to do something about the 2010 pension changes and the issue of women who retire before 2010 on a much less generous state pension regime. Baroness Hollis came up with one suggestion that the Government said they would do something about. They looked at it and have said that they will not do something about it. I want to offer the Government a way out and to offer my solution to the Baroness Hollis problem. I do so in a constructive spirit and, as the Minister knows, I will be happy to speak to him at great length about it if he wants.</p>

are in 2008, and one can pay back for any of the last six years, which takes us back to 2002. Between 1996 and 2002, there was a different mess; the Government were not telling people about such gaps in the national insurance record. To make up for that mess, there is a special scheme that allows people to pay back from 1996 to 2002. The problem is that lots of people do not know about it. I have set myself the goal of trying to find them individually. This might be slightly adventurous and I would like to enlist the Minister&#146;s help in the process. I have found a few so far, but there are a few still to go.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o298"><a name="80107-0017.htm_para14"><a name="08010724000007">My serious point is this: the Government hold records on everybody&#146;s national insurance, so they hold records on all of those women who have gaps in their records for the years for which the special scheme applies and since then. If those women knew that they were entitled to fill the gaps in their record on these very favourable terms, many would do so. I have found dozens of such women who, when we have told them about the scheme, have found they could get, literally, free money. They have found out that they could pay a couple of thousand pounds in back contributions and earn &#163;3,000, &#163;4,000 or &#163;5,000 in back pension. The scheme is so generous that the Government do not even ask them for the money and simply pay the difference.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o299"><a name="80107-0017.htm_para15"><a name="08010724000008">I have had the pleasure of ringing up women the length and breadth of Britain&#151;I have had several proposals of marriage&#151;and helping them to discover that they could have free cash and a bigger pension. The problem is that the Government know exactly who they all are. They never told one set of women and they told another set but only once, several years ago, and in a somewhat complicated way. All those women have that latent entitlement that they are not taking up.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o300"><a name="80107-0017.htm_para16"><a name="08010724000009">The Baroness Hollis problem&#151;the problem of lots of women with incomplete records who could fill them&#151;could be made much better if the Government were to access their own records proactively and contact the women who are missing out.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o301"><a name="80107-0017.htm_para17"><a name="08010724000010">Very briefly I shall identify the two groups about whom I am most concerned. The first are the women who did not get a letter from the Government telling them about gaps in their record. Such women are perhaps atypical now but are typical of a generation of women who left school at 15, worked full-time and paid some national insurance, left work to have children, went back for a period and paid the married woman&#146;s stamp, but maybe stopped altogether when they had other children. They might work in Oxfam, or they might care for an elderly relative. Basically, their working lives stopped in 1980. In other words, they have a dirty great gap in their contribution record.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o302"><a name="80107-0017.htm_para18"><a name="08010724000011">A few years ago, the Government took the view that they would not tell these women that they were entitled to fill the gaps in their record on very favourable terms. The scheme is brilliant and the Government know all the women who are entitled to it, but they chose not tell them; they did not write to them. This set of women could benefit if the Government used their own information to tell them. I am not asking for legislative change. All the information and powers are there and the Government just need to tell the women. Even if the Government were simply to prioritise those who have most to benefit from the scheme, that could help a  <br>

<p><a name="stpa_o303"><a name="80107-0017.htm_para19"><a name="08010724000012">The second group is the women the Government did write to in 2004-05. Some of them responded, but, even on the Government&#146;s own figures, tens of thousands have still yet to respond. There is a ticking time-bomb in that there is a deadline, as the Minister well knows; the scheme will run out by 2009 or 2010. There are lots of women out there who could take advantage of it. I find them practically every day&#151;the Minister looks mildly sceptical, but I can give him names and addresses. Practically every day I find another woman who could take advantage of the scheme and who received the initial letter and either did not understand it or, crucially, received it at a time when it was not right for them to respond. They might have been 60 when they received it and they did not have the &#163;2,000 but they are now 64 and it is worth their while to respond, as they will get the offset and they will end up in cash. So it was right for them not to respond when they received the letter, but I would bet any money that they binned the letter because they thought, &#147;I haven&#146;t got thousands of pounds,&#148; instead of putting it in an envelope marked, &#147;Open again in 2008 when it is worth while.&#148; The Government know who those people are.</p>

 I also want to pay tribute to Front-Bench Members for their outstanding work in tackling pensioner poverty, and in particular in dealing with issues to do with women&#146;s pensions. My hon. Friend the Member for Grantham and Stamford (Mr. Davies) said to me earlier that there are many men in the low-income pensioners pot as well, which is of course right, but the figures show that the pensioners who are in poverty and who particularly miss out are overwhelmingly women.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o305"><a name="80107-0017.htm_para21"><a name="08010724000017">The Government have done two particular things to help them. One is the much-reviled means-tested benefits, especially pension credit and the minimum income guarantee; many of those payments have gone to women pensioners and have been responsible for lifting them out of poverty. The other was to commission the Turner report, which produced excellent proposals on women&#146;s pensions. It highlighted two issues. First, it identified that one of the main reasons why women pensioners were poor was that they were not qualified for the state  <br>

pension. In the last round of legislation, that was addressed by reducing the number of years needed to qualify. In addition, there is, of course, the changing demographic profile and the change in women&#146;s status which means that more of us now work for longer. As a result, by 2025 more than 90 per cent. of us will be entitled to a full state pension. That is a major plank in getting women pensioners out of poverty.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o306"><a name="80107-0017.htm_para22"><a name="08010724000018">The second particular cause of pensioner poverty for women that the Turner report identified was the fact that many women do not have pensions linked to their work&#151;in the past, the term for that was occupational pensions. The Bill is particularly important as it will bring in the mechanism that will give women&#151;especially those on low incomes&#151;pensions that are linked to their work. That obviously raises a lot of issues, which I want to discuss. It will impact on their ability to get means-tested benefits, which have kept up women&#146;s income in retirement. However, it is right that we say that there will have to be a fundamental shift in pension provision such that people start to save even if they are on a low income. That will mean that people will have to start looking at saving, which will be the ultimate way in which they will achieve security in retirement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o307"><a name="80107-0017.htm_para23"><a name="08010724000019">Members have talked about incentives to save, and as I know from personal experience, the best incentive is to say to people, &#147;You put so much in the kitty and your employer will have to put in so much, and the Government will put in so much.&#148; That is a basic incentive to save. I speak as one of those women who missed out on their state pension, for all the reasons that the hon. Member for Northavon (Steve Webb) identified.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o308"><a name="80107-0017.htm_para24"><a name="08010724000020">I want to touch briefly on three of the various issues relating to personal accounts, which I hope Ministers will look at. It is important that personal accounts work for people on low incomes who have never saved for their retirement before, particularly women. I understand from looking at the figures that people will get the full benefit of personal accounts only if they have their basic entitlement to a state pension; it is not a requirement&#151;it is just the way that the figures work out. That is why it is particularly important that in paving the way for this provision, we ensure that pensioners can buy back missing years. I take the point made by the hon. Member for Northavon about the schemes that are open; when people get such letters&#151;I get them&#151;they think, &#147;I&#146;ll worry about that later.&#148; It is important that the issue be dealt with so that women can buy back the missing years from the early years of their employment, which are often the years that they miss. They also need to be able to buy back enough of the years to ensure that, if they have the means, if it suits them and if they think it the right thing to do, they get the full state pension. I will not go into the figures in detail now because my time is limited.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o309"><a name="80107-0017.htm_para25"><a name="08010724000021">Secondly, the provision must work for women who have more than one job. Women in my constituency who have always worked and have a record of being in paid employment will often make up their income package through a basket of different jobs, all of them quite small and some of them not very well paid. It is particularly important that those women also get the  <br>

full benefits of the personal accounts, which perhaps means some tweaking of the requirements.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o310"><a name="80107-0017.htm_para26"><a name="08010724000022">Thirdly, perhaps women should be able to vary the amounts that they pay into personal accounts, so that they can buy back years when they were unable to pay in as much. Women&#146;s employment goes in peaks and troughs&#151;often troughs. When one occasionally hits the grassy uplands of having some money, it is very important to be able to make provision for one&#146;s retirement, particularly given that, as we know from research, women, when there is choice between their pension and their children, have a tendency to ensure that their children get the money. We therefore need to ensure that the patterns of how women save and work are properly reflected in the structure of the personal accounts. It is particularly important that these accounts perform the miracle of getting people who do not have a track record of saving to save not for a rainy day, for a holiday or for their children, but for their retirement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o311"><a name="80107-0017.htm_para27"><a name="08010724000023">We must also make sure that while this is going on, other elements of what the Government are doing do not damage women&#146;s pensions. Let me give an example. A constituent came to see me&#151;she is between 60 and 65 and her husband is over 65&#151;to explain that the tax on her quite measly pensions is doubling. She is losing the 10p starting rate, which is going up, and she will not get the benefit of the increased personal tax allowance for pensioners. So whereas this year she is paying, as it says in a letter that I wrote to the Treasury, a total of &#163;132 in tax, next year she will pay &#163;261.40 on her pension income of &#163;6,545.20.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o312"><a name="80107-0017.htm_para28"><a name="08010724000024">I ask that while we do all this good stuff through the Department for Work and Pensions and this legislation to bolster women&#146;s savings, we ensure that other bits of Government policy do not penalise women because of differences in retirement age and such like. It is not enough to say that the husband gets the benefit, because the argument about women&#146;s pensions is about poverty and equity. Women expect to be treated as individuals when they have retired as well as when they are employed. With those caveats, I welcome the Bill. I hope that we can fine-tune those small bits in Committee to make it work for women.</p>

If we go through the pain&#151;I believe that it is right to do so&#151;of automatic enrolment and we help most people in society, that will be good and beneficial. However, if a hard core of female, part-time and low-paid employees see this as not being a desirable process for them to engage in, if we miss them and still do not target them, and if they are being told, and they are saying, that there is no point anyway because they will be no worse off opting out from a process that they do not feel part of anyway, that will only compound the problem that the Government tell us they are attempting to address.

but they must understand that they will be. I see that the Opposition Chief Whip is now to be my audience on behalf of the Opposition. We never heard what their view is on generic advice. Would they prefer the Bill to provide for customised advice? In that case, who would pay for it? We did not hear that. Or do they want no advice at all? I presume that that is not the case.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o319"><a name="80107-0018.htm_para6"><a name="08010724000033">Another example is automatic enrolment, about which we heard much from the Opposition spokesman. He mentioned it over and over again and appeared to be totally against it, but he never said that he would table an amendment to remove it from the Bill. There was a complete abdication and a void where we should have heard some solid and concrete proposals from the Opposition if they want to be taken seriously. It is no use just complaining about things or saying that life is not perfect. We all know that life is not perfect. Compromises have to be made and decisions taken. If one wants to be in government, one has to be prepared to face decisions and come down on one side or the other. We had none of that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o320"><a name="80107-0018.htm_para7"><a name="08010724000034">By contrast, the Government deserve to be congratulated on the Bill. It is a historic Bill. It is the first time in our history that we will have a contributory pension scheme that covers the whole work force, every man and woman who is working, unless they specifically opt out. That is a special moment in the history of pensions in this country. It means that everybody who is working will have a stake through the contributory pension system and the equity market in the prosperity of this country. Indeed, through the international equity market and diversification, they will have a stake in the future wealth of the world, and that is enormously important.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o321"><a name="80107-0018.htm_para8"><a name="08010724000035">In another important achievement, the Government have succeeded in doing something that no other Government have even attempted, which is to provide for compulsory employer contributions. What is more, the Government have managed to do so through negotiation, and that is a fine achievement. Many people would not have put the Government&#146;s chances of success very high, but they have succeeded. It is against that background that I wish to make one or two points on issues that are left open by the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o322"><a name="80107-0018.htm_para9"><a name="08010724000036">We all agree that there is a problem with means-testing. Some people should not contribute under the scheme because they would be better off relying on means-tested benefits. But the important point is that they are in the minority. It would not be sensible to throw the baby out with the bathwater and say that because that minority will not benefit we should deprive the majority of these new, positive measures. It is however right that some flexibility should be provided, and the Government have done so in allowing people to opt out and through the provision, which the House has so far rather missed in the Bill, for trivial commutation. However, the amount is not actually trivial; it is &#163;16,000.</p>

&#163;16,000. That gives people a long time to think again in the light of changing personal circumstances or different rules about means-testing or pension contributions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o324"><a name="80107-0018.htm_para11"><a name="08010724000038">Finally, I should like to express something that the Government may not be able to say so easily. I have no idea what is in their mind on the matter and no idea of the substance of their discussions with the CBI and employers organisations, but it seems to me highly desirable, and natural over time, that the 3 per cent. compulsory contribution by employers should increase. The Australian superannuation system is interesting. It started at less than 3 per cent.&#151;it may have been only 2 per cent.&#151;but has risen to 9 per cent. over many years; there has been only a slight increase in the burden each year so that it could be absorbed. The House will see immediately that in so far as the compulsory and global contributions increase from a total of 8 per cent. at present to 10, 12 or 15 per cent., we will reach a point when not only will the proceeds of the sums invested through the contributory scheme in terms of an annuity available on retirement be much more significant than at present, which is highly desirable from all obvious points of view, but also the means-tested problem will have been relatively eroded over time. Fewer people will find themselves in the perverse situation of having no incentive to contribute to the scheme.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o325"><a name="80107-0018.htm_para12"><a name="08010724000039">It would of course be highly desirable if the Government could make sure that in future there will be no increase in means-testing, as that would go against the whole logic of the scheme. I congratulate them on a major move forward in that regard, for which they received little credit in the debate&#151;deciding to restore the link between earnings and the contributory national insurance pension. That is an anti-means-testing measure and will enable people to improve their pension income globally without it being negated by the loss of pensions elsewhere through the means-tested system.</p>

 We welcome the Bill, albeit with some reservations. Many of us have long awaited consensus on pension provision after the difficulties and complications of the past 25 years, beginning with the Thatcher Government&#146;s disastrous decisions about the state earnings-related pension scheme and the breaking of the link between pensions and earnings.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o328"><a name="80107-0018.htm_para15"><a name="08010724000043">The Bill has particular relevance for Wales and Scotland. In Wales, we have proportionately more pensioners and lower pensioner incomes, and there is significant under-claiming of means-tested benefits. Twenty-two per cent. of Welsh people are over 60 and the number is projected to rise to 29 per cent. in 20 years&#146; time. Many of those people will be very elderly and, as we know, elderly people have smaller incomes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o329"><a name="80107-0018.htm_para16"><a name="08010724000044">Pensioner incomes in Wales and Scotland are lower than those for the UK as a whole. Let me give some figures for the past three years. The net income per week for pensioner couples is &#163;338 in Wales, &#163;347 in Scotland, &#163;365 in the UK and, interestingly, &#163;445 in south-east England. Single pensioners&#146; net weekly income is &#163;164 in Wales, &#163;170 in Scotland, &#163;171 in the UK as a whole and &#163;189 in outer London. Obviously, we would welcome any steps towards improving pension provision, particularly for the less well-off. I have not even taken account of lifespan issues, which are particularly relevant.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o330"><a name="80107-0018.htm_para17"><a name="08010724000045">I am glad to say that there has been great progress in reducing poverty in Wales in the past 10 to 15 years, not only in income terms, but through measures such as free bus travel for pensioners and free prescriptions for all. In 1995, a quarter of low-income households in Wales were pensioner households; now it is a fifth. The figure is down from 25 per cent. to 20 per cent., which is welcome. However, 150,000 pensioners in Wales are still in poverty. Significantly, 30,000 of them would be lifted out of poverty if they took up in full the means-tested benefits to which they are entitled. I shall make a general comment, as the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions is also the Secretary of State for Wales: given that the Government are irrevocably wedded to means-tested benefits, I would welcome a vigorous take-up campaign to make sure that pensioners take up the money to which they have a right.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o331"><a name="80107-0018.htm_para18"><a name="08010724000046">Hon. Members will have heard the Minister for Pensions Reform assert in Question Time that the start date will not slip from 2012. I hope that he will not regret those words at his leisure. I also hope that he will reassure the House that employers will not see the Bill as an opportunity to establish a ceiling, rather than a floor&#151;a point that other hon. Members made, too.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o332"><a name="80107-0018.htm_para19"><a name="08010724000047">I now turn to my main concern, which is the relationship between existing provisions, particularly means-tested benefits, savings and other pension provisions. That relationship can seem fiercely complicated to many people, and that leads to confusion, badly uninformed decision making and subsequent potential loss of income. The advent of personal accounts may complicate matters in the minds of some people. There must be careful consideration of the relationship between personal accounts and means-tested benefits, not least, as has been said, to make sure that it pays to save.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o333"><a name="80107-0018.htm_para20"><a name="08010724000048">Many years ago, I was involved in advising claimants. Some hon. Members will remember the infamous &#147;better-off&#148; calculations that we used to do, to determine whether people were better off on unemployment benefits or family credit, as it was then called. The calculations were fairly complicated for benefit advisers, but for ordinary claimants they had the character of one of the lesser branches of mediaeval theology; people just did not understand. I repeat the plea for the wide availability of good-quality information. Advice must be available, and not just from the Personal Accounts Delivery Authority. As the Minister will know, Age Concern is pressing for  <br>

that, as are other bodies. People will need detailed, clear, face-to-face advice, if that is possible. It is expensive, but we are talking about people&#146;s income for the far future. The advice should cover all provision, including savings, and not just personal accounts.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o334"><a name="80107-0018.htm_para21"><a name="08010724000049">Lastly, I have two points of a more local and domestic nature. I shall take this opportunity to make my traditional demand that all the information and advice services in Wales be made available in Welsh and English, particularly given the linguistic preferences of many of my constituents, and the linguistic preferences and abilities of some older people in Wales. I urge the Government to liaise with the Welsh Language Board on those matters at an early stage. Finally and happily, I am sure that the Minister will welcome the announcement at the weekend of the appointment of Ruth Marks as Commissioner for Older People in Wales&#151;the very first such commissioner in the world, as far as I know. The commissioner is appointed specifically to work on the remit of the National Assembly for Wales. However, I hope that the Government will assure us that they in London will not raise artificial barriers, but will work closely with the Assembly and the commissioner on matters to do with older people.</p>

 This is a genuine attempt by the Government to tackle the serious problem of under-saving, too few contributors and insufficient contributions. Some 7 million people have not saved enough for their retirement. Half of them are over 35, and only a sixth of 20 to 24-year-olds are saving for retirement. Only 40 per cent. of people earning between &#163;5,000 and &#163;30,000 a year are saving towards their pension, so there is a serious problem.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o335"><a name="80107-0018.htm_para22"><a name="08010724000051">In the short time available, I shall make some brief points. First, contributions are too low. Turner said that contributions of 8 per cent. would bring about a 45 per cent. replacement rate&#151;someone&#146;s pension level, compared with what they earned&#151;which is a long way from the figure of two-thirds that most people regard as acceptable. I think that the figure will be much lower, because someone who has not saved enough at 30 will not get anywhere near 45 per cent. There will be much less for people who have undergone periods of unemployment. The figure depends on unspecified stock exchange gains and on administrative charges being kept down. That might not happen, so it is likely that employers&#146; contributions will have to be increased. The state may have to target measures on low-paid and older workers. Tax relief of 1 per cent. may not be enough, especially for the low-paid.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o336"><a name="80107-0018.htm_para23"><a name="08010724000052">Those on low incomes are of most concern to me. They may not benefit as they should&#151;in some cases, not at all&#151;from the personal accounts system. People may be ineligible because they are too poorly paid and have multiple jobs. The way in which the system has been set up is wrong. Individuals who are over the lower limit&#151;perhaps they have two jobs&#151;will not receive money from their employers to match their contributions, which is not reasonable. A great deal has been said about the issue of older women, who have sought entitlement to a higher basic state pension. It is not right that the Government should cut their options and not provide that higher basic state pension. I hope  <br>

that the Government will make a commitment to return with proposals to help those women increase their pension entitlement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o337"><a name="80107-0018.htm_para24"><a name="08010724000053">The relationship with the means test is important. There are two splendid articles by experts in the current edition of <i> Parliamentary Brief</i>. May I say to Ministers loud and clear that saving must be worth while for low-paid individuals who contribute to personal accounts? It is not right that they should be caught up in the means-testing problem and end up with nothing. I urge Ministers and the Secretary of State to look at the issue to ensure that they get something. Hopefully, the Bill can be changed in Committee or afterwards. I agree with the point that my hon. Friend the Member for Luton, North (Kelvin Hopkins) made about higher-rate taxpayers. The Bill provides for the overall reform of pensions, and for them to be left out so that they can carry on receiving their &#163;21 billion or whatever&#151;the figure is the in tens of billions&#151;is not right. The overall reform package should be skewed towards low earners so that, to coin a phrase, we end up with pensions and pension tax relief for the many, rather than the few.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o338"><a name="80107-0018.htm_para25"><a name="08010724000054">The Bill is a laudable effort, but significant reform was required, not just because of the crisis in savings for retirement but because of the other side of the balance sheet. We are going to raise the state pension age, which will go up to 66 in 2024; to 67, 10 years later; and to 68, 10 years after that. Those changes might not have consensus anyway, but they certainly will not if the other side of the reform package is not generous enough. Again, I urge Ministers on the issue. There are still issues of differences in life expectancy and health inequalities, especially for the lower socio-economic groups, and they must be addressed. I am concerned that the raising of the state pension age will affect the poor the most; one independent organisation said that it would be immoral to force the poorer sections of the population to wait longer for their state pensions just to save those who are richer some tax. As I said, the reform needs to be much more substantial for the socio-economic groups at the bottom of the ladder.</p>

When that point was put to the Minister for Pensions Reform, he was good enough to say that he had told the chief executive in no uncertain fashion that he, the chief executive, would introduce them in 2012. That is the equivalent of the military saying, &#147;Take this objective or do not come back alive.&#148; It would be interesting to hear in the Minister&#146;s winding-up speech what response he got from the new chief executive.</p>

people as they retire. The Pensions Policy Institute and others have set out some genuine concerns that go to the very heart of these proposals, but the Government are the only organisation in a position to model the likely effects and to come up with detailed proposals to avoid disaster. All Ministers seem to be able to do is come up with bland assertions that it will be all right on the night. They are sitting on their hands and hoping that the problem will go away.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o352"><a name="80107-0019.htm_para12"><a name="08010727000017">The situation is worse than that. In recent weeks, Ministers have tried to shut down any debate on the issue. They have tried to bully the Opposition and even third parties into silence on this crucial point. It has been put like this: the Tories are letting the side down and making party political points for the sake of it, whereas what matters is the majority of people who should be better off with personal accounts. <i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> I have that more or less right, I think, judging by the reaction on the Government Benches. However, that is simply not good enough. If Ministers wish for consensus only on their own terms, they have come to the wrong shop. We are interested in consensus only if our concerns and those of other people are listened to and taken seriously. That point was also taken up by the hon. Member for Inverness and other places, all of which seem to have a distillery&#151;the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey (Danny Alexander).</p>

However, the institute cannot tell us how many people are likely to be affected. The Government could tell us if they wanted to. They have the model, the manpower and the means. However, they seem to be doing nothing. That issue was touched on, I think, by the hon. Member for Birmingham, Northfield (Richard Burden).</p>

His answer may be that he and those advising him have not given it much thought, but I must tell him that the issue will not go away. That point was made by my hon. Friend the Member for Beverley and Holderness (Mr. Stuart). The subject will be written about by journalists, raised by financial advisers and used by unscrupulous employers who wish to induce their employees to opt out. I can assure the Minister that the official Opposition will not let it drop&#151;not because we wish to make life gratuitously difficult for Ministers, but because we are genuinely concerned, as are many interested third party organisations, that the problem, if it is not addressed, will undermine the success of personal accounts.</p>

to those important questions. We will do that in parallel with the passage of the Bill. The process will no doubt be more laborious and will take longer than if the Department was doing it itself. If it will not, we will. Perhaps there is another more selfish motive for our attitude. We do not wish to inherit the problems in government. We wish to be the ones who implement a system of personal accounts that is designed to succeed and not set up to fail. To misquote Marks and Spencer, that is because there is no plan B.</p>

 Let me begin by saying that I will take no lessons from the party that introduced pensions holidays for employers and the 1986 Lawson cap on surpluses that saw a drop in contributions. The Conservative party was responsible for the mis-selling scandal, the inadequate Pensions Act 1995, the so-called minimum funding requirement introduced by the right hon. Member for Richmond, Yorks (Mr. Hague) after the Maxwell scandal, and the 2.7 million pensioners left in poverty, some living on as little as &#163;69 per week. Those who had a private pension had their benefits taken from them, pound for pound&#151;a situation unlike that under this Government, who introduced the savings credit. The Conservative party also removed the earnings link. A little more humility from Conservative Members is therefore necessary.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o356"><a name="80107-0019.htm_para16"><a name="08010730000002">Having got that off my chest, let me say that the debate has been broadly good. Despite the usual knockabout, there has been a fair amount of consensus. There were strong contributions from my hon. Friends the Members for Broxtowe (Dr. Palmer), for Birmingham, Northfield (Richard Burden), for Grantham and Stamford (Mr. Davies), for Aberdeen, South (Miss Begg), for Nottingham, South (Alan Simpson), for Leyton and Wanstead (Harry Cohen) and for Northampton, North (Ms Keeble), from the hon. Members for East Londonderry (Mr. Campbell) and for Caernarfon (Hywel Williams) and from my right hon. Friend the Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field). The hon. Member for Northavon (Steve Webb), who is, I suspect, even more of an anorak than I am about pensions, made an especially lively contribution. He appears to be following the great tradition of Gladstonian Liberalism in seeking fallen women, albeit only those who have fallen behind with their national insurance contributions. He deserves much credit for that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o357"><a name="80107-0019.htm_para17"><a name="08010730000003">We heard some more critical but considered contributions from the hon. Members for Castle Point (Bob Spink) and for Ryedale (Mr. Greenway), as well as a series of interventions from many others, some of which were more helpful than others. I do not have time to deal with all the points that were made but I hope to be able to tackle many of them in Committee.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o358"><a name="80107-0019.htm_para18"><a name="08010730000004">One of the key issues in the debate was: will it pay to save? It was raised by Conservative and Liberal Democrat Front Benchers as well as the hon. Member for Ryedale and my hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham, South. It is a genuine and important matter, but the potential solutions are far from easy and often expensive. I am happy to discuss them in detail in Committee. However, the difficulties of resolving the issue should not undermine the need to support the Bill, promote personal responsibility, build confidence in pensions and be fair to the taxpayer in the process.</p>

 There will be widespread competition with the private sector&#151;those who currently provide various schemes. We hope that they will continue to do that.

People will face health and employment problems&#151;the sort of risks that we all face in our daily lives. It is vital that, if those problems arise, and people retire without adequate provision, there is a state safety net for them. Most people should still be encouraged to save, which is what the Pensions Commission recommended and what we are seeking to encourage as part of the process of pension reform. By disproportionately focusing on those people who might get low returns because of health or employment problems, we need to avoid creating a problem by which those who would benefit from saving lose out. We therefore need to be careful about how the debate is developed. We should ensure that those who  <br>

Member for Epsom and Ewell has been very vocal on the issue, and he has gone to great lengths to try to rewrite Conservative social philosophy. He told the BBC that the state should give an explicit guarantee to those who save, which is an innovative idea. He has asked me to welcome innovative ideas, and I am certainly interested in that idea, which I want to discuss because it seems to undermine the idea of individual responsibility. It would create an administrative nightmare, and it would probably create a nightmare for the hon. Member for Tatton (Mr. Osborne), who would have to find the money to fund it. Where would he find that money?</p>

Is he saying that he wants only those in personal accounts &#147;to retrieve contributions&#148;, or will that apply to every pension scheme now and in the future? Or is he saying that all private pension schemes should make provision to repay premiums to anyone who gets less than pension credit levels?</p>

Today, one in six people are automatically enrolled&#151;they work for companies such as Tesco. Some of them will retire, and some of them will be on pension credit. Is he saying that those pension schemes must repay those premiums? Or is he saying that the retrieval mechanism would apply only to personal accounts, in which case would that not give personal accounts a competitive advantage against private schemes by providing a state guarantee? That would be an extraordinary step for the Conservatives to take. I am sure that the pensions industry would not be terribly impressed by those proposals, which would mean that it would have to repay anyone who is on pension credit. If he were in government, he would have to come up with a plan to pay the extra funding for all the people who would have to claim extra pension credit. It is an ill-thought-out proposal.</p>

 I have set out the various problems arising from the various proposals in a number of speeches. It has been suggested that we should increase trivial commutation, which would be very expensive and likely to lead to some wealthy people using it as a way to avoid taxation. A further option would be to deal with the issue by having a disregard, which has been proposed by the Pensions Policy Institute, but the cost would be enormous at more than &#163;600 million. If it were to apply only to personal accounts, the cost would still be substantial, and applying it across the board to other sorts of pension schemes would be enormously expensive.</p>

answers. The hon. Member for Epsom and Ewell has asked me what we are doing about it. I am happy to discuss with him and with others ways in which we can deal with the issue, but coming up with proposals such as he has and suggesting that because there is a problem there is therefore a magic bullet solution is not worthy of him.

The Government do have a computer system that forecasts pensioner incomes up to 2050, but it has taken on almost mythic status in the interventions we have heard from the Opposition during the course of the debate. They told us that they cannot come up with any proposals because they do not have access to the computer. Our system is one of a range of models we use to tell us how people might end up in 2050 with regard to pension credit. It does not model behavioural changes arising from policy decisions and, to the best of my knowledge, the Pensions Policy Institute one does not either.</p>

 I happened to be involved in those discussions, although, in fairness, the hon. and learned Gentleman was not in his current post at the time.

should also be expressed to the Prime Minister and the Chancellor for bringing forward a settlement to deal with that problem.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o369"><a name="80107-0020.htm_para4"><a name="08010730000027">The settlement generated a flurry of publicity, but we must not lose sight of the fact that it was part of a larger package of Government proposals that seek to renew confidence and faith in our pensions system&#151;confidence and faith that was rattled by the previous Conservative Government. Today, by contrast, quietly and without controversy, we are carrying out massive social reform of pensions that will benefit tens of millions of people. The Bill is only a part of it. Our reforms address the real issues that face this country: a major demographic change with people living longer; a lack of saving to pay for it; confidence in the pension system; the move away from final salary schemes; and pensioner poverty itself. The Government have recognised those problems and are making one of the biggest changes to pensions in years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o370"><a name="80107-0020.htm_para5"><a name="08010730000028">We are reforming for the long term. We have put in place the pensions regulator, the Pension Protection Fund and proposals that address the issue of pensioner poverty. We have lifted more than a million pensioners out of relative poverty. The Bill will be another major reform that will tackle undersaving and give people who work the opportunity to save in a pension scheme. About 60 per cent. of the work force are not saving enough for their retirement. This major Bill will enable many of them to do so, and ensure that people on low and middle incomes are given many of the benefits that were available only to those who were richer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o371"><a name="80107-0020.htm_para6"><a name="08010730000029">This is a quietly done, but important and major piece of social reform. It is part of a wider package of reforms that we are undertaking. As part of those reforms, we aim, in the Pensions Act 2007 and other legislation, to renew confidence in Britain&#146;s pensions. I look forward to a responsible debate, and to genuine and effective consensus for lasting change. We will keep our eyes on the prize: up to 9 million people saving more for the first time, and &#163;10 billion more being saved. I commend the Bill to the House.</p>

 I am pleased to have secured my second debate on flooding. I thank you for awarding it to me, Mr. Speaker, and I thank the Minister for remaining behind to reply to it. I know that he has been extremely active on the issue of flooding. I am also glad to see other hon. Members here, including my hon. Friend the Member for Forest of Dean (Mr. Harper).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o392"><a name="80107-0020.htm_para27"><a name="08010734000036">A number of people have asked me, &#147;If you held a debate on this issue in October, why are you holding another one today?&#148; The reason is quite simple: to keep the issue on the agenda. Two inquiries are under way, one by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and one by the Government. However, it is important to keep reminding people that there are many in Tewkesbury&#151;I shall talk about Tewkesbury, but I know that other areas have been affected, too&#151;who continue to suffer from the effects of the flooding, which happened some months ago. Although the emergency passed long ago, the problems remain.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o393"><a name="80107-0020.htm_para28"><a name="08010734000037">One of the biggest remaining problems is the fact that many people&#151;567, according to an estimate by Tewkesbury borough council&#151;are still displaced from their homes. Many are living in caravans, and throughout Christmas many had to live in cold, cramped conditions on the drives of their homes. Some have been able to use the upper floors of their houses, but it has been a very uncomfortable time for them. While the rest of us may have enjoyed some comforts over Christmas, they have been suffering.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o394"><a name="80107-0020.htm_para29"><a name="08010734000038">Many people whose homes were devastated are back in them now. It seems to depend on the speed at which loss adjusters and builders have worked. I do not mean to suggest that some builders have been working slowly, but families who know, live near or are related to builders have tended to get the work done much more quickly than those who made arrangements through insurance companies. I make no criticism of the companies concerned&#151;it is just a very slow system&#151;but when they have allocated builders, the process has taken some time. It has been a very uncomfortable period for many of my constituents, and it may be months before those displaced from their homes can return to them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o395"><a name="80107-0020.htm_para30"><a name="08010734000039">I pay tribute to those people. I visited as many as I could before Christmas, and their spirit was incredible. Virtually all those who were living in caravans and would be in them over Christmas took the time to wish me a happy Christmas, although their own season had been so disrupted. Old people, young people, people who were ill, people who were healthy, children&#151;a very mixed bag&#151;were concerned enough to wish me a happy Christmas. That says something about the people of Tewkesbury.</p>

 Thankfully, in my constituency far fewer people&#151;about 41 families&#151;were still in temporary accommodation over Christmas, but does my hon.

order to ensure that this is the last time a significant number of families are prevented from living at home over Christmas and that it never happens to anyone again?</p>

<p><a name="st_o353"><a name="08010734000041"><a name="80107-0020.htm_spnew8"><a name="08010734000114"><b>Mr. Robertson:</b>
 My hon. Friend is right. The main thing that most of my constituents want is for lessons to be learnt. They accept that we live on a floodplain and that we often see water on the fields, but they do not accept that things need be quite as bad as they were. We must learn those lessons.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o396"><a name="80107-0020.htm_para31"><a name="08010734000042">As people work towards returning to their homes, their great fear is that the floods could come again. In his report, to which I shall return in a moment, Sir Michael Pitt described the fear that existed at the time of the floods. Now there is a different fear: what if it happens again? I do not think we can assume that this was a one-in-150-years flood. We do not know whether it was or not. Heaven forbid, it could happen again next week or next year. In the House we often discuss the problems caused by climate change, but I think we should take account of the fact that the same amount of rain could fall again at any time. We hope that it will not, but we really do not know.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o397"><a name="80107-0020.htm_para32"><a name="08010734000043">People are living in fear, and although I have tried to establish contact with as many of them as possible&#151;I have placed advertisements in newspapers and written to people&#151;it is difficult to reach everyone. Despite all the activity going on around them, people feel alone. One thing that worries them is insurance for the future. Many face increased premiums, some cannot obtain insurance cover at all, and some are being told by insurance companies &#147;If you want flood cover, there will be a very large excess on your policy&#148;. One lady told me&#151;and I think this is fairly typical&#151;that the insurance company had said there would be a &#163;10,000 excess on her buildings insurance and a further &#163;10,000 excess on insurance for furniture and other items. Effectively, that person has no insurance. If it floods again, it will cost her at least &#163;20,000 out of her own pocket. We may be in a position perhaps to criticise people who were not insured last time, but what now? People cannot get insurance. The Association of British Insurers said:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o400"><a name="80107-0021.htm_para1"><a name="08010734000048">Another problem is that business is down, particularly in the town of Tewkesbury. It has been a bit depressed for a while&#151;more than it ought to be&#151;but businesses are struggling to come to terms with what has happened. There was a tremendous loss of trade at the time, but it has not picked up as we hoped it would. I would welcome any suggestions that the Minister may have, but I want to say publicly that Tewkesbury is open for business. It is working and still open. As I have said, it did not end up like New Orleans sadly ended up. I hope that people will continue to come to Tewkesbury.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o401"><a name="80107-0021.htm_para2"><a name="08010734000049">One of the problems is identifying who is responsible for which ditch, which drain and which culvert. Is it the Environment Agency, the Highways Agency, British Waterways, the county council, the borough councils or the repairing owner? It is very difficult. Once an organisation accepts responsibility, it then must put the job right, which, of course, costs money.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o402"><a name="80107-0021.htm_para3"><a name="08010734000050">I wrote to the Minister on 15 November specifying projects that needed completion. I shall return to those in a moment, but on the issues of drains, ditches, sewers and culverts, we have had heavy rain in some parts of the country, which has brought the problems to light. I wonder what state the ditches and drains are in throughout the country. We simply do not know. I am pleased that Sir Michael Pitt&#146;s report has highlighted that as an important issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o403"><a name="80107-0021.htm_para4"><a name="08010734000051">We have a problem at Prestbury, where houses where people have lived without flooding for 40 years flooded in June. The culverts were not joined up and a tree fell on another culvert. The tree was listed and the owner did not want it to be felled, so the problems go on. The problem now is that, some months on, the Environment Agency is saying that it wants the whole cost to be reassessed. There will be a further delay in fixing the culverts in an area where 500 homes remain at risk.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o404"><a name="80107-0021.htm_para5"><a name="08010734000052">There is a problem with the bridge at Bredon road, which was cut off during the floods, causing the town of Tewkesbury to be isolated. The bridge has been repaired, but at low cost. I do not think that it would withstand future flooding. Planning permission has been sought for a further 105 homes further up the road, close to the bridge. Those houses would connect to the main sewers, which might not have the capacity to cope. What are the planning requirements with regard to drains? Who is responsible for the ongoing maintenance? Again, Sir Michael Pitt&#146;s report asks those questions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o405"><a name="80107-0021.htm_para6"><a name="08010734000053">In Uckington, gardens collapsed into the river Chelt and one person at least is still awaiting answers from the Environment Agency about what can be done to rectify matters.</p>

 Does the hon. Gentleman agree that we in Gloucestershire need prioritisation by the Environment Agency in looking at some of the issues that he has addressed and the two or three issues that I have asked the agency to look at? That is the very least that the Minister should take from the debate.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman is right, and I would go further as I have before on a number of issues. The Environment Agency, as it is formulated, is not up to the job. It either needs more responsibilities and powers, and perhaps more money, or it deserves to be scrapped. I really do not think that it serves a useful purpose as it stands. I again appeal to the Minister that something be done about it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o406"><a name="80107-0021.htm_para7"><a name="08010734000056">We have also had a problem with maps. The flood risk maps did not correspond to the floods we actually had&#151;and Sir Michael Pitt referred to the fact that flood risk maps for surface water did not exist at all. This begs a question: if the maps do not correspond to the actual flooding we are having, should they be used to determine where houses can be built? I want to  <br>

return to that, although I realise that I do not have as much time in this debate as I had last year, so I shall have to hurry up a bit.</p>

It is good that Mythe water treatment works and Walham substation are now protected by Hesco bastions, but they are semi-permanent and permanent measures are definitely needed.

<p><a name="stpa_o408"><a name="80107-0021.htm_para9"><a name="08010734000058">On money, if Tewkesbury borough council wanted, for example, to spend a little more on flood relief, would it be allowed to go over the capping limit? I do not know the answer to that, and I wonder whether the Minister might be able to help. I am pleased that the Government have secured about &#163;100 million from the solidarity fund, but I would like to know how that money will be distributed and used.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o409"><a name="80107-0021.htm_para10"><a name="08010734000059">Turning to Sir Michael Pitt&#146;s interim report, I am meeting him on 23 January and I will raise some of the following issues with him, but it will be useful to run through them briefly now. The report raises a number of good points, particularly with regard to drains, ditches, sewers, surface water and agencies&#146; responsibilities. For example, he says that</p>
<a name="80107-0021.htm_brev1"><a name="08010734000104"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;the automatic right to connect surface water drainage of new developments to the sewerage system should be removed&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o410"><a name="80107-0021.htm_para11"><a name="08010734000060">That is a useful suggestion.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o411"><a name="80107-0021.htm_para12"><a name="08010734000061">Sir Michael acknowledges, however, that it is an interim report. He says that more information is needed, and in a bid to help in that process I wish to make a couple of comments. Some of the interim suggestions are a little general. There is a lot of talk about strategies, assessments and guidances, and I hope that they can be worked up into more direct proposals for action. I also think that there is too much emphasis on homeowners doing work to protect against floods, which has caused a little offence in Tewkesbury. Sir Michael suggests that instead of being set against the floor, plugs should be mounted higher up on walls. That is fine, but one cannot move cookers right to the ceiling; there are obviously certain limitations on what can be done.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o412"><a name="80107-0021.htm_para13"><a name="08010734000062">The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs suggests that it would cost between &#163;3,000 and &#163;10,000 to protect each home. People do not have that sort of money to spend. On that point, I understand that the Environment Agency has just taken away the &#163;20,000 donation it makes to the National Flood Forum, which is unfortunate. That group is a charity; it advises people on flooding&#151;and it suggests steps that Sir Michael&#146;s report also suggests.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o413"><a name="80107-0021.htm_para14"><a name="08010734000063">There has been a little too much emphasis on what individuals can do. That is not the main point. There is not enough emphasis at present on what the Government&#146;s role should be in preventing house building on or near floodplains. Sir Michael says:</p>
<a name="80107-0021.htm_brev2"><a name="08010734000105"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;No new building should be allowed in flood risk areas that is not flood resilient&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o414"><a name="80107-0021.htm_para15"><a name="08010734000064">To say that such houses must be resilient rather misses the point. There used to be green fields that soaked up water. If they are built on, that water goes elsewhere and causes a problem. Sir Michael was quoted&#151;I do not know how accurately&#151;in the <i> Gloucestershire Echo </i>as saying that there is no point in recommending no building in these areas as the Government would not listen. That weakens the recommendation. That is far too weak, and it does not appear to be too impartial or  <br>

too independent. The point about where houses are built is the one that people make most frequently. People strongly feel that we should not have more houses on floodplains or even in areas close to floodplains.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o415"><a name="80107-0021.htm_para16"><a name="08010734000065">To summarise, my recommendations are clear and they are the same as those I made a few months ago. There should be no building on or near floodplains. We need to clear out the ditches and the drains. We need to repair sewers and culverts. We need to create one body that is powerful and that is responsible for all this work and for flood prevention and defences. We need to identify vulnerable people and buildings and to create a list of them, so that they can be helped first should such a situation arise again. We need to protect the water and electricity works and to network the supplies, and we of course need to improve the defences as far as possible.</p>

I hope, too, that the Government will take account of the recommendations in it and of the recommendations that those of us who have to live in these areas&#151;who have the pleasure of living in these areas, but who have suffered recently&#151;will make.</p>

 I start by congratulating the hon. Member for Tewkesbury (Mr. Robertson) on securing this debate and on his determination, as he said tonight, to keep this matter on the agenda. He is absolutely right to do so, because although he is right to say that the flood waters have long gone in the areas affected by the summer floods, many of the households, businesses and communities that have experienced problems in trying to get back to normal still have not done so. As Minister responsible for co-ordinating Government support for the recovery efforts, one of my principal tasks is to make sure that we give local councils leading those recovery efforts and providing that support the help and back-up that they need.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o417"><a name="80107-0021.htm_para18"><a name="08010734000068">The hon. Gentleman said that he wanted to make sure that the Government are aware of the continuing problems that people face and the continuing pressure that councils are dealing with through this recovery period. I pay tribute to him&#151;he has done that consistently since July, as has the hon. Member for Forest of Dean (Mr. Harper), who has now left the Chamber, and my hon. Friend the Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew). They have been consistent not just in their participation in the tele-conferences that I and my colleague Ministers ran throughout the summer recess, but in their attendance of meetings held by Ministers. As the hon. Member for Tewkesbury said, he also had a similar debate in October. Essentially, such efforts have ensured that Ministers have information first hand, direct from Members of this House, about the pressures that people are under, the challenges that they face and the support that councils and communities are rightly looking for the Government to offer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o418"><a name="80107-0021.htm_para19"><a name="08010734000069">The hon. Gentleman said that in future, we might need to be prepared for events such as those that occurred in the summer happening more often. During that summer, we were certainly faced with severe, prolonged and unprecedented levels of rainfall that in many areas  <br>

simply overwhelmed the drainage systems, flood defences and rivers. That rainfall resulted in severe damage to many properties. We estimate that during the two episodes of flooding in June and July, some 48,000 homes were flooded. Not just the gardens, outhouses or garages were flooded; there was water in the house in 48,000 properties. Of course, the June flooding was mainly in South Yorkshire and Humberside, although there were pockets of flooding in the hon. Gentleman&#146;s own county of Gloucestershire.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o419"><a name="80107-0021.htm_para20"><a name="08010734000070">Let me give the House an indication of the scale and severity of that rainfall. On 20 July, when the rainfall occurred that caused the problems in the hon. Gentleman&#146;s constituency, Gloucester received in one day one and a half times the average rainfall for the whole of July. Upstream at Worcester on the River Severn and at Evesham on the River Avon, the equivalent of two months&#146; rain fell in just one day. In Gloucestershire, approximately 4,000 homes and more than 500 businesses were flooded. Many other households and businesses were of course affected by the flooding of the Mythe water treatment works, which meant that some 350,000 people in the county went without water for some time. I pay tribute to the heroic efforts of the emergency services and local councils in protecting Walham. As I saw for myself when I paid a visit on 24 July, we came very close, had that sub-station been knocked out, to seeing a power failure not just in Gloucestershire, but potentially in large parts of south Wales as well.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o420"><a name="80107-0021.htm_para21"><a name="08010734000071">The hon. Gentleman spoke of the strength of community spirit and the generosity shown in the way that neighbours were looking out for each other&#151;they continue to do so&#151;and I reinforce that point, because that has been my experience. On 24 July, when I first visited Tewkesbury, I went to the town centre and was met by Police Inspector Brian Murnaghan, who was overseeing the distribution of bottled water. Sports centre staff were helping to distribute the water, and people such as the constituent whom the hon. Gentleman nominated for the local heroes reception were making sure that their housebound elderly neighbours got the water that they needed. Inspector Murnaghan was finishing off a 10-hour duty overseeing that operation in Tewkesbury town centre, and in the course of our conversation he told me that his home had also been flooded out.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o421"><a name="80107-0021.htm_para22"><a name="08010734000072">The mayor of Tewkesbury, Councillor Phil Awford, gave up a good deal of his time to show me around Tewkesbury. He is a renowned and rightly respected campaigner as part of the National Flood Forum, but he said to me on that day, &#147;Truth be told, nothing could have protected us from the scale of the rainfall that we faced in Gloucestershire at that time.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o422"><a name="80107-0021.htm_para23"><a name="08010734000073">My aim as the Minister responsible for the flood recovery is to ensure that we co-ordinate and put in place the central Government effort to support the local recovery efforts. Along with fellow Ministers, I have tried to ensure that despite the fact that the flood waters have gone&#151;the problems have not&#151;constituencies such as those of the hon. Gentleman and my hon. Friend the Member for Stroud are not forgotten. Indeed, 22 ministerial visits have been made to Gloucestershire since the summer, not least those made by the Under-Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, my hon. Friend the Member for Gloucester (Mr. Dhanda), who has played a great part in that programme. It is important that Ministers make such visits and it is important that  <br>

Ministers at the centre of Government understand the challenges that are still being faced.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o423"><a name="80107-0021.htm_para24"><a name="08010734000074">I am glad that the funding so far to Gloucestershire stands at about &#163;15 million&#151;there will be more to come. The hon. Gentleman&#146;s area, Tewkesbury, has benefited greatly and has made good use of the flood recovery grant that we were able to put in place. We await any Bellwin application that his authority may wish to make. I visited Tewkesbury just before Christmas, on 17 December, when I met the chief executive and other leading figures of the town council. May I tell the hon. Gentleman that what happens in the future and what happens with planning applications was a concern raised by local representatives? I gave an undertaking then, which has been followed up by officials in my Department, that Government office officials and planning experts will set up a meeting in Tewkesbury&#151;they have already written to Major Wilson, the town clerk, to get that under way&#151;so that representatives from the local community and the council can discuss directly the sort of points that he is concerned about for the long term.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o424"><a name="80107-0021.htm_para25"><a name="08010734000075">The hon. Gentleman mentioned the first successful application that the UK has made to the European solidarity fund. I had a meeting in Brussels with Commissioner Hubner on 31 October, and she has since persuaded the European Commission to agree to proposals that mean that we should receive additional aid to contribute to the costs of dealing with the flood recovery in Britain. We are working through the terms on which that money can be spent with the Commission, and I hope before long to be able to settle that matter. It will probably be some time before Easter when we finally receive that money&#151;that is the sort of time scale and pace at which the Commission&#146;s programme operates; nevertheless, that is an additional resource from the special fund set up to help countries such as our own, which have been hit by serious national events like these.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o425"><a name="80107-0021.htm_para26"><a name="08010734000076">The hon. Gentleman rightly raised the issue of those who are still not back in their home. One of the most distressing aspects of the flooding has been the impact on families and households. Based on the work of local authorities in Gloucestershire, we estimate that about 1,250 households are still not fully back in their homes. Around 250 of those are staying in caravan accommodation. When I visited the hon. Gentleman&#146;s constituency on 17 December, I met Mrs. Julie Irwin. Her family, including three children, are able to sleep in their house, but are otherwise living in a caravan. The oven in the caravan is  <br>

too small for the Christmas turkey, which is an example of the stresses, many of which are hidden, on such families, who are still struggling. I pay tribute to Mrs. Irwin for the way in which she has coped, and to her son, who suggested to Gloucestershire county council that children from families who are not back in their home should be entitled to free school meals. The council has now put that suggestion into practice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o426"><a name="80107-0021.htm_para27"><a name="08010734000077">That visit was one of the reasons why I was pleased to be able to announce just before Christmas that I would make available an extra &#163;1 million to the small number of authorities that have a large number of households that are still not back in their own home. We are consulting with local authorities about how to distribute those funds, and I hope to make an announcement shortly. That decision followed an important meeting that I had with the local authorities and the insurers, in which the authorities undertook to improve communications with those households not back in their own home and to assess the needs of those living in caravans to better understand the pressures of the onset of winter. For my part, I undertook to step up the advice available from the Government to deal with homelessness problems, and I have now made the extra money available.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o427"><a name="80107-0021.htm_para28"><a name="08010734000078">On the question of the insurers, my hon. Friend the Minister for the Environment was in his place on the Front Bench when the hon. Gentleman made the point about the lady from his constituency who faced prohibitive premiums. We would be interested in the details because we are keen to hold the ABI to the reassurances that it has given that no areas have been blacklisted for insurance, that existing cover has not been withdrawn in any area, and that there is no evidence of policy renewals being refused.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o428"><a name="80107-0021.htm_para29"><a name="08010734000079">The hon. Gentleman is right to draw attention to the need to learn lessons. The first report by the Pitt review was important and we have accepted the 15 urgent recommendations. There will be consultation on those and others over the next three months. It is clear that we need to improve Government emergency procedures; to improve surface water management; and to review the role of fire and rescue services during floods. We will do that.</p>
