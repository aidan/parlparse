congress that took place here in London only last week, and between the

experience on the ground from the individual pilots, and scaleable
propositions in respect of the technology, which could inform

Opposition&#146;s position. In principle they say that they are
interested in the scheme. They then criticise it as potentially

touched on the rationale for the traffic officer scheme. We cannot
build our way out of such problems. As I intimated in answering an
earlier question, a significant road building programme is currently
taking place, but it cannot be our total solution to congestion. We
must find better ways to use existing capacity. My right hon. Friend
the Secretary of State has discussed road pricing, which is one of the
long-term solutions, but solutions such as traffic officers clearing
away incidents very quickly and keeping traffic moving are also an
important part of the picture, and they are proving to be extremely

great deal of time to clear up serious incidents. The whole purpose of
the traffic officer scheme is that accidents that do not involve injury
or criminal activity are cleared away very quickly. The traffic
officers have very tight targets, and the early evidence suggests that
they are succeeding in clearing away accidents very quickly. We have
learned from the initial implementation of the scheme, and day by day

improving the network would be to ensure that highways departments have
access to the resources that they need to carry out road safety
improvements. When I asked the county council to carry out an
improvement in my patch, on a roundabout on the A59 between Sabden and
Clitheroe, I was told that it did not have the money, yet we have had
fatalities and many injuries there. Would not it be better to get
county councils, the police and the Treasury to talk together about
preventing the Treasury from siphoning off the money from road speed
cameras, and using it on road safety schemes that will save

last year that after this year the netting-off arrangements would end
so that there is no linkage between cameras and revenue to safety
partnerships. Next year, the money will go back to the local road
safety partnership and can be spent not only on cameras but on other
road safety measures. If the hon. Gentleman&#146;s local authority

Baird):</b> Since the implementation of the Freedom of

central Government Departments and

However, she gave the number of cases that the commissioner&#146;s
office has received rather than the number of complaints, so perhaps
she does not know how many complaints have been received. Does she
expect there to be a reduction in the number of complaints, given that
the Government propose to reduce the cost threshold, which will mean
that fewer applications will be answered? When officials decide that
Ministers may have something to hide and that they should push an
application up to ministerial level, the cost of a Minister considering
that application will be included in the cost
threshold.</p><p><a name="06101752000118"><b><a name="61017-0002.htm_spnew83"><a name="06101752001462">Vera

describes it. When deciding whether the &#163;600 threshold has been
reached, officials will take into account the time taken to read and
consider an application, rather than just the time taken to make a
search. That is surely a matter of common sense. In that process,
Ministers&#146; time is priced at &#163;25 an hour, just like
everyone else&#146;s. That shows that the engagement of Ministers in
the process is pretty cheap&#151;much cheaper than the equivalent in
my previous job used to be. The involvement of Ministers will not
necessarily mean that the process will cost more. Ministers do not get
involved only when a matter is controversial&#151;for instance, a
Minister might get involved because the question is about him or her
personally. Moreover, good governance under section 36 requires that
Ministers get involved from time to time, so I think that the hon.
Gentleman is making a number of false
links.</p><p><a name="06101752000119"><b><a name="61017-0002.htm_spnew84"><a name="06101752001463">Andrew

process will remain in place, and every time there is a refusal, there
will be an appeal all the way up from the internal review to the
commissioner and to the tribunal. The right hon. Gentleman will know,
however, that there is already a power to aggregate similar requests
from the same inquirer&#151;the BBC has been extensively referred to
in the publicity, for example. That is a power, however, not a
compulsion; sometimes it is used, and sometimes it is not. What is
being proposed is an extension&#151;we are going to sound out where
the extensions should take place&#151;to enable the aggregation of
non-similar requests. Serious serial users account for about 14 per
cent. of requests, and they are very expensive. In particular, they
take up a lot of senior officials&#146; time. I have said that we
price their time out at &#163;25 an hour, but it costs us a good deal
more than that. So this proposal is an attempt to strike a balance
between an appropriate level of information being delivered and public
service delivery, which is what our officials are mostly
about.</p><p><a name="06101752000123"><b><a name="61017-0002.htm_spnew88"><a name="06101752001467">Mr.

was announced today that the Treasury will continue to refuse to
release information about the true cost of identity cards under the
Freedom of Information Act. It has been ordered to provide that
information but, no, it is going to appeal. How does the Minister

freedom of information Act. They preferred to cleave to secrecy during
all that time. There was not much evidence of letting sunshine in to

Treasury must be asked about its own approach, but it is entitled, like
everyone else, to go through the appellate procedure, and that is
exactly what it is going to do. If we wanted to make a serious attempt
to curtail or limit these requests, the way to do it would be to levy a
flat-rate charge. That would reduce by about 44 per cent. the time
spent processing the requests, but we have expressly chosen not even to
consult on that option. The impact of our proposal will be to reduce
the most expensive requests while preserving the right of the vast
majority of people to get absolutely free information. The hon.

distanced ourselves from the appointment of judges, too. We have

for whom mediation is important so that issues relating to finances
and, above all, the care of the children can be agreed on instead of
battled out in court. The Government are working to ensure that there
is a great deal more mediation to avoid unnecessary court disputes. For
example, 400 couples got publicly funded mediation in 1997 and the

there will be a public inquiry and if, in his view, it covers the same
ground as the inquest, what happens is that, unless there are
exceptional reasons to the contrary, the coroner has a duty to adjourn
the inquest until after the inquiry has concluded. The meeting with
officials came about because, although the inquest was opened by the

information&#151;after the Hutton inquiry had been announced, but

pathologists, including a toxicology report. The coroner wanted to be

were properly recorded. I was not working in the Department at the

that they are likely to result in the future. However, there is a
requirement for returning officers to be aware of the problem and to
make plans to deal with a heavier turnout, perhaps in a general

leave be given to bring in a Bill to amend the Gambling Act 2005 to
allow for increased provision of casinos; and for connected
purposes.</p></ul><p><a name="06101752000178">The
Bill&#146;s objectives are to amend the Gambling Act 2005 to allow a
minimum of eight regional casinos, with the onus on the regeneration of
key cities, as initially proposed by the Government. After the
Act&#146;s consideration in Committee, the Government introduced new
clauses to set limits on the number of casinos. At that point, the
number of regional casinos was set at eight, but as the Government
faced opposition, that number was reduced to one. As a result, the
national potential for jobs and investment will not be fully
achieved.</p><p><a name="06101752000179">The failure
to recognise that loss of potential investment could result in the loss
of about 22,000 possible jobs and an additional 17,000 support jobs. In
total, the opportunity for 40,000 new jobs could have been lost, not to
mention reductions in investment. The failure to support all the main
regeneration schemes will have a negative effect and may put back
regeneration programmes by about a decade. In total, the UK could lose
the potential for more than &#163;5 billion in investment,
particularly in deprived areas.</p><p><a name="06101752000180">In terms of protective
legislation, the Secretary of State has addressed concerns regarding
habitual gambling, stating that she does not think that casinos would
increase problem gambling, and that she would prefer to close them if
they did. In advance of the implementation of the relevant provisions
of the Gambling Act 2005, and every two or three years thereafter, the
Government intend to fund a national study that will measure the impact
that any new casinos would have on the surrounding areas and the issue
of problem gambling. In addition, provision has been made in the Act to
establish the Responsibility in Gambling Trust. The trust has been
established on a voluntary basis to provide funding to support problem
gamblers and their dependants.</p><p><a name="06101752000181">The casino advisory
panel&#146;s criteria, as laid down by the Secretary of State, were
to ensure that location satisfies need, for there to be the best
possible test of social impact to include areas of need and
regeneration, for consideration to be given to areas that are likely to
benefit in those terms from a new casino, and to ensure that the areas
selected were willing to license a new casino. The panel condensed the
applications down to a shortlist of eight. On the shortlist were
Blackpool, Wembley, Cardiff, Glasgow, Manchester, Newcastle and
Sheffield. I believe that the Government should increase the numbers of
casinos, as the decision that has been taken is not based on the best
interest of those areas that are in dire need.</p><p><a name="06101752000182">Local authorities should not be
fighting each other over restricted resources. Rather, the Government
should allow a fair system of opportunity, and allow more than one area
of need to benefit from regeneration, investment and jobs. The
Government have hinted that legislation could be revisited, and that
the permissible number of regional casino licences

and the public. It should be remembered that the Government expect that
a regional casino will be a major development, offering clear potential
for regeneration, and providing not only a range of gambling
activities, but also perhaps including hotel accommodation, conference
facilities, restaurants, areas for live entertainment and other leisure
attractions.</p><p><a name="06101752000183">There is
already a casino in Coventry that would meet the criteria, should the
Government be willing to increase the numbers. In contrast to many
other proposals, Coventry&#146;s submission was based on an
extensive, independent assessment. Therefore, I propose that an
amendment be made to the Act, increasing the number of regional casinos
from one to a minimum of
eight.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="61017-0003.htmordayhd_2"><a name="06101752001359">3.42

Julie Kirkbride (Bromsgrove) (Con):</b> I rise to speak
against the desire of the hon. Member for Coventry, South
(Mr. Cunningham) for there to be an amendment to this
gambling legislation. I do so despite the fact that I have a great deal
of respect for the hon. Gentleman, who is a neighbour and colleague in
the west midlands, as I believe that he is profoundly wrong to think
that his constituency will benefit from such a development. If I may
say so to the hon. Gentleman, I also think that he is being used
somewhat as a stalking horse by his Government, to test opinion in the
House on whether there is an appetite to change what was set out by the
Gambling Act 2005. The simple fact is that it is not necessary to have
this proposed legislation, because the relevant provisions in the Act
can be changed by statutory instrument, subject to a vote by all
Members.</p><p><a name="06101752000185">It might be
helpful if I remind the House about how we got the Gambling Act 2005.
When the Government introduced the original Bill, they intended to have
a free-for-all on the development of casinos across the country,
subject to demand as the operators saw that. As time passed, and as
Members spoke out, along with other sections of
society&#151;including the <i> Daily Mail</i>, the Minister for Sport
might be fond of remembering&#151;it became clear that it would not
be acceptable to have a major extension of such Las Vegas-style casinos
across the United Kingdom. Given that a general election was imminent,
the Government agreed to the idea that there should be only one
regional casino, eight large casinos and eight small casinos, and that
that would be the way that the measures would be proceeded with, unless
the House decided otherwise, through a statutory instrument such as
that which I
mentioned.</p><p><a name="06101752000186">The
Minister for Sport, who is in the Chamber, might remember that my hon.
Friend the Member for East Devon (Mr. Swire) asked him about
the matter during Question Time just a week or so ago. The Minister
said:</p><a name="61017-0003.htmbrev_4"><a name="06101752001334"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The
Conservatives decided to come back with the proposal of one regional
casino, which we accepted because we wanted to get the Bill on to the
statute book in order to protect the vulnerable in our society. That is
where it now stops&#151;at one regional casino&#151;unless the hon.
Gentleman says to the Government that the Conservatives want to change
the proposal.&#148;&#151;[<i> Official Report</i>, 9 October 2006;

my hon. Friend, but although that represents the public face of the
Government, their private face appears to be somewhat different. I
suspect that the Secretary of State is much keener on a bigger
free-for-all on casino development than the Minister is, at least in
public. Following a meeting that took place between the Secretary of
State and Coventry Members to petition her about a casino in Coventry,

that the Government had views on who they would like the licence to be
awarded to when we heard about the Deputy Prime Minister&#146;s visit
to a ranch in Colorado owned by Mr. Philip Anschutz, who
also happens to own the dome. Mr. Anschutz is determined to
get a regional casino licence for the dome, but were such a licence to
be granted, the Government would face the huge embarrassment of having
to tell everyone else in the country that the development that is
attached to that licence&#151;such as it is&#151;had gone to the
most prosperous part of the United Kingdom, rather than another
area.</p><p><a name="06101752000194">I hope that the
casino advisory panel&#151;and the Government, for that
matter&#151;will give the one licence available to Blackpool. That
would allow Blackpool to revive its tourism and enjoy the regeneration
attached to the proposals that was set out by the hon. Member for
Coventry, South. The best case that has been put forward is for such a
development to be in the Blackpool
area.</p><p><a name="06101752000195">I should warn
the people of the Blackpool area that such a casino would involve
significant moral hazards. One of the arguments that is often cited
about the development of casinos is that we have insufficient exciting
opportunities for betting and gaming in the United Kingdom today. I
profoundly refute such a suggestion because there are ample
opportunities for betting. We can bet at the races, in betting shops
and on the internet. We can bet on national savings bonds, if we want
to buy some. We can bet on the lottery. We can win more money than we
ever thought that we would have, and lose more money than we would hope
to do,

profoundly different form of gambling and are almost certainly bound to
lead to a big increase in addictive gambling in the United
Kingdom.</p><p><a name="06101752000196">Hon. Members
who have not seen such casinos should visit one for themselves. They
are made up of huge complexes in which sheds upon sheds are filled with
gaming machines. People put their coins in those machines and pull the
levers in the hope that they will win the jackpot prize.</p><p><a name="06101752000197">The machines are deliberately
designed to encourage the player to believe that one more pull of the
lever will win them the jackpot, but the owners of the machines have
programmed them to pay out exactly the amount that the operator is
prepared to lose. No gaming is involved; the machines are simply for
money-making.</p><p><a name="06101752000198">Gaming
machines pose a significant moral hazard for our fellow countrymen, as
was shown in the recent PricewaterhouseCoopers report, commissioned by
Greenwich council to assess the implications of such developments in
the Greenwich area. The report was leaked to the <i> Evening
Standard</i> but it has not yet been published due to its explosive
contents. We are led to believe, however, that the report notes that
groups such as young people, the poorly educated, pensioners and people
who play on slot machines are at high risk and more likely to become
addicts. I cannot believe that Labour Members are keen to see that
happen in their
constituencies.</p><p><a name="06101752000199">The
social costs of such developments include bankruptcy, suicide, illness
and crime, which can involve money acquired from family, friends and
employers under false pretences. Those are the moral hazards of the
casino industry and the Government were right to proceed on the basis
of a pilot project, by offering only one regional licence. It is right
and proper that we assess the impact of that project before we proceed
with a roll-out across the United Kingdom, whether it involves one,
eight or 100 new casinos. We want to know about the implications before
we go ahead with such a worrying social development, so I oppose the
Bill.</p><p><a name="06101752000200"><i> Question put,

Government.</p><p><a name="06101752000514">Despite
the eight years of preparation, and the fact that the parliamentary
Session began back in May last year, this enormous Bill did not receive
a Second Reading in another place until 11 January this year.
Unsurprisingly, it took their lordships nearly six months to complete
their consideration of it. They did that in a thorough and expert way
and did their best to consider the Bill, as Parliament should, clause
by clause, line by line and argument by argument. The Bill received its
Second Reading on the third sitting day after the House received it
from another place and duly proceeded to Committee. The Bill, which was
already enormous when it left another place, was then made into a
parliamentary leviathan by the Government&#146;s late but none the
less welcome acceptance of the argument that it should be a
consolidation measure and should replace the whole of the Companies Act
1985. The Opposition welcomed that decision, but we consistently urged
the Government to enable us to do our duty as legislators on the detail
of the Bill in Committee, and asked them to take the summer recess as
additional time to get the generally uncontentious consolidation
measures right and allow the Committee stage to extend into
October.</p><p><a name="06101752000515"><b><a name="61017-0004.htm_spnew140"><a name="06101752001818">Mr.

of the consolidation measures that were passed without debate at the
end of the Committee stage, as the programme motion required.</p><p><a name="06101752000517">As a consequence, we estimate
that, during the next three days, the House is being invited to
consider about 200 amendments to amendments that the Committee was not
able to consider in July, but which have since turned out to be
defective in some way. Those amendments to amendments, together with
the hundreds of other new amendments and 88 new clauses, were tabled
only last week. That has inevitably placed the Opposition Front-Bench
spokesmen in some difficulties, even with the assistance of their
advisers, and even with the best will in the world, it is simply beyond
the capacity of any Back Bencher to have any sensible appreciation of
the scale of what is being attempted.</p><br>

mountain to climb. Unbelievably, a further 24 new amendments have been

being invited to consider, you, Mr. Speaker, have identified
nine separate debates for today, 12 separate debates for Wednesday, and
under the programme motion presented by the Government, 31 debates on
Thursday. Proceedings on Report on Thursday will be further curtailed
by the weekly business statement and by the Third Reading debate, which
I understand is due to commence at 4 o&#146;clock. That means that
each subject, identified by you under the rules of the House, let alone
individual amendments, will have less than seven minutes for the
Government to explain the case for their amendments, for the Opposition
then to raise their concerns and for the Government to reply, let alone
leaving any time at all for Back Benchers to make a contribution; and

go back to a decision, which unfortunately seemed to have universal
consent, at least in all parts of the other place, to bring into the
Bill&#146;s scope a massive consolidation exercise, including
hundreds of new clauses from existing company law. This Bill was
originally called the Company Law Reform Bill, and its intention was to
reform parts of company law. It is now called the Companies Bill thanks
to an interesting vote in Committee, which the Government managed to
lose&#151;technically it was a free vote on their side. The Bill is
now a general Companies Bill. It tries to consolidate the whole of the
existing law, and it is that specific decision which has led to the
various
difficulties.</p><p><a name="06101752000527">The
Government have been courteous and helpful to Liberal Democrat Members
in making sure that there is enough room to debate the topics that we
want to debate. Given how much is going on in the Bill, however, the
fundamental problem is that there is not enough time for debate,
because at this time of year there is not enough time to allow
additional days for discussion. We are in a very difficult position,
which was entirely foreseeable when all sides decided to change the
Bill from a reform Bill into a consolidation Bill. As it stands, the

should be doing&#151;we should learn from America, where running a
company has become a matter of engaging in financial manipulation to
enhance the share price, which enhances the income of the people at the
top through share options and pay schemes. Those dodges are being used
both here and in the United States, and such practices led to the
collapse of Enron and many prosecutions by the Securities and Exchange
Commission, which is now, as they say in the United States,
&#147;seeing the perps walk&#148;. We should be countering those
practices, which brought about the collapse of huge American companies

because they have tabled more than 800 afterthoughts. If the Government
are rethinking at this stage, it indicates that the thinking process at
an earlier stage was not satisfactory&#151;we are effectively dealing
with a new Bill. The strongest critics of the Bill were not members of
the Standing Committee, so they were unable to table amendments in
Committee. The Bill has not been given the intense scrutiny that it
needs.</p><p><a name="06101752000533">The Bill is
effectively a new Bill, because there are so many amendments. My head
bursts when I read through the amendments. Some hon. Members are
accountants and auditors, and they cluck appreciatively when they read
such amendments, but my head is strained by trying to digest them. If I
were to read out the amendments, it would take three days. There is
just not time for us to deal with all the inherent complexities and all
the changes that need to be made from any point of view that is either
critical of the way in which companies are run or deferential to the
vested interests that deal with those companies.</p><p><a name="06101752000534">We need more time if we are to
produce a Bill that will endure. After all, the Government have had
nine years in which to introduce this Bill. A new companies Act was
necessary to change the balance when we first came to office. Now,
after nine years of gestation, we have a Bill that requires, at this
very late stage, 800 amendments that there will be no time to consider.
I have tabled, with my hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne,
Central (Jim Cousins), several amendments of genius that I would want
to discuss in full. Some have been selected, mercifully, while some
have not, but there are serious issues to discuss in relation to each
one. Having read the selection list, I find that all my amendments are
crammed into Thursday, when we have about 36 groups to deal with.
Thursday is going to be hell on the basis of this timetable. I plead
for more time while affirming my deference to our Front Bench and to
the purposes of this Government whom I so loyalty
support.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="61017-0004.htmordayhd_7"><a name="06101752001364">4.21

despairing of the conduct of Government Front Benchers. The fact that

is that this Report stage is the first occasion on which the House as a
whole, as distinct from the Committee, can consider the detail of the
Bill. The effect of a timetabling motion of this kind is to preclude
the House from doing so. Because of the way in which the knives will
fall, a whole range of important issues will not be addressed or
examined, far less voted upon.</p><p><a name="06101752000537">We are doing this far too
often, and there are examples of the chaos that results. I often have
to handle the Criminal Justice Act 2003 in the courts, as does my hon.
and learned Friend the Member for Harborough (Mr. Garnier).
We know full well that the timetabling motions with regard to that Act
produced one of the worst criminal justice Acts that the courts have
ever had to deal with. We are now doing the same thing, but in this
case it is worse because we have not only a new Bill but the new

making in expressing the criticism that the Government should face is
underlined and made all the worse by virtue of the fact that the Bill
is largely politically uncontroversial in seeking to bring up to date,
consolidate and modernise the law governing corporations, yet the
Government say that they are in a tremendous hurry and must allow it go
through at an accelerated pace, probably because of their own
incompetence.</p><p><a name="06101752000539"><b><a name="61017-0004.htm_spnew152"><a name="06101752001830">Mr.

His comments lead to another point: we could use the carry-over
procedure. The Bill is important, so let us use the carry-over
procedure. We were willing to use it for the Corporate Manslaughter
Bill last week. The measure that we are considering is as difficult, if
not more so. Let us take time over
it.</p><p><a name="06101752000540">I introduced many
Bills when I was a Minister. I suppose that I handled six, seven, eight
or nine Bills on the Floor of the House or in Committee. I am therefore
well versed in their conduct. As hon. Members know, I am not an
especially modest man but they will accept that it was my considered
view that a Minister had to master the detail of a Bill as well as any
official; otherwise, the Minister cannot overrule the officials or set
policy. Ministers cannot handle Bills that are much more than 30
clauses to that standard of excellence. Bills that are much longer need
teams of Ministers to deal with them.</p><p><a name="06101752000541">It is inevitable that Ministers
will not understand what they are doing when measures are the size of
the Companies Bill. They are thus wholly in the hands of their
officials. That is not a proper exercise. Moreover, it makes
timetabling even more inappropriate. Any honest and sensible Member
knows full well that it is a disgrace and that we are not doing our
duty, and will vote against the timetable motion, as against many
others.</p><p><a name="06101752000542">I am now
looking at the Conservative Whip. When we get into office, he and the
Front-Bench team will find people such as me unwilling to support
timetable motions. The Conservative party, when in office, had better
not ask people like me to vote for such motions because, in general, we
will vote against
them.</p><br>

afternoon&#146;s proceedings are a sad and worrying example of what
is wrong with Parliament and the way in which the legislative process
has been eroded. The Executive branch has achieved a dominance in our
constitution that has unbalanced what used to be a fine constitution.
That is deeply worrying. I greatly object to the Minister for Industry
and the Regions telling hon. Members that if we objected to timetabling
we would lose time for discussion of the Bill. That is arrogant because
it shows the Government automatically assuming that they have a
majority. It also means that the notion of timetabling includes an
element of blackmail. The House is constantly told, &#147;You
mustn&#146;t object, speak your mind or ask for more time because if
you do, you&#146;ll get even less time for debating the Bill.&#148;
That is
wrong.</p><a name="06101752001275"><p>Even
worse, the Minister said that the Bill had already been the subject of
considerable scrutiny in another place. It is true that the other place
spent six months or so on the measure and did a fine job. The other
place contains people of great distinction and often technical
expertise, whose deliberations are extremely useful to us when we take
a Bill from the Lords. The fact remains, however, that the other place
consists almost entirely, apart from some hereditaries, of nominated
Members&#151;people who have no democratic mandate whatever. The role
of the House of Lords as an additional stage in the process is one
thing, but the idea that it can replace the House of Commons and that,
if a Bill has received a certain amount of consideration in the other
place, it requires no more than perfunctory consideration from
ourselves, is deeply offensive. It is against the democratic idea that
legislation should be undertaken by elected

afraid, has been getting worse for many years. Often, there is no one
dramatic moment when everyone focuses on what has happened&#151;but,
suddenly, after a few years, we turn around and realise that the
fundamental balance of the constitution has been eroded and
lost.</p><p><a name="06101752000550">The Minister today gave a
particularly bad example of the Government taking its large majority
for granted. She has added insult to injury by producing all these
amendments at the last moment. What she is telling the House and the
country is that the bureaucracy is instructed that even if the
Committee stage ends in July, it has two or three months to do any
necessary work deriving from the Committee stage and to produce further
consequential amendments. It does not need to bother to introduce those
until 24 hours before the parliamentary process begins, because the
stupid politicians will have no time to spend on them anyway, and they
will be rolled over by a large majority. The parliamentary process has
therefore become just a decorative aspect of the constitution&#151;a
time-consuming and rather trying formality that is really just a rubber
stamp for what has been agreed in Whitehall.

Many have made representations about the Bill during its passage
through the House, and they are horrified by the proposals in the

for four years, but she has not had the same benefit and I fear that

certainly true that not enough time was spent on it in Committee, and
it is regrettable that the Government chose to end those proceedings in
July rather than carry them over from the summer, which is what the
Bill deserved.</p><p><a name="06101752000559">As has
been stated, this is the largest Bill ever to go through Parliament.
Its consequences are far reaching, affecting the very lifeblood of our
economy. It is therefore especially regrettable that the Government
should introduce almost 1,000 new amendments and a huge number of new
clauses when, once again, the time available for debate is very
limited.</p><p><a name="06101752000560">The
Government&#146;s abuse of power has also been referred to, and that
is the right term in this context. The Minister is abusing her power,
and she demeans herself and her office by treating the Bill in this
cavalier fashion. More importantly, she also treats with contempt the
people who will be affected by the Bill&#151;the mainstream public
and the businesses that run the economy. The Government amendments and
new clauses are detailed and specific. If we do not consider them
properly, we risk producing shoddy legislation that will have a
negative impact on the business community and on the public at
large.</p><p><a name="06101752000561">This Bill is a
consolidation measure and comes some 20 years after the Companies Act
1985. However, it does not take into adequate consideration the fact
that the global business environment has changed considerably. Business
is now compelled to take into account environmental issues and the
protection of data, as well as a huge number of other issues that
simply did not exist in 1985. Again, we fail in our duty by failing to
consider all those issues properly, in the context not only of Britain
and the European Union, but of worldwide business.</p><p><a name="06101752000562">Sadly, the Government&#146;s
not allowing enough time today, tomorrow and on Friday&#151;or,
indeed, in previous years&#151;to debate these issues will result in
the sad consequence that we shall do a disservice to the business
community. In failing properly to scrutinise the Bill, we also fail in
our duty to the House and to the country.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="61017-0004.htmordayhd_12"><a name="06101752001369">4.40

habit for them to assume that Parliament need no longer scrutinise

almost 1,000 amendments, and no doubt the Minister will have taken
advice from her civil servants on what will actually be constituted by
the proposed changes. However, the Government will not allow the House

Parliament.</p><p><a name="06101752000565">I am
terrified that a misjudged clause in the Bill could have ramifications
right across the business community. That is why Ministers should
listen carefully to the people who represent businesses and to those

proper consideration of these matters and to give the Opposition and
other Members with opinions the opportunity to comment. As is my

Gerald Howarth (Aldershot) (Con):</b> On a point of order,
Mr. Deputy Speaker. May I inform you that, today, the
Ministry of Defence published an extremely important document,
&#147;Defence Technology Strategy&#148;, which follows from
&#147;Defence Industrial Strategy&#148;, published last December?
The new document sets out some of the key technology capabilities that
it is believed we must maintain in the United
Kingdom.</p><p><a name="06101752001128">I must report to you,
Mr. Deputy Speaker, that I have spoken to the Secretary of
State for Defence within the past few moments. He assures me that
copies have been sent to the shadow Secretary of State for Defence, my
hon. Friend the Member for Woodspring (Dr. Fox), to the Chairman of the
Select Committee on Defence and to the hon. Member for North Devon
(Nick Harvey). None of them has received the documents, yet those in
industry have copies on their desks. I understand that the media have
them, so it is parliamentarians who do not have copies, save for one
copy of a 200-page document in the Library. Mr. Speaker
regards it as being very important that Ministers report adequately to
the House.</p><p><a name="06101752001129">Will you,
Mr. Deputy Speaker, refer this matter to Mr.
Speaker? Without this document, we simply cannot hold the Government to
account. The press will respond to the document today, and if we do not
have adequate advance knowledge of it, it is very difficult for us to
participate in the debate. The Government get just one bite of the
cherry, and we get none. Could you please take up this issue with
Mr. Speaker? It is a grave discourtesy to the
House.</p><p><a name="06101752001130"><b><a name="61017-0004.htm_spnew180"><a name="06101752002396">Mr.
Deputy Speaker (Sir Alan Haselhurst):</b> The hon. Gentleman
has had the opportunity to put this matter on the record, and I am sure
that it will be noted by Mr. Speaker. The hon. Gentleman
probably supplied the answer to his concern in his remarks.
Mr. Speaker has indeed made it clear that he expects hon.
Members to have as much early notice as is possible of matters of
importance in the form of publications or whatever. Certainly,
Mr. Speaker will be concerned that some problem arose with
the dispatch of these documents and that parliamentarians did not have
what others outside the House had. I am sure that Mr.
Speaker will take note of that fact. However, there is indeed a copy in
the Library at the
moment.</p><br>

matters of substance in which many members of the public are
interested, and I should have thought that many hon. Members are
concerned about them, too. I hope that we shall do so with some of the
tolerance, good humour and dignity that we experienced in Committee but
which we did not experience during the debate on the programme
motion.</p><p><a name="06101752001146">It is a little
daunting to open the batting on a 1,264 clause Bill. However,
thankfully, I wish to speak only to new clause 4 and amendment No.
2&#151;the consequential amendment tabled by my hon. Friend the
Member for Portsmouth, North (Sarah McCarthy-Fry) and me.</p><p><a name="06101752001147">The House will be aware that
directors&#146; duties have attracted a great deal of attention
outside Parliament and, consequently and quite rightly, were subject to
detailed and lengthy scrutiny in Committee. I am given to understand
that the public response to the issue has been one of the largest of
all time. The office of my right hon. Friend the Minister for Industry
and the Regions has been inundated by the cards generated by the
Corporate Responsibility Coalition and the Trade Justice Movement. I
congratulate those two umbrella organisations on their campaign, and I
thank the many members of the public who have flagged up their views,
both to the Department and to individual Members of Parliament around
the country.</p><p><a name="06101752001148"><b><a name="61017-0005.htm_spnew184"><a name="06101752002400">The
Minister for Industry and the Regions (Margaret Hodge):</b> My
hon. Friend raises issues that are of huge concern to many hundreds of
thousands of people outside this House. Does he therefore share my
concern that, following an acrimonious debate on the programme motion,
only one Conservative Back Bencher has chosen to be present for this
debate on one of the Bill&#146;s key
issues?</p><p><a name="06101752001149"><b><a name="61017-0005.htm_spnew185"><a name="06101752002401">Patrick
Hall:</b> That is entirely up to the official Opposition, as
my right hon. Friend knows.</p><p><a name="06101752001150">I was reflecting on the fact
that there is a great deal of interest in these matters outside this
place. Therefore, although we should not judge the quality of an issue
on the size of the postbag on it, it is right that we recognise the
scale of interest and concern and reflect that on the Floor of the
House on Report, as we did in Committee.</p><p><a name="06101752001151">I therefore reiterate my
welcome for the progress that the Government have made&#151;and
widely supported elsewhere&#151;in respect of this first-ever
statement in statute that company directors, in fulfilling their
primary duty to promote the interests</p><a name="61017-0005.htmbrev_58"><a name="06101752001336"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;of the company for the benefit of

environment&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="06101752001154">That is the
first ever codification, and placement in statute, of duties around the
concept of corporate social responsibility. That is, indeed,
progress.</p><p><a name="06101752001155">It would be
remiss of us, however, not to take this opportunity on Report to seek
to ensure that what we end up with is the best outcome&#151;one that
is pro-business and at the same time socially and environmentally
responsible. New clause 4 follows clause 173 closely, but substitutes
&#147;have regard...to&#148; with &#147;must endeavour
to&#148;. The reason for that is clear. An examination of the
&#147;Shorter Oxford English Dictionary&#148; reveals that
&#147;endeavour&#148; means</p><a name="61017-0005.htmbrev_61"><a name="06101752001339"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;To exert oneself...To
try&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06101752001156">or</p><a name="61017-0005.htmbrev_62"><a name="06101752001340"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;make
an effort for a specified object; to attempt
strenuously&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06101752001157">to do
something. On the other hand, to have regard to something is to give
attention or consideration to it. Whereas &#147;have
regard...to&#148; is a subjective test&#151;a director can say
that he or she has thought about the six secondary duties listed in
clause 173 and new clause 4, and may or may not have done more about
them&#151;&#147;must endeavour to&#148; is an objective test,
requiring some evidence of having sought to abide by those duties
before deciding whether it was in the best interests of the company so
to
do.</p><p><a name="06101752001158"><b><a name="61017-0005.htm_spnew186"><a name="06101752002402">Mr.
Mike Weir (Angus) (SNP):</b> I agree with the hon. Gentleman.
I note that he said that the clause is pro-business. Given the changing
environment and the concern about environmental issues in this country,
does he agree that good businesses will look to be responsible in any
event, because they must move with the times or else they will not
survive in the new
century?</p><p><a name="06101752001159"><b><a name="61017-0005.htm_spnew187"><a name="06101752002403">Patrick
Hall:</b> That is an important point, and good businesses do
approach such matters in that way. What we are trying to create through
the Bill, perhaps as amended, is a level playing field to ensure that
they are not disadvantaged for giving emphasis to these important

that what I am proposing would not change the current position that the
overriding duty is to promote the success of the company, but it places
the six duties that articulate the essence of enlightened shareholder
value at the heart of company law, which has never been the case

on the agenda. I am not convinced that merely having regard to them
would suffice, but we shall

clause 4, it will encourage directors to be proactive, rather than
passive, about the long-term impact of their business operations on
employees, communities, suppliers and the environment. That would
support directors who provide the leadership to take such a route, and
why should that not be so? Who would not want it to be so? I suggest
that they would be the directors who are irresponsible, short-sighted
and too lacking in imagination to see the business case for a more
progressive
approach.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="61017-0005.htmordayhd_16"><a name="06101752001372">5.15

in Committee by several hon. Members who suggested that the position I
am advancing would open opportunities for litigation and thus increase
insurance costs, and they will be able to make their points today.
However, the hon. Member for Cambridge (David Howarth) pointed out
several times in Committee that suing a director or a board for not
fulfilling all or some of the additional six secondary duties will be
limited to few classes of people: the board as a whole, a
super-majority of shareholders, liquidators acting on behalf of an
insolvent company and a new board during a takeover. A minority of
shareholders could bring a derivative action, although the Bill closes
that option to a very limited number of cases because such action would
have to be subject to ratification by the majority of shareholders.
However, we should not forget that none of those classes of people
could sue for a loss to the company unless they could demonstrate that
there was a loss due solely to a breach of one or more of the six
duties.</p><p><a name="06101752001163">When applying
any of the duties that we care to think of&#151;whether they are the
six secondary duties listed in clause 173, the other seven outlined as
general duties in chapter 2 of part 10, or several in an amazing list
of 640 or so duties, the existence of which the hon. Member for
Huntingdon (Mr. Djanogly) repeatedly mentioned in
Committee&#151;directors are expected to act in good faith, to
exercise reasonable care, skill and diligence, and to do what is most
likely to promote the success of the company for the benefit of its
members as a whole. Suing a company director is difficult enough
already, so attacking new clause 4 on the basis that it would make such
action more likely is not a credible argument. On the contrary&#151;I
accept that this is at the margins&#151;the measure would help to
protect directors who took responsible and long-term decisions and
strengthen the hand of shareholders who wished to challenge directors
who did not do that. The power to challenge such directors would come
not from new clause 4 or clause 173, but elsewhere, because it is
already well established in
law.</p><p><a name="06101752001164"><b><a name="61017-0005.htm_spnew188"><a name="06101752002404">Mr.

where it would be firmly on the agenda. It would also apply to the
behaviour of British companies in their overseas operations, as British
statute law does
not.</p><p><a name="06101752001168">I want to touch
on the criticism that the new clause would lead to conflict between the
different duties. That is certainly not the intention of the proposal,
nor would that be its effect. The primary duty remains clear; were
there any conflict the directors have the means to resolve it in the
normal way, as at present. There is no change in the current situation
or as it is envisaged in the Bill, so I do not agree with the
criticism.</p><p><a name="06101752001169">It has been
suggested that the new clause represents a pluralist approach to
corporate social responsibility. That is absolutely not the case. A
pluralist approach would allow the interests of all the
company&#146;s stakeholders&#151;its employees, the wider
community, local residents and consumers&#151;to be given the same
priority as the interests of shareholders. It is true that such a
situation is a desired long-term objective of CORE&#151;the Corporate
Responsibility Coalition&#151;and others but I accept entirely that
the framework advanced by the Government through the Bill is one of
enlightened shareholder value. The Bill is not about a pluralist
approach, nor is the new clause. It is firmly under the umbrella of
enlightened shareholder value, which means that the primary duty of
directors is to promote the success of the company. If there is to be
suing for loss, only losses to the company will
count.</p><p><a name="06101752001170">Before I
conclude, I want to make some observations about the position of the
official Opposition. In the other place, in May, Conservative peers
sought to remove all matters pertaining to enlightened shareholder
value&#151;an attempt to turn back the clock on the progress that is
being made in company law. The word &#147;reactionary&#148; may be
appropriate. Their position flies in the face of the new support for
corporate social responsibility and compassionate Conservatism offered
by the new leader of their party, the right hon. Member for Witney
(Mr. Cameron), who has made some welcome and strong comments
in support of the enlightened shareholder value perspective, so
different positions are on display.</p><br>

were objects of fashion and I repeat that statement. I say that not for
the reasons that he gave, but because there are some 650 common law
duties, of which these six are part, and the Government have
cherry-picked certain duties that they want to put into the Bill. All
the duties are equally relevant. I am not saying that the six that the
Government have chosen are not relevant; I am saying that they should
not be codified.</p><p><a name="06101752001175"><b><a name="61017-0005.htm_spnew193"><a name="06101752002409">Patrick

duties&#151;I take the hon. Gentleman&#146;s word for the fact that
there are 650&#151;as of equal weight and value is not credible and
does not stand up to scrutiny. Looking after one&#146;s employees,
and having regard to the local community and the environment are
perfectly reasonable issues to give higher priority to. We know that
the right hon. Member for Witney adopts a kindly, sunny and progressive
stance on these matters. The Conservative party went to the polls last

consultation and 10 months of Bill process, involving several thousand
amendments&#151;650 of them tabled by the Government in the past
week&#151;we near the end of the process on the largest Bill in
history. One issue that is directly relevant to every group of
amendments to be discussed on Report is the timing of implementation.
There is much speculation and there are many rumours going round the
City and the law firms on that point. It would be most helpful if the
Minister could set out the position when the opportunity arises for her
to do so.</p><p><a name="06101752001178">I will
speak to our amendments Nos. 392 to 398. As the hon. Member for Bedford
(Patrick Hall) said, the issue of directors&#146; duties to promote
the success of the company as set out in clause 173 is the area of the
Bill that has probably courted the most controversy. I do not believe
that the Government really wanted that when they set out with the Bill,
but gradually, possibly over seven years of consultation, they have dug
themselves into something of a hole on these provisions, from which
they are now finding it difficult to extract themselves. We have seen
that in the conflicting messages from Ministers since the Committee. It
was interesting to hear the hon. Gentleman say that we are sending out
conflicting messages. I suggest that quite the opposite is the
case.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="61017-0005.htmordayhd_17"><a name="06101752001373">5.30

an article in the <i> Financial Times</i> of 26 September, the Minister,
then at the Labour party conference, was reported as saying that the
Government were listening to lobbyists and could still use regulations
to increase reporting and behavioural requirements for directors, once
the Bill was</p><a name="61017-0005.htmbrev_71"><a name="06101752001349"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;in force

was reported as saying, within 24 hours of the Minister of
State&#146;s remarks, that the Government did not intend to introduce
any changes on Third Reading. I am therefore slightly confused, not
least because, without advising us, the Minister tabled amendments to
the provisions on accounts and reports, which we are to discuss
tomorrow.</p><p><a name="06101752001181">The plot
thickens yet more. The Minister needs to advise the House whether there
is a secret Labour, or perhaps trade union, agenda, or whether two
Department of Trade and Industry Ministers are pulling in different
directions. Of course, new clause 4, tabled by Labour Back Benchers,
creates a third position. Business expects a clear direction from the

susceptible to regulation and that their individual circumstances
should be taken into
account.</p><p><a name="06101752001184">In our
amendments, we are attempting to take a constructive approach to
improving the provisions, as the hon. Member for Bedford acknowledged.
The amendments therefore take account of the still widespread concerns
throughout the legal and business communities. We do not feel that they
would weaken the Government&#146;s position&#151;that is not our
intention.</p><p><a name="06101752001185">Part 10 and
clause 173 are designed to codify existing, mainly common law,
principles relating to the responsibilities of directors. That has led
to vociferous and growing complaints from across the legal and business
communities that those provisions in particular could cause company law
to be altered dramatically for the worse. Historically, judges have had
the discretion to deal with complicated issues relating to
directors&#146; duties on a case-by-case basis; that system has been
adaptable and effective in dealing with cases that are often
complicated and highly technical. The existing duties found in common
law rules and equitable principles which have been built up over the
years in the courts are now to be replaced by the statutory statement
in part 10. A flexible system is to be replaced by an inflexible
one.</p><p><a name="06101752001186">On the one hand,
the Government have said that there will be no change in the common law
position; yet, on the other hand, they have introduced the concept of
enlightened shareholder value, which all legal experts agree will alter
the common law position of acting in the best interests of the company.
We believe that there is a fundamental gap in the Government&#146;s
train of thought: either they are introducing a new concept,
enlightened shareholder value, which is an extension of the common law,
or they are simply codifying the existing common law. The Minister has
still not made clear which course the Government are taking. According
to the many interested parties whom we have consulted on the Bill, the
position seems to be clear: if the audience is business-oriented, the
Government message is, &#147;Don&#146;t worry&#151;nothing is
going to change. This is only a restatement of the existing common law
position.&#148;</p><p><a name="06101752001187"><b><a name="61017-0005.htm_spnew197"><a name="06101752002413">Mr.

where the pressures are coming from, we can see from its briefings that
the TUC supports codification and makes an explicit link between the

matters for consideration listed in the clause, and makes it clear that
directors should have regard to these matters. The TUC sees that link
as a significant step and wants clear and comprehensive guidance and
reporting, which it sees as contributing to raising standards of
corporate behaviour. How does a significant step not constitute a
change? The Minister must come to terms with that anomaly in her
position.</p><p><a name="06101752001202">Our party

of the individual items listed in clause 173, as I made clear to the

exist as common law responsibilities in current law. However, in the
context of sound law, these intentions can easily slip into platitudes,

driven approach to the exercise of directors&#146; duties rather than
one based on the making of good-faith judgements. This could lead
directors to take expensive and time-consuming legal advice, impair
efficient decision making and add an unnecessary layer of bureaucracy
to board practices. Codification of directors&#146; duties would not
then achieve its goal of greater transparency and accountability, but
instead create new uncertainties and larger administrative
burden.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06101752001204">The

contrary, the new provisions on directors&#146; duties will result in
new uncertainty, increased legal costs and additional
bureaucracy...In particular, the Law Society believes that the new
code is inflexible&#151;at present, the courts have considerable
freedom to develop the law on directors&#146; duties to suit changing
needs and expectations and in practice the code will not be more
accessible than common law rules, as its meaning will over time become
less and less clear to a reader who does not also understand how it has
been interpreted and applied by the
courts.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06101752001205">It is
very clear that while the Government protest that they are not changing

some cases the Government are weakening existing statutory duties.

responsibilities already imposed on directors by statute or common law,
they have curiously chosen to ignore
others.</p><p><a name="06101752001210"><b><a name="61017-0005.htm_spnew211"><a name="06101752002427">Margaret

arguing here that all directors&#146; common law and statutory duties
should be put into statute. That would be nonsensical, particularly as
the common law duties are being advanced all the time. However,
amendments Nos. 393 and 395 would oblige company directors to give
consideration to all other common law duties of directors. A
non-statutory guide, as provided for in amendment No. 398, could then
give directors some guidance as to what these duties are without the
guidance being enshrined in
statute.</p><p><a name="06101752001213">A May 2006

artificially constrain the decision-making processes and provide
inappropriate challenges to the way in which directors have exercised
their discretion. The list of factors set out in clause 173(1) is
applicable to all types and sizes of company, but the listed matters
may not be appropriate for directors to take the best decision in all
circumstances. The director of a major plc and the sole director of a
corner shop will not take into account the same factors when they make
important decisions, and

has pointed out that the list of factors in clause 173(1) which a
director must consider raises the possibility that the courts will be
given the power to review business decisions made by directors in good
faith, thereby undermining the well-established business judgment rule.
That could adversely affect the management of companies and be a
significant burden for businesses in terms of both time and cost,
because businesses would have to examine those factors before taking
any decision. That is why we have tabled amendment No. 393 on the
recommendation of the Law Society, the CBI and the Association of
British Insurers. It would require directors to take into account all
those factors only if those factors are relevant to the matter under
consideration and if it is reasonably practicable to do so, which would
qualify the requirement to take all the factors into account all the
time.</p><p><a name="06101752001216">Amendment No.
788 would tie clause 173 to large companies, relieving smaller
companies of extra bureaucracy and red
tape.</p><p><a name="06101752001217">The introduction
of factors to which directors are required to have regard in
discharging their duty under clause 173 may also create new
uncertainties for third parties. That is because a transaction entered
into with a third party who has notice of a breach of a fiduciary duty
by one or more of the directors relating to the transaction is voidable
at the option of the company, which may result in third parties seeking
an assurance that directors have complied with that duty and have had
regard to the factors listed in clause
173.</p><p><a name="06101752001218">We also believe
that directors will be more exposed to actions for breach of duty, in
particular following a takeover or in the event of a company becoming
insolvent when there is new management, who may want to recoup losses
from whatever source is available, including previous directors. An
increase in the risk of personal liability is likely to discourage many
individuals from taking up directorships of UK-incorporated companies
and is also likely to discourage those who take up directorships from
taking decisions which might give rise to personal liability in the
future, if those decisions ultimately turn out to be detrimental to the

my fears.</p><p><a name="06101752001221">Amendment

of a particular factor could not be called into question by the courts,

that the list does not make clear the ranking of the factors. That is
why we have tabled amendment No. 396, which states that no one duty
should take precedence over another.</p><p><a name="06101752001223">The fundamental problem with
clause 173 is that it clouds the paramount duty of directors to
consider the best interest of the company&#151;I do not think that
the hon. Member for Bedford was saying that that should not be the
paramount duty. This is the kernel of the issue: as I have said, the
other duties are all important, but the ultimate responsibility of a
director is to the best interest of their company, and from that
fundamental duty all other responsibilities spring. By clouding that
duty, the Government will do a great disservice to company law and
company directors for a long time to come. That is why we have tabled
amendment No. 397, which states that</p><a name="61017-0005.htmbrev_75"><a name="06101752001353"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The duty to promote the

hon. Member for Bedford promoted his concept of corporate social
responsibility. Let me spend a little time addressing his concerns. CSR
is now taken more or less seriously by all the larger companies based
in this country; it is generally agreed that it is only good business
sense to do so. My party, too, has shown how highly it values CSR. We
in the Conservative party support social responsibility in companies.
We believe that companies, in preference to the state, can and should
be a positive driver of environmental and social change. In fact, we
have placed increased corporate responsibility at the top of our
agenda, even in being what my right hon. Friend the Member for Witney
(Mr. Cameron) called a &#147;critical friend&#148; to
big business when necessary. No Member, certainly no Conservative
Member, would dispute that increased CSR is a good thing and a
developing area.</p><p><a name="06101752001225">However, we argue that this
Bill is not the place in which to place unnecessary non-specific
mandatory burdens on company directors of all UK companies. That will
not only lead to uncertainty and the fear of litigation but set back an
agenda that my party supports. The environmental agenda, which was
mentioned by my right hon. Friend the Member for Suffolk, Coastal
(Mr. Gummer), is of prime importance to Conservatives; that
is why we say that we need a climate change Bill. However, that is
different from making broad statements in a very precise Bill, which
will lead to more tick-box exercises by companies with little gain to
the environment. There are many campaigns to improve corporate
environmental and social involvement across the world&#151;indeed,
sometimes across companies.</p><p><a name="06101752001226">The problem is that very few of
the companies involved will be affected by the Bill, because most such
multinational companies are non-UK companies. Let

<notus-date day="17" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><b>17 Oct 2006 : Column 774</b><br>me be frank: we can make our company law regime as rigid as we wish, but
it will not matter a jot to most of the companies that hon. Members
probably have in mind and will therefore not go far in helping to
further their individual campaigns. Most major multinational companies
that are UK-listed already take CSR very seriously and spend
considerable amounts of time and money on it. We can all too easily
ignore the fact that many publicly listed companies sell themselves on
their CSR reputation. Furthermore, increasing numbers of shareholders
are realising that they can exert a positive influence on the companies
that they ultimately control, and we wish to encourage that. The rise
of &#147;green&#148; and &#147;ethical&#148; investment funds
operated by most of the major fund managers has made them clearly aware
of CSR, and it is now simply bad business for a major PLC to ignore
it.</p><p><a name="06101752001227">The vast majority
of companies affected by the Bill&#151;perhaps 99 per
cent.&#151;are small and medium-sized companies. Those companies,
which are rarely the target of environmental or social campaigns,
already have enough troubles without being asked to jump through a
series of statutory hoops. Because the Bill deals with UK companies, it
does not have the framework to deal with the issues on which activists
have been campaigning. It treats the corner shop in the same way as the
multinational. It is the wrong place to be dealing with these issues,
important as they may be. That is why we tabled amendment No. 392,
which proposes that duties shall be appropriate to the size of the
company, and amendment No. 788, which would exclude small and
medium-sized companies from the provisions.</p><p><a name="06101752001228">Many organisations have taken
an active interest in the Bill, and I have met several of them. In
Committee, the hon. Member for Bedford stated that a voluntary approach
would not work and referred to examples of corporate, social and
environmental abuse. He hoped that providing legislation on that would
raise the bar for CSR. However, the Bill as drafted will merely provide
vague language to govern directors and serve to confuse businesses,
particularly small and medium-sized companies. That is why we tabled an
amendment that would limit it to larger companies.</p><p><a name="06101752001229">That said, we believe that the
UK should be the world leader in promoting good CSR. Where UK companies
lead, Conservatives believe that other companies will follow. However,
the answer to leading the way in CSR is not to impose a heavy
regulatory burden on our companies but to encourage investors to take
into account a company&#146;s record on CSR and to encourage all the
companies in the UK to understand that being socially responsible is in
the best interests of the company. Governments certainly have a role to
play in this; indeed, we often forget the need to use carrots for best
practice as much as threatening the stick of regulation. I have no
doubt that CSR will also be moved ahead by market forces. Informed
consumers voting with their feet will always be a more effective way of
getting companies to take up their CSR responsibility than regulation
will ever
be.</p><p><a name="06101752001230"><b><a name="61017-0005.htm_spnew215"><a name="06101752002431">Sarah

an early-day motion, which was signed by more than 220 hon. Members,
setting out why company law needed to be modernised for the 21st
century. I warmly welcome the Bill, particularly the fact that it
clearly states the Government&#146;s position with regard to
enlightened shareholder value. That clarity seems to be sadly missing
from the Conservatives&#146; approach; I am sure that that will not
go unnoticed.</p><p><a name="06101752001232">I tabled
the amendments in the hope that we could go a little further. New
clause 4 proposes a positive duty for company directors to take
responsibility for the impacts and interests of their companies in the
round by endeavouring to minimise adverse impacts on the community and
the environment, promoting the interests of employees, and maintaining
high ethical and business standards. That is merely what we have a
right to expect of our companies as responsible members of the global
community. Modernising company directors&#146; duties in that way
would give them a clear incentive proactively to consider the impact of
their business operations on their employees and suppliers and on the
companies and environment they rely on. By empowering directors to take
their responsibilities seriously, we would give room for our
companies&#146; huge energy and innovation in terms of delivering
unprecedented social and environmental benefits. By making it a clear
and positive duty, we would provide an incentive for those directors
who do not take their responsibilities seriously to think
again.</p><p><a name="06101752001233">I am a Labour
and Co-operative MP. For the co-operative movement, corporate social
responsibility is integral to doing business, and always has been.
However, it should not only be the concern of co-operatives and social
enterprises. It is in the long-term interests of the economy and of
society as a whole&#151;and in the interests of the long-term success
of companies themselves&#151;that all businesses operate in a
responsible and sustainable way.</p><p><a name="06101752001234">I support the efforts that the
Government have made to encourage responsible business practices,
including through the promotion of business education and best practice
in CSR. The Bill, particularly through the codification of
directors&#146; duties, addresses a fundamental premise. Should a
company operate only in the interests of its members&#151;its
shareholders&#151;or should it have a wider remit and operate in the
interests of stakeholders? If we accept that, as I do, how should we
manage it&#151;by legislation, regulation or voluntary code? That
goes to the heart of the matter. In my view, as I said on Second
Reading, it is no longer acceptable for financial profit to be the only
motivating factor in doing business. Many businesses already
acknowledge a wider responsibility to consider the interests of
employees and the impacts on the local community of doing
business&#151;the essence of what we say is CSR.</p><p><a name="06101752001235">Regrettably, though, despite an
increasing number of commitments by companies to a more responsible way
of doing business, we have evidence that there are still far too many
failures to deliver. As my hon. Friend the Member for Bedford noted,
the amendment is supported by members of the Trade Justice Movement

Howarth:</b> I begin with the point that the hon. Member for
Huntingdon (Mr. Djanogly) made about whether clause 173
constitutes reform. It is a reform because it is clearly different from
the previous law, and it is welcome because it supports the development
of corporate social responsibility in a way that will protect directors
who believe that such matters are important from litigation, which is
far more likely to arise than the possibility that the hon. Gentleman
raised.</p><p><a name="06101752001251">I want to
direct most of my comments to new clause 4 and the amendments that the
hon. Member for Huntingdon tabled. As I said in Committee, I have every
sympathy with the motives of those who tabled the new clause. It is
important to drive forward the debate on corporate social
responsibility. Unfortunately, after much thought and having considered
the debate in Committee carefully, I remain of the view that clause 173
is a better way forward at this stage.</p><p><a name="06101752001252">Clause 173 is better for two
main reasons. First, I am still worried about the problem of
contradictory duties. The hon. Member for Bedford (Patrick Hall)
mentioned that and I believe that the problem remains. Secondly, the
new clause raises expectations that it cannot fulfil. There is a risk
that it will make matters worse for good directors who want to follow a
social responsibility
agenda.</p><p><a name="06101752001253">Let us
consider contradictory duties. The central problem is the requirement
in the new clause for directors
to</p><a name="61017-0005.htmbrev_76"><a name="06101752001354"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;minimise any...
adverse impact... on the community and the
environment&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="06101752001254">That is
different from clause 173, which simply asks directors to &#147;have
regard to&#148; the environment and the community. It is impossible
to minimise two things simultaneously when there is a trade-off between
them. Let us consider a company that is engaged in inherently polluting
activities. The way to minimise pollution and thus the impact on the
environment is plainly to close the factory. However, that cannot
minimise the impact on the community because of all the jobs that would
be lost. That also works the other way around. To minimise the impact
on the community, the factory must be run as efficiently as possible,
at least as regards cost, but that might well lead to worse
environmental circumstances.</p><p><a name="06101752001255"><b><a name="61017-0005.htm_spnew227"><a name="06101752002443">Mr.

Green taxes both reduce anti-environmental behaviour and raise money
simultaneously, but they do not reduce the activity to zero. The
problem is in the trade-off, as opposed to minimising, which is the
problem of the clause.</p><p><a name="06101752001258"><b><a name="61017-0005.htm_spnew229"><a name="06101752002445">Patrick

environment is overridden by the primary duty of acting in a way to
promote the success of the company. How could one promote the success
of the company by closing the company? If one closed such a company,
one would not just be minimising but
eliminating.</p><p><a name="06101752001259"><b><a name="61017-0005.htm_spnew230"><a name="06101752002446">David
Howarth:</b> There are often examples, which we have discussed
on the Floor of the House, of a company that thinks that the way to
maximise profits is to close down one part of its operation. The hon.
Gentleman&#146;s point is not therefore an objection. I thought that
he was going to say that his new clause uses the words
&#147;endeavour to minimise&#148;. I have been thinking about that
point over the past few months. Technically, it is possible, I suppose,
to endeavour to minimise the adverse impact on both the environment and
the community, to fail to do both, but then to argue that one has not
breached the duty because one has tried to minimise both but failed.
That seems a terrible way to draft a duty of directors&#151;it is
saying that if they apparently fail to fulfil that duty, they will be
let off, because they only have to try to fulfil it. The better, more
positive and encouraging way to do it seems to be as the Government
have proposed&#151;to say that the director must &#147;have
regard&#148; to both the environment and the impact on the community.
I am therefore still worried about the contradictory duties
point.</p><p><a name="06101752001260">My second
objection to new clause 4, which is the reason I prefer the
Government&#146;s approach, is that it raises false expectations. We
have already heard two very different points of view from the hon.
Member for Bedford (Patrick Hall) and the hon. Member for Portsmouth,
North (Sarah McCarthy-Fry) with regard to whether the new clause
promoted a pluralist view of company law or was sticking to the
Government line of enlightened shareholder value. The hon. Gentleman
was correct that the new clause does not abandon the
Government&#146;s basic stance of enlightened shareholder value. The
hon. Lady, perhaps talking directly to the campaign groups, was saying
that it was an attempt to move the pluralist view on. It cannot do
both.</p><p><a name="06101752001261">An underlying
problem is what company directors&#146; duties are under the
enlightened shareholder value system. It is important to remind
ourselves that as long as that system is in place&#151;and the new
clause does not challenge that system&#151;the directors&#146;
duties are to the company, not to anyone else. The hon. Member for
Bedford used that point to reinforce his argument,

<notus-date day="17" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><b>17 Oct 2006 : Column 780</b><br>which I think is correct, that there is not much risk of litigation
under the new clause, or under clause 173. Who can sue as the company
in such a situation? Normally, the board of directors represents the
company, and decides whether to sue. If not the board, in some cases, a
majority of shareholders&#151;usually, a super majority of 75 per
cent.&#151;can order the company to sue. As he said, rare derivative
actions will occasionally occur, which we shall discuss later. The
scope for using such derivative actions, however, is limited. More
likely, as the hon. Member for Huntingdon mentioned, is action by
takeover bidders, administrators or liquidators on behalf of creditors
after the company has gone insolvent. Those are the only people likely
to be using directors&#146; duties litigiously. Are those
people&#151;institutional investors, commercial creditors and boards
of directors&#151;likely to put forward, and implement through
litigation, a strategy based on pluralism, which is more concerned with
the environment and the community than with the company&#146;s
profits? I dare to suggest that they will not enforce those
directors&#146; duties in that direction.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="61017-0005.htmordayhd_20"><a name="06101752001376">6.15
pm</h5><p><a name="06101752001262">Finally, there
is a danger that new clause 4 works against the interests of existing
directors who are concerned with corporate social responsibility. The
reason for that is that, in practice, those who are vulnerable to being
sued for breach of directors&#146; duties are not those who act only
according to the narrow interests of the company&#151;its profits.
Instead, they are those who attempt to look more broadly, taking into
account the environment and the wider community of employees. On a
takeover or liquidation, there is a danger that those who act for the
creditors or new owners will sue the old directors for failing to make
enough money, and for taking other interests into account. In a way,
that is an answer to the question asked by the right hon. Member for
Wokingham (Mr. Redwood). Clause 173 achieves extra
protection for directors who have had regard to environmental matters
and the community, and puts them in a position where they cannot be
sued.</p><p><a name="06101752001263">We all have
experience of that. The existing law mentions the interests of
employees, and there have been examples of directors being sued for
taking into account the interests of employees, failing to sell the
business to the highest bidder, and instead selling it to a bidder whom
they thought would carry on the business to the benefit of
employees&#146; jobs, not asset-strip the company. That is a
practical matter, and whereas clause 173 offers extra protection, I
fear that the new clause reduces that
protection.</p><p><a name="06101752001264"><b><a name="61017-0005.htm_spnew231"><a name="06101752002447">Patrick

point clearly in Committee that such actions cannot proceed unless the
loss can be attributed to failing to fulfil those secondary duties?
Does he now feel that that would be possible? He did not seem to be
convinced in Committee.</p><p><a name="06101752001265"><b><a name="61017-0005.htm_spnew232"><a name="06101752002448">David

precisely an attempt to sue a director for selling a business at less
than maximum value. In that example, a director needs the protection of
the new law and is not threatened by it at all. My point was

<meta name="Date" content="17 Oct 2006">

<notus-date day="17" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><b>17 Oct 2006 : Column 781</b><br>therefore that directors are not threatened by the new law, as the hon.
Member for Huntingdon was saying, because the only examples of a loss
would be where a company could be said to have made a financial loss as
a result of taking into account wider interests. In those
circumstances, and only in that direction, directors might be
vulnerable to personal actions. That is why I said in Committee that
clause 173 was a deregulatory clause that protects directors from
actions that might otherwise be brought against them.</p><p><a name="06101752001266">A problem with the new clause
is that if the hon. Member for Bedford is right that the word
&#147;endeavour&#148; makes it harder for directors to fulfil their
duty than the words &#147;have regard&#148;, in a way, that reduces
directors&#146; protection, as they will be less likely to be able to
argue that they have fulfilled their duties under the law and cannot
therefore be sued for what they did. I fear that that is an unintended
effect of the new clause as drafted. The Government&#146;s existing
proposal, because it might be slightly looser, is in practice more
helpful for directors who want to do the right thing</p><p><a name="06101752001267">I now turn to the amendments
tabled by the hon. Member for Huntingdon. Some are slightly puzzling,
and one wonders why they are needed. Amendments Nos. 393 and 394 use
subjective words and phrases such as &#147;in good faith&#148; or
&#147;relevant&#148;, but that subjectivity is already to be found
in clause 173. In fact, the House of Lords changed the original draft
to ensure that that subjectivity suffuses the clause as a whole, and
one of the arguments about new clause 4 is that it renders part of
clause 173 objective rather than subjective. Amendments Nos. 393 and
394 would not add anything to the Bill. They are merely confusing, as
they throw into doubt how the start of clause 173 should be
read.</p><p><a name="06101752001268">Similarly, why
is amendment No. 392 needed? It talks about requiring directors to act
appropriately for the size of a company, but that is implied in the
duty already set out in clause 173, where directors are required to act
in the way that they think would promote a company&#146;s success. If
amendment No. 392 did serve to reduce the scope of the duty placed on
directors, it would also have the unfortunate effect of reducing the
scope of the protection to them offered by new clause 4, and so could
be said to be objectionable on those grounds.</p><p><a name="06101752001269">Amendment No. 395 deals with
common law duties. The hon. Member for Huntingdon has said in the past
that there are 640 or 650 of them, but there is some confusion in his
approach. I have done some digging and discovered that many are simply
examples of duties that are in the Bill, such as the duties not to
exceed the powers of the company, or to act in accordance with the
company&#146;s constitution, or to act with skill and care, and so
on. Other examples are not, in the strict sense, directors&#146;
duties at all, as they are not duties to the company but duties to
someone else, as set out in the wider environmental, employment or
other law. The company law review team and the Law Commission have put
years of work into these matters, and so it would be surprising for
them to get the law as badly wrong as the hon. Member for Huntingdon
suggests.</p><br>

not know what the word &#147;implied&#148; means in that context.
It would usually refer to duties not mentioned elsewhere in the clause,
but in this case it must refer to duties that are not mentioned but
implied by the clause. I am not at all clear what is meant: if the
amendment refers to all the duties in the clause, why does not the hon.
Member for Huntingdon want the fundamental duty to promote the success
of the company to apply to SMEs? That would make no sense, as that duty
must apply to companies of all
sizes.</p><p><a name="06101752001272">Perhaps the
hon. Member for Huntingdon really means that the wider concerns that
follows the words &#147;have regard&#148; in clause 173 should
apply only to large companies. If so, the amendment would achieve only
a reduction in the protection offered to directors of SMEs against the
sort of legal action that I described earlier. I think that those
directors of SMEs who follow corporate and social responsibility
requirements closely are entitled to the same protection as are
directors of large companies. Therefore, I do not understand what
amendment No. 788 is getting at. It may be more of a symbolic gesture
rather than something that the hon. Gentleman really wants to be agreed
to.</p><p><a name="06101752001273">Finally,
amendments Nos. 396 and 397 contradict one another, and both cannot be
accepted. Amendment No. 396 states that no duty takes precedence over
any other, whereas amendment No. 397 states that the duty to
&#147;promote success is paramount.&#148; Duties are either equal
or unequal; they cannot be both. I hope that the hon. Member for
Huntingdon is able to choose between the two alternatives that he
offers.</p><p><a name="06101752001274">As it stands,
and as all speakers have accepted, clause 173 means that the duty to
promote the company&#146;s success is paramount, so there is no need
to add what is proposed in amendment No. 397. The fact that amendment
No. 396 would throw that priority into doubt is unfortunate, and I hope
that the hon. Member for Huntingdon will not press it to a
vote.</p><p><a name="06101770000015"><b><a name="61017-0005.htm_spnew233"><a name="06101770000791">Jim

I am in favour of that happening because it means that each company can
talk about itself in its own way and satisfy those who listen to it in
their own way. The trouble with the Minister&#146;s proposal is that

up&#151;a bit of an extension involving better wording&#151;or as a
dramatic alteration. I find this difficult to deal with because I, too,
have read what the campaigners have written about the new clause.
Frankly, if what they say is true, what the proposers of new clause 4
have said is not quite as true. Alternatively, if what the proposers of
new clause 4 say is true, it does not quite explain some of the real
difficulties that many of us&#151;who are on the same side in terms

would be wise not to go along with new clause 4, not on the basis that
they take a view one way or the other on corporate responsibility or
the mechanisms by which we should get companies to take these matters
more seriously, but simply because if companies are being asked to do
that, they must be clear about what they are expected to do. They must
not be presented with wording that will have to be interpreted by the
courts.</p><p><a name="06101770000026">One of the
problems with the bipartisan approach that we try to take on
environmental matters is that we often end up doing nothing. Everyone
talks about it and the rhetoric is very good, but in the end nothing is
done. The worst thing to do in such circumstances is to produce a
measure that the courts are going to have to interpret. That is what
worries me about this wording. It has been suggested that we should not
be too mean to the Minister about this because everyone else who has
tried to do something about it has been sacked. That is not a very good
idea, if I may say so. The Minister has moved pretty rapidly from one
job to another over the past few years, but that seems to be part of
this Government&#146;s mechanism of keeping everyone in perpetual
motion lest they begin to understand the issues that they are facing
and start to worry about the fact that nothing is being done.</p><p><a name="06101770000027">Many of us who are pushing for
a climate change Bill believe that we are going to have to do a great
deal more, much more precisely and with real regulation that will
actually work. If we are going to do that, however, we should not at
the same time load people down with vague duties and bits and pieces
that the courts will interpret. I would say to the Minister that if the
Government are going to introduce the kind of environmental legislation
that we desperately need to cut our carbon output and change our carbon
footprint, we will have to ask people to do some very tough things. So
far, the Government have avoided doing any of that. Instead, they have
gone in for a kind of flim-flam. The trouble with this particular
flim-flam is that it will have to be interpreted by the courts, and we
do not know what the outcome will be. Worse still, decent directors who
try to understand this legislation will find themselves at odds with
the courts. The Minister has put us in a pretty difficult position

new clause 4, on the basis that that is even worse, but I do wish that
she would get down to some practical, direct and real environmental
legislation so that we know where we were, rather than presenting us
with these measures as part of a propaganda proposition to try to get
the Chancellor off the hook.</p><p><a name="06101770000028"><b><a name="61017-0005.htm_spnew237"><a name="06101770000795">Mr.
Mike Weir (Angus) (SNP):</b> I am pleased to be able to make a
short contribution to the debate. I was pleased to hear the hon. Member
for Bedford (Patrick Hall) say that his new clause was pro-business. It
is important for all of us that our companies should continue to be
successful. However, the world is changing and&#151;as the right hon.
Member for Suffolk, Coastal (Mr. Gummer) rightly
said&#151;we are all now much more concerned about the environment
and climate change. Companies are going to have to change along with
that.</p><p><a name="06101770000029">The hon. Member
for Portsmouth, North (Sarah McCarthy-Fry) made the point that there is
a philosophical argument involved. To whom does a company owe a
responsibility? Is it, as the existing law states, only to its
shareholders? Incidentally, those shareholders tend these days to be
other big companies or institutional investors, which creates a kind of
circle. That is where the idea of enlightened environmental shareholder
action begins to fall down. Other big companies control each big
company, so unless all of them have an interest in doing something
about the environment, I do not think that we should get very far.
</p><p><a name="06101770000030">To whom does a
company owe a duty? Traditionally, it has been purely to its
shareholders&#151;but in the changing world in which we live, where
we need to tackle climate change, companies must also owe a duty to the
wider society, as the right hon. Member for Suffolk, Coastal rightly
said. New clause 4 would point directors along the route of thinking
about their duties towards the community and the
environment.</p><p><a name="06101770000031"><b><a name="61017-0005.htm_spnew238"><a name="06101770000796">David
Howarth:</b> The hon. Gentleman was talking about a
company&#146;s duties. However, he then switched to talking about
directors&#146; duties. This provision is about directors&#146;
duties. Companies may have broad duties under environmental law, but
this is about directors&#146; duties to the
company.</p><p><a name="06101770000032"><b><a name="61017-0005.htm_spnew239"><a name="06101770000797">Mr.
Weir:</b> I am well aware of that, but the directors are the
controlling mind of the company. I think that the hon. Gentleman is
being a bit nit-picking.</p><p><a name="06101770000033">Companies will have to change
the way in which they interact with communities and with the general
environment. The point was made earlier&#151;by a Conservative
Member, I think&#151;that there might be a need to change audit
procedures if some of these proposals were to be agreed. I believe that
companies will have to change anyway, and that they should be thinking
now about how they will change their audit procedures in order to
assess the carbon footprint of the company, and to determine how the
company impacts on the environment. We had a debate in the House
yesterday on the Liberal Democrats&#146; proposals for green
taxation, and I understand that the Conservatives have also been
considering proposals for environmental taxes. The logical extension of
that is

<notus-date day="17" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><b>17 Oct 2006 : Column 786</b><br>that if we are going down the route of taxing companies on their
environmental performance rather than purely on their income, new
procedures will have to be imposed on every company in order to work
out its environmental impact. The audit procedures will therefore have
to be looked at in any event.</p><p><a name="06101770000034">The point was also made about
the impact of citizens on companies in relation to green and ethical
funds. However, if we are serious about introducing the substantial
changes that we need to tackle global warming and environmental change,
all companies will need to be green and ethical. We should not be
looking at separate funds in that regard. All companies should adopt
such policies. The whole point of this exercise is to achieve a level
playing field, with all companies operating on the same level and
considering seriously their community and environmental
responsibilities. That has to be
done.</p><p><a name="06101770000035">The impact of
the provision on smaller companies was discussed. The hon. Member for
Huntingdon (Mr. Djanogly) claimed that the provisions would
affect everyone from the corner shop to the corporation. It is a long
time since I practised law, but in my experience most corner shops are
not companies, but sole traders or partnerships. I am trying to
remember the exact procedure that he used, but I believe that, in the
last Budget, the Chancellor took measures to try make small
partnerships and sole traders desist from incorporating to avoid
taxation.</p><p><a name="06101770000036">Let as look
at what is already provided for in clause 173 and consider each
subsection in turn. Subsection (a) deals with</p><a name="61017-0005.htmbrev_80"><a name="06101770000772"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;the likely consequences of any
decision in the long
term&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="06101770000037">Any company that
does not consider the long-term consequences of a decision is barking
mad, because it will affect the future of the company. However, some
businesses might look to short-term profit rather than long-term need,
so the provision will make sure that companies consider the
consequences of their actions. A small company or sole trader will of
course think about the long-term consequence of any action, otherwise
they would not have a business.</p><p><a name="06101770000038">Subsection (b) deals
with</p><a name="61017-0005.htmbrev_81"><a name="06101770000773"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;the interests of
the company&#146;s
employees&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="06101770000039">In a small
business, the employer is likely to know all the employees, and that is
more important. Subsection (c) deals
with</p><a name="61017-0005.htmbrev_82"><a name="06101770000774"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;the need to foster
the company&#146;s business relationships with suppliers, customers
and others&#148;,</p></ul><p><a name="06101770000040">but in a
small business, the chances are that the employer is the sole buyer in
the company. Subsection (d) deals with</p><a name="61017-0005.htmbrev_83"><a name="06101770000775"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;the impact of the
company&#146;s operations on the community and the
environment&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="06101770000041">A small
company&#146;s business operates in the community, so the employer
would consider it. Subsection (e) deals with</p><a name="61017-0005.htmbrev_84"><a name="06101770000776"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;the desirability of the company
maintaining a reputation for high standards of business
conduct&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="06101770000042">That is more
important for small businesses than it has ever been. A large,
multinational oil company might get away with dubious practices, but a
small business in a local community is most unlikely to do so.

have learned in a report that we must cut our emissions by 90 per cent.
if we are to stop climate change and have a planet on which to live. We
cannot do that as individuals, no matter how many low-voltage
light-bulbs we use, and no matter whether we have windmills on our
roofs. That will not bring about changes in emissions. Companies must
be part of the process, and to ensure that that is the case, we must
change the culture of companies. Neither clause 173 nor new clause 4
goes far enough, but they are a step in the right direction. I must
tell the Minister that although the provisions do not go far enough,
they are an improvement. They will make companies start to think about
what they have to do. I prefer new clause 4 because it goes slightly
further, but there is more to do, and companies should take that on
board.</p><p><a name="06101770000045"><b><a name="61017-0005.htm_spnew240"><a name="06101770000798">Margaret
Hodge:</b> This has been an extremely good debate. I thank
Labour Members, especially my hon. Friends the Member for Bedford
(Patrick Hall), for Portsmouth, North (Sarah McCarthy-Fry) and for
Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Jim Cousins), for their generous welcome
of the provision, and I note their wish that it went a little further.
I also appreciate the welcome that the hon. Member for Angus
(Mr. Weir) gave the measures. It is a shame that I must once
again draw the House&#146;s attention to the fact that, although
Opposition Members said that they wished to debate the issues in
detail, for most of the debate the right hon. Member for Suffolk,
Coastal (Mr. Gummer)&#151;I welcome his
contribution&#151;has been the only Opposition Member present in the
Chamber. There have been more Members from the minority parties than
from the Conservative party, even though it was Conservative Members
who resisted the programme motion so
vigorously.</p><p><a name="06101770000046">Clause 173
heralds and articulates a radical, historic and vital cultural change
in the way in which companies conduct their business&#151;a change
that the Government enthusiastically promote in the Bill. In the past,
business success in the interests of shareholders has been thought to
be in conflict with society&#146;s aspirations for people who work in
the company or in supply chain companies, the long-term well-being of
the community and the protection of the environment. The Government
challenge that view. We think that the two purposes are complementary,
not contradictory.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="61017-0005.htmordayhd_22"><a name="06101770000786">6.45

businesses perform better, and are more sustainable in the long term,
when they have regard to a wider group of issues in pursuing success.
That was the premise behind the contribution made by my hon. Friend the
Member for Portsmouth, North. We are not alone in holding that view: a
number of Members have said that the best British companies conduct
their business responsibly because, having

is the best way to promote business success.</p><p><a name="06101770000048">We are backing Britain&#146;s
businesses, which regard the Bill as the future. Good businesses
understand the purpose of good law&#151;and the Bill is good law. We
are setting out in legislation a director&#146;s duty to her or his
company. We are laying out the issues that we expect quoted companies
to cover in their business review, and we are ensuring that quoted
companies will be held to better account by their
shareholders&#151;particularly indirect shareholders, such as those
of us who have investments in pension funds or personal equity plans.
We are making information more readily available, we are making it
easier for indirect shareholders to exercise a vote, and we are
ensuring that directors can be held to account for their actions. In
doing all those things, we are setting in place a framework&#151;not
rigid prescriptive action&#151;that will support companies and enable
them to be both successful in business and responsible to their
communities and work force. Our new framework is not burdensome, as
Opposition Members have suggested, nor is it destructive. It will help
to stimulate changes in market behaviour.</p><p><a name="06101770000049">Clause 173 sets out the first
part of the framework, codifying in law a director&#146;s duties to
his or her company. That is simply a common-sense approach that
reflects a modern view of the way in which businesses operate in the
real world: they interact with customers and suppliers; they make sure
that employees are motivated and properly rewarded; and they think
about their impact on communities and the environment. They do so at
least partly because it makes good business
sense.</p><p><a name="06101770000050">Directors&#146;
duties evolve as times change and as societal norms are transformed.
When I first became involved with concepts of corporate social
responsibility some 25 years ago, our main concern was to encourage
companies to employ people who suffered discrimination in the labour
market on the grounds of their race, gender or sexuality. Today, it is
customers who increasingly care about whether employees have been
mistreated or whether the environment has been damaged. That is why the
sale of Fairtrade and organic products has increased so sharply in
recent years.</p><p><a name="06101770000051">I
entirely understand and appreciate that some Members want us to go
further, but I encourage them to be patient. We have all seen corporate
social responsibility develop and evolve over time. Many practices that
are initially controversial quickly become common and then widespread.
The relationship between business interests and the wider world is
changing all the time&#151;I believe for the better. The best way of
achieving lasting cultural change is to go with the tide and the broad
consensus of
opinion.</p><p><a name="06101770000052">New clause 4
would amend the subsection by inserting &#147;endeavour to&#148; in
place of &#147;have regard to&#148; and, I am afraid, it would
paint the list of factors in more pluralist colours. One of our key
aims in the clause is to make the law clearer and more accessible.
Directors must be clear about their objective, but the wording of the
new clause would point directors towards two different goals. Directors
are still required to promote the success of the company for the
benefit of its members as a whole, but the new clause would require
them to endeavour to promote the interests of

of the company&#146;s operations on the community and the
environment.</p><p><a name="06101770000053">The
Government believe that our enlightened shareholder value approach will
be mutually beneficial to business and society. We do not, however,
claim that the interests of the company and of its employees will
always be identical; regrettably, it will sometimes be necessary, for
example, to lay off staff. The drafting of the clause must therefore
clearly point directors towards their overarching objective. We have
made it clear that clause 173 will make a difference, and a very
important
difference.</p><p><a name="06101770000054">The
words &#147;have regard to&#148;&#151;to help my hon. Friend the
Member for Bedford (Patrick Hall)&#151;mean &#147;think
about&#148;; they are absolutely not about just ticking boxes. If
&#147;thinking about&#148; leads to the conclusion, as we believe
it will in many cases, that the proper course is to act positively to
achieve the objectives in the clause, that will be what the
director&#146;s duty is. In other words &#147;have regard
to&#148; means &#147;give proper consideration to&#148;. I hope
that comforts my hon.
Friend.</p><p><a name="06101770000056">Consideration
of the factors will be an integral part of the duty to promote the
success of the company for the benefit of its members as a whole. The
clause makes it clear that a director is to have regard to the factors
in fulfilling that duty. The decisions taken by a director and the
weight given to the factors will continue to be a matter for his good
faith judgment. I hope that, on that basis, my hon. Friend will agree
to withdraw his new
clause.</p><p><a name="06101770000057">Many of the
Opposition&#146;s amendments were discussed in Committee. In my view,
I am afraid that they row back from the good progress that we have made
in marrying success for enterprise and business with sustainability and
social justice. A lot of people have said, &#147;Stop talking, start
acting.&#148; The time has come for the Opposition to say whether
they mean what they say and to show that in their votes. They do not
dare, quite, to oppose us lock, stock and barrel&#151;we will see
what happens tonight&#151;because that would unmask their continuing
true hostility to the socially and environmentally responsible agenda
that we are laying out and that most people in Britain today want. But
they are trying in their amendments, which were discussed in Committee,
to weaken and neutralise the impact of our proposals on the way in
which businesses conduct their activities. I would have greater respect
for the Opposition if they were honest about their principles. Do they
mean untrammelled, short-term, laissez-faire business behaviour that
damages society or not? If not, they should vote with
us.</p><p><a name="06101770000058">I know that hon. Members wish
to talk about other issues tonight, so I will not deal with all the
Opposition amendments in detail. Those hon. Members who are interested
in the amendments can look at the record of our Committee proceedings,
because most of the issues were dealt with then. I will just say that I
do not believe from tonight&#146;s debate that Opposition Front
Benchers believe in enlightened shareholder value, whereas we do.
Everything that they have said continues to suggest that they see
business prosperity, caring for the environment and looking after their
employees as pointing in different directions. We emphatically do not
see it that way. Successful businesses do not see it that

need to change with it. They know that the world will change

which I accept. The Law Society, among others, has pointed out that
there is a significant difference between the common law rule on
conflicts of interest and the wording of the clause. Notably, the
common law rule maintains a negative position, whereas the clause
imposes a positive duty. While the Government deny that that is so, it
seems to be a widely held belief among stakeholders. The fact that the
clause now gives rise to a positive duty is a key concern that many
stakeholders have raised. The fear is that that positive duty might
impact on a director&#146;s ability to assume multiple directorships,
which are a feature of the UK company system and provide a number of
benefits to companies of all sizes.</p><p><a name="06101770000074">We believe that it will be more

aim is that directors should seek to avoid conflicts of interest, which
do arise and need to be dealt with in a reasonable and balanced way. If
they arise, the interests of the company must come first. The current
law is strict. We want to put in place a statutory structure that
enables the interests of the company to be closely balanced with those
of the director so that people may have, in particular circumstances,
multiple directorships. But it has to be clear that the interests of
the various companies of which they are directors are taken into
account.</p><p><a name="06101770000076">Through the

have provided for shareholders and companies to be able to look after
their interests. If directors have created a conflict&#151;in some
cases they will not be aware that the conflict is about to arise, but
in the case of multiple directorships it is possible that they will be
aware&#151;they must resolve that conflict and the company&#146;s
interests must come first. It is important that, in order to give
greater protection and to safeguard the interests of shareholders,
investors and the companies themselves, we do not give discretion to
directors to the extent that the Conservatives propose. We have to
constrain it; we have to ensure a balance. We believe that we have got
that balance right; we believe that we should stick to
it.</p><p><a name="06101770000080"><b><a name="61017-0005.htm_spnew250"><a name="06101770000808">David

with situations in which there is a requirement for prior shareholder
authorisation, because a director has a conflict of interest. The
chapter replaces provisions of part 10 of the Companies Act 1985 with
ones that will be more accessible and more consistent. It also
implements various recommendations of the Law Commission and the

makes a major deregulatory change to the regime that applies to loans
and other similar transactions made by a company for its directors. At
the moment, such transactions are

prohibition with a requirement for member approval.</p><p><a name="06101770000629">The Bill was drafted to
implement the Law Commission&#146;s recommendation that all the rules
on loans, quasi-loans and credit transactions for directors should
extend to all companies. That would increase regulation for most
private companies, as many of the current rules apply apply to relevant
companies. In broad terms, relevant companies are public companies and
private companies that are in the same group as a public
company.</p><p><a name="06101770000630">Although
that recommendation was endorsed by the company law review, we have
carried out further informal consultation in the light of the
discussion in Committee. Stakeholders clearly supported the proposal
that the requirements that currently apply only to relevant companies
should not be extended to all private companies. Government new clauses
72, 73 and 74 and Government amendments Nos. 592 to 597, 599 and 601 to
612 will make the relevant changes to the
Bill.</p><p><a name="06101770000631">Amendments Nos.
405 and 406, tabled by the hon. Member for Huntingdon (Mr.
Djanogly), relate only to the rules on credit transactions and would
retain the increase in regulation for loans and quasi-loans. We believe
that it would be better to remove that additional regulation.
Therefore, under the Government amendments, the Bill will no longer
apply the rules on credit transactions or quasi-loans to private
companies, unless they are associated with a public company, or apply
the rules on loans, quasi-loans and credit transactions with persons
connected to a director to private companies, unless they are
associated with a public company. Unlike in those Opposition
amendments, we have not gone back to the concept of &#147;Relevant
company&#148;, as that added to the complexity of the current law.
Instead, Government amendments use the concept of &#147;associated
company&#148;, which creates consistency with the rest of this part
of the Bill. The rules that currently apply only to relevant companies
will, under these amendments, apply only to public companies, and to
any private company associated with a public
company.</p><p><a name="06101770000632"><b><a name="61017-0005.htm_spnew254"><a name="06101770001331">Jim

she has just made, the new clause on quasi-loans would apply to special
private-finance-initiative-vehicle companies? Also, does the watering
down of the Bill that she has just outlined mean that, for example, the
company taking over Thames Water Utilities, which is a foreign bank in
a consortium of private equity companies, could be in a format where
the clauses under discussion would not apply? If that were the case, it

Perhaps my hon. Friend would like to write to me, or alternatively,
after I have looked at <i> Hansard</i>, I will write to him in greater
detail, if that will be helpful to him.</p><p><a name="06101770000634">I now turn to the issue of
exceptions to the rules. We recognise that, in a group situation, it
might be more convenient for the loan to be made by a different company
in the group. Therefore, amendments Nos. 598 and 600 make it possible
for a loan under the exceptions in clauses 204 and 205 to be used by a
director to fund their defence in proceedings relating not just to the
company, but to any associated companies. Amendments Nos. 598 and 600
achieve the same result as Opposition amendment No. 354, but create
consistency by going further and widening the exception in clause 205
in the same way&#151;for example, to actions that the Financial
Services Authority might take.</p><p><a name="06101770000635">We do not accept Opposition
amendments Nos. 20 and 21. They would widen the exception much further.
In particular, amendment No. 21 makes the exception available whenever
the company would be permitted by clause 234 to give the director a
qualifying third-party indemnity. Let me give an example of the sort of
thing that would happen if that were the case. Without shareholder
approval, a company could give a loan to a director to defend herself
or himself against matters such as driving fines or offences. That
would be
inappropriate.</p><p><a name="06101770000636">Under
the Companies Act 1985, it is currently the case that the prohibition
on loans to directors goes much further than the restrictions on the
indemnities that may be given in respect of a director. It is possible
at present to give an indemnity in circumstances where a loan would be
prohibited. It is important that there is some limit on the types of
proceedings for which loans may be given to a director under clauses
204 and 205. Companies should not use those exceptions to make loans
without member approval for matters that, in reality, have nothing to
do with the company. The sums involved under these clauses could be
significant, and the exceptions do not contain any financial limits.
Given that, it is right that the exceptions should only be used for
matters that are properly connected to the company. It would be
inappropriate for the exceptions to be available for company funds to
be used without member approval to defend a director against
proceedings unconnected with company
business.</p><p><a name="06101770000637">The Bill has
already significantly relaxed the regime applying to loans by replacing
the outright prohibition with a requirement for member approval. These
clauses create exceptions where not even member approval is required.
In order to provide worthwhile protection to members, it is important
that those exceptions are sensible in their scope. We do not agree that
there is any need to widen the exceptions even further, thus reducing
the need for shareholder
approvals.</p><p><a name="06101770000638">Amendment
No. 613 makes a minor drafting improvement to clause 204, following
comments made to us by the Law Society. It is designed to follow more
closely the wording used in section 337A of the

does not make any substantive changes to the current law.</p><p><a name="06101770000639">I now turn to substantial
property transactions. Clause 191 implements a recommendation of the
Law Commissions that has been widely welcomed, by allowing companies to
enter into agreements that are conditional on the approval of the
members of the company being obtained. Amendment No. 591 goes one step
further, allowing the agreement to be conditional on approval from the
members of its holding company as well, in those cases where the
approval of the members of the holding company is required. That
amendment responds to concerns that companies could be inconvenienced
if they were to have to wait for member approvals before they can agree
to a substantial property transaction. Opposition amendment No. 19
would achieve the same
result.</p><p><a name="06101770000640">Amendment No.
644 deletes clause 223 because the provision made by that clause will
now be included in clause 288, and applied not just for the purposes of
part 10 of the Bill but for the entire Companies Acts. As a result of
the restatement exercise, amendments Nos. 163 and 164 replace
references to the Companies Act 1985 with a reference to the relevant
bit of the
Bill.</p><p><a name="06101770000641">Amendment No.
757 on the compulsory consultation with employees on directors&#146;
service contracts was tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle
upon Tyne, Central (Jim Cousins). I am sorry to tell him that, despite
my best endeavours, we cannot support his approach. As he will
appreciate, company law is about the relationship between the company,
its members and the directors, and the directors should be accountable
to the shareholders rather than to employees. However, as he knows, we
do entirely agree that companies should be sensitive to pay and
employment conditions elsewhere in the group when taking decisions
about directors&#146; remuneration. Indeed, the combined code has a
supporting principle that the remuneration committee should
be</p><a name="61017-0005.htmbrev_87"><a name="06101770000779"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;sensitive to pay and

increases&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="06101770000642">I

uncontentious Government new clauses and

the selection list.</p><p><a name="06101770000644">We find Government new clauses
72, 73 and 74 to be uncontentious. Amendment No. 757, tabled by the
hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Jim Cousins), is an
interesting proposal. I believe that he is suggesting that a company
should not approve long-term service contracts by a shareholder vote
unless members are previously consulted. That has to be looked at in
the context of different types of company. If we are talking about a
small company&#151;a family company, for example&#151;it is
unrealistic, because the length of the service contract is, in reality,
unimportant: an owner-manager effectively has a service contract for
ever, simply because he does not need a service contract as he is the
owner of the company, and he would therefore have one for as short or
as long as he wanted, until he sold or closed his business.</p><br>

larger companies. It was considered by the Higgs review with regard to
corporate governance. The problem that we have with the amendment is
that employees are likely to be biased just as much as other directors.
Under the combined code, listed companies will have a nominations
committee of independent non-executive directors, which will undertake
appointments, and a remuneration committee, which will review service
terms. The independence of the bodies means that they should not be on
the side of the executive directors or the
employees.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="61017-0005.htmordayhd_23"><a name="06101770000787">7.30

also take a great interest in the matter. The combined code provides
for a maximum recommended service term of one year, which is generally
a move in the right direction. If a company puts in for a longer term
of service, it will invariably be the case that the institutions will
want a full explanation. There are thus controls in place to address
the matters with which the hon. Gentleman&#146;s amendment deals, but
tabling it was worthwhile because it has allowed our debate to be put
on record. We will not be able to support amendment No.
757.</p><p><a name="06101770000647">As the Minister
noted, Government amendment No. 591 is almost identical to amendment
No. 19, which we tabled. Our amendment was inspired by the Law Society
and would bring the provisions of clause 191(2) in line with subsection
(1) of the clause. We are happy to go along with the Minister&#146;s
proposal on substantial property
transactions.</p><p><a name="06101770000648">Amendments
Nos. 405 and 406 would amend clause 200. Although the clause replicates
a provision of the Companies Act 1985, it also permits certain credit
transactions that were completely prohibited by section 330 of that Act
to be approved by members. Clause 200 applies to all companies, rather
than public companies under the 1985 Act. Under the clause, private
companies that had been able to enter into such a credit transaction
will have to obtain member
approval.</p><p><a name="06101770000649">Although we
realised that the provision was a recommendation of the company law
review, it flew in the face of the deregulatory spirit of the Bill.
When we asked the Minister for Industry and the Regions in Committee
why private companies were being dragged into the net of requiring
shareholder consent, she replied with a letter in which she pointed out
that the provision followed the Law Commission&#146;s recommendations
that restrictions on a company&#146;s power to make loans to
directors and persons connected with them should apply to all
companies. However, just as we were about to give up hope on this, we
heard only last week that the Government had changed their mind. I thus
welcome Government amendments Nos. 592 and 593. It all goes to show
that the Bill continues to be something of a moving
feast&#151;<i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> Well, a feast of some
sort anyway, as my hon. Friend the Member for Reigate (Mr.
Blunt) suggests.</p><p><a name="06101770000650">The
Minister said that the Government will reject amendment No. 20. Again,
the amendment came from the Law Society. The insertion of the phrase
&#147;or any associated company&#148; would enable a company,
without the need for shareholder approval, to make a loan to a director
to enable him to defend proceedings in

<meta name="Date" content="17 Oct 2006">

an associated
company.</p><p><a name="06101770000651">Clause 204
substantially narrows the existing provision on the funding of a
director&#146;s expenditure on defending proceedings that is
contained in section 337A of the 1985 Act. In the view of the Law
Society, the clause is too restrictive, and it also points out that
there has been no public consultation on the proposed change. The
reference to &#147;the company&#148; in subsection (1)(a)(i) does
not even extend to the company&#146;s holding company, which is
curious given that the clause contemplates a loan being made to a
director of the company&#146;s holding company, but only to defend
proceedings in relation to the company. That is
illogical.</p><p><a name="06101770000652">The Law
Society&#146;s view is that subsection (1)(a)(i) should at the very
least refer to the company or its holding company, and that it would be
preferable if it referred to the company or any associated company.
Otherwise, if a person is a director of more than one company in a
group, each company will have to enter into a separate arrangement with
that director, rather than one company being able to enter into an
arrangement that covers all the relevant companies. That does not seem
sensible. The term &#147;associated company&#148; is defined in
clause 256. However, we note that Government amendment No. 598
addresses the problem, albeit with a different drafting approach. That
amendment will be a popular move with directors who are in need of help
from their
companies.</p><p><a name="06101770000653">The Law
Society also notes that the phrase</p><a name="61017-0005.htmbrev_88"><a name="06101770000780"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;any liability of the company
incurred in connection with the
matter&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06101770000654">in clause
204(2)(a) is potentially much wider than the wording in section 337A(4)
of the 1985 Act, thus making the exception in the clause much narrower.
The 1985 Act refers
to:</p><a name="61017-0005.htmbrev_89"><a name="06101770000781"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;any liability of the
company under any transaction connected with the thing in question
falling to be
discharged&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="06101770000655">In other
words, under section 337A(4), the requirement to discharge the
liability relates to only the thing done to provide the director with
the funds to meet the relevant expenditure, or to avoid incurring it,
whereas, under clause 204, the
words</p><a name="61017-0005.htmbrev_90"><a name="06101770000782"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;in connection with
the matter&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06101770000656">do not
clearly relate back to the

company&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06101770000657">in subsection
(1), and could thus refer to the entire circumstances of the liability
or alleged liability. The Law Society thinks that the wording used in
section 337A(4) is clearer and should be retained. Government amendment
No. 613 effectively deals with the problem that the Law Society has
identified, so I think that we have made
progress.</p><p><a name="06101770000658">Government

directors to borrow money from their companies because it is important
to maintain the separateness of the fund that a company holds from its
directors. That gives rise to a protection, not so much for
shareholders, but for creditors, so that they can be assured that a
company&#146;s assets are as they appear, rather than having been
dissipated by being loaned out to people with a direct interest in the

moment in the extension of European ways to our wonderfully
Anglo-Celtic system&#151;as there is a representative of Plaid Cymru

there is increasing concern about how pension rights and stock options
are exercised. In the UK, there has been a dramatic fall in final
salary pension schemes for employees in the private sector, but there
has been no such fall in final salary pension schemes for directors.
Such inequity cannot survive. It will become a matter of public debate
and public controversy, and the first and right place for that is
within the confines of the company

our amendment does not attempt to specify one. However, that, too, is
something a sensible company ought to consider; it should not require
the intervention of laws and Governments to force a company to think
about how to consult its employees on this or other matters. Perhaps
the amendment will serve a purpose by reminding people, in the context
of how we take decisions in companies, that companies must have some
regard to the

the views of their employees, it is difficult to see how those views
are to be included. Our workers have fewer rights in their companies

French and German ones, were decided by their Governments and imposed

we were willing to debate the matter now, so that we could form our

Mitchell:</b> The principles of amendments Nos. 761 and 762,
which are in my name and those of my hon. Friends, are fairly clear. Up
until now, we have been dealing with the duties of directors and
companies. The problem is how we take account of those duties and how
directors and companies can be made accountable. The purpose of our
amendments is to strengthen accountability. Clause 155 is an
improvement in the sense that now at least one of the directors has to
be a real person. We want to take that a little further. Amendment No.
761 therefore provides that that one person shall be domiciled in the
UK. That is an important principle to maintain. Amendment No. 762
strikes out the ability of corporate entities to be
directors&#151;something that is wrong in principle, confuses
accountability and makes enforcement of any kind difficult.</p><p><a name="06101770000688">We need those two amendments
because somebody needs to be accountable for what companies are doing.
They need to be accountable under UK law and not living in a country
that is perhaps a tax haven, or which has no extradition agreement or
arrangements, and where UK law cannot be enforced. I am thinking, for
instance, of countries such as that chosen by Asil Nadir&#151;that
was the nadir of enforcement&#151;when Polly Peck collapsed. He fled
to northern Cyprus and, strangely, for some reason he has refused to
come back to this country and face the rigours of the law. We do not
want that situation to be sustained. We need companies to be
accountable. I am sure that the Opposition will support that principle
in the sense that, in refusing to accept companies as directors of
other companies and depriving them of that power, we are, in effect,
reducing the red tape on companies.</p><p><a name="06101770000689">The principle is
straightforward. There is a huge problem attendant on the ability of
companies to escape accountability. It is because of that kind of
escape from accountability that we have such problems with tax
avoidance&#151;problems involving companies and directors stationing
themselves in tax havens. I am thinking of companies such as Mapley
Steps, which has close relations with the Government. I am following
every one of the 39 Mapley Steps adventures

such as that, in a tax haven? How do we ensure that companies in tax
havens fulfil their social responsibilities, pay their rent to society,
and are responsible for the damage inflicted by the corporation under
the law that we passed earlier? How do we ensure that they fulfil their
responsibilities in relation to profits derived here? There is also the
matter of criminal negligence. These two simple, straightforward
amendments confront a simple issue.</p><p><a name="06101770000690">The Government want companies
to be accountable and they want to deal with tax avoidance, tax havens
and all the other issues involved in companies escaping their
obligations in this country. I note that the United States Government
Accountability Office, in a report on minimal ownership information,
which came out earlier this year, said that the United States
Government found it almost impossible to pursue many companies for
criminal activity&#151;not just for tax avoidance&#151;because they
could not trace the individual directors, who were often living in tax
havens. I want to enforce the principle in the UK and make it possible
for us to deal with all kinds of infringements from money laundering,
financing of terrorism and tax avoidance to criminals operating through
a shelf company. How will we deal with any of that unless we agree to
the amendments? Our simple provision is that a real person&#151;the
one real person&#151;should live in this country and that only real
persons can be directors of a company. I hope that my right hon. Friend

Djanogly:</b> First, I will address amendment No. 761. The
suggestion is that if a company has only one director, not only should
they be a natural person, but they should be domiciled in the UK. In
the UK, we pride ourselves on being an international centre for
conducting business. The amendment would be a backwards step and would
fly in the face of London as an international community. It will not

the difficulties in determining whether a person is a shadow director,
including by making reference to the Ultraframe case of 2005. Hon.
Members will be pleased, if not relieved, to hear that I do not intend
to rerun that debate this evening. We recommended that the Government
should recognise those complexities and remove the requirement for
shadow directors&#146; details to be entered on the relevant
registers. In the light of that, the Government have reconsidered their
position and tabled amendments Nos. 715, 716 and 717. That is welcome

summer, the pages of the press seem to have been filled with stories of
young entrepreneurs developing thriving and often profitable
businesses. They include Fraser Doherty, who makes jam using his
grandma&#146;s recipe, and who attacked the Government&#146;s
attitude to young entrepreneurs, saying that the enterprise culture
should start not in the boardroom, but in the classroom. On 7 October,
the <i> Financial Times</i> reported on a 15-year-old boy who founded a
cosmetics company. I have heard of other successes, not least the
teenager in my constituency who started up an online company selling
shoes to people with big feet. He is doing very well, thank you very
much.</p><p><a name="06101770000694">In Committee,
we supported the proposition that under-16s who are currently directors
should be able to remain directors after the implementation of the
clause, but the Government rejected that. We have proposed it again in
amendment No. 388. However, we have thought further about the clause
over the summer, and we now want to make a stand in support of the
innovating youth of our country by tabling amendment No. 385. This is
what the modern Conservative party stands for: youth, innovation and
entrepreneurial spirit. What sort of example does the fuddy-duddy
Labour Government set by attacking innovative youngsters?</p><p><a name="06101770000695">That said, if the clause
remains, my reading of subsection (5) suggests that a child who owned
all the shares in a company&#151;for example, a 14-year-old who had a
bright idea and incorporated&#151;and who appointed his parents as
directors and told them what to do could, presumably, be treated as a
shadow director. However, I am not sure that that follows logically. If
the child is considered to be not old enough to take decisions as a
director before he or she is 16, how can we say that the same child has
the nous to act as a shadow director? Amendment No. 386 is designed to
elicit clarification on that point. In Committee, the Minister
responded to our argument by saying that really talented young
entrepreneurs who direct businesses should be subject to criminal
sanctions. We believe that we should support our youth and that there
is merit in our amendment.</p><p><a name="06101770000696">I am not sure why the

Bill works.</p><p><a name="06101770000699">I am quite
sympathetic to amendment No. 761, because there is sometimes a problem,
as the hon. Gentleman said, of getting jurisdiction in respect of
wrongdoing directors. I fear, however, that the means that he has
adopted to achieve that end would not work, as to avoid the problem a
company would need only to appoint someone innocent and poor to be
their real person director, and all the nefarious people to whom the
hon. Gentleman referred would remain
offshore.</p><p><a name="06101770000700"><b><a name="61017-0005.htm_spnew267"><a name="06101770001344">Mr.

as he might find that that is no longer the case. The Government appear
to have changed their mind on that matter, and very glad we are about
it, too.</p><p><a name="06101770000702">There is a
problem with amendment No. 762. I do not think that what the hon.
Gentleman said was correct. The problem relates to the concept of the
corporation sole, which is not a sort of fish, but is largely a sort of
bishop. Most corporations sole are traditional offices, such as the
office of bishop, where the aim of the law is to separate the person
who holds the office from the office itself. If one were to leave money
to the Bishop of Ely, the question would be whether one left it to the
bishopric&#151;that is, the ongoing office of Bishop of Ely&#151;or
to the human being who holds that office for the time being. The two
things are
separate.</p><p><a name="06101770000703">The hon.
Gentleman commented that it was more difficult to track down
individuals who are office holders. It seems to me that precisely the
opposite is true in the case that I have just outlined&#151;that of
the Bishop of Ely. It is quite easy to find the present Bishop of Ely:
he is usually in his palace. It would, however, be quite difficult to
find the former Bishops of Ely. If a company is set up in which a
directorship is held by the Bishop of Ely as an office&#151;that is,
the corporation sole&#151;accountability is far easier under the
present arrangements than it would be if amendment No. 762 were passed
and it was impossible to offer the directorship to the office of Bishop
of Ely, with the result that the company had to keep changing the
person to the new holder of the office. I see the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s general point about office holders, but I am not
entirely convinced that the amendment would work as he says it would,
especially with regard to
bishops.</p><p><a name="06101770000704">On the

of young entrepreneurs, but I am sympathetic to the argument advanced

<notus-date day="17" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><b>17 Oct 2006 : Column 811</b><br>hon. Member for Huntingdon (Mr. Djanogly). It is true that
many young directors&#151;those aged less than 16&#151;are
directors by reason of family settlements: for example, their parents
died younger than expected and the way in which the family settlement
works requires them to count as a director. There is a worry that if we
impose on directors, as we do in the Bill, a long series of onerous
criminal law duties, it might not be sensible to expect very young
children to meet those duties. On the other hand, the age of criminal
responsibility is 10, not 16. I therefore wonder whether 16 is the
correct age to cut off directorships and whether, in the light of the
research that has been done into young people holding directorships and
the evidence about young entrepreneurs, 16 might be thought to be too
advanced an age for the cut-off point. Another age, less than 16, might
be more appropriate.</p><p><a name="06101770000705">The transitional arrangements
remain bothersome. I cannot see why the Bill should take the line of
insisting that all existing under-age directors be cut off before their
prime. A big issue in the Committee, to which I hope Ministers will
give some thought, was the question whether we should allow existing
under-16 directors to continue as directors&#151;obviously, the
situation would last no more than 16 years, and in most cases
considerably less than that&#151;rather than make the arrangements
necessary to change directorships almost on the
fly.</p><p><a name="06101770000706"><b><a name="61017-0005.htm_spnew269"><a name="06101770001346">Mr.
Austin Mitchell:</b> It is good to see the Liberal propensity
to sit on both sides of the fence given full exhibition by the hon.
Gentleman, but if he is defending the rights of under-age directors,
why does he not go the whole hog and give them the right to have
experience down the mines or in textile factories, or to do all sorts
of other manual labour that might amplify the joys of being under
16?</p><p><a name="06101770000707"><b><a name="61017-0005.htm_spnew270"><a name="06101770001347">David
Howarth:</b> I am grateful for the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
intervention, but he is confusing a duty with a right. We are not
saying that it should be compulsory for under-16s to be directors, or
that we would encourage it by legal force. Our argument is that in
those cases where young people have set up their own business, it is
not entirely wrong for them to have some sort of direction of the
business. If they had taken a different approach&#151;if they had set
up the business and then asked someone else to run it for them, as the
hon. Member for Huntingdon said&#151;the law would treat them as
directors anyway. They would end up being responsible, even though the
starting point was that the law did not allow them to be directors.
That is the point that the hon. Gentleman was trying to make about
shadow directors. In the light of what the Government are doing about
shadow directors, it seems to me that the provision in the Bill about
young people being shadow directors could be justified, but only if the
more general rule were
changed.</p><p><a name="06101770000708">Government
amendments Nos. 716, 770 and 717 deal mainly with whether there is an
obligation on companies to register the existence of shadow directors.
There is an issue of transparency&#151;whether people who effectively
run companies without officially

people exercising that power. The problem is a practical one for
companies&#151;whether they can know whether particular people count
as shadow directors, given the fact that the law is not very easy to
apply, especially from the point of view of another company director.
Courts might find it easy to apply, but companies might find it
difficult.</p><p><a name="06101770000709">The history
of the concept of shadow director is that it has been used by the
courts to put liability on someone who deserves liability for actions
that they have taken with regard to a company, perhaps without
realising that they were directors. It is a remedial concept, rather
than a real one. It is a construct of law that is used to achieve
particular results. Because the concept is so artificial, it is going
too far in practical terms to require companies to register shadow
directors in such circumstances. Although there are problems with
transparency in this area, on the balance of practicalities the
amendments are
acceptable.</p><p><a name="06101770000710"><b><a name="61017-0005.htm_spnew271"><a name="06101770001348">John
McDonnell:</b> I support amendments Nos. 761 and 762. Reading
clause 155, I was almost overjoyed when I saw the concession that the
Government had made by requiring at least one director to be a natural
person. I then read subsection (2) and for about two hours did not
understand what it meant, because it is a masterpiece of drafting
skills and obfuscation, the likes of which have not been seen for some
time in the House. Nevertheless, on the basis of the interpretation
offered by my hon. Friend the Member for Great Grimsby (Mr.
Mitchell) that subsection (2) overrides subsection (1), we are back to
the situation where a director of a company does not have to be a
natural person&#151;that is, a human being.</p><p><a name="06101770000711">The reason why my hon. Friend
has pressed the issue for some time is that at some stage in the life
of a company its responsibilities have to be borne by a human being.
Last week we debated the Corporate Manslaughter and Corporate Homicide
Bill. When we discussed how we held to account companies and
individuals operating within those companies with regard to how they
looked after the health and safety of their employees, a number of us
pressed for specific reference to be made to the responsibilities of
directors. We were informed that that was dealt with elsewhere as a
result of various other pieces of legislation that apply to directors,
and that there did not need to be a specific reference in the corporate
manslaughter
legislation.</p><p><a name="06101770000712">We find
that the provision contradicts those assurances. We could have
companies where no single director was responsible of the health and
safety of their employees. A company could perpetrate actions that were
so negligent that they resulted in the death of an employee, and no
individual would be held responsible. That is one example to
demonstrate why my hon. Friends have been pressing the issue for so
long.</p><p><a name="06101770000713">The provision
enables individuals to become involved in the establishment of
companies, which then establish further companies, and they are no
longer held responsible for their actions as individuals. In that way
they avoid their duties and responsibilities. I urge my right hon.
Friend the Minister to consider, though possibly not in the context of
the Companies Bill, that we need to debate the matter further, so that

be some misunderstanding of what the amendments would do. Amendment No.
761 attempts to provide power to make regulations specifying the
conditions with which a service address must comply. Our intention is
to require a director of a company to have a service address in the
same jurisdiction as the company&#146;s registered office. That is a
practical way of ensuring that documents can easily be served by UK
residents on any director. My hon. Friend the Member for Hayes and
Harlington (John McDonnell) mistakes that. With the duties that will be
placed on directors when the Bill is enacted, no one would be able to
evade responsibility in the way he

No. 762 attempts to address the point. The hon. Member for Cambridge
(David Howarth) dealt with it in his contribution. Subsection (2) does
not mean that a company can have no directors who are natural persons.
That is because of what is meant by &#147;corporation sole.&#148; A
corporation sole is a corporation that is constituted in a single
person. Corporations sole are always holders of a particular

Djanogly:</b> For the first time today, we have a decent
amount of time for Opposition amendments&#151;I suppose that I should
be grateful.</p><p><a name="0610181000193">Despite
amendments in the other place, which have improved clause 260, part 11
dealing with derivative claims is a complex area that still gives many
much concern. Currently, a shareholder can only bring a claim on behalf
of a company against directors in limited circumstances. Part 11 sets
out a new procedure of derivative actions that enable shareholders to
bring a claim on behalf of the company for directors&#146; breach of
duty, if that breach has not been authorised or ratified by the
company. Together with part 10, we believe that this has significant
potential to increase liability for directors.</p><p><a name="0610181000194">Before I go any further, I
should like to explain the current common law position and set out what
the Government aim to do in this area. Derivative claims are
proceedings brought by a shareholder. Under the new Bill, they must be
either</p><a name="61017-0006.htmbrev_116"><a name="0610181000195"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;in respect of a
cause of action vested in the company and seeking relief on behalf of
the company&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="0610181000196">and</p><a name="61017-0006.htmbrev_117"><a name="0610181000859"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;brought only in respect of causes
of action arising from an actual or proposed act or omission involving
negligence, default, breach of duty or breach of trust by a director of
the company.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="0610181000197">This is
significantly wider than the current common law position.</p><p><a name="0610181000198">There are two major concerns in
relation to part 11. First, that it does not advance the common law
and, secondly, that its effect, particularly when it is combined with
part 10, will be detrimental to directors. We have tabled amendments
that seek to deal with those concerns, which I shall discuss in due
course. The leading common law case on which this codification attempts
to build is that of Foss <i> v.</i> Harbottle. If the Bill&#146;s
intention is to enshrine in statute the well-established exceptions to
the rule set out in the case of Foss <i> v.</i> Harbottle, our view and
that of the lawyers who have advised us is that that is not immediately
achieved by the current drafting. The rule in Foss <i> v.</i> Harbottle
is that a member cannot bring an action on behalf of the company for an
injury done to the company; the company is the injured party and the
action vests in it.</p><br>

<meta name="Date" content="17 Oct 2006">

<notus-date day="17" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><b>17 Oct 2006 : Column 825</b><br><p><a name="0610181000199">The exceptions to the rule in
Foss <i> v.</i> Harbottle include circumstances in which the transaction
constitutes a fraud on the minority. That includes fraud proper as well
as breach of fiduciary duty as a director and circumstances in which
the wrongdoers are in control of the shares of the company. The
non-inclusion of this fraud control test in the Bill represents a
radical departure from the previous thresholds to a member making a
derivative claim. The result of this non-inclusion is that it will be
easier for shareholders to bring claims against
directors.</p><p><a name="0610181000200">Although the
court will now be required to consider the evidence and merits at the
earlier stage, there is a danger that this part of the Bill will simply
create a more complex procedure without any corresponding reduction in
the potential administrative burdens for companies. It therefore makes
sense that part 11 should be amended to preserve the traditional
thresholds of fraud on the minority and wrongdoer control, as that
would make it clear in statute that this new regime is not intended to
sweep away the existing case
law.</p><p><a name="0610181000201">As the new
legislation does not replicate existing case law, it will take some
time for a body of case law to develop. We feel that this will create
uncertainty for some period as to the extent of the derivative claim
provisions and the burden of this will largely fall on the company.
This could, in part, be remedied by the legislation mirroring more
closely existing law. In practice, derivative claims have to date been
relatively rare, but any potential benefit this codification will have,
which will be minimal, will be far outweighed by the possible damage
that will be wrought by increased shareholder litigation and reducing
the number of people who are willing to take up company directorships
in the UK.</p><p><a name="0610181000202">A further
key change in this Bill is that the persons engaging in fraudulent
conduct need not have received a benefit. Members will therefore be
allowed to make claims for an honest act or omission of a director
where that results in a breach of duty, regardless of whether the
individual has received a benefit. Under the existing common law, it is
not possible to make a derivative claim as a result of negligent action
unless the person in breach of duty has received a corresponding
benefit. This represents a shift from the existing position and the
focus is much more on allowing member control of directors&#146;
actions.</p><p><a name="0610181000203">The range of
circumstances under which a derivative action may be brought will be
much wider than is currently the case. This is once again an area of
the law where the Government have said that the intention of putting in
new clauses has been to codify the existing common law position, but
this is, unfortunately, once again an area where the Government are
overturning the common law position. The codification of the basis of
bringing a claim and the means of bringing that claim will serve only
to make it easier for claims to be brought against company
directors.</p><p><a name="0610181000204">Company
directors also fear that increased litigation may lead to increased
insurance premium costs&#151;that is a very real fear for company
directors. Should the rates that directors and officers have to pay go
up, there will be a further disincentive to people becoming company
directors. I am afraid that that is becoming a theme of parts 10 and
11, and it is not a happy one.</p><br>

increase potential liabilities for directors and the chance of tactical
and vexatious litigation by activist shareholders has been raised by
many others. The City law firm, Lovells,
says:</p><a name="61017-0006.htmbrev_118"><a name="0610181000860"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The
Explanatory Notes to the Bill explain that
&#145;the&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="0610181000206">derivative
action</p><a name="61017-0006.htmbrev_119"><a name="0610181000861"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;clauses do not
formulate a substantive rule to replace the rule in Foss v Harbottle,
but rather a new procedure for bringing such an action which set down
criteria for the Court distilled from the Foss v Harbottle
jurisprudence&#146;. It is hard to see how this can be correct. As
the Explanatory Notes themselves make clear, the rule in Foss v
Harbottle is that is for the company to bring proceedings where a
&#145;wrong has been done to the company&#146;, and that an
exception can be made where there is conduct amounting to a fraud on
the minority. The case of Estmanco (Kilner House) Ltd v Greater London
Council made clear that &#145;fraud&#146; in this context extends
beyond fraud at common law to include &#145;the equitable concept of
fraud on a power&#146;, including an abuse or misuse of power. It is
generally considered that fraud, in this sense, does not include
negligence. Other grounds include where the director&#146;s act is
illegal, ultra vires and not ratifiable, or where the shareholder has
acquired a personal right against a relevant director.</p></ul><a name="61017-0006.htmbrev_120"><a name="0610181000862"><ul><p class="tabletext">Whilst the Explanatory Notes say
that Part 11 does not seek to overturn these previous &#145;well
established principles&#146;, it is hard to see how this can be. If
Part 11 comes into law, individual shareholders will be able to bring
proceedings against directors, including in respect of negligence,
which cannot be summarily struck out for want of locus standii, but
only under a brand new test, which is unconnected to these common law
factors. As a result, there is a clear risk that multiple stakeholders
might make good use of Part 11 to further their own various platforms,
at the expense of companies&#146; time and money, and their directors
time and money, personal stress, and claims upon their D&amp;O
insurance. It may even be possible for such a shareholder to use the
provisions of this Part to apply for an order that the company pay his
costs of bringing the proceedings, along the lines of the application
upheld in Wallersteiner...If so, this could produce the very odd
result that a number of activists could each buy a single share in the
company, and each bring separate proceedings against directors, in
respect of conduct predating their shareholding, at the
company&#146;s expense. Such claims may well, however, be struck out
by the Court under the first stage of section 242 referred to
above.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="0610181000207">We hope that that
would be the case, but clearly the risks are
there.</p><p><a name="0610181000208">Let me turn to
our amendments, which seek to rectify the problems that I have
highlighted. Clause 260(3)
states:</p><a name="61017-0006.htmbrev_121"><a name="0610181000863"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;A
derivative claim...may be brought only in respect of a cause of
action arising from an actual or proposed act or omission involving
negligence, default, breach of duty or breach of trust by a director of
the company.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="0610181000209">That wording
is not sufficiently precise and is too wide. In particular, the use of
the words, &#147;or proposed&#148;, go too far. A member should not
have the statutory right to make a derivative claim to restrain some
proposed act or omission. The intention should be to provide a remedy
for a member where there has been an actual act or omission. To include
the words, &#147;or proposed&#148;, may be a charter for members at
any time to take action to restrain what they thought was a potential
future breach of the relevant duties. We therefore propose to amend the
wording of the clause as set out in amendment No. 412. In Committee,
the Solicitor-General said that this approach is too restrictive, but
we are yet to be convinced by his arguments.</p><p><a name="0610181000210">Amendments Nos. 413 and 414 were

Solicitor-General:</b> I am interested that the briefing from

The Institute of Chartered Accountants believes that it will encourage
nuisance claims against directors. We therefore tabled amendment No.

drafted on Law Society recommendations. He gave examples of third
parties who hold money, transferred in breach of trust from the
company, and who should be permitted to be pursued by a member of the
company. Although that may be true in limited circumstances, we remain
concerned about the growing scope of the clause and support the
position of the Institute of Chartered

It aims to ensure that the company retains an opportunity to exercise
its primary right to sue the directors. Although it is easy to get
carried away with arguments for and against members being able to seek
relief on the company&#146;s behalf, we should not forget that the
primary right is for the company to initiate the action. The amendment
would embed that right in primary
legislation.</p><p><a name="0610181000215">Amendment
No. 416 is aimed at resolving some of the problems that I have
highlighted. The Law Society has been a great help in drafting the
amendment, which was first tabled by Lord Hodgson in the other place.
It would insert in clause 263 three new provisions, which oblige the
court to refuse permission to continue a claim.</p><p><a name="0610181000216">The first provision would apply
when the directors had decided not to pursue the claim. The second

Solicitor-General maintained that that should be a relevant factor for

permission for leave. However, we urge the Government to trust
directors and accept the

not believe that they have merit. The amendment would improve the
drafting considerably. We emphasise that its purpose is to introduce a
threshold test that does not involve expense.</p><p><a name="0610181000221">The Government have added new
reasons for the court to reject a derivative claim. Are the tests
strong enough? We contend that they will not be in practice. There is a
concern that it will be possible for firm advice to be given on the
court&#146;s approach to the exercise of its unfettered discretion
only after years of jurisprudence. Uncertainties will be damaging to
business.</p><p><a name="0610181000222">Amendment
No. 417 would reintroduce the fraud on the minority and wrongdoer
control tests that existing common law contains. I have already spoken
about the way in which the radical departure from common law has
worried several stakeholders to whom we have spoken. From the way that
the hon. Member for Cambridge (David Howarth) is shifting in his seat,
I have a feeling that he, too, will cover the
matter.</p><p><a name="0610181000223">I thank the
Solicitor-General for his letter of 25 July on derivative claims, which
set out the legal position about fraud on the minority following

attempting to clarify a difficult matter, we believe that the common
law position should prevail and have tabled amendment No. 417 on that
basis.</p><p><a name="0610181000224">The issue is
important to us. We have been lobbied significantly by companies,
accountants, solicitors, the CBI and many interest groups, including
many City solicitors. The Government need to reconsider the matter
because if we get it wrong, we open up the possibility of a culture of
litigation, which exists in the United States, but that we do not want
to experience in this
country.</p><p><a name="0610181000225"><b><a name="61017-0006.htm_spnew297"><a name="0610181000908">David

action from going forward.</p><p><a name="0610181000226">As I understand it, the
Government have said that they are trying to clarify the law without
codifying it. As the hon. Member for Huntingdon has said, the trouble
with that is that it will tend to cause some confusion in areas where
the statute does not mention the previous law. Would the courts
reconstitute the previous law? It might be argued that it will be
several years before we end up back where we started.</p><p><a name="0610181000227">As the hon. Member for
Huntingdon said, the law on this matter is not entirely clear. I have a
problem with his amendment No. 417, simply on the ground that the
concept of fraud on the minority is so difficult and so contested in
the courts and academic journals that it is not really worth putting
into a statute. Most academic writers think that it is too confusing to
use, and many point out that what it really means is fraud against the
company. Perhaps we should not put into statute a phrase of such
contested meaning.</p><p><a name="0610181000228">Other amendments that have been
tabled have varied merit. The idea of amendment No. 412, which would
leave out the word &#147;proposed&#148;, is, as the hon. Member for
Huntingdon said, to prevent derivative actions in advance of the harm
being done. That seems to me a useful aspect of the current draft, as
it is frequently cheaper for all concerned to prevent harm from being
done than to try to cure it later. Obviously, the word
&#147;proposed&#148; does invite possible extra legal actions. The
question, however, is whether the safeguards in the rest of the clauses
with which we are dealing prevent abuse. To a large extent, I think
that they do. I would not therefore support amendment No.
412.</p><p><a name="0610181000229">Amendment No. 413
would take away the ability of a derivative action to cover rights that
the company has against third parties. In the past, that has always
been thought to be possible, and the amendment would impose a
restriction on such action. This area of law is always about the
company&#146;s rights, not the personal rights of the individual
shareholders or directors. The question is whether derivative action
should be used to allow shareholders to enforce the company&#146;s
rights, and it seems to me perfectly sensible to propose that it
should, given the other restrictions on the possible use of such
action.</p><p><a name="0610181000230">Amendment No.
415, however, seems to be a more sensible proposal. As has been said,
the whole point of Foss <i> v. </i>Harbottle is to prevent shareholders
in a minority action from wasting everyone&#146;s time by bringing a
derivative action that is unnecessary or has no chance of succeeding.
The amendment allows the company&#151;in particular, the board of
directors, the organ of the company that normally has such a
right&#151;to decide first whether it wants to proceed with the
action. It seems to me to be straightforwardly correct, and in the
spirit of the existing law that goes back to the original 19th century
cases, to allow the company in the form of the board of directors to
have a pre-emptive right of first refusal on whether an action should
be brought.</p><p><a name="0610181000231">Amendment
No. 416 would reconstitute the details of the rule itself. Its ambition
is admirable, and proposed subsections (d) and (e) are clearly linked
to legal developments in the 19th century&#151;the former to the
Atwool case of 1867, and the latter to the Menier <i> v.</i>

cases in statute. In a way, the amendment is vulnerable to the
objection expressed by the hon. Member for Huntingdon against the whole
thrust of the Bill&#151;that it tries to put into statutory form a
very complex area of case law. One could argue that he has not got it
quite
right.</p><p><a name="0610181000232"><b><a name="61017-0006.htm_spnew298"><a name="0610181000909">Mr.
Djanogly:</b> The hon. Gentleman is right that I do not want
to create new case law, and that the amendment&#146;s attempt to
incorporate in the Bill the existing common law position runs the risk
of falling into that trap. However, he will appreciate that the
amendment is an attempt to ensure that that the existing provisions
should not be widened.</p><p><a name="0610181000233"><b><a name="61017-0006.htm_spnew299"><a name="0610181000910">David

whether it is entirely successful.</p><p><a name="0610181000234">Amendment No. 416(f) is a new
departure, in that it would insert in the Bill the sort of catch-all
provision to which one would normally object on the grounds that it is
vague and unclear. The amendment has its merits, therefore, but needs
more work.</p><p><a name="0610181000235">I have
already dealt with amendment No. 417, which I said was not a good idea
because it would bring back the notion of fraud on the
minority.</p><p><a name="0610181000236">Finally, the
Bill is an important attempt at reform, as the hon. Member for
Huntingdon has noted. He seems to think that that reform is not
desirable, but many people would differ with him about that. The
particular question that I am dealing with here is whether it is
necessary to prove that the directors made a gain from their wrongdoing
before a derivative suit can be brought. The present law states that
such an action cannot be brought against directors who have committed
negligence, except where that negligence has resulted in a gain for the
wrongdoer.</p><p><a name="0610181000237">It is not
entirely clear why that rule is in place. I agree with the many people
who think that it is simply an historical accident, the result of
taking too seriously the notion of
&#147;fiduciary&#148;&#151;that a gain has to be identified
before legal action can be taken. Another possibility is that the
relevant case law was not consistent, so that judges went one way,
regretted it, and then decided to go the other
way.</p><p><a name="0610181000238">The underlying
question is whether a derivative suit should be possible when directors
have lost the company money through their negligence. That would give
rise to a claim that belongs to the company, and the next question is
whether the proposed reform in the Bill would give directors an
incentive to do their job better. I think that it would and therefore
am in favour of it.</p><p><a name="0610181000239">I
recognise that there could be a problem if people on the outside think
that what is being is a codification rather than a reform. That would
not be correct: the Bill proposes not a codification but a reformed
system that has some merits.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="61017-0006.htmordayhd_29"><a name="0610181000876">9

<notus-date day="17" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><b>17 Oct 2006 : Column 831</b><br>contribution has helped to clarify many of the issues. I should like to
make a couple of points for the sake of clarification before I set out
a brief outline of the Government&#146;s position.</p><p><a name="0610181000241">The hon. Member for Cambridge is
quite right to say that our aim is not to codify the whole of Foss
<i> v.</i> Harbottle. That case states that a only company can sue for a
breach of duty, and the courts have allowed shareholders certain
exceptions to sue by various derivative claims. We are replacing the
exceptions&#151;rather than codifying&#151;by means of part 11 of
the Bill. As I have said, Foss <i> v.</i> Harbottle will
survive.</p><p><a name="0610181000242">The hon.
Member for Huntingdon is right to say that we need to ensure that we do
not create a culture of litigation in this country. We believe that our
provisions will strike a balance that will avoid the development of
that kind of culture. Our aim is similar to his in that regard, but we
disagree over the way in which the provisions will apply.</p><p><a name="0610181000243">Both hon. Members made the point
that, in order to develop this area of law further, there would need to
be more case law. They are quite right, and the new statute will bring
new case law with it. The common law has developed through case law in
any event. Even if we did not introduce these reforms or bring into
operation the clauses in part 11, there would still be some case law.
There will therefore be a degree of further development of the law, and
the statute will help that development. That is our
intention.</p><p><a name="0610181000244">I also
agree with the hon. Member for Huntingdon that this is an important
part of the Bill. Let me therefore outline the Government&#146;s
approach in this area. Our starting point has been the need to balance
the ability of directors to manage the affairs of companies in good
faith and the right of the members to bring an action on behalf of a
company in circumstances in which a director has acted in breach of his
duty to the company and in which an action would not otherwise be
brought. I believe that part 11 achieves that balance very
well.</p><p><a name="0610181000245">A derivative
claim is not a shareholder action in the sense of an American class
action. It is an action brought by a shareholder on behalf of a
company. It follows from this that any damages arising from a
successful claim would be paid to the company, not to the shareholders
who have brought the action. Since shareholders who bring an action may
also face heavy costs, a derivative claim is very much an action of
last resort. It is not something that any shareholder is likely to
embark on lightly, as they could put themselves in a very difficult
position if they did so.</p><p><a name="0610181000246"><b><a name="61017-0006.htm_spnew301"><a name="0610181000912">Mr.
Djanogly:</b> Our fear in relation to this provision concerns
costs. If an action group persuaded 300 of its members to buy one share
each in a company, then funded the action of those shareholders, that
could give rise to problems. People might bring court cases without
caring about the costs, because they were being funded by a third
party.</p><p><a name="0610181000247"><b><a name="61017-0006.htm_spnew302"><a name="0610181000913">The

therefore be the company.</p><p><a name="0610181000248"><b><a name="61017-0006.htm_spnew303"><a name="0610181000914">Mr.
Djanogly:</b> My point is that the Minister is speaking about
individuals winning or losing&#151;as in America&#151;or about the
company winning or losing. However, individuals who own only one share
making a claim might not have any desire to win individually. They
might be taking the company to court to make a point, and if they are
funded by a third party, they will be able to do that much more easily
under these provisions than under the present
legislation.</p><p><a name="0610181000249"><b><a name="61017-0006.htm_spnew304"><a name="0610181000915">The
Solicitor-General:</b> I do not necessarily accept that it
would be that easy. The hon. Gentleman should look at the details of
the derivative claims provisions. I think that they provide sufficient
safeguards against the development of a litigation culture, as our aim
is to prevent a pressure-group level of litigation against particular
companies. When I have developed my argument, perhaps he will see how
we intend to do that.</p><p><a name="0610181000250">A
breach of a director&#146;s general duties to the company is a
serious matter. Indeed, it may be extremely serious for the company,
whose very existence may be put in jeopardy by the breach or threatened
breach of duty. The general duties set out in chapter 2 of part 10 do
not constitute guidance or a wish list. They are statutory duties, and
every director must comply with them. It is therefore important that
there be a clear and accessible mechanism by which shareholders can, if
necessary, bring an action in the name of the company against a
director for breach of one of those duties. For shareholders, there are
two main problems in current law. First, as the hon. Member for
Cambridge knows, the law is to be found in case law that stretches back
more than 150 years and is anything but clear and transparent. That is
why the Law Commission recommended that the right to bring a derivative
action at common law should be replaced by a</p><a name="61017-0006.htmbrev_123"><a name="0610181000865"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;new derivative procedure with more
modern, flexible and accessible criteria for determining whether a
shareholder should be able to pursue the
action&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="0610181000251">It is essential
that the procedural requirements for bringing a derivative action are
accessible and clearly set out, so that they can be understood by both
directors and shareholders.</p><p><a name="0610181000252">Secondly, the law is built on
somewhat arcane legal principles relating to the concept of fraud on
the minority. Those principles are difficult and obscure, even to
lawyers, but they restrict the ability of shareholders to bring
meritorious claims. That is why the new statutory procedure differs
from the common law in two key respects. We do not want the claimant to
have to show &#147;wrongdoer control&#148;&#151;that is, to show
that the company is controlled by the directors whom the claimant
believes to have acted in breach of their duties&#151;as that might
make it impossible for a derivative claim to be brought successfully by
a member of a widely held company, including almost all major quoted
companies.</p><p><a name="0610181000253">We also
want it to be possible to bring a claim in cases of negligence, even if
it cannot be shown that the directors have profited from the
negligence. As the hon. Member for Huntingdon says, it is important
that the Bill should not permit shareholders to bring a

<notus-date day="17" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><b>17 Oct 2006 : Column 833</b><br>derivative claim that is motivated by reasons other than the commercial
success of the company. We have made it clear from the beginning that
we want such claims to be dismissed by the courts at the earliest
possible opportunity, without the companies being involved. However,
the general reforms to civil procedure introduced by Lord Woolf may
mean that unmeritorious cases proceed further before being thrown out.
Under those reforms, there is no requirement to obtain leave before a
claim is issued. Instead, the claimant must apply to the court for
&#147;permission to continue&#148; the claim. For that reason, in
the other place, we tabled a package of reforms that ensure that the
courts can dismiss unmeritorious claims at an early stage.</p><p><a name="0610181000254">The amendments in the other
place introduced a two-stage procedure for permission to continue a
derivative claim. At the first stage, the applicant would be required
to make a prima facie case. The court would be required to consider the
issue on the basis of the evidence filed by the claimant alone, without
requiring any evidence from the defendant. The courts must dismiss
applications at that stage if what is filed does not show that there is
a good case. At the second stage, but before the substantive action
begins, the court considers whether the decision of the directors was
one that the company could reasonably and independently have taken. In
addition, the Government amendments that were tabled to part 11 in
another place made it clear that the court may</p><a name="61017-0006.htmbrev_124"><a name="0610181000866"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;make any consequential order it
considers appropriate.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="0610181000255">Examples include a cost order or a
restraint order against the applicant. That would give the court
explicit power to adjourn the permission application, either for a
specific event, such as a general meeting of the company and other
soundings, or more generally, so that it can revisit the question of
permission at a later
stage.</p><p><a name="0610181000256">Thirdly, it provides that, in
deciding whether to permit a claim to continue, the court should have
particular regard to any evidence as to the views of members of the
company who have no personal interest, direct or indirect, in that
particular matter. That will help to address concerns that it is not
practical or desirable for major quoted companies to ask shareholders
formally to approve directors&#146; commercial decisions.</p><p><a name="0610181000257">I believe that these clauses, as
amended in another place, strike the right balance between the ability
of directors to take business decisions in good faith and shareholder
rights, and they make this important area of law clearer and more
accessible. I emphasise that they do not oblige the courts to involve
themselves in business judgments or to reverse the burden of proof in
any way.</p><p><a name="0610181000258"><b><a name="61017-0006.htm_spnew305"><a name="0610181000916">Mr.

is&#151;I trust that it is not&#151;that we ought to make the law

viewpoint that is not about the commercial success of the
company.</p><p><a name="0610181000261">I think that
we have struck a proper balance. The amendments that we have tabled and
have had accepted in another place are able to deal with the main
concerns that the hon. Member for Huntingdon raised. As I say, I do not
think that there is any great difference of view of what we want. The

ensure that we are able to achieve the benefits of more accessible and
clearer legislation without the problems caused by unnecessary
litigation.</p><p><a name="0610181000262">I shall
now look at the amendments to clause 260, beginning with amendment No.
412, which attempts to delete &#147;or proposed&#148;. Amendment
No. 412 is based on a misunderstanding of the current law and the
position under the statutory statement of directors&#146; general
duties. Clause 179 provides that the consequences of breach or
threatened breach of the statutory duties are the same as would apply
if the corresponding common law or equitable principle applied. The
reference to threatened breaches is important. Under the present law,
companies may be able to take pre-emptive action to stop a breach of
duty from taking place before it actually happens and the damage is
done. There could, for example, be a threatened breach of duty if a
director was refused permission to exploit a corporate opportunity but
then announced that he was going to go ahead and do it anyway. The
remedies in such cases, which include an injunction or a declaration,
provide an important safeguard of a company&#146;s interest against
wrongdoing by a director. A derivative action is an action brought by
the company, and there is no sensible basis on which the remedies
available to the court should be limited in the way proposed in the
case of a derivative
claim.</p><p><a name="0610181000263">Amendment No.
413 would remove the right to bring a claim against a third party. That
provision in clause 263 flows from a clear Law Commission
recommendation, which is explained in detail in part 6 of the Law
Commission&#146;s report on shareholder remedies. The principles are
important. The claim should be allowed only if there has been a breach
of a duty by a director, but the relief sought may be against a third
party as well as against the director
personally.</p><br>

a couple of examples that have been cited by the Law Commission in its
report on shareholder remedies. In the first example, a relief is
sought from a third party for knowingly being in receipt of money or
property or for property transferred in breach of trust or for knowing
assistance in a breach of trust. It seems to us correct that the member
should be entitled to pursue a remedy against the third party in
circumstances where he is holding assets belonging to the company,
which he has obtained in those particular circumstances.</p><p><a name="0610181000266">In the second example, a
profitable company is a victim of a tort by a third
party&#151;perhaps another company. The directors, while otherwise
committed to the well-being of the company, have ulterior motives of
their own for not wishing to enforce a remedy for the tort. Although
the directors would in those circumstances be in breach of duty, that
breach would not have given rise to the claim, so it would not be open
to a member to bring derivative proceedings against a third party.
Again, we believe that that is an appropriate outcome.</p><p><a name="0610181000267">I hope that those examples show
that it is possible to uphold important principles while placing
reasonable constraints on the application of the provision and that
this would not result in members seeking to bring derivative claims
against third parties simply where they disagree with a decision of the
board not to sue a third party. I believe that clause 263 achieves
that.</p><p><a name="0610181000268">I now wish to
deal with the provisions in clause 264, which respond to the requests
from some respondents to the company law reform White Paper, including
the Law Society, that part 11 should state clearly that it is
immaterial whether the cause of action arose before or after the person
seeking to bring or continue a derivative claim became a member of the
company. That reflects the position in the common law derivative
action, and the provision also makes it clear that current members,
even if not members at the time that the corporate cause of action
arose, are the only plaintiffs entitled to bring proceedings. In doing
so, it accurately reflects the nature of the derivative action that is
the company&#146;s cause of action. As such, the point in time at
which the member became a member is immaterial. I cannot therefore
support the amendment proposed by the hon. Member for
Huntingdon.</p><p><a name="0610181000269">Amendment
No. 415 provides that a derivative claim may be brought only if the
directors have refused a request by a member to bring a claim. The
amendment goes to the heart of what we are seeking to achieve in our
reform of the law in this area. At present, a derivative claim will not
be available to the minority shareholder unless he can show that, to
put it briefly, the wrongdoers are in control. The onus is thus on the
claimant minority shareholder who seeks to bring a derivative claim to
allege in his statement of case, and then to demonstrate, that those
whose actions he complains of are in control of the company and will
not permit its name to be used as claimant in the action.</p><p><a name="0610181000270">If the minority shareholder
cannot demonstrate control, the action will be dismissed. However, the
minority shareholder does not need to be able to

the Law Commission observed, the meaning of &#147;wrongdoer

not&#151;it sometimes takes us a long time to achieve things in this
place&#151;the Jenkins committee said that it would be</p><a name="61017-0006.htmbrev_125"><a name="0610181000867"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;extremely difficult to devise a

of the exception to the rule in Foss <i> v.</i> Harbottle in wider
terms. That is why the Law Commission has proposed a new statutory
remedy.</p><p><a name="0610181000273">Under the
proposed statutory procedure, a member need not demonstrate wrongdoer
control, but one of the factors that the court must take into account
in considering whether to give permission to continue the claim is
whether the company has decided not to pursue the claim. It may
therefore be advisable for a member seeking to bring an action to
ascertain the company&#146;s intentions with regard to pursuing its
cause of action before bringing a derivative claim, but we do not
believe that that need be a mandatory precondition.</p><p><a name="0610181000274">The hon. Member for Huntingdon
proposes that we enshrine in law such a mandatory condition. He takes
the view that permission should be sought, at least. I have some
sympathy with the proposal, but we do not believe that such a mandatory
precondition would be helpful or necessary to bring a claim. We fear
that going down that route would bring us right back to a number of the
unsatisfactory and undefinable concepts that I have just mentioned.
Although I have every sympathy with the aim in amendment No. 415, I
cannot accept its mandatory nature, so I hope that it will not be
pressed to a vote.</p><p><a name="0610181000275"><b><a name="61017-0006.htm_spnew307"><a name="0610181000918">Mr.

enable them to enforce the company&#146;s rights. The shareholder is
seeking to enforce the company&#146;s rights&#151;that is the key
thing, and it is where I began. We need to ensure that we have the
proper balance in place, and I fear that the provisions that the
Opposition seek to insert into the clause would create a lack of
balance, so the shareholder could not take action when they need to do
so if there is impropriety by a director. This is about balance and the
need for care. We have got the balance right, and although the
Opposition are taking points from outside organisations, they might not
have got that balance right.</p><br>

out the criteria that must be taken into account by the court in
considering whether to give permission to continue a derivative claim.
Subsection (2) provides that the court must&#151;I emphasise the word
&#147;must&#148;&#151;refuse leave to continue a derivative claim
if it is satisfied that a person acting in accordance with the duty to
promote the success of the company would not seek to continue the
claim; or where the cause of action arises from an act or omission that
has not yet occurred, that act or omission has been authorised by the
company; or where the cause of action arises from an act or omission
that has already occurred, that act or omission has been either
authorised or ratified by the
company.</p><p><a name="0610181000278">Amendments
Nos. 416 and 417 seek to add to the list of factors matters that, if
established to the satisfaction of the court, would constitute a bar to
the continuation of a derivative claim. The Bill&#146;s approach
follows the Law Commission&#146;s recommendation that whereas
ratification of a breach should constitute a bar to the bringing of a
derivative action, the fact that a breach of duty is ratifiable should
not constitute a bar, but should feature as one of a list of factors to
which the court should have regard in considering whether to grant
permission to continue the
claim.</p><p><a name="0610181000279">Amendment No.
416 would add three further grounds that, if established to the
court&#146;s satisfaction, would constitute a bar to the continuation
of a derivative claim. Therefore, let me consider each briefly. The
first new bar to the bringing of a derivative claim would be a decision
by the directors not to pursue the claim, unless the court considers
that there is a substantial risk that, in reaching their decision, they
acted in breach of their duties to the company. That factor already
appears on the list of matters that have been taken into
account.</p><p><a name="0610181000280">The second
new factor under the amendment would be a claim that the company in
general meeting could validly decide not to pursue, unless the court
considers that there is a substantial risk that a decision not to
pursue the claim would be taken only as a result of votes cast by
members with a personal interest, direct or indirect. It is not clear
from the drafting whether the amendment refers to a claim relating to a
breach of duty that the company might ratify in general meeting, or to
something short of that. In either case, we do not consider that this
is a matter that should bar a derivative claim. The clause already
provides that where a breach of duty has been ratified, that will
constitute a bar and the claim will go no further.</p><p><a name="0610181000281">The third factor that the
amendment would insert into clause 263 is that pursuing the claim would
not be in the interests of the company. That overlaps in an unhelpful
way with the existing factor in subsection (2)(a),
namely,</p><a name="61017-0006.htmbrev_126"><a name="0610181000868"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;that a person
acting in accordance with section 173...would not seek to continue
the claim&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="0610181000282">It is
important that clause 173 and part 11 use consistent
wording.</p><p><a name="0610181000283">Amendment No.
417 would add two further grounds that are variants of those proposed
by amendment No. 416, and once again we are not persuaded, for
substantially the same reasons as before, of the arguments of the hon.
Member for Huntingdon. I therefore ask him to consider withdrawing the
amendment. If he does not do so, we will feel it necessary to oppose
it.</p><br>

Djanogly:</b> Under these provisions, there will be a wider
variety of people who can be sued, it will be possible to sue people
for a greater variety of offences, and there will be a more
straightforward procedure by which to sue people, which I think the
Minister called a clearer and more accessible procedure. I foresee that
the net result will be that more people will, indeed, be sued, as my
hon. Friend the Member for North Wiltshire (Mr. Gray)
suggested.</p><p><a name="0610181000285">The
Government have introduced certain amendments to tighten this part of
the Bill, introducing the two-stage process, which in itself could be
contentious&#151;I have doubts that it will, in the event, save
costs. While we note the requirement for the claimant to establish a
prima facie case in order to obtain permission to continue a derivative
claim, the introduction of the threshold does not entirely address the
concerns about frivolous litigation. For certain categories of claim,
it will be easy to establish a prima facie case, and the threshold
might not act as a deterrent. The best example that I can give is where
directors or the company have been fined for regulatory breaches.
Evidence of the conviction will itself amount to a prima facie case of
breach of duty under clause 243(3). The threshold is also no answer to
the concerns that arise from allowing shareholders to bypass the board
when commencing a derivative
claim.</p><p><a name="0610181000286">We remain
concerned that part 11 empowers shareholders to commence litigation
against the directors without consulting or informing the board. That
increases the chances of tactical litigation, as I have made clear.
Secondly, it will create the capacity for disruption. Thirdly, it will
give the shareholder a primary, rather than a derived, right to bring a
claim in the company&#146;s name. On that point, we have common
ground with the Liberal Democrats; it comes to the fore in relation to
amendment No. 415.</p><p><a name="0610181000287">9.30
pm</p><p><a name="0610181000288">It is a fundamental
principle of company law that directors owe their duties to the
company, and the company thus has the primary right to sue them in
respect of wrongdoing. At present, a shareholder derives a right to sue
in a company&#146;s name in particular circumstances, including
because the wrongdoers who control the company will not exercise the
company&#146;s primary right to sue. By failing to include a
requirement that the board be consulted on, or informed about, a
shareholder&#146;s intention to sue the directors in the
company&#146;s name, the company will be deprived of an opportunity
to exercise its primary right to sue in any circumstances in which the
shareholder chooses not to consult the board. We were not convinced by
the Minister&#146;s response to that point, so although I will not
press amendments Nos. 412 to 414 to a Division, I will press amendment
No. 415. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the

running to take her place. I welcome her to the debate. I hope that she
is considerably more briefed on the statutory instrument than I have
had the opportunity to be.</p><p><a name="0610181000788">The statutory instrument was
laid before the House on 2 June this year, when Parliament was sitting
and capable of dealing with it. The arrangements that the order
implements were put into practical effect&#151;came into
force&#151;on 1 July, when the House was still sitting. The question
is, why are we faced this evening with a statutory instrument that was

Mr. Speaker. This is in no sense a challenge, but my hon.

the Member for Westbury made, very perceptively, would have been to
discuss the substance of the order. I recognised that that would not be
relevant this evening, as your ruling on the point of order
confirms.</p><p><a name="0610181000795">What matters
is the fact that the order came into effect on 1 July, it having being
laid before Parliament on 2 June&#151;six or seven weeks before the
House rose for the long summer recess. Why was not the order laid
before the House and time found for a debate, so that we may understand
the serious consequences that flow from it?</p><br>

which we were so familiar and which existed in our various
constituencies across England, albeit not in Scotland. Schedule 1
replaces them with a lesser number of strategic health authorities but,
interestingly, there were issues about the transfer of staff, so there
will be no difference. Will the Minister explain why the House was not
given the opportunity to debate the order and possibly to vote to refer
it to Committee? That would have allowed us to discuss the

consider the order after it has been put in place. I ask you,
Mr. Speaker, to consider, and I hope the Minister will also
think about, the feelings of members of strategic health authorities
who have recently been appointed. What must they think of a Government

Members on the Conservative Benches have been Ministers and, indeed,
members of the Cabinet&#151;it is not uncommon for such orders to be

Goldsworthy (Falmouth and Camborne) (LD):</b> I am grateful
for the opportunity to raise the issue of lifeguarding.</p><p><a name="0610183000006">I shall begin by mentioning a
couple of facts. First, I am a new member of the surf lifesaving
association in the village where I live, Portreath, and I am learning
lots at first hand about beach safety. Secondly, I managed to fall off
a cliff when I was 17, which resulted in my needing to be rescued, so I
have first-hand experience of such
matters.</p><p><a name="0610183000007">All hon.
Members appreciate that the south-west is an important tourist
destination, and in many places the principal attraction is the
coastline. The issue of safe beach lifeguarding is important to many
families, and we have visitors to the south-west in their millions.
West Cornwall alone had 1.4 million visitors between May and September
this year, and the holiday season is increasing for a variety of
reasons. One reason may be global warming, which means that we are
getting unseasonably warm weather. One need only look at the front page
of yesterday&#146;s edition of <i> The Guardian</i>, which showed a
little girl paddling in the sea in Sussex. Another reason may be the
increasing popularity of surfing, where there are better conditions
outside the peak summer weeks. Surfing is a sport that is growing in
popularity, so we are seeing greater numbers in a longer season.
Furthermore, we have more sophisticated materials that mean that it is
possible to stay warmer for longer if one happens to venture into the
water outside the summer months. Whatever the causes, more and more
people are visiting beaches over a longer period of time. Although that
is undoubtedly good news for the economy in the south-west, it has
implications for lifeguard
cover.</p><p><a name="0610183000008">I want to draw
the Minister&#146;s attention to some figures from the Royal National
Lifeboat Institution. The RNLI assisted 10,000 people last year, which
was 2,000 more than the previous year. It saved 71 lives and carried
out 718 rescues, assisting 1,448 people, and those figures cover only
the beaches where the RNLI provides cover. The key question is whether
lifeguard cover reflects that changing need&#151;unfortunately, the
answer seems to be no.</p><p><a name="0610183000009">At the moment, lifeguard cover
is discretionary, and it is provided by local authorities mainly on an
historical basis. In some cases, they provide it on publicly owned
beaches; in others, they provide it on privately owned beaches. The
service is discretionary in terms of not only whether there is
lifeguard provision, but whether there are warning signs, whether there
is any emergency equipment and even whether there is an emergency
telephone. Because there is no statutory requirement to provide the
service, and because there is no accompanying funding as a result,
local authorities are increasingly hesitant to increase their cover or
provide new services. In Kerrier and Penrith, many local
authority-owned beaches are manned by only one lifeguard in the summer,
with inferior equipment to that provided on RNLI-lifeguarded
beaches.</p><br>

<notus-date day="17" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><b>17 Oct 2006 : Column 848</b><br><p><a name="0610183000010">The season cover provided by
local authorities is getting shorter. Anything that is not a statutory
service experiences budgetary pressures to a disproportionate extent, a
point which is made clear in a letter that I received yesterday from
Kerrier district
council:</p><a name="61017-0007.htmbrev_131"><a name="0610183000032"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Kerrier
historically has provided its own life guard service and is proud of
the service provided to date. There are always issues regarding the
funding of discretionary services in both revenue terms and the capital
investment needed to upgrade equipment...There remains pressures
to reduce the cost to the council tax payer in Kerrier and this could
take the form of asking private beach owners for contributions towards
service provision or even removing
services.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="0610183000011">The council
states that a final decision has not been made, but the threat is
there. These pressures are mainly reflected in two areas, the first of
which is the length of the season when cover is provided on local
authority owned or provided beaches. Kerrier district council says in
its letter:</p><a name="61017-0007.htmbrev_132"><a name="0610183000033"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;As
regards maintaining existing levels of service Kerrier has already
reduced the service to cover its main beaches during the summer peak
periods and the shoulders of the season, especially half terms. This
service used to include a winter patrol where, during the winter
months, a beach was patrolled according to predicted surf
conditions.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="0610183000012">I went to
visit the RNLI lifeguards at Perranporth the other week, when it was
very quiet because the conditions were quite rough. I talked to the
lifeguard, who lives in Portreath. He said that he has had very quiet
days on the beaches that he covers in Perranporth, but when he returns
home to a more sheltered cove he has found up to 150 people using the
beach with no lifeguard provision at all. At a time when using the
beaches is becoming increasingly popular, even in the autumn and
earlier in the spring, cover is being withdrawn, and that is not
reflecting the areas that people are
visiting.</p><p><a name="0610183000013"><b><a name="61017-0007.htm_spnew345"><a name="0610183000040">Matthew
Taylor (Truro and St. Austell) (LD):</b> As I am sure that my
hon. Friend is aware&#151;I want the Minister to reflect on
this&#151;the availability of effective and cheap bodysuits and
wetsuits means that many beaches are being heavily used right through
the year. This is not simply a matter of whether local authorities can
maintain the cover that they used to provide. There is now a need for
much more extensive cover through the year than there was before. I
think that my hon. Friend will be able to confirm the number of recent
incidents that have required rescue in what would traditionally have
been a part of the year when there was virtually nobody in the
water.</p><p><a name="0610183000014"><b><a name="61017-0007.htm_spnew346"><a name="0610183000041">Julia
Goldsworthy:</b> I thank my hon. Friend; I was just coming to
that. I have been flicking through my local newspapers from recent
weeks, and they contain several examples. On 21 September, four people
had to be rescued dramatically from Hayle Towans. A father and his
three sons, who were on holiday, got into trouble on the beach where
there was no lifeguard provision, and the coastguard has to be called
out. There is a similar story from Newquay on 7 October. The RNLI,
commenting on an event where surfers had to be rescued, said that if
lifeguards had been on duty, there would have been red flags that would
have dissuaded people from going into the surf in such treacherous
circumstances. The problem is that surfers sometimes look on bad
weather as a bit of a treat and an extra challenge. There need to be
clear signals that

Colin Breed (South-East Cornwall) (LD):</b> My hon. Friend
raises some important issues. There is great variability. Some beaches
have several lifeguards, or have them for a few hours, while others do
not have them at all. People who visit various beaches when they come
on holiday may find services on one beach and expect them on another
where they are not provided. There is no uniformity or co-ordination in
terms of the availability of beach
safety.</p><p><a name="0610183000016"><b><a name="61017-0007.htm_spnew348"><a name="0610183000043">Julia
Goldsworthy:</b> My hon. Friend is right. The situation is not
predictable. That uncertainty is becoming even more of a problem where
local authorities that have historically provided services on privately
owned beaches begin to think, because they are discretionary services
and there are budgetary pressures, that if a private beach owner is
making a profit from it, they should make a
contribution.</p><p><a name="0610183000017"><b><a name="61017-0007.htm_spnew349"><a name="0610183000044">Mr.
Dan Rogerson (North Cornwall) (LD):</b> Does my hon. Friend
agree that the situation is further complicated in the case of
beaches&#151;there are some in my constituency&#151;with multiple
landowners, some of which may be involved in businesses that derive
benefit from their involvement, such as
farmers?</p><p><a name="0610183000018"><b><a name="61017-0007.htm_spnew350"><a name="0610183000045">Julia
Goldsworthy:</b> I will come to that in due course. At this
point, I am talking about entirely privately owned beaches. One example
is Saunton Sands, a very large and popular privately owned beach in
North Devon. North Devon district council felt that it was no longer
able to provide these services on its own, but when it withdrew them,
the private landowner had no responsibility to provide additional
cover, so a very popular beach now has no lifeguard provision
whatsoever. As my hon. Friend said, the matter can get more complicated
because beaches are not entirely privately owned or entirely owned by
the local authority; in some cases, a significant number of people have
some kind of ownership. In my home village of Portreath, the beach is
partly owned by the local authority, partly owned by the local village
improvements committee, and partly privately owned. If there is to be a
statutory responsibility, it will not be easy to resolve where it
should lie in cases of multiple
ownership.</p><p><a name="0610183000019"><b><a name="61017-0007.htm_spnew351"><a name="0610183000046">Alison
Seabeck (Plymouth, Devonport) (Lab):</b> As the hon. Lady
knows, I was a lifeguard in a previous life. When a public pool becomes
overcrowded, the lifeguards can close it and get people out of the
water in safety. I have corresponded with the Health and Safety
Commission and the position on a beach is incredibly ambiguous. Once
people are in the water, who has the duty of care? I am pleased that
the hon. Lady has called the debate and I await the Minister&#146;s

interest.</p><p><a name="0610183000020"><b><a name="61017-0007.htm_spnew352"><a name="0610183000047">Julia

<notus-date day="17" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><b>17 Oct 2006 : Column 850</b><br>statutory responsibility for safety and whether risk assessments should
be made on the beach. The HSC response made it clear:</p><a name="61017-0007.htmbrev_133"><a name="0610183000034"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Where a beach is being
actively maintained as a leisure amenity on which members of the public
are encouraged to use services... the operator... will need
to conduct a risk assessment.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="0610183000021">That sounds straightforward, but the
second paragraph
states:</p><a name="61017-0007.htmbrev_134"><a name="0610183000035"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;However,
while the duty of care would include the beach down to the low water
mark, the sea itself would not be part of the undertaking, so there is
no obligation under health and safety law to assess the risks of
swimming or provide control measures such as
lifeguards.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="0610183000022">That is a
ridiculous anomaly: the place where people are most likely to drown is
the one area where no risk assessment currently takes
place.</p><p><a name="0610183000023">The issue is
complex and becomes increasingly so when there is more than one owner
of a beach. However, the RNLI is working hard to try to clarify the
position. There has been a pilot in the south-west since 2001, whereby
the RNLI helps extend the season of cover. For example, in Carrick,
where the RNLI helps provide lifeguarding services, the season of cover
is extended, there is access to better equipment and the organisation
looks to provide work placements abroad so that the turnover of
lifeguards is not so high and they have a winter as well as a summer
job.</p><p><a name="0610183000024"><b><a name="61017-0007.htm_spnew353"><a name="0610183000048">Annette
Brooke (Mid-Dorset and North Poole) (LD):</b> Dorset,
especially Poole, where there is a beautiful beach, which many of my
constituents use, is well served by the RNLI. There is funding, which
the RNLI regards as adequate, but the big problem is that, unless
responsibility is made clear shortly, the local authority may dip into
that money. The service is currently
excellent.</p><p><a name="0610183000025"><b><a name="61017-0007.htm_spnew354"><a name="0610183000049">Julia
Goldsworthy:</b> Partnership working between the RNLI and
local authorities already happens but the relationship is vulnerable
without clarity about statutory responsibility. The RNLI is worried
that, with increasing pressure on local authorities, they will slowly
start to withdraw and the RNLI will be left holding the
baby.</p><p><a name="0610183000026">The Government
have been aware of the problem for some time. The Transport Committee
raised the matter in 2005 and suggested a meeting with local
authorities and the RNLI. The meeting took place and I understand that
both parties were initially positive, but there has been no formal
response. Although the RNLI met the Under-Secretary of State for
Communities and Local Government, the hon. Member for Basildon (Angela
E. Smith) on 19 July to discuss duty of care issues, again there has
been no formal response. That is frustrating for those who are worried
that services are being eroded and time is ticking
on.</p><p><a name="0610183000027">Let me summarise
the problems. Unclear statutory responsibility means that there is no
funding and many local authorities with a significant coastline find
that a great burden. There are also complications about beach
ownership. I appreciate that that cannot be cleared up immediately or
quickly but progress needs to be made.
</p><p><a name="0610183000028">The RNLI proposes a
compromise, which offers a viable way forward. It suggests that any
beach that exceeds a specified amount of usage, whoever owns it,

more emergency equipment. The RNLI offers to undertake that risk
assessment free of charge, provided that it goes on to determine the
cover that is needed. That process could trigger negotiations about who
is responsible for the duty of care on the beaches. Again, it needs to
be accompanied by clarification from the Government.</p><p><a name="0610183000029">If the proposal gets Government
approval, it could result in the roll-out of the RNLI&#146;s support
through lifeguard provision, not only in the south-west, where it has
already proved beneficial, as my hon. Friends testified, but in places
such as Brighton, which cry out for access to those extra resources. If
the programme that has been trialled in the south-west cannot be rolled
out, we will experience declining provision when use of beaches is
increasing.</p><p><a name="0610183000030">This is not
an easy issue to resolve. There have been plenty of warm words, but,
unfortunately, not enough action. I hope that the Government will take
up the RNLI&#146;s offer, and that there will be an opportunity to
respond formally to the representations made over two years. There is a
fantastic opportunity before us. Cornwall&#146;s surf life saving
clubs are among the most vibrant in the country, providing beach and
pool lifeguards to the highest standards. The county is also bidding
for the 2010 world surf life saving championships, which would be an
amazing prelude to the Olympics and a real way to champion the
popularity of the sport and to put Cornwall on the map. It would be
ironic if we were hosting such an event but not providing world-class
surf life saving lifeguard cover.</p><p><a name="0610183000031">I do not want to see our
position undermined. The Minister and her Department have had long
enough to consider this problem. We need to see progress, and I hope
that I shall receive assurances from her tonight that that will be the
case.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="61017-0007.htmordayhd_34"><a name="0610181000880">10.15

must be put out to tender in each and every case. As far as future
contracts and arrangements are concerned, that issue should be thrown
into the melting pot.</p><p><a name="0610181000830">Thirdly, local authorities in my

brains to remember what was said on the BBC programme
&#147;Coast&#148;. I think that it was that we are never more than
73 miles from the coast&#151;I might be wrong on the
number&#151;wherever we are in the UK. Beach safety is therefore an
important issue for us all. Day trips and longer vacations to the
seaside are a popular form of recreation. As the hon. Member for St.
Ives (Andrew George) knows, only a month ago, I made a ministerial
visit to Cornwall, where I took the opportunity to spend a little more
time and to visit some of the very nice beaches. Of course, tourism
makes an important contribution to local economies in many coastal
towns.</p><p><a name="0610181000833">Beach safety
impacts on the experience of visitors and can have a significant impact
on the reputation of local areas. It is therefore important to local
areas that beaches are maintained as good quality, safe environments
for all. I am therefore grateful to the hon. Member for Falmouth and
Camborne, other hon. Members and my hon. Friend the Member for
Plymouth, Devonport (Alison Seabeck) for raising such points in debate
this evening.</p><p><a name="0610181000834">The
discussion on how best to promote safety and avoid accidents on our
beaches has been with us for some time. As the hon. Lady stated, it was
recently raised by the Royal National Lifeboat Institution, which has
expressed concerns about the future of life-guarding in some areas. The
concern is that some local authorities, and other beach owners that
have funded provision of this service in the past, may be planning to
reduce their contributions, owing to budgetary
constraints.</p><p><a name="0610181000835">The RNLI
is a key player in this field, having provided lifeguard services in
the south and west of England since 2001, with 62 beaches being covered
in the summer months. According to its own figures, its staff saved the
lives of 71 people in 2005, and attended 8,664 incidents. On average,
participating local authorities fund 40 per cent. of the cost of
providing lifeguard services, which are administered through service
level
agreements.</p><p><a name="0610181000836">Recently,
however, the RNLI has reported that some local authorities are becoming
reluctant to renew existing SLAs, and that some are unwilling to
contribute towards beach safety generally. The institute wants to
reverse that trend and is calling for a lead from central Government on
who is responsible for

<notus-date day="17" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><b>17 Oct 2006 : Column 853</b><br>beach safety and lifeguard provision. As the hon. Member for Falmouth
and Camborne noted, it has asked for a standard risk assessment for
beach safety to be put in place, with a duty to provide lifeguarding
once a threshold is
exceeded.</p><p><a name="0610181000837">Beach safety
provision is a complex issue, however. Looking at how safety on beaches
should be provided and who is responsible for it reveals those
complexities. The problems include determining who owns the beach and
whether there currently exists a legal duty of care for a beach owner
to provide protection. Another element involves deciding the practical
measures that should be put in
place.</p><p><a name="0610181000838">Most beaches are
owned by local authorities, whose jurisdiction normally coincides with
their boundaries. Coastal local authorities in England and Wales have
administrative control and jurisdiction over areas down to the
low-water mark. In the main, beaches not owned by local authorities are
owned by private companies and charities. In those cases, those bodies
would be considered to hold the primary duty of care towards beach
users, where there is held to be such a
duty.</p><p><a name="0610181000839">Although local
authorities have a duty of care towards their service users, there is
currently no statutory duty on them to ensure beach safety or produce
risk assessments on beach safety. Legally, it would be unreasonable to
expect a local authority, or other beach owner, to offer protection
against the naturally dangerous properties of the sea. It could also be
argued that to impose on any beach owner a duty to protect persons from
self-inflicted harm sustained when taking voluntary risks in the face
of obvious danger would also be
unreasonable.</p><p><a name="0610181000840">As
matters stand, it is at the discretion of a local authority or other
beach owner to decide whether or not to implement beach safety
measures. However, where a beach owner has created a &#147;reasonable
expectation&#148; regarding the level of safety of a beach&#151;for
example, by promoting it to visitors or previously providing a
lifeguard service&#151; that action in itself is generally held to
establish a duty of care. In other words, users would be entitled to
use the beach on the assumption that appropriate safety measures would
continue to be provided. Therefore, if a local authority currently
providing lifeguard services decided to withdraw them, there is an
argument to suggest that a risk assessment should be carried out
first.</p><p><a name="0610181000841">Placing a
statutory duty on beach owners to provide beach safety could be viewed
as one solution to the problem of ensuring that beaches are safer, and
it might reduce the number of accidents and deaths on beaches. Such a
course of action could involve requiring all coastal local authorities
to risk-assess the beaches falling within their jurisdiction and to
provide appropriate remedies to alleviate potential
problems.</p><p><a name="0610181000842">Requiring
beach owners to risk-assess their beaches and provide safety measures
raises a number of practical issues, however. For example, there would
need to be guidance about the categories against which a beach should
be assessed and who would carry out the assessment. In addition, the
guidance should also cover how frequently and when the assessment
should take place, as well as what level and type of risk would require
safety
measures.</p><p><a name="0610181000843">Clearly,
placing such a requirement on beach owners would have cost
implications. A cost is involved in

Goldsworthy:</b> The RNLI has made it clear that it

that is why it has offered to undertake them. That would overcome some

why that might not be as straightforward as she
suggests.</p><p><a name="0610181000846">I said that
the assessments would have to be carried out by a suitably qualified
body, and there is a possibility that that body would have to take out
some professional indemnity insurance. Implementing additional safety
measures would also carry additional costs. For the majority of beaches
that are local authority owned, that could place an additional cost on
them which would need to be
funded.</p><p><a name="0610181000847">The Government
remain committed to ensuring that the net additional costs of new
policies that they impose on local government are funded as required
under the Government&#146;s new burdens rules. These rules help to
ensure that the Government do not put pressure on council tax.
Furthermore, the forthcoming local government White Paper places a
strong emphasis on providing local government with much more scope to
take its own decisions on local issues. Our thinking here is that local
authorities and their partners are best placed to assess the costs and
benefits of actions at local level and to take a view on resulting
local priorities.</p><p><a name="0610181000848">In
January this year, my hon. Friend the Member for Poplar and Canning
Town (Jim Fitzpatrick), then a Minister at the former Office of the
Deputy Prime Minister, stated to Parliament that there were no plans to
place a statutory obligation on local government to provide beach
safety, and that remains our view. In practice, however, one must not
overlook the fact that many beach owners already provide beach safety
measures, including signage and lifeguard services, most notably where
a beach is being actively promoted as a visitor
destination.</p><p><a name="0610181000849">In
addition, the Department for Transport funds the Maritime and
Coastguard Agency, which in turn operates Her Majesty&#146;s
Coastguard. Her Majesty&#146;s Coastguard is an on-call emergency
organisation responsible for the initiation and co-ordination of all
civilian maritime search and rescue within the UK maritime search and
rescue region. This includes the mobilisation, organisation and tasking
of adequate resources to respond to persons either in distress at sea
or at risk of injury or death on the cliffs&#151;I am glad that the
hon. Lady avoided that when she was younger&#151;or shoreline of the

Taylor:</b> I want to be clear about what the Minister is
saying. She seems to be saying that the Government want safety to be
provided, and that they encourage local authorities to provide it and
do not want them to withdraw it. However, the Government do not want to
make it a statutory obligation, because they would then have an
obligation to ensure that the appropriate funds were available. Is that
correct?</p><br>

Munn:</b> If the hon. Gentleman listens a little more
carefully, he will understand that I am saying that it is for local
authorities to decide what they want to spend their money on in their
local areas. Clearly, a local authority such as mine would not have a
need for such expenditure, but would need to spend money on other
things. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will bear with me, because I
want to continue to develop these points, and we are getting a little
short of time.</p><p><a name="0610181000853">Local
authorities that have expressed their views on the subject of beach
safety and lifeguard provision state that they do accept a duty of care
for the beaches that they own, and that they can and do carry out risk
assessments. They wish to retain the discretionary power to choose what
cover to provide, and those that use the Royal National Lifeboat
Institution service value it but do not wish to be tied to using one
provider. This picks up on the point raised by the hon. Lady a few
moments ago. In some cases, they choose to use voluntary lifeguards
such as those trained by the Royal Life Saving
Society.</p><p><a name="0610181000854">There are
other incentives for local authorities to provide beach safety
measures. Tourism is a powerful economic driver, and a further powerful
draw for local areas is the number of beaches that possess a seaside or
blue flag award. The seaside award recognises well managed beaches that
are clean and safe. There are two categories&#151;rural and
resort&#151;and 242 beaches in England hold this award at present.
The blue flag campaign recognises beaches throughout Europe that fulfil
strict criteria relating to both water quality and the surrounding
beach area. To be considered, a beach must have attained the guideline
standard of the bathing water directive before being assessed for

moment. The guidance for these awards specifies that a risk assessment
should be conducted by an appropriately qualified person, following
which any necessary beach safety measures should be put in
place&#151;for example, a requirement for lifeguards to be on duty
during the summer season and for a record of all incidents to be
maintained. Because tourism and economic development are discretionary
services at local authority level, however, pursuing such awards
cannot, and should not, be enforced.</p><p><a name="0610181000855">To conclude, it is clear that
the issue of beach safety is a complex one that requires a number of
elements to be resolved, including funding, the practicalities of
imposing risk assessments and follow-up measures, how to include
private beach owners, and clarity on legislation. As I said earlier, we
stated to Parliament in January 2006 that there were no plans to
replace the current discretionary power to provide beach safety
measures and undertake risk assessments with a statutory obligation to
do so. Indeed, the forthcoming local government White Paper will
highlight the importance of reducing top-down control and allowing
local people and places greater discretion to decide priorities for
their areas. There can be few more local issues than beach safety, and
it follows from this that it would be for a local authority and its
partners to decide whether the level of
