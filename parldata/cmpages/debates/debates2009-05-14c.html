to him is that I recognise that there are capacity questions right across our network, which is entirely the result of the remarkable success of our railways in recent years.

 Perhaps I should declare an interest as a former employee of British Rail. Network Rail promised a year ago to move towards a seven-day railway, yet we have seen no progress. For example, in Lewes, between 1 January and the end of March, on  11 weekends there were rail replacement buses instead of a proper train service, which is simply unacceptable. Is it not time to give Network Rail an incentive to move towards a seven-day railway, and would it not be a good idea to reduce ticket prices by, say, a third, when there are rail replacement buses?</p>

 I am sure that British Rail regretted the loss of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s service, and I hope that he can make a contribution to the future of the railways in his current position. I accept that it is important that we move towards a seven-day railway, and that, as I said in answering the previous question, we find ways to co-operate with Network Rail on weekend journeys, because so many more passengers are using the railway at weekends. That means looking at innovative ways of attracting passengers on to the railway. Weekend and off-peak prices are very competitive these days, but I am confident that his suggestions will be looked at seriously by the train operating companies.</p>

 My hon.

 Does the Minister not agree that our roads are safer if the speed limits in force are appropriate and therefore respected? Is he aware that a number of local authorities, some of them second rate, refuse to consider the introduction of variable speed limits, simply on the ground of the extra cost of the necessary signage? Will he therefore consider instructing or at least advising local authorities that they always reflect on whether a variable speed limit is the more appropriate answer? What is wrong with having a 20 mph speed limit outside a school only when that school is in use?</p>

 The right hon. Gentleman has a point to make. As he knows, we are consulting on our post-2010 road safety strategy, and we know that 20 mph limits are popular in many areas. They are a relatively new phenomenon and we are gathering evidence on the success that has clearly resulted from the introduction of 20 mph limits or zones. He also has a point in that those local authorities that have tried variable speed limits ought to be able to supply us with data so that we can incorporate them into the consultation, because we intend to issue new, stronger guidance both on 20 mph limits and, for local authorities where there is a 60 mph limit, on dangerous rural single carriageways. It is appropriate to have them revisit the issue, and variable speed limits, looking after the motorist and promoting safety, may very well be another way forward.</p>

 Most of the main roads in Skelmersdale do not have pavements, so people are forced to use underpasses&#151;or often to cross the roads. In particular, there are two major secondary schools with 1,500 pupils, who, when discharged, are supposed to go through underpasses or take the back way. In reality, however, they cross the main road. A child has died, yet the local authority says&#151;to the horror of the head teacher, the rest of the school and the parents&#151;that because the road is a main road it cannot support a reduction in the speed limit.

 I understand the right hon. Gentleman&#146;s point. We have clarified as best we can that we are not proposing a blanket ban or reduction from 60 mph to 50 mph on single rural carriageways. However, given that 62 per cent. of fatalities occur on roads with only 40 per cent. of the traffic, we clearly believe that the 60 mph limit is inappropriate for some roads. In the consultation document that we have issued, we propose to produce annual reports on the performance of roads, indicating where there are greater dangers.</p>

Clearly, pot holes ought to be repaired where possible. The Government give local authorities generous grants to make sure that such matters are addressed.

Is he aware that the Institution of Chemical Engineers has said that in areas where the speed limit is reduced to 20 mph, there will be a 15 per cent. increase in CO2 emissions and a 50 per cent. increase in nitrous oxide?

 We are conscious of the question of emissions, and I am sure that that will be examined as part of the consultation and monitored closely by the Department of Energy and Climate Change. However, variable speeds have been shown to be able to assist in managing and reducing congestion. The consequence that we are trying to achieve as a result of the consultation document is further to progress the improvements that we have seen in road safety. Between 2002 and 2007, there was a reduction of some 36 per cent. in people killed or seriously injured on our roads. In the longer term, our ambition is to achieve the safest roads in the world. We are looking to have a further reduction of one third in casualties by the end of the next 10-year strategy. Speed reductions are part of that, because inappropriate speeds and people breaking the speed limits cause some 700 deaths and 20,000 injuries in an average year.</p>

 As I have been trying to outline, I cannot guarantee that there will not be reductions from 60 mph to 50 mph on some roads. We are trying to achieve a reduction in speed on roads where people are being killed and seriously injured in disproportionate numbers because the quality of the road is not as good as that of most of the A roads in the country. We are looking to make an assessment, we will produce the data, and it will then be for local authorities and highway authorities to make a determination as to the appropriate speed limit for the roads concerned. We are not proposing to introduce a blanket reduction across the country: this is targeted for best effect to ensure that vehicular traffic can get from A to B as efficiently as possible, but also safely.</p>

50 mph across the country. We signalled a clear intention to issue new guidance based on data that we will collect on an annual basis on the performance of roads to identify those that are most dangerous&#151;where more people are being killed. As I mentioned earlier, the clear statistic in all this is that 62 per cent. of people are dying on those roads, which carry only 40 per cent. of the traffic. There is a disconnect in this regard. We need to ensure that we can assess the more dangerous roads and that they then have an appropriate speed limit. There is no retreat; the proposal has never been for a blanket ban. We are targeting where the 50 mph limit should be introduced, and we will produce guidance for local authorities, not an instruction or a blanket reduction.</p>

Why, after a decade in charge of our roads, are they still using a test for drug-drivers that is no more sophisticated than asking them to walk in a straight line?

 I shall try to deal with the main elements of the hon. Lady&#146;s questions. First, we think that we are making progress. The road safety strategy for 2000-10 targeted a 40 per cent. reduction in deaths and serious injuries. Up to 2007, it was 36 per cent., so we should reach that. We had the lowest number of such deaths in recorded history in 2007, at 2,946. That is progress, and it is to the great credit of the police, local authorities, road safety officers and everybody else who is campaigning on road safety.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o13"><a name="90514-0002.htm_para2"><a name="09051460000097">On the direction of travel, we want a further reduction and we want Britain&#146;s roads to be the safest in the world again, as they were previously. On dealing with those who are transgressing against our laws, we are dealing with uninsured drivers and those who do not have road tax. The numbers are the lowest they ever have been. We had a consultation suggesting that those who recklessly and dangerously speed should get double points on their licence, because that will bring them to book. We are ensuring that the sensible, decent, ordinary, courteous motorists are the ones whom we are trying to protect, and we believe they are on the side of stronger legislation and guidance. We want safer roads, and we want those who transgress against the laws dealt with.</p>

 My hon. Friend is absolutely right. It helps families if parents of young children, or family members who care for an elderly or disabled relative, can continue to go out to work and choose their working hours, or the days of the week on which they work, to suit their caring responsibilities. She is right that it is important that employers respond positively to such requests when they are made.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o17"><a name="90514-0003.htm_para0"><a name="09051460000128">I can tell my hon. Friend and the House that when such requests are made, employers respond positively to them. I have just looked at the figures that relate to her question. For people who care for an elderly or disabled relative, 96 per cent. of requests for flexible working are agreed. For working parents with young children, 95 per cent. of requests for flexible working are agreed. The problem is that people do not make the request because they do not know their rights. Only 10 per cent. of carers knew they had the right to flexible working. That is why most of them do not make a request. Only 19 per cent. of parents with children under six know that they have the right. The problem is not employers complying; it is that people do not know they have the right, so they do not ask.</p>

Employers will need to go beyond their statutory responsibilities if they are to give the entitlement referred to in the question.</p>

 My hon. Friend has raised many times in the House the question of what happens if people are made to work short time. There are a number of reasons why working practices are changing. According to recent research I have seen, most people who work part time&#151;the majority of whom are women&#151;would prefer to work full time. The position has changed. We have tended to assume in the past that women work part time because that suits them and their family responsibilities, but now most part-time work is involuntary: people would work full time if they could. Increasingly, employers are trying to make people work part time or short time in order to manage until the economy picks up. In that context, awareness of the availability of tax credits is essential. It is also essential for employers to know that they can defer payment of tax to help them with their cash flow.</p>

 My hon. Friend is again asking me to assess the merits of the Bill&#146;s provisions, and I have said that I will do so; I will certainly have a look. The Law Commission proposals were about addressing hardship.

 Indeed, we will. One reason why we have not yet come to a final conclusion in assessing the different approaches to what we accept is an important issue is that the Scottish legislation came into force in 2006 and there is ongoing research on its impact; it will be useful to have some of the research&#146;s conclusions before coming to a final decision on the best way forward. The hon. Lady is right to raise the issue of the myths associated with what is often known as common-law marriage, which, of course, does not carry any rights at all beyond the ordinary property rights and rights within law. While we are coming to a conclusion about whether legislation is appropriate in this respect, it is important that we continue to provide advice to cohabiting couples&#151;there are 2.3 million such couples in the UK&#151;about what the current rights are, and, perhaps more importantly, are not.</p>

 I am glad that the right hon. Lady is, like Labour Members, concerned about the gender pay gap. The Equality Bill will put an obligation on the public sector, and a more onerous obligation where there are 150 or more employees, to produce more information than we will be asking the private sector to produce. The public sector will therefore be leading by example, and it is important that we ensure that we do. Perhaps she was a couple of minutes late into the Chamber because she was reading the Bill&#151;the provision is in there. We will make sure that we place this obligation on the public sector. May I remind the House that the public sector generally does better than the private sector? However, having transparency&#151;seeing what the position is in a meaningful way&#151;is the real way, as we have all discovered over the past couple of weeks, to find out what is going on.</p>

 I thank the Leader of the House for giving us the forthcoming business. May I raise again the need for a statement on the case of the 80 or more Chinese children who have disappeared from a London care centre? We were promised a report to the House two weeks ago, since when we have heard nothing. There are some things in life that really are important, and this is one of them. What will the world say about our priorities if we fail to raise in this House this scandalous, shocking and vile trade in children that is going on under our noses? The Chairman of the Home Affairs Committee has asserted that Chinese children who arrive alone at a British airport are taken into local authority care and two thirds of them vanish within a week. To put it into plain English, for God&#146;s sake what is going on? Victorian campaigners stamped out child prostitution and now, in the twenty-first century, it seems to be back.</p>

This issue will not go away. What is stopping her from referring this issue to the Committee on Standards and Privileges in a motion, so that we can take time to reflect on the lessons that need to be learned?

This is a matter of serious concern and we need to be sure that the local authorities responsible, the immigration authorities and the police work together to ensure that children who have travelled to this country on their own, and who are vulnerable thousands of miles away from their families, are properly protected.

There has been a great deal of progress over the past 10 years, but the hon. Gentleman is of course right to say that a problem remains, particularly with persistent offenders.

 I know that this answer will be disappointing and annoying for many hon.

 A legal obligation and a moral obligation are different. I am simply stating the position in relation to a legal obligation. The Chief Secretary to the Treasury said that, notwithstanding the fact that there was no legal obligation, the Government apologised for the regulatory failures and believed that there should be financial recompense for those who had lost out. The question is how we establish a scheme to pay out to those many people who have lost out. Sir John Chadwick, who is a High Court judge, is establishing that scheme. He will shortly produce an interim report on how it will be framed, and at that point the matter will be brought back to the House for Members&#146; information.</p>

 This had better be good! Thank you for calling me, Mr. Speaker, for the third time and I hope for many more. Will the Leader of the House find time for a debate on the use of the &#163;35 million Short money that the Opposition have received since 1997?

 Short money is public money that goes to the Opposition to help them to do their work and develop policy. That is important. We should acknowledge that public money underpins the political system in respect of the Opposition as well as the Government, but we must also recognise the role of the communications allowance. We need to be in communication with our constituents and to give them information about issues of concern to them. For example, we should tell them what help is available for those who lose their jobs and are worried about losing their homes. We should give them information about the mortgage protection schemes. We should give information to small businesses in our constituencies and tell them about the possibility of deferring taxes. It is not permissible to use the communications allowance to pass on party political messages, but I hope all hon. Members will use their allowance to give constituents the information they need. I support that, and I agree with my hon. Friend.</p>

I cannot see either in next week&#146;s business or in the provisional business for the week after the recess. May I suggest that we might use one of the general debates in those weeks for a debate on unemployment? There are now 2.2 million people in this country who are unemployed, and we could discuss what we can do to address that.</p>

That is clearly inadequate, and I hoped that the complaints made from all parts of the House would be recognised. We still have only one day for a Bill that is exceedingly complex, and it is almost certain that we will not reach key sections.

Departmental statistics were supposed to be released on 7 May, but they were unaccountably delayed for a week until yesterday&#151;perhaps because they show that 29,200 children between the ages of five and seven are now taught in classes of more than 30, despite the Government&#146;s absolute pledge to do away with all classes of that size. How can that be? May we have a debate on the matter?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o42"><a name="90514-0004.htm_para21"><a name="09051460000198">May we also have a debate on the state of our nation&#146;s roads? Anyone who drives around Somerset, Wiltshire and neighbouring counties will know that the roads have deteriorated very badly. They are full of potholes and there is a massive problem with the backlog of road maintenance&#151;it is estimated that the average shortfall for each authority across the country is &#163;6 million. The state of the roads causes danger and discomfort, especially to cyclists&#151;I can vouch for that&#151;and many people are concerned that money is being spent on compensation for road accident victims rather than on doing something about the cause of those accidents.

He incurred the wrath of folk singers in Somerset, including the redoubtable Wurzels, when he set out his plans for live music. The number of venues for live music, and the number of pubs and bars that provide live music, has declined, as we predicted. The Licensing Act has brought some advantages, but it has also brought about a dire state in the provision of live music in pubs, and many difficulties for voluntary bodies such as village halls. May we have a debate on the operation of the Act, so that we can explore how we can improve the situation and revitalise the music industry in this country?</p>

 In respect of the Policing and Crime Bill, in business questions last Thursday, I undertook to review the decision that it should have just one day on Report following Committee, as is usual. I have done that and looked again at the matter, because I know that there were concerns about four aspects: the definition of gangs; the use of DNA; control for gain in respect of prostitution, and its definition; and lap dancing and  <br>

controls on lap-dancing clubs. Those are very important issues; I do not demur from that at all. However, the provisions on control for gain and lap dancing were already in the Bill when it was brought before the House on Second Reading. The Government are bringing forward amendments as concessions on issues raised in Committee.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o44"><a name="90514-0004.htm_para23"><a name="09051460000201">The provisions on gangs and DNA were new; they were brought into the Bill in Committee, and therefore were not considered by the House on Second Reading. Concessions were agreed, so it is important that on Report we focus on those issues. When it comes to a Bill getting on to the statute book, we must take account not only of business in this House but proceedings in the other House. We have to make sure that we provide time so that we can consider not only our views but Lords amendments. Looking at the business of the House ahead of us, I have not seen a possibility of making a second day available. If it were possible to do so, I would have done it, but it was for me to make a judgment. I know that there were discussions among the parties, that there was not satisfaction on the issue, and that there have been concerns about it, but I am afraid I could not really offer any assistance on that, although I tried.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o45"><a name="90514-0004.htm_para24"><a name="09051460000202">We made it a priority when we came into government to reduce class sizes, particularly in primary schools. Part of the reason for our big investment in education, year after year, is to keep class sizes down, so that each child can have more individual attention. That is one of the reasons why, despite the fact that there is a global economic recession, we are this year increasing investment in education by 4.3 per cent. That is in stark contrast to the cuts proposed by the Opposition, which would affect important things such as class sizes.</p>

Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath) was about the importance of the House being able to discuss and debate and hold Ministers to account on what is being done to protect businesses, jobs and people&#146;s homes. I did say that the House would have an opportunity to discuss those issues more or less every week&#151;and it has had that opportunity in the past&#151;because that is the No. 1 priority. This week, we have had two days of discussion on the Finance Bill. On Tuesday, debate on the Bill went on until nearly 2 o&#146;clock in the morning, and last night I think that it went on until about 10 o&#146;clock.

 Well, most people are concerned about two things. They are concerned about whether the places that want to provide music can get a licence to do so, and the answer to that point is that more people are getting licences. They are also concerned about ensuring that when those clubs or pubs have licences, all the people who are having a great time there do not deafen neighbours, and that the neighbours do not suffer a grim time as a result. The licensing regime is important, and more premises are getting a licence, so everything is absolutely fine, contrary to what the hon. Gentleman said.</p>

I think we all want to put things right quickly, because we all want to restore trust and confidence in Parliament. We are all united in our belief in the importance of Parliament to our democracy. This is a defining moment, and it is a huge challenge for all of us. The public who elected us, and whom we represent, expect us to sort it out.

 Many hon. Members have been asked by their local newspapers, which are read by the constituents who elected them, to put details of their own claims and the payments received in the public domain so that the local newspaper can report them. Many hon. Members want to do that because, having been elected by their constituents, they feel that their constituents are entitled to know where their Member of Parliament stands amidst all of this. The difficulty is that the information on the claims and payments made that we have been given by the House authorities in electronic form cannot be given to local newspapers because it includes all sorts of information whose release would breach the freedom of information laws. For example, if I gave out the information about my expenses to the <i> South London Press</i>, which I want to do without having to wait for the House authorities to do so, I would be putting in the public domain the bank statements of my assistant, who is not at all keen that I should do that.

I was shocked to find that my correspondence and the reply was circulated to county councillors at will, breaching confidentiality.

 My right hon. and learned Friend will recall that the Select Committee on Public Administration published its report on lobbying in the first week of January. The report, which called for a statutory register of lobbyists, was followed by an early-day motion from my hon. Friend the Member for Pendle (Mr. Prentice), who is a fellow member of that Committee, calling for urgent legislation. The motion has been signed by 162 hon. Members.</p>

 A debate on defence in the world is always to be welcomed, but may I ask the Leader of the House to reconsider the date on which she proposes to hold the next one, which is the date of the local and European elections? That could be perceived as lowering the priority of defence, bearing in mind that in the past week, when both politicians and the media have been over-indulging in navel gazing, four young men have lost their lives in Afghanistan and the lives of their families and friends have been changed for ever. Can we get our priorities right?</p>

 Absolutely no disrespect or lack of priority is indicated by our scheduling the defence debate on that day. The subject is one on which there is so much agreement in the House, albeit a keen determination to debate it, that it will not divide the House. If elections are taking place&#151;European elections and council elections are being held on that day&#151;the usual practice is not to put on whipped business or business that will result in a vote. The defence debate is a general debate&#151;such debates are keenly supported by hon. Members&#151;and there are not such divisions that it will end in a vote. That is the explanation, although I have some sympathy with what the hon. Lady says.</p>

 On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. Disappointingly, the Leader of the House said that only one day would be available for the Policing and Crime Bill on Report. She admitted that that would result in scrutiny only of those clauses that the Government arrange in the programme motion. I understand that programming was designed to aid scrutiny, but it is being used to stifle it and, in effect, to impose the Government&#146;s selection of amendments and new clauses. I also understand that&#151;perhaps for procedural reasons&#151;you do not or cannot select amendments to order of consideration motions at Report stage.</p>

My question to you, Mr. Speaker, is: will you consider how programming operates and&#151;perhaps as a defender of Back Benchers&#146; interests&#151;how we can return to the original function of programming, which was to aid parliamentary scrutiny of Executive action? At present, the Government, not necessarily in bad faith, decide what parts of their programme we are able to scrutinise.</p>

 On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. I do not think that any hon. Member underestimates the gravity of the revelations that have appeared over the past week. It is clear that individual Members will have to account for their own actions and that we as a House are responsible for the system within which they have operated. It is appropriate for the House to reflect on the judgment of those who, in recent years, have sought to block reform of the system and increased transparency.

Will it be possible to share with the wider House the advice that is given to Officers on how to respond to those requests, so that we as a House can take ownership of the appropriate response to requests for transparency and so that we are not put in the same position again? Officers must have clear guidelines within which they operate and the House must be assured that we are not inappropriately blocking requests for information which should properly be given to the public.</p>

To those people who make such strange judgments about whom to arrest and attempt to prosecute, will the Minister please pass on the message that it does not help to put innocent men in the dock and to wreck their lives for a year only to find out that they are innocent, as anybody who knew them already knew?</p>

The first, and most immediately pressing, concern is the fate of the civilians who are still caught in the conflict area. The lack of independent observers makes it impossible to be certain of the facts, but the UN and the International Committee of the Red Cross estimate that there are anything between 50,000 and 100,000 civilians still trapped in an area that, to put it in context, is slightly larger than the combined area of St. James&#146;s and Green parks. There are very clear indications that the LTTE is holding many of those civilians against their will and using some of them as human shields. It shoots at civilians who try to escape, forcibly recruits those able to fight, including children, and uses others as labour to construct earthwork defences. We rightly and utterly condemn those practices, but we also have to be clear that they do not in any way, shape or form excuse any failings by the Sri Lankan Government.</p>

 Everybody appreciates and is thankful for the Foreign Secretary&#146;s intervention, the statement from the USA and the visit of my right hon.

However, despite the statement made on Monday, thousands of people have still been killed and the bombing is still going on; we can see the photographs today in the free papers distributed in the London underground. There is enough evidence. The communities over here are not satisfied; they are worried about, and unaware of what is happening to, their loved ones.

the International Committee of the Red Cross ship, which makes deliveries and evacuates the wounded, depends fundamentally on security. That is another reason why the Sri Lankan Government must uphold their commitment to stop using heavy weapons.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o68"><a name="90514-0007.htm_para1"><a name="09051460000294">The second crisis revolves around the conditions for civilians who manage to escape the fighting. We welcome the fact that more than 190,000 civilians, including more than 120,000 during the past four weeks, have been able to escape it and are now registered in the camps for internally displaced persons. The ability of the relevant agencies depends on the full co-operation of the Sri Lankan Government. Bluntly, that has not been forthcoming.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o69"><a name="90514-0007.htm_para2"><a name="09051460000295">Owing to those concerns and others, my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary and French Foreign Minister Kouchner visited Sri Lanka on 29 April. They made it clear to the President and Foreign Minister that the protection of civilians must be paramount and that the conflict must end. Since their visit, and the welcome visit made by the cross-party group of MPs, made up of my right hon. Friend the Member for Kilmarnock and Loudoun (Des Browne)&#151;he sends his apologies for not being here today; he is speaking elsewhere&#151;about the Sri Lankan crisis the right hon. Member for Gordon (Malcolm Bruce), my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Central (Mr. Sarwar) and the hon. Members for South Down (Mr. McGrady) and for Buckingham (John Bercow), there has been some improvement in the issuing of visas to the staff of the humanitarian agencies and in those agencies&#146; ability to move around the country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o70"><a name="90514-0007.htm_para3"><a name="09051460000296">However, more needs to be done. We will continue to press for improved access for the humanitarian agencies to the internally displaced persons and for adequate supplies of food, water and medicines to reach those in need. We are also calling on the Sri Lankan Government to ensure that the screening of IDPs is carried out in a fully transparent way that respects human rights and the dignity of those involved.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o71"><a name="90514-0007.htm_para4"><a name="09051460000297">The Sri Lankan Government also need to give free access to the international media. Let me be clear: what is needed is greater access and transparency, not less. As I have said in this place before, hon. Members across parties have been criticised and attacked by the Sri Lankan high commission for speaking out and expressing their legitimate concerns about the actions of the Sri Lankan Government. Such criticism of MPs who are doing their jobs legitimately on behalf of their constituents is wrong and unacceptable.</p>

 The Indian elections are concluding on Saturday, and we need the new Indian Government to speak out on this matter. Not only that, but both Governments must speak out clearly in condemnation of countries such as China and Russia, which are impeding the progress of the United Nations attempt to resolve the dispute.</p>

<p><a name="st_o186"><a name="09051460000302"><a name="90514-0007.htm_spnew3"><a name="09051460000942"><b>Bill Rammell:</b>
 The issue of the Indian Government is at the fore of our concerns. Concerted international pressure is of paramount importance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o73"><a name="90514-0007.htm_para6"><a name="09051460000303">In recognition of the importance of internationalising the issue, we have led the calls of the G8 for an end to the conflict and the calls of EU Ministers for a ceasefire. Two days ago, an EU troika visited Sri Lanka, and the country will feature prominently at next week&#146;s meeting of EU Foreign Ministers. We have also welcomed the engagement of the United Nations, including the personal involvement of the Secretary-General, with whom the Foreign Secretary has discussed Sri Lanka several times. My right hon. Friend has welcomed the Secretary-General&#146;s statements and made it clear that we fully support the visits to Sri Lanka made by his representatives, including Sir John Holmes, Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs, and Walter Kälin, the Under-Secretary-General with responsibility for internally displaced persons. In the face of some opposition from others, we have also supported their subsequent briefings to members of the Security Council.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o74"><a name="90514-0007.htm_para7"><a name="09051460000304">As the Foreign Secretary made clear in New York on Monday, we strongly believe that the civilian situation in Sri Lanka merits the attention of the United Nations at all levels, including formal discussions by the Security Council. We welcome the important step taken by the Security Council yesterday in issuing its first official written statement on the worsening humanitarian crisis in Sri Lanka. While he was at the UN, the Foreign Secretary had direct meetings with other members of the Security Council, UN officials and non-governmental organisations, to discuss Sri Lanka.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o75"><a name="90514-0007.htm_para8"><a name="09051460000305">Despite opposition from some other members of the Security Council, we will continue to explore how to keep the Security Council actively engaged. That is the right thing to do; it will ensure that the spotlight of international attention remains focused on Sri Lanka and that the Sri Lankan Government can have no doubts about the international community&#146;s concerns. After his visit to the UN, the Foreign Secretary went to Washington, where he discussed Sri Lanka with Secretary of State Clinton and others in the Administration. We welcome President Obama&#146;s strong statement last night, which underlined again the force of international concern.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o76"><a name="90514-0007.htm_para9"><a name="09051460000306">In conclusion, I should say that for the past 25 years the conflict has inflicted dreadful damage on Sri Lanka and its citizens. The fighting now has to stop and the lives of civilians have to be safeguarded. There can be no military solution to the conflict; lasting peace can come about only through an inclusive process that takes fully into account the legitimate aspirations of all communities in Sri Lanka&#151;Sinhalese, Tamils and Muslims. How the conflict ends will have a direct bearing on the prospects for longer-term peace in the country. The Sri Lankan Government must win the peace as well as the war, and that will be the continuing focus of this Government&#146;s activity, together with international partners, in the coming days and weeks.</p>

 This is the latest in a series of debates in the House about the worsening situation in Sri Lanka. I say straight away that what the Minister said about the fate of the refugees in the so-called no-fire zone beggars imagination. That so many people should be attempting to live in such a small area&#151;let alone under fire&#151;is absolutely horrific. We should bear that in mind.</p>

 All hon. Members must be responsible for their individual thoughts; I certainly do not support what was said at all. I say with great respect to the hon. Lady that, on the whole, there is amazing consensus on both sides of the House on this issue. Now is not the time to raise such issues; I have made the Conservative Front-Bench position perfectly clear in all the debates. Indeed, in a few minutes I shall comment on what has happened in respect of the demonstration.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o78"><a name="90514-0007.htm_para11"><a name="09051460000311">Since we last debated this issue, the situation has got demonstrably worse for civilians in the no-fire zone. The Sri Lankan Government had made a commitment not to use heavy weapons, but the recent bombardment of the last hospital appears to show that that commitment has been breached.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o79"><a name="90514-0007.htm_para12"><a name="09051460000312">As I am sure that hon. Members will recognise, the use of heavy weapons includes close air support, artillery and mortars. In a battle zone, the use of high-velocity firearms&#151;self-loading rifles and pistols&#151;is bad enough, let alone artillery fire. I press the Minister to say what independent evidence there is to place in front of the Sri Lankan Government, who appear to be in denial. I recognise that in a war zone, as this is, it is possible to make mistakes; we have seen that on occasions involving NATO forces in Afghanistan. However, I think that most people believe that this was a clear breach by the Sri Lankan Government, who should be told that not only the military commanders but the political leaders may well be held to account, as they should be, in the international court of opinion and, indeed, international law.</p>

 It is not only morally wrong, but stupid. If one has surrounded an area, there is a fair chance that if one starts lobbing artillery shells around one will get overshooting and might kill and injure some of one&#146;s own troops. Without being facetious, it is, as Talleyrand might have said, more than a crime&#151;it is a mistake. Sadly, it is one of many mistakes that the Sri Lankan Government have made.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o80"><a name="90514-0007.htm_para13"><a name="09051460000315">As the Minister said, in excess of 140,000 civilians are now in IDP camps. Although the conditions in those camps are not as bad as in some that hon. Members have visited in other parts of the world, such as Darfur, they are not good, and they are not open to proper international inspection or to the media. What evidence do the Government have as regards the accusation made by several people who have had access to the camps that the Sri Lankan Government are weeding out young Tamils, not only directly because they are thought to have been active on the military side, but because they are young men, and they have gone into a category that I can only call &#147;the disappeared&#148;? Are we any closer to being able to persuade the Sri Lankan Government to respond to the request by the United Nations, the UK Government and other Governments for greater access to the camps?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o81"><a name="90514-0007.htm_para14"><a name="09051460000316">On the demonstration in Parliament square by the British Tamil community, I would like to support the Minister&#146;s comments. I think, on the whole, that although they have inconvenienced large parts of London, they have been within the natural bounds of such demonstrations. Given that many of them have relatives who have been killed, injured or wounded, or are under threat of all three, there is a natural emotion there.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o82"><a name="90514-0007.htm_para15"><a name="09051460000317">Following the demonstrations, the debates that we have had in this House, and the formal requests made by the Government to the Sri Lankan Government, is there any evidence that the Sri Lankan Government have in any way moderated any of their policies? I said in our last debate, although I did not wish to be a Jonah, that I feared that they are not open to any persuasion at all. Indeed, I get the impression from colleagues who have recently returned from Sri Lanka that, if anything, they become even more intransigent in having these legitimate points put to them&#151;although that is not a reason for us not to do it. The House should recognise&#151;this is not to undermine the activities that have been undertaken&#151;that, sadly, there seems to be no evidence that the Sri Lankan Government are prepared to moderate their policies. I suspect that that is because they still believe that in a matter of days or weeks they will have gained a military victory over the LTTE. However, as the Minister and other hon. Members have said, they will win the narrow military war but lose the peace; this will rebound on them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o84"><a name="90514-0007.htm_para17"><a name="09051460000323">The Minister referred to the welcome news that, crab-like, the United Nations Security Council has moved from a position whereby several members were effectively saying that what was going on in Sri Lanka was an internal matter to a hardening up of that position. Do the Government intend to have any further discussions or conversations with individual members of the Security Council? On the question of whether we should put down a resolution, I accept that that is, again, a matter of judgment. On balance, I feel that if we were to put down a resolution knowing that it would be vetoed, that might look good in terms of publicising a negative view of one or other members of the Security Council. My view at this moment is that the Sri Lankan Government would regard that as a great plus and it would make them even more intransigent, but I accept that circumstances may change.</p>

Although all we can do in this House is debate the situation, we would still like to think that we are, in many respects, giving support to the people who have relatives out there suffering. I hope that the Sri Lankan Government will, little by little, recognise that they are isolated internationally and that, as a consequence of the latest United Nations resolution, they may be isolated even further.</p>

Member for Worcester (Mr. Foster), will feel free to answer this when he responds to the debate&#151;what pressure we are putting on China in particular. The more I have examined the matter, the more I have found that it is the Chinese who are the real block, although they were hiding behind the Russians earlier. The Chinese have a massive vested interest because, as I said in a previous debate, China is now the biggest donor of aid to Sri Lanka, and while India and western Governments have refused to sell weapons to the Colombo Government, it has been the Chinese who have been supplying those weapons.</p>

We have to find a way to make China listen and take its responsibilities, over and above its economic interests, rather more seriously. This is not about domestic politics in China. The Chinese Government get terribly worried when we mention Tibet, and one can debate whether it is right for them to be so sensitive about it, but at least we can understand why they might be.

I should like to know whether the British Government are exercising their influence, and getting the Americans to exercise theirs, on the Chinese Government. That is one thing that we need to focus on, because it could really unlock some doors.</p>

 Does my hon. Friend accept that whereas the Chinese might, for historic reasons, be concerned that by either abstaining or supporting a resolution they might be supporting the case for an independent Tamil homeland, and worry about the implications of that in China, there has actually always been a strong Tamil voice, including from the LTTE, that accepts that that is not the only and necessary option? At the moment, that is not the main issue. The main issue is getting the peace, the ceasefire and other things, and the Chinese and potentially Russia should at least see the merit of abstaining, even if they are not able to support a resolution.</p>

 I strongly agree with my hon. Friend, and we also need to go further within the European Union. It was good to hear in the Minister&#146;s opening remarks that the EU is going to discuss the matter in the next few days, and I hope that the Government will be pressing for trade sanctions on Sri Lanka. The idea that we should give the Sri Lankan Government preferential trade benefits at the moment beggars belief.</p>

We clearly need massive humanitarian assistance and support, but we also need to ensure that the message continues to be sent to the Sri Lankan Government that we are watching them. Not only must they act magnanimously to try to win the peace, and recognise Tamil rights and aspirations, but they need to keep the Tamil people around the island secure, including those living in Colombo. I fear that there could be repercussions on Tamil civilians living all over the island, but particularly in Colombo. The Sri Lankan Government must recognise that they need to keep all Tamil people safe throughout the island, and that they have to act responsibly as a democratic Government.</p>

 I suspect that there will be a lot of agreement in this debate&#151;virtual unanimity&#151;as there has been in earlier debates on this subject. I am one of quite a number of Members who have been accused of being supporters of the LTTE when we have spoken up in these debates. I hold no brief for the LTTE. I know that many Tamils regard them as freedom fighters, but I know something of their history and hold no brief for them. The Government of Sri Lanka need to understand that we are criticising them not because we are supporters of the LTTE but because what they are doing is totally and completely unacceptable from any Government.</p>

I am supporting people in my constituency who have friends and relatives about whom they are desperately worried. They are fearful about what has happened to them and cannot get in touch with them. They fear that they are trapped in Vanni, among the civilians who are still being shelled by the Sri Lankan army.</p>

It is no good trying to draw equivalence between the Government and the LTTE, because Governments have duties under international law and conventions.

<p><a name="stpa_o95"><a name="90514-0008.htm_para5"><a name="09051460000340">The key question is what we should do. It seems crystal clear that, as has been said this afternoon, the Government of Sri Lanka are simply not interested in a ceasefire at the moment. They believe that this is their opportunity to crush the LTTE once and for all. That is why they will not allow international observers and international organisations into the area. They believe that this is a war that they are about to win and that will be the end of the LTTE. The fact is, I do not believe that they can win this war.</p>

I am absolutely convinced that it will not mean the end of the problems, because nothing will solve them in the longer term except a political solution. That solution has to mean the recognition of the political and human rights of Tamil people in the whole of Sri Lanka. We must try to ensure that the people responsible for some of the criminal acts that have gone on and are still going on are brought to justice. I cannot see any move towards that at the moment within Sri Lanka.</p>

We must try to get a resolution through the UN. We should be considering suspension of Sri Lanka from the Commonwealth. We should make sure that Sri Lanka does not get money from the International Monetary Fund.</p>

 We have had numerous debates in the Chamber and in Westminster Hall on Sri Lanka. The Prime Minister has been deeply involved in the matter, the Foreign Secretary has paid visits to Sri Lanka and a recent delegation has just got back from there. The House is unanimous in its disgust at what the Sri Lankan Government are doing daily to innocent people. Although our words are worthy, they will not save one life among the relatives of my constituents and those of other Members. More people are dying every day.</p>

Sanctions must be taken against Sri Lanka so that it hears loud and clear that the world will not accept what it is doing to innocent people.</p>

They should not be given any money from the International Monetary Fund. They should know that the whole world is united in condemning what they are doing. There must be an immediate ceasefire now.

 It is always a pleasure to follow the hon. Member for Ilford, North (Mr. Scott). No Conservative Member has done more for the Tamil cause than him. I pay tribute to him not only for his speech and his work, but for clearly putting the shopping list to the Government: we should not give any more money from the IMF; ensure that we get a resolution before the Security Council insisting on a ceasefire; and call for suspension from the Commonwealth. I would go one stage further. Why are we even considering allowing Sri Lanka to host the next Commonwealth conference in 2011?

not take the next step. What is the point of the UN if we do not take effective action to stop what is happening? There is a ship off the coast of Sri Lanka with tons of food that should be delivered to innocent people who are dying and being killed by their own Government, who are committing genocide against their own people, and the world stands by and issues statements.

 My hon. Friend is absolutely right.

But speaking with one voice and condemning is not enough when genocide is being committed. I know that my hon. Friend the Minister had to read his speech. I know that he has put a lot of work into it. I know that it is probably very different from the speech that he was given originally and that he has added his own words, but it is not as we would like to hear it. We want more.</p>

The fact remains, however, that there is a Government who are not only committing genocide and arresting British journalists&#151;the Channel 4 reporters &#151;because they happen to be reporting truthfully from the war zone, but separating people from their families so that they may never see each other again and causing such despair.</p>

 I come to the debate with some trepidation because I am fresh to the topic. On the other hand, I was a member of the delegation led by the right hon. Member for Kilmarnock and Loudoun (Des Browne) which was in Sri Lanka last week. I hope to share with the House something of what we saw and heard.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o112"><a name="90514-0008.htm_para22"><a name="09051460000362">It is fair to say that the stance of the Sri Lankan Government can be described as aggressive defence. When we met the President, at one point in our engagement he indulged in what I can only describe as a hissy fit, saying, &#147;We&#146;re not a former colony.&#148; It was the usual response. Indeed, in response to the hon. Member for Buckingham (John Bercow) who quoted United Nations evidence, the President denounced the UN as infringing the sovereignty of Sri Lanka by trying to monitor and observe what was going on. He protested vigorously, as Ministers of the Sri Lankan Government are doing to this day, that no heavy artillery of any kind was being used within the war zone. If that is the case and that is the Sri Lankan Government&#146;s position, the best response is to allow international observers to see what is happening. If that does not happen, they can hardly be surprised if people draw the wrong conclusions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o113"><a name="90514-0008.htm_para23"><a name="09051460000363">We did not go to the war zone. Hardly anyone has tried to. It is a very dangerous place, and none of us knows what is going on or who is doing what. We do know, however, that tens of thousands of people are trapped there, clearly in a desperate situation, which everyone wants brought to an end as quickly as possible. Nevertheless, it is important to share some of the things that we did observe.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o114"><a name="90514-0008.htm_para24"><a name="09051460000364">It is interesting that the media were denied the access that we were given. That in itself is a problem for the Sri Lankan Government. Apart from myself and the right hon. Member for Kilmarnock and Loudoun, the delegation included the hon. Members for Buckingham, for Glasgow, Central (Mr. Sarwar) and for South Down (Mr. McGrady). We were flown into Vavuniya and taken to the two newest parts of the camps there, zone 2 and zone 3, I think. Zone 3 had not existed the week before we were there; it had been forest. The Sri Lankan army had cleared the forest, put in roads, shelters, water points and sanitation, and provided some clinics and food. That is an objective fact.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o115"><a name="90514-0008.htm_para25"><a name="09051460000365">There were problems because the food was not arriving at an even speed. There was pressure on water and sanitation. There were not enough medical supplies. As hon. Members have said, people were concerned about being separated from their families, not having access to them and not having information about them; they were fearful of what was happening to them. Clearly, we impressed on the Sri Lankan authorities the need to address those issues, again in good faith, if they were honestly claiming to deliver a safe environment before allowing people to return to their own areas.</p>

In response to direct questions, they said they had not left earlier because the LTTE had basically said, &#147;If you try to leave, you will be shot.&#148; They had evidence of people who had tried and who had been shot at. That is an objective fact.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o118"><a name="90514-0009.htm_para2"><a name="09051460000368">However, if that is the whole story, why not let the international community in, in the numbers that are necessary, to help to deliver the supplies that are not being fully provided? Why not give the media the opportunity that we had and let them in to see and hear those stories for themselves? That is the message to the Sri Lankan Government. They cannot issue denials and protestations while keeping the country closed and expect people not to believe the counter-argument. They have lost the propaganda war.

 Of course, that is exactly the question we asked. Some of the supplies had been getting in. The fundamental problem, and the Under-Secretary may be able to confirm this, was that the agencies&#151;the UN and others&#151;experienced bureaucratic delays affecting, for example, what trucks they could take in and the visa processes. As a result, a variety of equipment and expertise was poised to go in, but not getting there. It is not true to say that nothing was there, but it was not arriving fast enough and not on the scale that was needed. Of course, it was not open to international scrutiny, which is the merit of what needs to be concluded.</p>

 I am grateful for that intervention, because we asked that question. The local authorities conceded that several thousand people had been taken out of the camps to a nearby technical college where they were being screened and put through to rehabilitation. Apart from whatever that implies, the problem is that people were not given access or information about what was happening, which was causing more distress. To be honest, some people understood the motivations, but were not satisfied because they could not get in touch with others. One woman was in tears: she had a phone number but no access. The hon.

and bellicose denunciations of all and sundry who had dared to criticise them. They were extraordinarily rude, and inappropriately so, about the Foreign Secretary. They took umbrage at our raising critical evidence against them. For example, when I mentioned, during a meeting with the President, the UN&#146;s satellite photography, which appeared to repudiate the notion that they had stuck to their 12 February commitment not to deploy heavy weaponry, the President&#146;s response was both to complain bitterly about UN spying and to rant at me about adopting a neo-colonialist posture. The House will not be surprised to learn that I was not intimidated by the rant, or indeed impressed by it, but rant it nevertheless was, and it will not do.

We visited two zones of a camp called Menik Farm, which had been established only about a week earlier.

There was anecdotal evidence of a reasonable number of latrines and some evidence of a decent water supply, but much more needed to be done about sanitation.</p>

The position needs to be put on the record: the LTTE is a pretty poisonous force. But we were not there to stand up for the LTTE.

Sri Lanka. The idea that there can be a military victory&#151;that the LTTE can be wiped out and that the problem can be physically removed and that will be the end of the matter&#151;is nonsense on stilts, and the Government of Sri Lanka need to be clear about that.</p>

However, I say to those who have much more experience on this subject than I do that since we came back the situation has got worse: the killing has continued, civilians have suffered, and there have been indiscriminate attacks. Unless the Government of Sri Lanka very quickly and in short order recognise the scale of international anger and change their behaviour, it will be inevitable that the multilateral institutions on which we depend for civilisation will assert themselves to take the strongest possible action against the regime. It is in the regime&#146;s hands to behave properly or to face the consequences.</p>

 Like many other Members, I am here to voice the feelings of my Tamil constituents; a wave of anger, despair and almost desperation has swept over them. I have held constituency meetings, and hundreds of people have turned up. I have also received vast volumes of letters sharing examples of lost relatives, people butchered and maimed, and more now stranded on a beach and being shelled by the Sri Lankan Government. There is not a Tamil family in my constituency who have not been touched. Kandiah Mylvaganam, a friend of mine who has been pictured with me, went to Sri Lanka a few months ago to try to find a relative. He was hurt and became ill, but when he went to a medical station there were not sufficient drugs so he died&#151;he never came back. That highlights why there is such deep anger. No wonder so many people came to Parliament square; they felt no one was listening to them. I support them; I have been out there with many Members in absolute support of that demonstration. Now, however, the world has begun to listen, and the question on the lips of all of them is: &#147;Why can&#146;t you stop the killing?

As we have seen fairly recently, if we cannot get UN multinational action, we now take unilateral action. In the past, we have looked for coalitions of the willing to invade places. Well, why cannot we have a coalition of the willing for peace? Why do we not now bring together our partners and make a clear statement of offering to broker a peace deal and to give the Sri Lankan Government 48 hours?  <br>

The community has put its case more effectively than we ever could and those people have listened, but the action that it needs and that we call for has not been taken. As the hon.

Members from across the House. There ought to be an attempt by our Government to secure an agreement within the next few hours, or within the next day, for a coalition of countries to say to the Sri Lankan Government, &#147;Within one or two days we are going in with the relief, the aid, the food, the water and the medical aid. We are going to land and we challenge you to stop us.&#148; The international community cannot say that sovereignty takes precedence over international responsibility. We have passed that point, as the UN has accepted; the right to protect has been accepted. We have to say that we are going to implement that; we cannot wait for more diplomatic negotiations to take place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o150"><a name="90514-0010.htm_para5"><a name="09051460000412">My call to Ministers is to respond to that. Of course we can seek a resolution in the UN Security Council and we can ask the United Nations Committee on Human Rights to take action. My Liberal colleagues say that the international communities&#151;the Commonwealth, the EU and the UN&#151;are good because we are stronger together, but it is no good if being stronger together does not deliver any action. I ask that that now be taken. I ask that the Commonwealth take some action, because so far it has not done so and for those of us who believe in the Commonwealth, that is unsatisfactory.</p>

 The responsibility to protect is legally established and morally incontestable, so the Sri Lankan Government need to be clear about that. May I say to the hon. Gentleman in case this was not clear, although the point was made very powerfully by the hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington (John McDonnell), that allegations of war crimes, crimes against humanity or genocide must be investigated whenever? There can be no question of any amnesty for the Sri Lankan Government, at any time, from consideration of allegations of that kind.</p>

 I absolutely support that, and I ask the Minister to indicate in his winding-up speech that the Government have begun the work on investigating war crimes and are working with other partners&#151;I know that the US is active on this&#151;to ensure that the Sri Lankan Government know that that is happening so that those who are responsible are held to account.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o151"><a name="90514-0010.htm_para6"><a name="09051460000415">I wish to make only two further points, because we want everybody to contribute to this debate. The first follows some of the other requests that have been made. Another way of effectively making the point to the Sri Lankan Government is for the Governments of the other Commonwealth countries, other countries in the EU and the United States simultaneously to call in the high commission ambassadors and warn them that if there is not a stop to the Sri Lankan Government&#146;s military action, there will be a peaceful but immediate intervention. That concerted sign has to be given, because all the pleas have so far fallen on deaf ears.</p>

But this situation is a challenge to the effectiveness of our democracies and our democratic Governments, and so far, in the moment of the greatest need of any people from this country since I was elected 25 years or so ago, our democratic system has been found wanting. We have to do more if the effectiveness of our own democracy is not to be undermined and if we are not to let down people whose relatives are threatened with the prospect of not being alive tomorrow.</p>

 Since the previous debate in the House, things have got significantly worse in the conflict area in north-east Sri Lanka. There are about 120,000 people in a narrow strip of coastal land of only 3 sq km, and the shortage of food, water and medicine has got significantly worse, although thanks to the efforts of the Foreign Secretary and the Prime Minister&#146;s special envoy, my right hon. Friend the Member for Kilmarnock and Loudoun (Des Browne), some improvements were temporarily made. I thank them for their ongoing efforts to bring about a ceasefire and to get humanitarian aid to the Tamil civilians caught in this terrible conflict.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o153"><a name="90514-0010.htm_para8"><a name="09051460000418">It is also without doubt now clear, despite their denials, that the Sri Lankan Government forces are using heavy weapons to shell this small area. The reports of the past few days of hundreds of deaths and casualties in the makeshift hospitals in the conflict area are testament to the callous indifference of the Government of Sri Lanka to innocent civilian casualties. It is clear that the Sri Lankan Government armed forces do not have the capability to avoid civilian casualties or the moral will to stop killing innocent civilians. There must be an immediate and permanent ceasefire to stop this slaughter of innocent Tamil people. The Government of Sri Lanka must also be held to account for these war crimes, and there must be proper UN investigations into any alleged war crimes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o154"><a name="90514-0010.htm_para9"><a name="09051460000419">The International Red Cross is continuing to try to get food and medical supplies into the war zone by sea, but the continuing fighting has made that very difficult. Civilians are now starving and dying from untreated injuries, as my hon. Friend the Member for Hayes and Harlington (John McDonnell) has said. Any member of the Tamil community will give thousands of examples of relatives, brothers, sisters and friends dying because of the shortage of medical aid and food, so an immediate ceasefire to allow humanitarian aid into the conflict zone is vital.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o155"><a name="90514-0010.htm_para10"><a name="09051460000420">Reports from &#147;Channel 4 News&#148; about conditions for the 180,000 Tamil civilians in Sri Lankan Government internment camps are also very worrying. There have been reports of dead bodies left for days; sexual abuse; food, water and medical shortages; and families being split up. The Government of Sri Lanka must allow UN and international aid agencies into these camps. The Sri Lankan Government are now isolated, given their unwillingness to call a ceasefire and to allow international media into the conflict zone and the camps. I urge our Government to take the steps that other hon. Members have mentioned, because that is how we will win the confidence of the communities here and have the trust and the faith of the international communities.</p>

 I wish to make just three points. On Monday, having spent many hours, and after seven separate phone numbers had been given to me, I was able finally to make representations to try, with the UK Border Agency, to block the deportation of a young woman, whom I shall simply call Laksna, aged 21. She had been sexually assaulted by the Sri Lankan security forces and had come to this country seeking asylum, but she was facing deportation. I want to put on the record my gratitude to the Foreign Secretary and the Minister for Borders and Immigration for the way in which, after I had eventually discovered that despite those representations to block the deportation that woman had been taken to Heathrow and was about to be put on the plane&#151;that was in stark contrast to the assurances that I had been given by the UKBA&#151;they ensured that that young woman was sent back into detention in Yarl&#146;s Wood and was not deported. Can this Minister assure me that the country assessment that the UK has now made of Sri Lanka has been communicated to the Home Office and that no further deportations of Tamil asylum seekers will be allowed?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o156"><a name="90514-0010.htm_para11"><a name="09051460000422">The second point that I wish to make is that it is time that relatives of the members of the Sri Lankan regime were no longer deemed welcome in this country, whether they are here studying as students&#151;as immediate family of the President have been&#151;or in other ways. Diplomatic sanctions must now be imposed, and those people, including more distant relatives, should be told that they are not welcome in this country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o160"><a name="90514-0010.htm_para15"><a name="09051460000430">The likelihood of the current outbreak of swine flu developing into a full-blown pandemic remains high. According to the latest figures, there are now 6,497 confirmed cases across the world, including 2,446 in Mexico, 3,352 in the US and 389 in Canada. Every continent has confirmed cases and there have been 60 deaths in Mexico, three in the US, one in Canada and one in Costa Rica. There are currently 78 confirmed cases in the UK&#151;one in Northern Ireland, five in Scotland, 72 in England and none in Wales. There are cases in every region of England except Yorkshire and the Humber.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o161"><a name="90514-0010.htm_para16"><a name="09051460000431">While there are still many uncertainties about this virus, scientists are learning more every day, and their findings are informing the preparations of the World Health Organisation and Governments across the world. The Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies, chaired jointly by the chief scientific adviser, Professor John Beddington, and leading independent scientist Sir Gordon Duff, are gathering and assessing all the latest information available. This includes the work of researchers at Imperial college who have studied the evolution of the epidemic and whose findings were published earlier this week, and of course the Health Protection Agency, which has been to Mexico to study the virus in its place of origin.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o162"><a name="90514-0010.htm_para17"><a name="09051460000432">Early studies indicate that this virus has pandemic potential. However, it is still a novel virus and it is difficult to say anything concrete about its severity, not least because there are many local factors that have an influence&#151;availability of antivirals, the robustness of local health systems, standard of living and the prevalence of underlying health conditions. Currently, the virus appears to be milder than the most severe previous pandemics&#151;notably the pandemic of 1918. But flu viruses are prone to mutation&#151;it could become more virulent or it could lose strength over time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o164"><a name="90514-0010.htm_para19"><a name="09051460000436">We do not know enough about the virus yet. It is important to note that countries in the southern hemisphere are entering their flu season, which may mean that the disease gains a firmer global foothold during our summer period. Past flu pandemics in the UK have been light in the summer with an increase in cases in the winter. It is possible, therefore, that there will be a second wave of the virus in the autumn.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o165"><a name="90514-0010.htm_para20"><a name="09051460000437">We have yet to see sustained transmission within communities in the UK&#151;that is to say, a significant number of cases between people who have no obvious connection to each other. We have one so-called de novo case, where someone has developed the disease apparently without being exposed to any close contacts who have the virus. The containment strategy that we have adopted&#151;supplying antivirals as a preventive measure both to those who develop the disease and to their close contacts, and in certain circumstances closing schools, where disease can spread particularly rapidly&#151;is effective in that it is delaying the spread of the disease, and buying valuable time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o166"><a name="90514-0010.htm_para21"><a name="09051460000438">It is unlikely that we can prevent a more widespread outbreak indefinitely. But while the number of people developing this disease will certainly rise over the coming weeks, we do not expect to have to move from containment to mitigation for several weeks. None the less, everyone needs to be prepared for the next stage, in which the outbreak can no longer be contained and has spread more widely.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o167"><a name="90514-0010.htm_para22"><a name="09051460000439">There are three aspects that I want to touch on today. First, as I explained to the House in my statement a week ago, when the number of cases increases beyond a certain level, we will have to keep under review to what extent we supply antivirals prophylactically&#151;in the first instance supplying them only to immediate family and household members and, on a post-exposure basis, to health and social care workers, rather than to all contacts.</p>

<p><a name="st_o229"><a name="09051460000440"><a name="90514-0010.htm_spnew10"><a name="09051460000985"><b>Dr. Vincent Cable (Twickenham) (LD):</b>
 Has the Secretary of State considered the special case of cabin crew of airlines travelling to and from the highly affected regions? They operate in a very unhealthy environment, and the airlines, especially BA, will not at present participate in prophylactic schemes. Can he give us some guidance on that?</p>

 My understanding is that airlines are prepared to give their staff antivirals. They are part of the employer groups to which we talk all the time through the business advisory group on the pandemic. They tell us that they are seeking to do so post-exposure and if any of their cabin staff are symptomatic. There are good occupational health systems in place. If the hon. Gentleman believes that that is not the case with some airlines I would be grateful if he could let me know, so that we can talk to the people concerned.</p>

 On that point, the Secretary of State will recall that on 27 April, when he made his first statement on the issue, I asked about people who necessarily had to travel to infected areas.

 The hon. Gentleman&#146;s sense of the stage that we have reached is right. However, such a proposal might still be pertinent for Mexico, where there have been the most fatalities. I shall look into that. It has not been raised as an issue in the wider discussions that we have had with people who are in this situation, but I know that the hon. Gentleman has raised it before. It is a valid point.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o168"><a name="90514-0011.htm_para0"><a name="09051460000444">We would expect to move away from this containment phase to a mitigation phase only when it became apparent that there was sustained community transmission at a level that made containment futile.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o169"><a name="90514-0011.htm_para1"><a name="09051460000445">My second point is that there are steps that people should be taking now so that they are fully prepared for the next stage. The principal objective is to avoid those who are symptomatic spreading the illness further by continuing to move around the community. Everyone should think about identifying what we have termed as &#147;flu friends&#148;&#151;neighbours, friends or relatives who live nearby and who can pick up medication and food for those who develop the disease so that they can avoid leaving the house and spreading the virus further. We should also all be thinking about friends, neighbours and family members who live on their own, and how we can best help them should they fall ill. Primary care trusts are already identifying patients they know to be vulnerable and making sure that they have someone who can help them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o170"><a name="90514-0011.htm_para2"><a name="09051460000446">An essential element of the mitigation phase will be a system for ordering and distributing antivirals. As I explained in my statement last Thursday, the flu line will be ready in the autumn. It is a ground-breaking system and the first of its kind in the world. It will be able to assess people via either the internet or telephone, it will be able to co-ordinate the distribution of antivirals and it will be fully plugged in to local health services. It will have the capacity to cope with the huge surges in demand that are likely if the virus becomes more widespread. It will have been thoroughly tested so that staff, patients and the public can have full confidence in its efficacy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o171"><a name="90514-0011.htm_para3"><a name="09051460000447">If we need to move from containment to mitigation before the flu line is ready, we will need to have arrangements in place that enable those who develop the disease to get treatment as quickly and effectively as possible without unnecessarily exposing more people to the virus. In addition, local health services will need to be able to respond to people&#146;s everyday health needs, as well as concentrating their efforts on providing specialist support to those who develop this strain of flu and are severely affected, and those who have underlying complications that make them particularly vulnerable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o172"><a name="90514-0011.htm_para4"><a name="09051460000448">The interim service that we expect to have ready shortly will consist of a phone service that the public can access through a single 0800 number, and a supporting website application. That will mean that people can have their symptoms assessed either over the phone or online. Those symptoms will be checked against an algorithm&#151;a list of the key symptoms and factors that determine whether the patient in question has been  <br>

 The Secretary of State says that the flu line might be available in the intended form in the autumn, but the deputy director of national influenza-pandemic preparedness told the Lords Select Committee on Science and Technology in March that it would be available in May. It is now May, and we have been told that it will not be available until the autumn. Will the Secretary of State explain?</p>

 I think that the director concerned would say that that was an over-optimistic assessment. It is a very complicated system. There was a need to ensure that it was tested thoroughly and that we did not bring it into use before it had been rigorously tested, although we could have done so in this particular pandemic. As I have said to the House before, I believe that it is best to have that system ready to come online in the autumn and to have something available. We might not need it until the autumn&#151;we might not move to a mitigation phase by that time or be at the level of mitigation that would mean that such a distribution system would be necessary. I am confident that once the flu line is up and running it will do what it says on the tin, and will do everything that we have planned for it to do.</p>

The best protection we can offer people is vaccination, because by giving people some form of immunity to the virus, even at a low level, we would achieve a significant reduction in the severity of any pandemic and, in particular, in the number of deaths or serious complications. We are now much closer to obtaining a vaccine. British scientists working for the Health Protection Agency in Colindale have already identified the genetic fingerprint of the virus. The National Institute for Biological Standards and Control in Potters Bar has now taken that isolate and is developing it into a vaccine strain.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o175"><a name="90514-0011.htm_para7"><a name="09051460000453">It is a long journey from identifying the virus to making a vaccine available. It is our intention to acquire sufficient stocks to vaccinate the entire UK population. We have advance purchase agreements with manufacturers that will be activated if the World Health Organisation moves to phase 6&#151;that is, if it declares a pandemic. We are still at phase 5 at the moment. However, we have always known that it might take four to six months before a matching vaccine becomes available, and more than a year before it can be manufactured in sufficient quantities for the entire population, given that international demand will be high.</p>

unique sort of influenza, but can he give some indication of whether the four to six-month delay to which he refers might be overtaken by events? When we move to a phase 6 pandemic, we need to ensure that we have gone through this phase in such a way that we will be able to mitigate at the earliest opportunity.</p>

 I cannot give any indication of that. Phase 5 means that a pandemic is imminent&#151;it does not mean that it is inevitable. There is no historical precedent for how long we are likely to stay at phase 5. The WHO meets in Geneva at the weekend and it might decide then to move to phase 6. My feeling is that it will not and that it will be a little while yet. Nevertheless, I believe that we will get to phase 6, but I cannot give any indication of the timing.</p>

 Will the Secretary of State clarify whether the delay is caused by scientists all around the world going flat out to devise a vaccine, or perhaps it lies in the production of the vaccine once it has been designed, because it takes so long when we use an egg-based system? Are there new systems that mean that once we get the vaccine and manufacturers allocate capacity to it&#151;if that is the decision&#151;it will be available, at least for the countries that buy it?</p>

 It is a mixture of the last two points. It takes a long time to produce the vaccine. We have one contract for an egg-based vaccine and another for a cell-based vaccine with Baxter. Getting the virus is a labour-intensive system. It is not like the identification; that bit has been done, but the next bit is what takes a long time. Manufacturers need to obtain sufficient quantities to manufacture, and the manufacturing then takes a long time. Given that countries in every part of the world are entitled to a proportion of the vaccine&#151;our advance purchase agreement is good, and other countries have advanced purchase agreements, too&#151;it would be wrong for 100 per cent. of it to be coming to the UK while people were dying in other countries.</p>

Some of the commentary that I have heard has mixed up our saying that we will not begin to have this vaccine ready for four, five or six months with a belief that it will be ready for 100 per cent. of the population within that time scale. Our national framework always set a period of between 60 and 79 weeks for completion of the process for 100 per cent. of the population, but we are currently in negotiation with manufacturers to see whether we can obtain early supplies at this pre-pandemic phase. We hope that that will enable us to vaccinate front-line health and social care staff and vulnerable groups who prove particularly susceptible to infection, before a predicted second wave hits.</p>

 On a related point, I know that masks have been ordered for NHS staff, but are there any plans to distribute them more widely? What impact do they have?

 We have discussed face masks before, and we are ordering 226 million surgical face masks that are coated and have a protector, as well as 34 million respirators. They are for front-line NHS and adult social care staff, not for the general public. As we have said before, the WHO and all the relevant experts have made it clear that it is fairly futile for people simply to put a strip of cloth over their mouths; indeed, that may even be counterproductive, because it can cause people to believe that other safeguards need not apply.</p>

 The Secretary of State said that 226 million face masks had been ordered, but when and how will they be supplied? Does the Department have some stockpiled? The normal use is 31 million a year, so there is a big difference between the target and what we have. Secondly, the Department&#146;s guidance on face masks made it clear that there is no evidence that they do much good when used by the general public&#151;but the exception to that involved infected people who are shedding the virus. The guidance suggested that they should wear a mask if they have to leave home, because that would reduce the risk of other people being infected by the virus that they emit.</p>

 We do have stock from some suppliers, and the first supplies are due to go to the NHS this weekend. The company manufacturing the product has done extremely well, and we are expecting something like 20 million masks to be available every month.

we are at phase 6, we have an opportunity to make some progress before the pandemic takes hold. We are exploring how much we can produce in that period, and other countries will be doing the same. It seemed sensible to us to see what we can do, rather just waiting to activate the APAs. It is by no means certain that we will be successful, but it seems the proper thing to do, and I shall say a little more about that in a second.</p>

The immunologists, virologists and epidemiologists who advise the chief scientist and the Health Protection Agency are very clear on this point. Even on their most pessimistic estimates&#151;that is, if the vaccine were to give only a low level of protection&#151;that would significantly dampen the virus&#146;s severity and its ability to spread, and reduce the possibility of people developing complications.</p>

 I fully support the Secretary of State&#146;s basing his decisions on scientific advice. The Phillips report showed how important such advice is, but does the right hon. Gentleman accept that, in a few aspects of vaccination policy, there will also be questions of judgment that go beyond scientific advice on the ethics? One such question&#151;about jumping the queue&#151;has been raised already, but others involve exactly who gets the vaccine first, and how we deal with supplies in the private sector. Although the answers to those questions can be informed by Government policy to an extent, I hope that he will accept that the wider House beyond the Front-Bench teams should be engaged, as well as civil society. We need to have those debates now, before the vaccines become necessary and the arguments rage, because that gives us a better chance of achieving consensus.</p>

 I have no problem with such ethical debates taking place. When a pandemic is declared, the whole system and all the manufacturing capacity must in effect be put at the service of the WHO, because that is how we can ensure a proper spread of vaccine.

We can keep people informed and enable them to protect themselves and their families. Finally, we can be thankful for our NHS and the people who work in it and with it.

 May I first thank the Secretary of the State for Health and the Government for responding positively to our suggestion that we have a debate? Hopefully, it is not premature; we entirely understand all the uncertainties that remain. In truth, it is less than a month since the circulation of the virus was first identified to the World Health Organisation, so there will be uncertainties about the nature of the virus, its characteristics, how it affects humans and what we should do about it. However, it is a good time to consider how we should approach the issue, particularly with regard to vaccines, not least because the strategy is beginning to take shape. I agree with the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon (Dr. Harris), who was in the Chamber earlier, that it is also a good time to discuss prioritisation, use of resources and the ethical issues that might emerge from that if there were to be a substantial spread of the virus in the months ahead.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o185"><a name="90514-0011.htm_para17"><a name="09051460000476">May I echo what the Secretary of State said about our thanks to the NHS? I thank not only NHS staff generally but, through him, those working in the Department of Health and the Health Protection Agency. In particular, the staff in pathology laboratories in heath protection units across the country have literally worked 24/7 on very large numbers of suspected cases. I know that we are dealing with 72 confirmed cases, but they have now dealt with perhaps tens of thousands of suspected cases, and pushing those cases very rapidly through the system has been a tremendous burden on them.</p>

 I know that a lot of the technical staff in the NHS who work for pathology labs have, in the past, felt a little under-appreciated, in terms of pay and conditions. Given that they are doing an excellent job, it might in future be worth reflecting on the fact that when a doctor decides to do a test, it is actually somebody in a pathology lab who carries it out.</p>

In 1918, of course, there was an initial, relatively mild spread, in which no very large proportion of the population was affected. About three months later, there was a severe impact, with large numbers of cases and a very high fatality rate. In early 1919, there was a third wave. The assumption is that, somehow, it must happen like that.</p>

Administration at the time developed a vaccine, but in the expectation that the virus would recur in a second wave, in the way it had done in 1918, they vaccinated the whole population, which, as it turned out, was an error; they should not have done so. There were significant side effects. There was not a second wave. Clearly, with the benefit of hindsight, it is clear that the proper public health response would have been to acquire the vaccine&#151;to stockpile it&#151;and then to see whether there was an intimation that a second wave was coming. I hope that the Secretary of State does not dissent from that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o188"><a name="90514-0012.htm_para1"><a name="09051460000481">That is not to say that we necessarily know what the strategy needs to be, but it is important that we do not make an assumption at this point about the future profile of the spread of the virus. For that matter, we do not know whether there will be sustained transmission in other countries. Clearly, from Mexico to America, between, it turns out, the middle of February to the middle of April, there were significant opportunities for the virus to spread from Mexico to America, which made it very difficult for the Americans to achieve containment. However, in many other countries, we are achieving containment. If we can continue to do so, we may find that we can delay phase 6 until we have made dramatic progress in the development of a vaccine. That is important to bear in mind.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o189"><a name="90514-0012.htm_para2"><a name="09051460000482">I confess that this is entirely speculative, but when one looks at the genetic make-up of the virus&#151;as I know will be done, not least in Mill Hill&#151;and compares it to viruses in the past, it is interesting to see that it emerged in north America, and that H1N1 in 1976 was, to some extent, related to the outbreak in 1918 in a very limited way. It is also interesting that in Mexico, the virus has impacted on younger adults. Arguably, it is possible that some older adults in Mexico had some vestigial immunity from exposure to it in 1976. It may or may not bear some genetic relationship to the H1N1 that circulated in 1976, but if it does, that would point to it being less likely to be virulent and severe than was originally feared when it first emerged.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o190"><a name="90514-0012.htm_para3"><a name="09051460000483">The Secretary of State and I share a view about how to respond to this matter. I score no points on this. The Opposition have raised issues with Ministers on 77 occasions since June 2004, and we have talked to Ministers repeatedly, including the Secretary of State&#146;s predecessors, about the importance of pandemic preparedness&#151;admittedly in the context of H5N1, which would be a major threat. Issues such as the antiviral stockpile, the stockpile of face masks, and the need for critical care capacity and for an advanced purchase contract have all been the subject of our questions to and responses from Ministers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o191"><a name="90514-0012.htm_para4"><a name="09051460000484">My only reservation about Britain&#146;s preparedness was that the extension of the antiviral stockpile could have been initiated sooner, rather than when H1N1 emerged in Mexico. Clearly there is the issue with the national flu line, which I asked the Secretary of State about, and the Government would have achieved that sooner had it been possible to do so. As for stockpiling face masks and gloves, the French bought 200 million, from recollection, in about the latter part of 2005, so there is a gap between what we were asking about and what has been achieved. None the less, we are among the best prepared countries in the world, and I will return to what that might mean in terms of our obligations in relation to other countries.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o192"><a name="90514-0012.htm_para5"><a name="09051460000485">I want to raise about half a dozen points, both to express a view and to see whether the Minister can add anything beyond what the Secretary of State has already said when she replies. The Secretary of State knows the Opposition&#146;s view on vaccine availability, because he has kindly involved us in conversations about it from time to time. By way of a brief detour, I should say we must not get this out of proportion. The Imperial college modelling talked about a central estimate of a 30 per cent. clinical attack rate, and a 0.4 per cent. fatality rate, but that was on a global basis. The virus may spread to a quarter or more of the British population in the longer term, but we have good reasons at the moment&#151;not least because in America there have been just three fatalities compared with more than 3,000 confirmed cases&#151;to hope that the fatality rate in this regard in a developed health economy will be low, and barely more than for seasonal flu. That being the case, it does not suggest that it is in the interests of a country such as Britain for seasonal flu vaccine production to be diverted at this point to pandemic flu vaccine production. Our view, which I expressed to the Secretary of State earlier in the week, is that we would certainly support the continuation of seasonal flu vaccine production, not least because we are probably only about two months away from the point at which, in a normal process, availability its would have been achieved. That gives us the basis on which we could move on towards pandemic vaccine production immediately.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o193"><a name="90514-0012.htm_para6"><a name="09051460000486">We would support the securing of an additional supply of a vaccine for the novel H1N1 virus on a pre-pandemic basis in parallel with seasonal flu vaccine production if that is possible, as the Secretary of State says. If the seed strain is available in a matter of days, we may infer that, probably by the end of September, supplies of a vaccine would, if necessary, begin to become available for health care workers and others who are most likely to be at risk. The chances are that any second wave would be initiated by an event such as the return of children to school&#151;schools tend to be the so-called super-spreaders and the virus tends to spread faster among young people, meaning that it could be transmitted through the population.</p>

 In recent years, there has been a lot of emphasis on GP surgeries writing to people on their lists to ask that they be vaccinated from ordinary flu.

The period between now and then gives us the opportunity to learn far more about the nature of H1N1 and whom it is likely to impact.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o194"><a name="90514-0012.htm_para7"><a name="09051460000489">It is important to remember that we may be dealing with very different kinds of flu. Obviously, seasonal flu tends to have an impact particularly on older people, which is why they are summoned for seasonal flu vaccination, but H1N1 has an impact on younger adults,  <br>

so by late autumn we may be dealing with different vaccination programmes with different population groups being targeted as priorities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o195"><a name="90514-0012.htm_para8"><a name="09051460000490">To be absolutely clear about the use of the antiviral stockpile, I think we agree that for the time being, we are devoted to containment, which requires post-exposure prophylaxis, meaning that everyone who is known to have come into contact with the virus should get the antivirals. We should sustain that for as long as we know that containment stands a chance of success. However, it is important for the public to know something about the trigger for shifting from a strategy of containment to one of mitigation. For example, when we reach 200 cases of seasonal flu per 100,000 population in a week&#151;that is on the Royal College of General Practitioners flu line&#151;we say that the virus is circulating in the community. Are we talking about a similar or a lower number of cases in relation to the novel H1N1 virus? Are we talking about the point at which significant numbers of people are confirmed as having the virus but we cannot identify how they contracted it? What sort of volumes are we talking about? What are the triggers to shift from containment to mitigation?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o196"><a name="90514-0012.htm_para9"><a name="09051460000491">Once we are in mitigation, I cannot see, given what we know about our access to antivirals now and for the rest of the year, why we should not sustain a policy of household prophylaxis to support families by reducing the impact, and post-exposure prophylaxis for health and social care workers to keep them at work. That will not stop people getting flu, but it may well mean that large numbers of people find they are affected very little. They can then be vaccinated which, in the long run, will reduce the number of people who have to be hospitalised or, indeed, the numbers who die.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o198"><a name="90514-0012.htm_para11"><a name="09051460000492">The Secretary of State did not talk about school closures, but I should like to inquire whether the Government wish to have a debate on the matter. The Americans have moved quite quickly from a policy of closing a school at the point when a case is confirmed in the school to a policy of not closing schools but carrying on, because the economic detriment is greater than the benefit to be derived from school closure and the virus is now assumed to be circulating generally in the population in America. Those are difficult judgments, because one is balancing, on the one hand, the pace of spread of a virus with a health impact on the population against, on the other, the economic, educational and other impacts of maintaining a policy of school closures. The Americans have chosen the path of stopping automatic school closures quite quickly. Clearly, in our present circumstances, it is right for us to implement school closures where cases are confirmed. The Government&#146;s contingency plan does not contemplate moving away from a closure policy, but given the American experience and the nature of the virus, is it not time for us to think about and discuss such a move?</p>

assumption is that if we were experiencing a pandemic involving a virus with very severe effects, it would be possible for local education authorities to take a general decision, which clearly they would do based on advice from the chief medical officer and the Government. However, I do not think that we are contemplating anything of that nature; at present, the decisions are made by schools. I do not anticipate head teachers, where they have a confirmed case and where the health protection unit is pursuing a containment strategy, would do anything other than close the school, for at least a week and perhaps, it could be argued, for a little longer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o199"><a name="90514-0012.htm_para12"><a name="09051460000497">I should be grateful for further opportunities to discuss the policy and what the modelling might tell us about the benefits and costs of a different strategy on school closures. The original scientific modelling of a pandemic suggests that a school closure strategy with prophylaxis would have a significant benefit, but of course that modelling related to a virus that probably had more severe effects than the one we are dealing with now.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o200"><a name="90514-0012.htm_para13"><a name="09051460000498">We have not previously raised this in detail with Ministers, because it seemed premature to do so, but given what the Imperial college modelling suggests about the impact of the virus, I think it is appropriate to do so now. The Americans have a 5 per cent. hospitalisation rate, so although they are handling the virus successfully, not all victims are staying at home. Our critical care capacity compared with that in other countries is therefore an important matter for us. I hope that the Minister of State will be able to tell us what measures the Government have taken to support additional critical care capacity&#151;for example, ensuring additional ventilators are available.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o201"><a name="90514-0012.htm_para14"><a name="09051460000499">The latest data on adult critical care services in a number of the most developed health economies are found in the Society of Critical Care Medicine&#146;s 2008 study. It sets out the number of adult intensive beds per 100,000 people&#151;that is the relative measure. France has 9.3 per 100,000, Canada 13.5, the Netherlands 8.4, Spain 8.2 and the United Kingdom 3.5. The House will note the apparent substantial disparity in the availability of critical care capacity in this country and in many other countries.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o202"><a name="90514-0012.htm_para15"><a name="09051460000500">Anyone who has visited critical care units recently will know that they are generally full. The ethical and prioritisation impacts of a pandemic are therefore likely be encountered rather faster in this country than in many others. Fairly quickly, we will have to turn beds that would otherwise be occupied by elective patients into beds where there is some degree of high-dependency support for patients suffering the complications of flu, because we do not have spare capacity in our critical care units.</p>

The Secretary of State will know that the Department for International Development has made additional money available to support the relevant UN unit and &#163;5 million in special support to the World Health Organisation.

critical resources, particularly antiviral stockpiles and vaccines, when&#151;later in the year, perhaps&#151;we know that we are relatively secure against the impact of the virus while other countries may be anything but, having neither antivirals nor vaccines, poor surveillance and limited health care resources?</p>

 I shall briefly raise some constituency concerns about the issue. I must apologise, however, because I am supposed to be chairing another meeting so, although I shall try to return for the ministerial response, if I cannot, I look forward to reading <i> Hansard</i> or any correspondence that I receive.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o205"><a name="90514-0012.htm_para18"><a name="09051460000504">With Heathrow in my constituency, there is a particular concern about the vulnerability of its staff and the wider community. It is the largest airport in the country, so, naturally, it is potentially the country&#146;s largest entrance point for virus carriers. Concerns have been raised about cabin staff, but the issue goes wider than that, because anyone entering the country will come into contact with other passengers, cabin staff, immigration officers and staff in the wider terminal. Our concerns are that the infection could spread to the wider community and place demands on our local services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o206"><a name="90514-0012.htm_para19"><a name="09051460000505">I should welcome information, advice and assurances about the procedures that have been established to deal specifically with ports of entry. In particular, I should like assurances about the dissemination of information to staff, their training to spot the factors that they must consider regarding passengers, including the symptoms that passengers report, and the advice that staff relay to passengers about the actions that they should take. The issue is about ensuring that not just cabin staff, but a wide range of staff are properly informed and advised.</p>

There have been discussions about masks, but it is also important to bear in mind that, apart from health staff and others, staff at airports may need priority vaccination.</p>

The unit now comes under the Health Protection Agency, and the Government have allocated additional investment over the years, so I hope that we have resolved many of those past complaints. However, there have been some media reports about under-resourcing at the health unit at Heathrow. I would welcome assurances on that and on what discussions and consultations are taking place, particularly with staff at the unit, about the need for additional resources to cater for the virus.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o209"><a name="90514-0012.htm_para22"><a name="09051460000508">The other issue for me is that if a carrier infects members of staff at Heathrow, they will in turn infect the wider local community. I welcome assurances that the situation is to be specifically monitored in my area. If we find higher incidences of infection there, what resources will there be for the local primary care trust and, in particular, for Hillingdon hospital? Over the years, the hospital has played a vital role in responding to passengers&#146; health needs as those needs are identified at Heathrow; if a passenger becomes particularly ill, Hillingdon hospital will normally deal with them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o210"><a name="90514-0012.htm_para23"><a name="09051460000509">There might, however, be a wider incidence of infection among the local community as a result of Heathrow staff&#146;s vulnerability, so I would welcome information about what discussions have taken place with the primary care trust and Hillingdon hospital trust about planning for that situation and the additional resources required. The issue is not about raising fears and anxieties among the local community, but about reassuring airport workers that their concerns are being taken into account and that plans and consultations are taking place to ensure that they are properly protected.

dominating things, but because the prevalence and virulence of the flu has so far been slight. There is therefore a danger that we are lulled into a false sense of security and people start to say, &#147;What&#146;s all the fuss about? Hasn&#146;t there been an overreaction? People who have suffered from it have recovered very quickly.&#148; It is very important&#151;the Secretary of State made this clear, and I share his view&#151;that we maintain absolute focus on this, and get the message across to the public, in recognising that we do not know the implications or the extent to which the virulence will increase as the strain develops and potentially changes in character.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o214"><a name="90514-0013.htm_para1"><a name="09051460000514">I was struck by a recent BBC report about what is happening in the United States, which noted that there has been a significant increase in reported cases. The numbers have gone up by 600 since last Friday, and there have been 2,532 cases. As the Conservative spokesman said, the Americans are no longer closing schools because the disease is now recognised to be in the general community. The truth is, of course, that the American health system has no mechanism for controlling or monitoring the development of this epidemic. There are genuine concerns about its potentially spreading very rapidly from the US into Europe. Of course, the amount of travel between Europe and the US is vastly greater than that between Europe and Mexico, so we have to be prepared for a rapid advance.</p>

 Before we leave what the hon. Gentleman says about America on the record, I think, having been in the control room at the Department of Health and Human Services in Washington and discussed with people how they would respond to a pandemic, that the Americans have all the resources and legal powers that are necessary for surveillance and counter-measures to respond to a public health impact. We should not confuse the limitations of access to American medicine with limitations in the American response to public health demands.</p>

 I hear the hon.

A report that appeared in <i> The New York Times</i> a couple of days ago refers to a leading American infectious disease expert who has been in Mexico helping the Mexicans to tackle the swine flu outbreak and learning the lessons from that. It reports that many people who are suffering from the disease appear to be showing no symptoms of fever, which makes screening much more difficult and increases the difficulty of controlling it. I am not sure whether the Secretary of State and the authorities in this country are fully aware of what is being discovered in Mexico, but it is critical that we rapidly learn the lessons from that. According to the report, half those with the milder cases did not at any stage develop fever.</p>

The point is made in the article that there are implications for infection control, particularly in poorer countries, if diarrhoea is one of the symptoms that emerges from this strain. The advice that is reported is that stools should be tested for the presence of swine virus. When she winds up the debate, will the Minister of State say whether any such advice is coming across to the Health Protection Agency? There has been no reference so far to such testing, so has that been properly monitored?</p>

The Secretary of State mentioned one case in the UK of someone who has had a confirmed diagnosis but who has had no apparent contact with anyone who has suffered from the condition. Is a possible explanation that people carrying the virus may not be showing any symptoms? That would make control much more difficult. It is also reported that an unusual feature of the Mexican epidemic is that there are apparently five different influenza viruses circulating at the same time, making it much more difficult to plan and to judge how the swine flu virus will develop.</p>

 I note the hon. Gentleman&#146;s comment. BA has been making good money out of the situation, but BA staff have been anxious about whether they are being sufficiently protected. Professor John Oxford has expressed surprise that BA has not ensured that all cabin crew are given Tamiflu. He makes the point that toilets on board on aircraft are the focus for infection during a flight, because people sneeze, then visit the toilet, and the infection gets on to handles, taps and so on. In the Minister&#146;s closing remarks, will she confirm the specific advice being given by the Health Protection Agency to airlines to ensure that every step is taken to protect the health and safety of cabin crew and passengers on flights, particularly those flying between heavily infected areas and the UK?</p>

 The rate at which cabin air conditioning works is also an issue. When smoking was allowed on flights, the rate had to be very high, but it is turned down now that smoking is not allowed.

 The hon. Gentleman makes a good point. We all know that flights are a perfect breeding ground for infections, and it is important to take every step to ensure that all airlines meet the highest possible standards, and that they meet their duty of care to their staff and passengers. I have had reports that different airlines are responding differently, but the same high standards should apply to all airlines, so that all staff are protected.</p>

<a name="90514-0013.htm_brev0"><a name="09051460000697"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The publication of the &#145;Manual Flu Line Algorithm&#146; is regarded as crucial to ensure consistent messages and avoid postcode variation.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o224"><a name="90514-0013.htm_para11"><a name="09051460000530">Will the Minister also deal with that point?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o225"><a name="90514-0013.htm_para12"><a name="09051460000531">On Tamiflu, the BMA says:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o226"><a name="90514-0013.htm_para13"><a name="09051460000532">Will the Minister clarify the position on that? It also says that there is a need for clarity on distribution protocols. It would be helpful if we could hear from her on that point too.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o227"><a name="90514-0013.htm_para14"><a name="09051460000533">Last weekend, newspaper reports said that primary care trusts across the country had been making variable progress on implementing plans. The BMA complains that GPs in some areas have not been involved in the planning process locally. The reports suggested that the Department of Health was refusing to publish details of the state of preparedness of primary care trusts around the country. It seems to me that publication of where every PCT has got to would help to concentrate minds and ensure that the laggards get up to the state of preparedness of the best. I ask the Minister to consider publishing where every PCT around the country has got to in its plans on preparing for the pandemic.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o228"><a name="90514-0013.htm_para15"><a name="09051460000534">The hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire raised concern about critical care capacity. That has also been raised with me. I was told by the Royal College of General Practitioners that in the last two pandemics in this country, in 1957-58 and 1968-69, more people died of conditions other than flu. There was a higher excess mortality of people suffering from other conditions who were displaced from hospital by those who went there because of the flu pandemic. I suspect many people do not recognise that. It reinforces the absolute importance of having clear guidelines on prioritisation of cases for hospital treatment during a pandemic. The communication of those guidelines to the general public is critical. There will be many cases in which people are due to go into hospital&#151;they may well have a planned operation&#151;but are told that they cannot because the hospital is full as a result of the flu pandemic. That will cause a great deal of anxiety for many people. The communication of that prioritisation is vital.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o229"><a name="90514-0013.htm_para16"><a name="09051460000535">The briefing by the British Red Cross highlights the importance of the voluntary sector and the role that it can play in supporting statutory services in dealing with the challenge of a flu pandemic. It makes the point that it is essential that all volunteers who are participating in any way in support of statutory services get treated in the same way as staff to ensure that they are protected, given that they are giving their time voluntarily to help. The British Red Cross also makes the point that many volunteers will prepare to go overseas during a pandemic to help to make a difference in the real hot spots. It says that it is important that those people get access to medication speedily so that they are protected.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o230"><a name="90514-0013.htm_para17"><a name="09051460000536">I have appreciated the opportunity to raise these issues.

 I thank the Secretary of State for again updating the House on progress on this very serious matter. I am glad to note that when it comes to such matters the House can be constructive, we can make suggestions to the Government, and we can learn of preparations that I consider sensible. I think it is a case of &#147;so far so good&#148;, but as we know, it is still early days. I pay tribute, as others have done, to the staff of the national health service, who are working terribly hard, and to those who are working long hours in the pathology labs to deal with the crisis.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o231"><a name="90514-0013.htm_para18"><a name="09051460000538">I think that the national public information campaign is being run very well, and is having an impact. I presume that it will roll on in the coming weeks and months, and may be uprated if the profile of what is happening changes. It sends a very good message with regard to flu in general, and not least with regard to this very serious form of flu. However, I have a few concerns.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o232"><a name="90514-0013.htm_para19"><a name="09051460000539">It is easy for those who have bins in which to chuck paper handkerchiefs and somewhere to wash their hands, but if a pandemic does develop, we shall have to make an effort to provide better hand-washing facilities in public places. Perhaps the Minister could tell us whether it has been established that there are enough of the various soap products that people use to disinfect their hands as an alternative to ordinary hand washing. When I was at Euston station the other day I noticed that it costs 20p to go into the toilets, and I know that nowadays a number of other major rail centres charge people for using public facilities. I believe that that applies at Paddington station, for instance. I hope that the Government will consider allowing such charges to be waived in the short term if the situation deteriorates, so that people can have access to hand-washing facilities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o233"><a name="90514-0013.htm_para20"><a name="09051460000540">We have already had an exchange about masks, and I understand the medical advice about them, but I think that ordering a lot more and distributing them widely would be a sensible precaution. Many people work in the public services. If someone does not turn up for work because they are ill at home, a police officer or local authority representative, for example, may have to ring the front doorbell and go in to see them. It is true that in the short term, the sight of people wearing masks on the tube will not do a great deal for the tourist trade. However, notwithstanding what was said by the Secretary of State, I think that if the pandemic becomes much more widespread, seeing people walking around wearing masks would be a good way of reminding others that there is a crisis, and that they need to take the sensible advice being issued and use a paper handkerchief, &#147;bin it&#148;, wash their hands, and generally conduct themselves very carefully.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o234"><a name="90514-0013.htm_para21"><a name="09051460000541">I have a few more questions for the Minister. So far, the scientific information is that the genetic make-up of the flu virus does not seem to be quite as virulent in north America&#151;or, indeed, here&#151;as it is in Mexico. Is that related to diet, or to the general health levels in the population? We know that a number of drugs are available on the internet, such as Tamiflu and Relenza. If people do not take prescribed drugs but obtain them from the internet so that they are used more widely, there is a risk that a resistant strain of the virus will develop. Have the Government any plans to try to restrict online provision?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o235"><a name="90514-0013.htm_para22"><a name="09051460000542">Last week a useful leaflet about flu from the primary care trust was delivered in Bournemouth and Poole. We have heard a little about the swine flu information line; is there a plan for its capacity to be increased if the number of cases multiplies? As we have heard, in the event of a relatively rare occurrence it may be possible to get through on the line, but if thousands of people suddenly become infected, more phone lines and volunteers will be needed so that the service can be expanded rapidly rather than crashing. I welcome what the Secretary of State said about going online and setting up a website.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o236"><a name="90514-0013.htm_para23"><a name="09051460000543">I would like the Minister who responds to the debate to say a little more about the role of the national director of pandemic influenza preparedness. What meetings have taken place, and how is it envisaged that the role will unfold if a crisis develops?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o237"><a name="90514-0013.htm_para24"><a name="09051460000544">On the flu line, there is a difference between people phoning up about symptoms and decision makers trying to get sensible advice. In earlier exchanges, we talked about who was responsible for making decisions about whether to close a school, a place of work or a particular institution. I presume that the primary care trust would be the body to which people would refer at the local level. This is an interesting issue, however, because public health decisions will have to be made at various levels, and I wonder what the hierarchy of decision makers is. I presume that at the top will be the national director of pandemic influenza preparedness, or Richmond house, but what will be the local decision-making hierarchy in, for instance, Dorset&#151;or around Heathrow, as we have heard about the special risks that that area of London faces? Who will be in charge? We must ensure that people make proper and informed decisions at all levels, so we do not get panic, but rather a response that is measured, proportionate and sensible.</p>

<p><a name="st_o263"><a name="09051460000545"><a name="90514-0013.htm_spnew7"><a name="09051460001019"><b>Mr. John Gummer (Suffolk, Coastal) (Con):</b>
 I too would like the Minister to elaborate on that. We in Suffolk have an extremely good operation for dealing with crises, and I would like to know how that local hierarchy will fit into this situation. In the past&#151;for example, when we have had to deal with animal diseases&#151;it has been hugely successful. I think the Minister will know that the Department congratulated Suffolk on what we did in the last epidemic, and we had to congratulate the Minister concerned for keeping us in touch. I wonder whether the same system will operate.</p>

<p><a name="st_o264"><a name="09051460000546"><a name="90514-0013.htm_spnew8"><a name="09051460001020"><b>Mr. Syms:</b>
 That is a good point. I wonder whether there ought to be a chart setting out who is on top of the hierarchy and who takes decisions at various different stages. That would be particularly useful for Members, who could put it up on their wall, and there might also be relevant phone numbers for their area, so if a situation developed we would know who to talk to and who to refer people to. I suspect that if the swine flu emergency line has difficulties and PCTs are overwhelmed, people will phone up Members asking for their advice. It would be useful, therefore, if the Minister were to say a little more at the end of the debate about what we can have in our offices for our staff, so that we know who to go to, and to whom to refer people in our area if a situation develops.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o238"><a name="90514-0013.htm_para25"><a name="09051460000547">We must wait and see how the situation develops. History teaches us that these events can get very bad&#151;I am thinking about the events of 1918&#151;and it is best to take the precautionary approach and to plan for the worst. I am pleased with the preparations that the Secretary of State for Health has taken so far, and I hope that we will get a little more information from the Minister at the conclusion of the debate. Let us keep our fingers crossed and hope that this is not as bad as some people think it will be.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o239"><a name="90514-0014.htm_para0"><a name="09051460000549">Perhaps unsurprisingly, I shall refer to Scotland in my speech. Scotland was very much the focus at the start of this outbreak, as the first two confirmed cases in the UK were in Scotland. I join other Members in expressing appreciation to NHS staff for acting rapidly and wisely in admitting the couple concerned to Monklands hospital and isolating them there. That helped to protect those people&#151;although, fortunately, their symptoms were not serious&#151;and it also reassured the public that the matter was being taken seriously. It helped us across the UK to study that case and understand better what had happened and how it had happened, and issues such as contacts.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o240"><a name="90514-0014.htm_para1"><a name="09051460000550">It is worth noting in passing that Monklands hospital had previously been earmarked for closure, and one of the many good decisions of the current Scottish Government was to keep it open. I particularly wish to mention the way in which the Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing, Nicola Sturgeon, has been leading in the Scottish Government on this matter.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o241"><a name="90514-0014.htm_para2"><a name="09051460000551">Reference has been made to the booklet that has been widely distributed. One of the advantages of having two houses is that one gets two leaflets. As far as I can tell, the one distributed to my Glasgow flat some time ago is exactly the same as the one that I received last night in Lambeth&#151;except that the Scottish paper seems to be of a slightly higher quality. This raises the question of whether we have a guarantee that all these good-quality leaflets have been distributed. I only got mine in Lambeth last night, and as that seems a little late I wonder whether everybody else has got one. I did think that they were sensitively produced, given that they detail what the UK Governments&#151;rather than just the UK Government&#151;have done; again, full marks to the NHS and the Department of Health.</p>

 I hope that the hon.

I do not think that we should imply or make any asides to suggest that that is not happening.</p>

 I thank the Minister for her intervention, and I agree with her. Indeed, the main point of my remarks is about the good relationship on this issue between the Governments of Scotland and the UK. Our respective countries are working extremely well on this matter, and I hope that that can be extended to other matters. We are all&#151;those on the Government side and ourselves&#151; committed to the NHS, although there are some differences in how we view the way ahead for it. For example, I believe that the approach of &#147;no private GP practices&#148; in Scotland is fundamental to the future of the NHS, whereas a different view has been taken in England.</p>

and Shotts (John Reid) asked about the relationship between Ministers in the two Governments and I asked about the relationship between the officials. We were both given very positive answers, and all that I have become aware of since then shows that that continues to be the case. For example, I understand that antibiotics are being procured by the Department of Health for the whole of the UK, and that as Scotland has a stockpile of some 9 million face masks, which is probably more than it needs at the moment, it has offered 1.45 million of those to England to help its supplies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o244"><a name="90514-0014.htm_para5"><a name="09051460000556">I reckon that this is one of the many situations in which the Scottish and UK Governments seem to be working well together, and that is the way we want things to be. We do not want constant bickering, people picking fights or people putting party before country. The more responsibility the Scottish Parliament is given and the less dependent we are financially on Westminster handouts, the more likely it is that our two countries can have a mature and grown-up relationship. Of course England is the larger country and it is likely to have more experts on many subjects, be it health or whatever, but that does not prevent us from respecting each other as neighbours and working together on issues such as swine flu, which clearly is no respecter of international boundaries. Perhaps one of the good things that can come out of this episode is a good and strong relationship between our countries&#146; respective health services. I very much hope that other Departments in the London Government will follow the lead of the Secretary of State for Health.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o245"><a name="90514-0014.htm_para6"><a name="09051460000557">One area in which England has been ahead of Scotland is in closing schools when there is an outbreak. I understand that the experience is that very early precautionary closure, such as occurred in Paignton, has been instrumental in disrupting the further spread of the virus. The topic has already been raised, and perhaps the Minister could confirm whether the advice continues to be that schools should be closed for seven days, whether there is some other optimum time, or whether we have to examine each case individually.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o246"><a name="90514-0014.htm_para7"><a name="09051460000558">I also understand that Health Ministers are working together to secure and purchase early supplies of vaccine. That sounds encouraging, and I hope that we will be kept updated when negotiations with manufacturers are concluded. As we are talking about vaccines, I understand that our Cabinet Secretary this morning pointed out that if a pandemic is declared, global demand for a vaccine will outstrip the capacity to supply it. That point has also been made in this debate. There may be a danger in countries such as the UK and US squabbling over vaccines, but perhaps the more serious danger is that poorer countries will be left without adequate supplies. Maybe if we ourselves struggle with a shortage of resources to combat flu, it will test our resolve to help countries less fortunate than ourselves. I would be grateful for reassurance on that point from the Minister.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o247"><a name="90514-0014.htm_para8"><a name="09051460000559">Finally, we have seen various reactions to this outbreak. The very word &#147;pandemic&#148; can be a problem. It sounds very dramatic and suggests that the outbreak is both widespread and serious. However, I understand it to mean that a disease is widespread, but is not necessarily serious. That understanding is gradually spreading. We could have what is technically a pandemic that is not serious in its effect.</p>

I accept that it is difficult for the WHO, and indeed all Governments, to get the balance right. The phrase &#147;crying wolf&#148; comes to mind, and the danger is that if something more serious comes along in a year or two, we will again call it a pandemic, but by that time no one will take us seriously.

 This is a subject on which I do not normally speak, but I have listened to the debate and, for once and perhaps uncharacteristically, I think that much of what the Government are doing is very good.

I have looked up why it is called swine flu and I shall cite the definition in a moment. The concern is that the market for pig products will be affected because of public fear. That is especially unfortunate at a time when the industry faces enormous pressures. We need to ensure that this risk to our people from the current outbreak is not another nail in the pig industry&#146;s coffin. We have an opportunity to demonstrate that joined-up government is not just something that we talk about, but something that can be delivered so that the people are safe.</p>

farms, of which there are about 1,400, and the rest on about 10,000 smallholdings. These pigs are well kept and not the dirty creatures that stories would make out. This is a modern and important industry, which is under pressure from red tape and bureaucracy, the outbreaks of foot and mouth disease in 2001 and 2007, and the loss of non-EU markets owing to exotic diseases. Like most industries, the pig industry is seeing increases in production costs, feed costs and fuel costs.</p>

Estimates from the British Pig Executive, BPEX, show that in 2007 farmers are paid about &#163;1.10 per kilogram even though it cost them &#163;1.44 to produce. That led to the &#147;Pigs are worth it!&#148; campaign, which I thought was extremely helpful and successful. We are always, of course, subject to competition from cheaper imports.</p>

The advice posted on the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs website states:</p>
<a name="90514-0014.htm_brev1"><a name="09051460000700"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;There is still considerable uncertainty as to the true situation in pigs in affected areas&#148;</p>

I hope that the Minister will have the opportunity in her closing comments to provide us with an update on this mission and when it is likely to publish its findings.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o257"><a name="90514-0014.htm_para18"><a name="09051460000570">I also wonder whether the Minister agrees that newspaper articles and internet blogs with headlines such as &#147;Swine flu: British pig industry leaders &#145;reckless and selfish&#146;&#148;, as put out by Animal Aid, and &#147;Swine flu: is intensive pig farming to blame?&#148;, as put out by a Member of the European Parliament, Caroline Lucas, in <i> The Guardian</i>, are not only potentially misleading to the public but extremely damaging to the pig industry? Farmers in this country take biosecurity seriously and take action to keep their animals safe from disease. They have the highest standards in the world. The Government could help to support pig farmers by reassuring the pig industry that they will send out positive messages about British pork. The current outbreak cannot be transmitted by eating pork products, according to the WHO and the Food Standards Agency.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o258"><a name="90514-0014.htm_para19"><a name="09051460000571">The WHO has decided to back away from labelling this outbreak &#147;swine flu&#148; and instead refers to it as H1N1. That is proper and clear. The virus has elements of swine, avian and human varieties and it is yet to be determined whether pigs have caused the outbreak or not. Joseph Domenech, the chief veterinary officer in the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation in Rome, has said:</p>
<a name="90514-0014.htm_brev2"><a name="09051460000701"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;It&#146;s not a swine influenza, it&#146;s a human influenza.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o260"><a name="90514-0014.htm_para21"><a name="09051460000573">In view of the potential damage to the pig industry that could be associated with negative perceptions of linking pigs to the outbreak, will the Minister consider referring to the flu by some other term, including in the information guide sent out to the public? Other names could include Mexican flu or H1N1, which is what I would prefer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o261"><a name="90514-0014.htm_para22"><a name="09051460000574">There can be a risk to pigs from humans. In Canada, a farm worker reportedly infected a herd of pigs with swine flu. In Afghanistan, the only pig has been quarantined. The contingency plan for exotic animal diseases published by DEFRA and last updated in December 2008 appears to make no mention of any variety of swine flu, despite there being cases of other swine-related influenza strains previously in the UK. Will modifications be made to the plan to cover further outbreaks, especially as the virus spreads to pigs? Will antivirals be available for workers on pig farms? Will a vaccine be developed for pigs? That is a question that I do not expect the Minister to answer today, but it is one that I shall leave for DEFRA. Will there be a mass cull of pigs, as happened in Egypt?</p>

Last year, UK airports handled about 235 million passengers. What efforts have been made to put together a list of countries where the risk of infection is higher? Does the Minister know how many carriers of this strain might be coming into the country?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o265"><a name="90514-0014.htm_para26"><a name="09051460000578">Current cases in the UK appear to be linked to those who have travelled to Mexico or had contact with people from north America. The first known case of infection here, on 26 April, involved Mr. and Mrs. Askham, who had been to Cancun on their honeymoon. It was reported that the authorities had no plans to trace the other passengers on the flight, as they were not classified as &#147;close contacts&#148;. However, a 12-year-old girl from Downend in south Gloucestershire was on the same flight as Mr. and Mrs. Askham, and she was diagnosed on 1 May.</p>

In that way, they can be tested and, if necessary, treated. We need to know how the virus got into this country, what risk it poses to the population, and what the Government are doing about it.</p>

I hope that the predicted level 6 pandemic does not arrive, but the Secretary of State&#146;s opening remarks were deeply worrying in that regard, as he made it clear that the disease is considerably more serious than had been thought.

 It is a great pleasure to follow my hon. Friend the Member for Leominster (Bill Wiggin). In his opening comments, he said he did not know much about this subject, but he showed that he is a great champion of the countryside, and of farmers in particular.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o271"><a name="90514-0014.htm_para32"><a name="09051460000585">I want to ask some important questions arising from recent discussions with my local primary care trust, and I hope that the Minister will deal with them in her closing remarks. The questions are important, as swine flu has arrived in Berkshire: one case was reported in Slough and there is also a suspected case in Wokingham.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o272"><a name="90514-0014.htm_para33"><a name="09051460000586">I was rather surprised to hear a so-called expert argue on the radio that we should allow the current milder form of the virus to spread widely through the population, as that would allow people to build up resistance to the more virulent strain that may arrive in the autumn. Will the Minister comment on that view? Does she believe it is a suitable response, and what are her own expert advisers telling her?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o273"><a name="90514-0014.htm_para34"><a name="09051460000587">As I said, I have had discussions with my local PCT and have reviewed its pandemic plan, which I have with me this afternoon. I would like to congratulate the staff of the PCT on putting together a comprehensive and very welcome plan, but I am concerned about several issues.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o274"><a name="90514-0014.htm_para35"><a name="09051460000588">First, I am not convinced that the out-of-hours GP service will be robust enough to handle the scale of a pandemic. Many areas of the country, and parts of Berkshire, have their challenges and problems with the out-of-hours service. I just hope that my local PCT will re-check the robustness of local out-of-hours GP services to ensure that those services can cope with all the circumstances that might arise. If they cannot, what contingency plans will the PCT have in place?</p>

 My hon. Friend makes an important point. I have personal experience of the failures of out-of-hours services. When my daughter was ill on a Sunday in Herefordshire, there was no GP available for anybody in Ledbury, where we live, despite its having two GP surgeries, so we had to travel all the way to Hereford, where there was a Primecare centre, bang next door to an accident and emergency department. It totally defeats the point of having doctors spread through the community if people all end up in the county hospital at the same time. The Government have spent so much money on doctors and the health service, so I do not know why care does not reach the people who need it the most. That is perplexing. I wonder whether my hon. Friend agrees.</p>

 My hon. Friend makes an excellent point. The out-of-hours service is particularly fragmented in countryside areas such as the one he represents. I think we would find general agreement across the House that there are significant problems.</p>

am worried that robust plans may not exist for those closed communities. I would welcome the Minister&#146;s comments on whether there are any national plans, and on what advice on best practice has been given to local PCTs. Obviously, we are talking not just about prisons, but about places such as residential homes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o276"><a name="90514-0015.htm_para1"><a name="09051460000592">Finally, my PCT&#146;s local plan does not allow for prophylaxis for family members, and I believe that that is a mistake. If we are to limit and subdue the spread of the illness, such prophylaxis is particularly necessary. I understand that national guidance is moving us towards prophylaxis for family members and those in close contact with people who have the illness. Would the Minister like to comment on the advice being given to local PCTs, so that their plans might be updated in the light of that? I expressed my view to my local PCT in no uncertain terms: I told it that I think the omission is a weakness in its local plan. Having made those few comments, I look forward to the Minister&#146;s response.</p>

 Looking at the clock, it seems that the Minister of State, the right hon. Member for Bristol, South (Dawn Primarolo), and I have about an hour each in which to speak, but with the permission of the House, I will not go over much of what has already been discussed this afternoon. It has been an excellent debate, and I hope in good faith that the Minister will understand that there are questions that need to be asked on various issues, with regard to the situation both in the UK and abroad. Bearing that in mind, I hope that she accepts that the questions are asked in good faith. Front Benchers on both sides of the House have worked closely together. I know that the shadow Secretary of State, my hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley), who is sitting beside me, is grateful for the briefings that the Secretary of State has given the Front Benchers throughout the past four weeks.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o277"><a name="90514-0015.htm_para2"><a name="09051460000594">It is only four weeks since we first knew of the state of swine flu&#151;I will call it that for the moment, but I will come on to the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Leominster (Bill Wiggin) shortly. The debate&#146;s title is &#147;Swine Flu&#148;, but I agree that it should not be, and there are reasons why it should not. Sadly, in the past four weeks, there have been difficult articles in the press across the country that have, at times, genuinely frightened people. I pay tribute to the <i> Evening Standard</i>, which realised that it had got things wrong; the Secretary of State mentioned the matter earlier. It advertised extensively to address the mistakes that it had made. I know that the <i> Evening Standard</i> is a large newspaper, but I wish that some of the national newspapers would address the fact that they got some of the coverage wrong. There was a degree of scaremongering.</p>

About 50 per cent. of the public think that the reaction of Her Majesty&#146;s Government and the NHS has been correct and proportionate, and about 50 per cent. think that there has been an overreaction.

media continue, the public will be more aware of the difficult situation that we are in, particularly in Britain where our responsibilities lie, but also elsewhere. It may be necessary to move to stage 6, the pandemic situation, and if we do, the pandemic flu plan structure will be the bedrock from which we go forward.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o279"><a name="90514-0015.htm_para4"><a name="09051460000596">Much of what has been proposed cannot be rigidly adhered to within the planning structure. For example, according to the pandemic flu planning documents, in the event of an outbreak in a school, that school would expect to be closed for three weeks. Most schools have decided to close for a week and assess the situation as it develops, and that is a sensible way to proceed. What we do not want is headmasters deciding to shut a school for three weeks when the situation is fine within 10 days.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o280"><a name="90514-0015.htm_para5"><a name="09051460000597">We have had an excellent debate, and many new points have been made, which shows that we are all on a steep learning curve as to the effect that this will have on our communities, whether we are on the Opposition Front Bench, in the Minister&#146;s Department, or on the Back Benches. The hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington (John McDonnell) has apologised to the House for leaving to chair a Committee, but he raised some important points on behalf of his constituents. Heathrow is smack-bang in the middle of his constituency, and he was very concerned about training not just for cabin crew&#151;a point also raised by the Liberal Democrats&#151;but for staff within the airport infrastructure, so that they know how they can help. <i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> I welcome the hon. Gentleman back to the Chamber.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o281"><a name="90514-0015.htm_para6"><a name="09051460000598">The hon. Member for North Norfolk (Norman Lamb) made some important points. Will the Minister tell us either when she replies or later in writing how the negotiations were taken up early on and why the national flu line is completely separate from NHS Direct and NHS Choices, the online information service. That may be because the NHS deals with about 6 million calls a year and we expect the national flu line at full on-stream capacity to be dealing with about 2 million a day. Such IT and telecommunications infrastructure will require a robustness and resilience that this country has never experienced before. I listened intently when the Secretary of State told us that we were piloting and testing, but there is no way that that infrastructure could be tested to that capacity, unless it went through a similar telecommunications system. Why has NHS Direct been asked to pick up the situation now&#151;it is doing a good job, but it is struggling&#151;yet it was excluded from the contract for the NHS emergency flu line?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o282"><a name="90514-0015.htm_para7"><a name="09051460000599">The hon. Gentleman also dealt with the assessment of people who think that they may have swine flu. Why are we not using our skilled pharmacists to asses whether patients have swine flu before giving them the drugs required. I know that my hon. Friend the shadow Secretary of State has taken that up with the Secretary of State. Those pharmacists are the biggest point of contact in our constituencies for medication and the plan is to distribute the drugs through them. For years, we have quite rightly been increasingly using the expertise of pharmacists to diagnose, take blood pressure, undertake blood tests and lots of other things, so it would seem to be logical to use them for diagnosis. Will the Minister respond to that point?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o283"><a name="90514-0015.htm_para8"><a name="09051460000600">I have been slightly confused in the past couple of days as to who is in charge of handling the pandemic situation. The people in charge of producing the   <br>

November 2007 document were Professor Lindsey Davies and Mr. Bruce Mann. The former is the national director of pandemic influenza preparedness in the Department of Health, but last week, the chief executive of the NHS&#151;completely out of the blue, because there is nothing within the document to indicate his involvement&#151;indicated that he had appointed a national flu resilience director, Mr. Ian Dalton. Will the Minister indicate what the roles of those two people are? Has Professor Davies&#146;s role changed, and what role has Mr. Ian Dalton taken up? Who is in charge and to whom do they report? There seems to have been an important change in the protocols.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o284"><a name="90514-0015.htm_para9"><a name="09051460000601">My hon. Friend the Member for Poole (Mr. Syms) raised many important issues, but hand washing is very important. We are conscious of the capacity of the influenza to spread. If we get to the pandemic stage, facilities for hand washing are absolutely imperative, especially where there are large congregations of the public, such as railway stations and airports. Hand-washing facilities therefore must be open to the public free at the point of use, which can happen at the flick of a switch. I am sure that the odd 20p that is lost to the people who operate those facilities is tiny in proportion to what we could lose.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o285"><a name="90514-0015.htm_para10"><a name="09051460000602">Another important question raised by my hon. Friends the Members for Poole and for Reading, East (Mr. Wilson) is what we do about closed institutions such as prisons, secure hospitals and, especially, barracks. We know from experience that such influenza viruses move very fast through closed institutions and we have heard absolutely nothing, as far as I am aware, about what we are planning to do&#151;that is not a criticism, but a genuine question. What are we planning to do about closed institutions? The Mount prison, which is on the edge of my constituency, has 640 inmates and most of the people who work there live in my constituency. If we go to a pandemic situation, we must have a strategic plan for those people. We have learned from experience, particularly of 1919, that flu flies through military barracks once inside.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o286"><a name="90514-0015.htm_para11"><a name="09051460000603">The Secretary of State said quite a lot about the purchase of face masks&#151;specialist face masks that can restrict the virus getting through rather than the sorts of things we saw on the streets of Mexico City. I have tried to find out from different organisations, especially in the NHS supply chain, about gloves. Within the pandemic flu protocols, disposable gloves are crucial in containing influenza, yet we do not seem to know how many have been purchased or how many are out there. It would be useful to know exactly what is happening.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o287"><a name="90514-0015.htm_para12"><a name="09051460000604">The other question asked by my hon. Friend the Member for Poole is this: what happens if and when we move to the next level? Page 55 of the flu pandemic document shows that we should go to a gold command structure. The structure is quite complicated, but it is understandable. The civil contingencies committee is at the head of the structure, but who chairs that committee? I have experienced gold command in my constituency. The police tend to chair gold commands, but who will chair that committee?</p>

 My hon. Friend is absolutely right to raise that important point. Smack-bang in the model set out in the document is the local resilience forum and strategic co-ordination group. I do not expect everyone to read the document, but it does explain the arrangements. The next step in preparing for the next stage&#151;stage 6&#151;is ensuring that we in our constituency offices and, more important, our communities as a whole have the information needed on what to do next; it should not be left to gossip. We will be able to work with our constituents, local councillors and others to make that sort of information is available. In addition, local authority call centres need to know whom they should pass calls on to.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o288"><a name="90514-0015.htm_para13"><a name="09051460000607">I fully understand the point my hon. Friend the Member for Leominster made about pigs. We should stand up in this place and the Minister should say from the Dispatch Box that there is no danger from eating pork: as long as it is cooked correctly, pork makes wonderful eating. I agree with my hon. Friend when he says surely this strain of flu could have been given another name. In fact, it has&#151;we do not need to call it swine flu. The World Health Organisation calls it influenza H1N1&#151;that is the official title. It should not be called Mexican flu, either. As I was told a few minutes ago, the so-called Spanish flu of 1919 appeared in America. I think that people can understand its official title&#151;it is in the papers often enough&#151;and we should wean ourselves off calling it swine flu, because that has had a detrimental effect on pork sales here and in other countries. I know that we have no influence on decisions by other countries, such as Egypt, to slaughter their pigs, but, to be frank, what a waste that is of good stock.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o289"><a name="90514-0015.htm_para14"><a name="09051460000608">My hon. Friend the Member for Reading, East talked about the quality of out-of-hours GP services. That topic was raised at Health questions this week and it is regularly discussed by Back Benchers and Front Benchers. The truth is that our GPs are the best people to commission the out-of-hours care that our constituents deserve, because they have the empathy, understanding and knowledge needed. In fact, the situation is a complete mess, with a postcode lottery for out-of-hours services. At a time of crisis, the last thing we need is confusion in such services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o290"><a name="90514-0015.htm_para15"><a name="09051460000609">My final point is on third world or less economically developed countries. It is possible that some such countries will suffer a pandemic outbreak and we will not. It is imperative that, with our European friends and the WHO, we have in place a structure or plan whereby we do not stockpile a vaccine here when we have not and are not likely to move to stage 6, and leave other countries to suffer because they cannot obtain supplies. Although I fully understand that we have a sleeping contract and will, we hope, get the vaccine within the next few months, if other countries, particularly third-world countries, suffer a pandemic and we do not, we will have to examine our conscience and decide how to help those countries in their hour of need.</p>

or watching the debate that all hon. Members, regardless of party, are focused on making sure that we have in place the best measures to protect our citizens, should that become necessary.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o292"><a name="90514-0015.htm_para17"><a name="09051460000611">The challenges that swine flu poses in this country are real and considerable. Before I go any further, however, I should pick up on the point that the hon. Member for Leominster (Bill Wiggin) made about its name. If he turns to the leaflet that was sent out, he will see that it clearly states:</p>
<a name="90514-0015.htm_brev0"><a name="09051460000704"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;There is no evidence of this...disease circulating in pigs in the UK&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o293"><a name="90514-0015.htm_para18"><a name="09051460000612">and that scientists are investigating the origin. Linked to that, the hon. Gentleman referred to the statements that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and the chief veterinary officer made about the safety of consuming pig products in this country, and I agree with everything that the hon. Member for Hemel Hempstead (Mike Penning) said in his closing remarks about the safe consumption of pig products.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o294"><a name="90514-0015.htm_para19"><a name="09051460000613">However, I must say to both hon. Gentlemen that, from tracking public recognition and measuring public awareness, we have found that the virus is clearly fixed in people&#146;s minds as being called swine flu. Indeed, recent information shows that 75 per cent. of people agree that the Government are very well or fairly well prepared, and that 80 per cent. are satisfied with the information available. I am sure that all of us agree that awareness, clear information and transparency are of great importance to the general public, so I caution the hon. Member for Hemel Hempstead and others that changing tack and calling the virus H1N1&#151;that snappy title&#151;or anything else may not necessarily help in the communication of information. Nevertheless, I absolutely take his point that language is important to ensure that people are properly informed, while not causing concern elsewhere or, as he rightly and understandably pointed out, detriment to others&#146; occupations, whether they are in the pig industry or anywhere else.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o295"><a name="90514-0015.htm_para20"><a name="09051460000614">Although scientists are making progress on charting the genetic fingerprint of the virus, understanding its characteristics and tentatively assessing its impacts, there is still a great deal that we do not know about the infection and how it will develop in the weeks and months ahead. That point crucially underpins the information that we make available, and, as the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley) said in his opening remarks, transparency and proportionate information are crucial.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o296"><a name="90514-0015.htm_para21"><a name="09051460000615">In the face of that uncertainty, it is imperative that we have the appropriate measures to protect the public and ensure continuity throughout the public services&#151;all points, indeed, that hon. Members have addressed themselves to today. We must ensure also that when the virus becomes more established in this country, if it does, we are properly prepared and, as the hon. Member for North Norfolk (Norman Lamb) said, hope for the best but prepare for the worst.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o297"><a name="90514-0015.htm_para22"><a name="09051460000616">My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Health made it clear that experts warn us to expect further increases in the number of cases in the short term, and we must brace ourselves for the strong likelihood of a serious pandemic in the next six to nine months. Fast, effective prophylaxis has so far helped to contain  <br>

the spread of the disease in this country. I join other Members in expressing thanks to the national health service staff, health protection officers and Department of Health officials who have worked tirelessly in this containment phase. We have yet to see sustained, community-based transmission, but I reiterate that we need everyone, including the general public, to continue to do their bit. Preparing for a wholesale pandemic is important; appropriate plans and measures must be in place so that we will be ready if the virus becomes more established. That means monitoring and assessing whether and when the current policy of using Tamiflu is becoming ineffective or counter-productive as the virus becomes endemic.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o298"><a name="90514-0015.htm_para23"><a name="09051460000617">In his opening remarks, the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire posed a number of questions, as did all the other Members who spoke. When I can, I shall do my best to answer them. There is the issue of antiviral stocks and of the triggers that will move us from our current containment phase to a mitigation phase. How do we judge when that will be, given that all the current evidence is that in this country the infection is very mild and that people respond well to Tamiflu and recover? I am still taking advice and having discussions with scientists, but at this stage there are two principles. The first should be in respect of sustained community transmission. Secondly, we should consider the severity of the disease and take scientific advice at the relevant point on whether we can still contain it and whether we need to move to the next stage. We are doing a lot of work on that so that we understand precisely when that shift may be made. As the hon. Gentleman rightly said, that issue is important in respect of the impact on the antiviral stockpile and of moving to household prophylaxis as a sensible strategy in that period.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o299"><a name="90514-0015.htm_para24"><a name="09051460000618">The hon. Gentleman also asked why our approach to school closures was different from that in the United States. He said that he thought that the US was now basing its considerations more on economic and educational outcomes than on the disease, and that might well have played a part in the decisions. The advice to us, however, is that the US is no longer in the containment phase; it has moved to the mitigation phase for reasons of geographical distribution and its ability to contain the viral infections. Given that, its attitude to school closures is different from ours.</p>

<p><a name="st_o275"><a name="09051460000619"><a name="90514-0015.htm_spnew3"><a name="09051460001031"><b>Mr. Lansley:</b>
 I am grateful to the right hon. Lady for giving way, but I was not asking about the difference between the position in America and that here. I entirely understand that the Americans decided that they could no longer contain the virus, which was circulating in the community; sustained community transmission was taking place. My question was different. Looking at the second principle, if we believed that there was sustained community transmission of the virus in this country, and if the virus was not severe, would we have begun the process of examining whether our advice would remain the same as that in the national contingency plan? The current advice is that a school closure should be triggered automatically when a case is confirmed. Alternatively, would we re-examine the issue? Clearly, the Americans have re-examined it and reached a different conclusion.</p>

be given and what action we should be taking if the outbreak remains mild. I am sure that the Secretary of State will want to continue to keep the hon. Gentleman and the hon. Member for North Norfolk apprised of those considerations as we move through them. This goes back to my earlier point about a better understanding of the nature of the virus and the extent of the illness that it causes here in the UK. It is about not only the current investigations into the production of a pandemic vaccine, should that be necessary, but informing the other strategies in the plan.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o300"><a name="90514-0015.htm_para25"><a name="09051460000621">The hon. Gentleman asked about critical care and ventilators. Trusts have been advised that they could double their critical care capacity for ventilated patients during a pandemic. The possibility of additional ventilators is being considered, including the question of whether all ventilators are being used. That will form part of the ongoing discussions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o301"><a name="90514-0015.htm_para26"><a name="09051460000622">The hon. Gentleman asked about support for other countries, as did the hon. Member for Hemel Hempstead, and referred to the money that has already been contributed by the Department for International Development. In addition, the World Health Organisation has a stockpile of drugs. The WHO meets this coming weekend and early next week, and those considerations will be very much on its agenda. We look forward to seeing exactly what type of measures will be necessary, and we have made it clear that we stand ready to make our contributions in exactly the areas that the hon. Gentleman mentioned.</p>

<p><a name="st_o277"><a name="09051460000623"><a name="90514-0015.htm_spnew5"><a name="09051460001033"><b>Mr. Lansley:</b>
 I welcome what the right hon. Lady says about our willingness to participate positively and constructively in the next few days in the discussions with the WHO. So that we do not convey any misleading impression, I should point out that its stockpile of antiviral drugs is probably no more than about 5 million doses, so its ability to satisfy potential demand in developing countries may be very limited.</p>

<p><a name="st_o278"><a name="09051460000624"><a name="90514-0015.htm_spnew6"><a name="09051460001034"><b>Dawn Primarolo:</b>
 The hon. Gentleman is right. However, he also knows that the WHO, the US authorities, the UK authorities and all the health authorities that are working on this are looking carefully at exactly what we are dealing with. The virus is being analysed to see what may happen&#151;particularly, as we track it through the southern hemisphere&#146;s flu season, what that may mean in terms of where a returning virus, whether mutated or not, goes next and what arrangements therefore need to be in place. These are absolutely the right questions for the hon. Gentleman and others to be asking. The Government are very alive to this. We completely appreciate the dual wishes of this House: first, that we protect our own citizens; and secondly, that in a world pandemic, we play our part, particularly with the poorer and developing countries that may not have access to the drugs that we have.</p>

He went on to ask several questions about the responsibilities of airlines to their staff, and about whether there is greater vulnerability among the communities around Heathrow. He has been able to return from his other duties, and I hope to address the points that he raised.</p>

passengers. It is simply not possible to model and undertake that, and when it has been attempted elsewhere it has been ineffective. What is going on is that, first, we are ensuring that passengers are provided with information and advice. Secondly, symptomatic passengers identified en route are seen by port staff. Thirdly, if necessary, contact tracing is undertaken with regard to passengers on particular flights and anyone else who may have come into contact with them, for the purpose of ensuring that those who need Tamiflu on a prophylactic basis have it provided.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o304"><a name="90514-0016.htm_para1"><a name="09051460000628">Airlines are responsible for their employees, and there are already actions that they are required to take. They have received, and continue to receive, advice through the Health Protection Agency, and particularly guidance about their employees. With several hundred returning travellers, identifying those with symptoms has been crucial. It is important to keep things in perspective by noting that to date, only 31 cases have been confirmed among those returning travellers. The surveillance and work being undertaken are clearly doing their job.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o305"><a name="90514-0016.htm_para2"><a name="09051460000629">On the wider considerations for the community, the question is whether there is sustained spread across the whole country, which would mean that we needed to move on from the containment phase. The primary care trusts and hospitals have plans for those circumstances. The hon. Member for Reading, East (Mr. Wilson) pointed out that he had had access to his local PCT&#146;s plan for a pandemic, and the responsibilities are the same for the PCT that covers the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Hayes and Harlington. If he feels that he has not received enough information or been given access to the PCT&#146;s plan as the hon. Member for Reading, East has, he can certainly write or speak to me and I will ensure that he has access to it. Local health authorities are making those plans, and that should be going on in my hon. Friend&#146;s local area, including at Hillingdon hospital in its role as the nearest hospital to Heathrow.</p>

 I have already examined, as my hon. Friend would expect, the surveillance expectations at all our points of entry, and particularly Heathrow as a busy airport. However, I am more than happy to assure him that I keep that matter under review. I shall certainly return to it and satisfy myself about the situation again. If he has any concerns or examples, I shall be grateful if he lets me know about them.</p>

We are keeping under review the advice given to travellers to Mexico.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o308"><a name="90514-0016.htm_para5"><a name="09051460000634">On antibiotics, I confirm that we are on track to have sufficient stocks to cover 31 per cent. of the population&#151;19.6 million courses by the end of September&#151;with the stockpile reaching over 10 per cent., which is 6.3 million courses, by the end of May.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o309"><a name="90514-0016.htm_para6"><a name="09051460000635">The hon. Member for Poole (Mr. Syms) asked various questions, some of which I have already answered. On face masks, no scientific evidence supports their general use, and such use is not part of the Government&#146;s strategy. Although television images from elsewhere in the world might convey an impression that such use should be made, there is no evidence for a general issue of such masks. As the Secretary of State said, the Government have increased our order to 226 million additional face masks and 34 million of the high-quality face masks.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o310"><a name="90514-0016.htm_para7"><a name="09051460000636">The hon. Gentleman and others asked about the role of the national director for NHS pandemic influenza preparedness. Let me be clear: this person&#146;s role is to strengthen lines of communication and implementation of policy with regard to any operations of the NHS flu plan, and anything necessitated by the pandemic. Professor Lindsey Davies, who has been mentioned, remains responsible for national pandemic preparedness&#151;but it is important to ensure that decisions are implemented promptly and smoothly across the NHS, and that information is available. The hon. Gentleman requested that more information be made available to Members of Parliament for their offices, should they be contacted. I am happy to consider that point, because it would be relatively easy to provide, over and above the information available to the general public, a simple guide for MPs&#146; constituency offices about where to direct concerned constituents.</p>

 I am grateful for the opportunity, somewhat earlier than anticipated, to speak yet again on behalf of the fishing communities of Hastings and Rye. I am sorry that it is necessary to raise the same issue, but the urgency of the message is not getting through. I shall try to leave no ambiguity as to the importance of responding to the cry for justice for the under 10-metre fleet in Hastings and Rye. The issue is that of quota.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o318"><a name="90514-0016.htm_para15"><a name="09051460000645">As we approach the Euro elections next month, I can well appreciate why there is hostility towards the European cause within the fishing communities. The price that Britain paid for joining the EU back in the 1970s was perhaps worth while in many respects, but in terms of fishing, it was a huge cost. That, of course, was under a Conservative Government, who have never been forgiven for what happened&#151;for the surrender to the European Community of the greater part of our fishing grounds. In return, the UK was allowed a relatively small proportion of quota, but even that gross unfairness is not the issue today. No major party is suggesting withdrawal from the EU, and thus we are stuck with the EU distribution to national governance of a negotiated share of the catch each year. It is then for national Governments to divide up that quota catch within the fishing industry, and it is that calculation that has brought the under 10-metre fleet to virtual extinction.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o319"><a name="90514-0016.htm_para16"><a name="09051460000646">I acknowledge that the under 10-metre fleet in particular may not be significant economically&#151;not to the nation, anyway&#151;in terms of the sector&#146;s direct contribution. However, it is often forgotten that the contribution that the sector makes to tourism and other onshore industries is significant. That is certainly the case in Hastings and Rye. The key issue is how we as a nation distribute the quota among the fishing industry. As I have brought to the Government&#146;s attention before, and it is well known, the division of 96 per cent. of total quota to the over 10-metre fleet, and just 3 per cent. to the under 10-metre fleet, is manifestly unfair. It has to change, and it needs to change soon.</p>

In March 2004, the Cabinet Office strategy unit prepared a report entitled &#147;Net Benefits&#148;, which stated that:</p>
<a name="90514-0016.htm_brev1"><a name="09051460000706"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;the overarching aim of fisheries management should be to maximise the return to the UK of sustainable use of fishery resources and protection of the marine environment.&#148;</p>

that despite our best efforts, DEFRA is immovable. Even the efforts of the Prime Minister of the day to move things on came to naught.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o324"><a name="90514-0016.htm_para21"><a name="09051460000651">I shall not bore the House by listing the debates, discussions and meetings that have taken place in the intervening period, but it seemed to me then, and seems to me still, that the Department is in the clutches of the big boys who run the producer organisations, and is incapable of breaking out of their control. It is frequently said that the allocation of quota is based on historical catches, but the fact is that the under-10 metre fleet, which is small&#151;indeed, it consists of the minnows of the industry&#151;is not just sustainable, but without significant catch records. As a result, the producer organisations take the cake, or rather the quota, and DEFRA stands by and ticks the boxes. That is certainly what appears to be happening.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o325"><a name="90514-0016.htm_para22"><a name="09051460000652">If the big boys&#151;the over 10-metre fleet&#151;employed significantly more personnel, there would be some understanding of the current position, but that is not the case. About 50 per cent. of the personnel of the United Kingdom fishing industry are employed in the over-10 metre sector, and the other 50 per cent. in the under-10 metre sector. So, where is the justice in the current arrangement? Those in the under-10 metre sector are not even permitted to form their own producer organisation in order to bid for their share of the quota.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o326"><a name="90514-0016.htm_para23"><a name="09051460000653">The Government seem to suggest that quota is based on historical calculations of catch that cannot be altered. Why? The quota that the UK receives belongs to the UK, not to the producer organisations or to any particular sector. If fairness so demands, it is for the Government to exercise their discretion without fear of producer organisations taking the huff. A doubling of the quota available to the under 10-metre sector would make little difference to the over 10-metre industry, but it would be a life-saving change for the under-10 metre fleet.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o327"><a name="90514-0016.htm_para24"><a name="09051460000654">My hon. Friend the Minister was the first person for a long time to acknowledge and understand the injustice, and I compliment him on that. Earlier in the year, a new division for allocation of cod quota was created in area 7D. That was a big step forward, and I do not think it too much to say that those in my local under-10 metre industry were elated about the possibility of a fair deal as a consequence. Quota is normally&#151;or so it is said&#151;distributed on the basis of the historical catch. In area 7D, which is the bit off the south coast between Hastings and Dover, the under-10 metre fleet accounts for 93 per cent. of the fishing vessels in the area and 83 per cent. of the fishermen employed. There was real hope that the new allocation would follow the established pattern.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o328"><a name="90514-0016.htm_para25"><a name="09051460000655">On 18 February, my hon. Friend the Minister wrote to the chief executives of the producer organisations and other interested parties, proposing that a quota of 109 tonnes&#151;live weight&#151;or 70 per cent. of the overall total should be allocated to the under 10-metre sector in area 7D. The proposed quota was apparently based on official records showing actual landings at that percentage. The under-10 metre fleet believed that its share was even greater, but it did not look a gift horse in the mouth. The allocation appeared to mean that its demands were being recognised for the first time, while also conforming to the historical basis of allocation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o329"><a name="90514-0016.htm_para26"><a name="09051460000656">While the 70:30 split was still minimal, the principle had been established, and my hon. Friend the Minister was held in high esteem as a result. What happened  <br>

then, however, was nothing short of an outrage. Officials talked again to the producer organisations and the policy was changed around completely: 70 per cent. was now to go to the south-west producer organisation, which only seldom fishes in the area, and 30 per cent. to the under 10-metre sector. I am told that the south-west producer organisation, which has that 70 per cent., for the main part sells it on. It is not even the local fishing industry. This is an outrage, and it is barmy. There is no explanation. What is going on?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o330"><a name="90514-0016.htm_para27"><a name="09051460000657">I am sorry to be so forceful to my friend the Minister, who I know really does work hard on this, but the forces of darkness are out there and they are defeating his best efforts. I am asking him to be bold and stand up for fairness and justice, given his acceptance of the argument. We do not need to go over the argument again, as he has accepted it; it is now just a matter of implementing it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o331"><a name="90514-0016.htm_para28"><a name="09051460000658">My friend the Minister is very thoughtful, and I know, by reason of his initial proposals, that he has the interests of the under 10-metre fleet at heart. He was good enough to hold a recent meeting with me and my hon. Friend the Member for South Thanet (Dr. Ladyman), who has a similar interest to me, at which he expressed, first, a clear desire that measures be put in place to ensure the continuity of the under-10 metre fleet&#151;that is to say, that it should have sufficient income to survive&#151;and, secondly, that he would want to enter into a dialogue with all the parties, including the producer organisation and the New Under Ten Fishermen&#146;s Association, which now represents the under-10 metre fleet, to ensure that the allocation of quota is more fairly distributed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o332"><a name="90514-0016.htm_para29"><a name="09051460000659">I know that my hon. Friend is wholly genuine in that desire. However, I have to tell him that that is what the then Prime Minister, Tony Blair, asked should happen some two and a half years ago, and I cannot share his optimism that further discussions will now make a difference. I fear that this will not be settled by negotiation. It will be settled by decisions being made along the lines of those that my hon. Friend the Minister earlier proposed. I say as loudly and clearly as I can that the Minister has the obligation to divvy up the quota fairly to allow my constituents to survive.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o333"><a name="90514-0016.htm_para30"><a name="09051460000660">I understand that my hon. Friend does not want to rock the boat&#151;the industry is dangerous enough already&#151;but the under 10-metre industry is not too worried about risking the wrath of the producer organisation and forgoing the crumbs from its table. Now this is not only an issue about survival&#151;although it is about that&#151;but one of justice. I am fairly sure that no court in the land will accept that the current arrangement is fair. Sadly, I think that opinion will be tested, because Paul Joy and his colleagues in NUTFA have now issued proceedings in the courts. That action will inevitably challenge the distribution unless a very early reversal of the recent decision is made.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o334"><a name="90514-0016.htm_para31"><a name="09051460000661">I challenge my friend the Minister to give an unequivocal answer as to the justification for the most recent decision of the 96 per cent:3 per cent. split and for the 70:30 split in area 7D in favour of half the total industry, when it was the established practice that that be determined on catch records. I know the answer to that question; I would not ask it if I did not. The answer is that it cannot be justified. There is no argument; there is no  <br>

 I welcome the opportunity to discuss this matter and congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Hastings and Rye (Michael Jabez Foster) on securing the debate. This is a timely juncture for discussion of the under 10-metre fleet for a number of reasons. I thank him not only for the courtesy he has shown me in his opening remarks, but for his forceful and passionate contribution and what he has done in his frequent formal and informal meetings with me in Parliament to act as an advocate on behalf of his constituents and the under 10-metre fleet as a whole. Without my being charming or disarming, I hope we will be able to reach some agreement on a way forward and what we need to do on quota reform.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o336"><a name="90514-0016.htm_para33"><a name="09051460000664">As my hon. Friend rightly says, the under 10-metre fleet is an economically, culturally and socially vital part of the life of the UK, in terms not only of coastal communities but the fabric of this island nation&#151;it really is. I have said before, and I will say it again, that I am utterly committed to seeing it not simply eke along but thrive and have a very long-term viable future. The question is how we get there. I understand exactly what he is saying. He is saying, &#147;Show us some certainty that you will step up to the mark and do it.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o337"><a name="90514-0016.htm_para34"><a name="09051460000665">I do not wish to go off on a tangent, but may I begin by discussing common fisheries policy reform, which my hon. Friend mentioned at the start of his contribution? That is a long game, as many things with the EU are, but we are now starting on it. I was the first of the 27 Ministers to address the recent Council, when I spoke boldly and radically for fundamental reform of a 30-year-old policy that is clearly not doing what it was intended to do. I put the following points then, which I shall re-put and work. Right at the heart of radical CFP reform we need to see that fisheries management is integrated with management and conservation of marine resources; that fishing of commercially exploited fish has to be within safe biological limits; that the policy has to ensure a prosperous and efficient fishing industry; that there is effective, targeted support for fishing-dependent communities; and that there is more regional and long-term management of fisheries and devolved responsibility. It is not right that we lurch from year to year in this annual process of bartering and negotiation that is surely not in the best interests of either fishermen or fish stocks. I say that in passing because our discussions of the under 10-metre fleet are integral to how we look at this reform as well.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o338"><a name="90514-0017.htm_para0"><a name="09051460000666">Let me discuss the issue that has brought us here today, which, as my hon. Friend rightly says, is the allocations, not least of 7D cod within the Hastings area. First, I shall outline some background. I know he  <br>

will be familiar with this because we have had discussions about it, but it is helpful to outline it. Before 2009, there had been one total allowable catch for area 7B-K cod. The commission agreed to split that TAC, giving a separate allowance for 7D cod in recognition of the different scientific assessment of the stock. This is one TAC, which has been split into two, and it therefore&#151;this is the important thing&#151;does not constitute a new fishery, a blank sheet and a clean start.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o339"><a name="90514-0017.htm_para1"><a name="09051460000667">However, let me elaborate on that a little. A 30 per cent. increase in the total allocation of cod for area 7D was negotiated at the EU December Council&#151;we were glad to do that&#151;and it was also secured for North sea cod. On that basis, the Marine and Fisheries Agency consulted the industry on the best way to allocate the new and split quotas in the UK, and my hon. Friend rightly says that it issued a proposal to use the track record of catch for 7D cod. I was pleased to see that proposal, which he rightly says was put forward to signal an opportunity. If it had been accepted, it would have meant that approximately 70 per cent. of the quota would go to the inshore fleet. I am not dancing on words, but let me say that this is probably where some of the misunderstanding has come from and where I went from hero to zero overnight. That was a deliberate proposal and I understand that the inshore fleet had an expectation that it could secure additional cod through it. However, good practice means that we then, on the basis of the proposal, go out to consult the industry&#151;the wide industry. He is right to say that that should include the producer organisations&#151;the big boys. Across that wide range of participants, the proposal was emphatically rejected by the industry at a meeting on 2 March, where the sector raised serious concerns about any move away from fixed quota allocations.</p>

 Does my hon. Friend agree that the principle of one person, one vote might be a better way of determining this? Producer organisations represent only 50 per cent. of the industry, but they seem to have about 90 per cent. of the vote. Should we not consider electoral reform?</p>

<p><a name="st_o284"><a name="09051460000669"><a name="90514-0017.htm_spnew1"><a name="09051460001040"><b>Huw Irranca-Davies:</b>
 My hon. Friend makes a good point that goes to the heart of the issue, but I do not think we need to look at electoral reform in terms of how those meetings are run. I hear the powerful voice of the under-10s on this matter. Indeed, that voice has become louder since that meeting and since we responded by returning to FQAs. I am very cognisant of that, not least because of the representations that my hon. Friend has made, and I shall point out how we can act on that. However, that does not mean that I will revisit that decision. There is an issue that we have to deal with promptly and in a considered way, because it is not only an issue for the Hastings fleet. Many in the under 10-metre fleet would regard it as a historical anomaly and there are arguments for and against that, but they see it as a genuine issue of justice. There is a way forward, and perhaps assurances could be given to that effect, including clear mechanisms and a timescale for achieving it. As a Fisheries Minister I have to represent everybody, but I appreciate the problem which the particular issue of the 7D cod has brought to the fore.</p>

fisheries income in the Hastings area. It is anticipated that the sole fishery will be maintained for 2009 and the MFA&#151;to its credit&#151;has worked hard to source sole, given the huge importance of that stock to the Hastings fleet. My instructions to the MFA are to continue to do all it can to maximise the quota available to the inshore fleet.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o341"><a name="90514-0017.htm_para3"><a name="09051460000671">One important issue is how we can use the current system to deliver benefits to the under 10-metre fleet around the UK, and its relationship with the producer organisations and the larger fleet. Only recently&#151;within the last few weeks&#151;I signed off on an agreed transfer of quota to fishermen in the north-west of significant benefit to the under 10-metre fleet. That was done through the MFA in agreement with the over-10s and the producer organisations. We have done the same recently in my hon. Friend&#146;s area and we will continue to look for every opportunity we can.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o342"><a name="90514-0017.htm_para4"><a name="09051460000672">When I walked out of the December fisheries negotiations, we were able to deliver a unique package under the Hague preference. I apologise to my hon. Friend because it did not benefit his fishermen, but it had a huge impact on the under 10-metre fleet in the north-east, which walked away with an additional 300 tonnes. It was the first time that an agreement had been reached with the over-10s to split the quota&#151;on a one-off basis&#151;that was invoked under the Hague preference at the December Council. It was split upfront, with half going to the under-10s, and that had a huge impact proportionally. We will continue to look for such deals.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o343"><a name="90514-0017.htm_para5"><a name="09051460000673">We think it important under the current system to maintain the ability to engage with the producer organisations and the over-10s to maximise opportunities at this moment.

 With regard to the implication of the Hague preference, which my hon. Friend has used in the north-east, as he said, it is obviously easier to get agreement if there is an extra cake to split up. Otherwise, there is no cake for anyone. Should he not be considering doing the same for the coastal strip in the south? Is it not the case that the catch is so low at the moment that the Hague preference would have a part to play in making a special case for them, too?</p>

 We tend to counter-invoke in response to an invocation of the Hague preference by our ministerial colleagues in Ireland, if they choose to do so. The preference can be invoked only on certain species and certain areas. We tend to counter-invoke in response and try to maximise the opportunities that are available. That opportunity simply was not there. If there was a way to do that, we would certainly consider it. If the opportunity came up in the future, we would not rule it out. I would want my hon. Friend to say that to the fishermen he represents, too.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o345"><a name="90514-0017.htm_para7"><a name="09051460000677">Let me say something about the way forward.

We have set up an advisory group to steer and support the work of the project, and I am delighted to announce the appointment of Alan Riddell as chair of the group. He brings significant experience of community regeneration, which is not a million miles away from what we are trying to do with this project. Sometimes&#151;I know my hon. Friend will agree&#151;fishermen are seen in isolation from the rest of what is going on, whereas they are actually integral to their communities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o347"><a name="90514-0017.htm_para9"><a name="09051460000679">Alan Riddell has experience of community regeneration through his former positions as director for local development and renewal for the Department for Communities and Local Government and, prior to that, setting up the East of England Development Agency.

<p><a name="stpa_o348"><a name="90514-0017.htm_para10"><a name="09051460000680">The advisory group will bring together expertise from both within and outside the fishing industry to develop new and innovative ideas&#151;I want to be bold and quite radical&#151;for achieving a genuinely sustainable inshore fishing industry. I look forward to working closely with Alan and the advisory group, receiving input from fellow Members of the House, on what I am convinced will be a worthwhile and rewarding project that will have a lasting impact on the English inshore fishing industry.</p>

I shall not deal with the detail of that, as I am sure there will be many other opportunities to do so. That process has been successful, as shown by the number of applications. Many of those who felt they were hard done by and appealed have been brought in on appeal. Those moves have been well received, even though they were controversial, and we see them as a building block rather than the end. I have consistently made that clear.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o350"><a name="90514-0017.htm_para12"><a name="09051460000682">It is now time to build on that firm foundation. As part of the SAIF project and other work that we have going on, we need to bolster our evidence on the environmental, economic and social impacts of the under 10-metre fleet, specifically focusing on that fleet, and to bring fresh thinking to these challenging issues. As part of that fresh thinking, we should map the way forward for quotas in a careful, considered and timely way. We must engage with the producer organisations and also recognise the widely held view among the under 10-metre fleet that there remains unfinished business. I have used that phrase before, but our work must achieve the agreement of all fishermen, and not be carried out in opposition to the views of some groups. Under the current system, members of the over 10-metre fleet have been willing to engage in quota swaps and so on, but the work that I have set out is the way forward.</p>

It will be most important, however, to fishermen and the communities in which they work, as they share our desire for a healthy and viable inshore fishing industry. Moreover, they want an industry that will last beyond the 12 months needed for the annual quota negotiations and instead continue for many years to come.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o352"><a name="90514-0017.htm_para14"><a name="09051460000684">We are faced with a choice. We can go ahead with considered, strategic and timely work to reform the inshore fleet that will include the SAIF project. The work on quota reform will be taken forward through the quadrilateral ministerial group that I and my counterparts from Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland&#151;that is, Richard Lochhead, Elin Jones and Michelle Gildernew&#151;announced yesterday. The group will look at quota reform and licensing throughout the UK, and one of our terms of reference is to look at vulnerable communities. Richard Lochhead has problems with his communities, as do I with mine, not least in respect of the under 10-metre fleet.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o353"><a name="90514-0017.htm_para15"><a name="09051460000685">We have not announced a timetable for our work, but we need to be realistic. We will have to come to a position on CFP reform to inform our discussions, so we are probably looking at taking 12, 13 or 14 months. However, we will discuss that so that we can set up an out-date or a milestone towards which we can work. I know that my fellow Ministers are as committed to that as I am.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o354"><a name="90514-0017.htm_para16"><a name="09051460000686">We announced the establishment of the ministerial group yesterday, and today we announced the chairmanship of the SAIF group. On top of all that, there is the environmentally responsible fishing scheme, which I believe will prove to be a notable success. It is already gearing up to play a constructive role in CFP reform.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o355"><a name="90514-0017.htm_para17"><a name="09051460000687">The scheme will run in under 10-metre fleets in six pilot areas in mixed fisheries around the coast. Instead of discarding fish, fishermen will land everything that they catch and sell it. We are examining the sustainability of that approach, and we will take the lessons that we learn to the European Commission because we believe that the scheme could offer a sensible way forward. It has already improved the economic viability of the fishermen taking part, and the early indications are that it is being done in a way that is extremely sustainable for the local fisheries environment.</p>

 I am glad that my hon. Friend understands the wickedness of discards, but will he say what the timetable for the scheme is? What prospect is there that it can be adopted more widely across the UK, and when could that happen?</p>

 We have not come to a firm conclusion about that yet, as we have not seen the results of the first trials, but I have begun discussing with my officials the possibility of expanding or extending the existing scheme. However, I ask my hon. Friend to bear it in mind that the aim of the pilot scheme being carried out with the agreement of the European Commission is to see whether the approach can work. As a result, there will not be a complete roll-out on the basis of the pilots, however we assess them, because they will not provide enough evidence. We have yet to come to a firm decision and we will need to do more,  <br>

but the pilot schemes do offer the possibility of a new approach. It is one that I am inclined to take further, once we have looked at all the evidence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o356"><a name="90514-0017.htm_para18"><a name="09051460000690">In conclusion, there is an issue to address. I understand the position of the New Under Ten Fishermen&#146;s Association, and its frustration, but I say to it clearly that we have a choice. We could spend our precious time and valuable resources on entering into litigation, without bringing about the long-term change that we want. That might, at least temporarily, stymie our shared aspiration for a strong and stable future for the under 10-metre fleet. However, my hon. Friend rightly laid down a challenge to step up to the big boys. By the way, there are big boys in the under 10-metre fleet, as well as in the over 10-metre fleet; there are big, powerful voices. I want to sit down with those people, not throw bricks at them. I think I have already shown, in my time as a Minister, that I am not afraid of taking tough decisions to achieve the right end. I am very willing to come down to Hastings promptly to meet fishermen there, together with my hon. Friend, to discuss the real challenges and the real ways forward. That is a genuine offer that I urge my hon. Friend to pass on to his constituents.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o357"><a name="90514-0017.htm_para19"><a name="09051460000691">I know that my hon. Friend will want to play a real, continuing leadership role on the issue on behalf of his constituents and the under 10-metre fleet in his area and across the UK. So do I. We share the ambition of ensuring the long-term viability of our fleets, large and small, in all parts of the UK. This has been a good, timely debate. I believe there is a way forward, but we need to confront the issues head-on. We need to get people to sit down together and take on the issues, and then try to find a way forward that gives the under 10-metre fleet certainty that we are serious about the issue. We should not simply harangue&#151;I am not accusing my hon. Friend of doing this&#151;the very stakeholders to whom we need to say, &#147;You will be part of the solution.&#148; We need to move forward on the issue; I recognise that. I am committed to doing so, and I hope that he will take those messages back to his constituents.</p>
