 (Con): If he will make a statement on the security situation in Iraq.  [27265]
</p>


<p><a name="st_0"><a name="51114-01_spmin0"><b>The Secretary of State for Defence  (John Reid): </b> 
 I first wish to congratulate the Iraqi people on the turnout of 64 per cent. in the referendum on 15 October, despite the terrorist threat. The successful security arrangements for the referendum were largely in the hands of the Iraqi army and police. We are continuing to build the capability of the Iraqi security forces so that they are increasingly able to take responsibility for delivering law and order themselves. Today, I will meet Vice-President Adel Abdul Mahdi to discuss those issues.
</p>





<p><a name="st_1"><a name="51114-01_spnew0"><b> Daniel Kawczynski: </b> 
 We heard radio reports over the weekend that our troops might come out of Iraq as soon as next year, but what specific benchmarks will the Secretary of State establish to ascertain whether Iraqi security forces can take over from our troops at the appropriate time?
</p>





<p><a name="st_2"><a name="51114-01_spnew1"><b> John Reid: </b> 
 We have made it plain that we will hand over to the Iraqi security forces when they are capable of defending the democracy that they are building against the terrorists. In order to make that assessment, a committee has been established under the Prime Minister of Iraq, and it has set out several criteria on which the assessments will be made. Those criteria include the current threat level, the situation posture of multinational forces and the capacity of local government to oversee the transition from multinational forces to Iraqi forces. It is my view&#151;and I have expressed it before&#151;that that process of handover will occur in different parts of Iraq at different times, and it could begin by the end of next year. That is why I was able to confirm the general framework of President Talabani&#039;s remarks.
</p>





<p><a name="st_3"><a name="51114-01_spnew2"><b> Jim Cousins  (Newcastle upon Tyne, Central)</b> 
 (Lab): I welcome the way in which my right hon. Friend has responded to President Talabani&#039;s initiative, but it clearly pointed to a withdrawal by the end of next year 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>14 Nov 2005 : Column 676</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>and my right hon. Friend has just said that it will begin by the end of next year. When the Iraqi security forces are in possession of heavy weapons&#151;mortars, artillery, tanks and so on&#151;is my right hon. Friend concerned that such material might fall into the hands of political militias that are active in the area?
</p>





<p><a name="st_4"><a name="51114-01_spnew3"><b> John Reid: </b> 
 I am afraid that my hon. Friend is wrong. President Talabani referred to an agreement by the end of next year on the withdrawal of forces. He talked of starting the process by the end of next year, so his words are consistent with what I have said previously. He also went out of his way to say&#151;and I want the House to know exactly what we are saying&#151;that that is not a commitment, but it is his estimate of when conditions for handover to the Iraqi forces might or could prevail. That is exactly what the Chief of the General Staff said yesterday and what I have said. In short, we are not saying that there will be an immediate withdrawal, which would&#151;in President Talabani&#039;s words&#151;be a catastrophe. We are not saying that there is an immutable timetable, nor are we saying that all our troops will be out of Iraq by the end of 2006. It is important that the House understands what I am saying, which is that, as we build up the Iraqi forces, the process of handover could start in some parts of Iraq&#151;including in our area&#151;by the end of 2006.
</p>





<p><a name="st_5"><a name="51114-01_spnew4"><b> Mr. Tobias Ellwood  (Bournemouth, East)</b> 
 (Con): If the British area of responsibility is deemed safe and ready for handover before that of the Americans, can the Secretary of State confirm that British troops will return before the Americans do?
</p>





<p><a name="st_6"><a name="51114-01_spnew5"><b> John Reid: </b> 
 The process of handover will be determined by conditions on the ground and if they are different in one area from another area, the handover will take place at a different pace. That is completely consistent with what we have said before. We have moved from a position in which we had very few trained and capable Iraqi troops to having more than 211,000 Iraqi security force members who are trained and capable. About half of them are army and they have started to participate in operations, but they are not yet capable of autonomously leading operations. In other words, they are reliant on the multinational forces, including ourselves, for first aid back-up, logistics, leadership, intelligence and other things. We believe that, in the course of next year, they will be able to begin to deal autonomously with such issues. As they do so, we will first withdraw to barracks and then we will withdraw from Iraq itself. That may happen at different rates in different parts of the country and will correspond to circumstances on the ground.
</p>





<p><a name="st_7"><a name="51114-01_spnew6"><b> Adam Price  (Carmarthen, East and Dinefwr)</b> 
 (PC): The Government are aware of serious human rights abuses by the Iraqi police service, including two deaths in custody in the al-Jamiyat prison in Basra. What are the implications of those incidents and the reluctance of the Iraqi authorities to investigate them on the potential timetable for handover?
</p>





<p><a name="st_8"><a name="51114-01_spnew7"><b> John Reid: </b> 
 Whenever we suspect breaches of human rights, we make the most vigorous protests. We want to ensure that the police in Iraq will be effective and capable 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>14 Nov 2005 : Column 677</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>not only operationally, but also in terms of their objectivity and neutrality. That is not easy to do in any combat situation. In some ways, the last security force to become unbiased and objective is policing, as the police are the nearest form of power with use of arms or authority to local communities, but we continue to do what we can to train the Iraqi police in an objective fashion. Indeed, we are upping our efforts in that direction, precisely for the reasons mentioned by the hon. Gentleman.
</p>





<p><a name="st_9"><a name="51114-01_spnew8"><b> Mr. Michael Ancram  (Devizes)</b> 
 (Con): The Secretary of State confirmed on the radio this morning and again in the Chamber that the criteria for withdrawal of our troops from Iraq will be the capability of Iraqi security forces to maintain public order and progress in containing and suppressing insurgency. In the context of the second of those criteria, will he answer two factual questions? Is it true that, over the last year, the weekly number of terrorist incidents in Iraq tripled? In relation to violent contacts between our troops and the insurgents in the last 12 months, has the proportion initiated by the insurgents rather than by our own military action gone up or down?
</p>





<p><a name="st_10"><a name="51114-01_spnew9"><b> John Reid: </b> 
 The answer to the right hon. and learned Gentleman&#039;s second question would, I think, be up. In answer to the first question, I cannot give him exact details off the top of my head at the Dispatch Box, but I will write to him. If he is asking whether we continue to face a problem of insurgency as well as violence imported by Zarqawi and al-Qaeda elements in their international struggle, yes we continue, as part of the global war on terrorism, to face imported violence and indigenous violence from elements of the former regime&#151;the fascist regime whose authority has in part been destroyed, although there are still elements of it both inside and outside the country. There are also a number of Sunnis who do not fall into either category, but who are disempowered and alienated and may feel that they have lost power, influence and a better standard of living. We need to reach out to those elements to engage them in the political process. That will not be achieved by military means alone, but by the building of a democratic society and I was gratified by the number of Sunnis who turned out for the referendum. I hope that the number in this election is far greater than in January, when they boycotted it.
</p>





<p><a name="st_11"><a name="51114-01_spnew10"><b> Mr. Michael Moore  (Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk)</b> 
 (LD): Following the Iraqi President&#039;s welcome statement yesterday and the Secretary of State&#039;s comments today, can he give the House more detail about the latest assessment made by the joint committee on transferring security responsibility? He identified 35 battalions that can lead missions with international support. What are the barriers to their being able to work without support and how close are they to achieving that objective? After last week&#039;s Security Council resolution, does he accept that one of the key steps in creating an exit strategy for the coalition will be the internationalisation of support for Iraq, especially from countries in the region?
</p>





<p><a name="st_12"><a name="51114-01_spnew11"><b> John Reid: </b> 
 First, I cannot give the hon. Gentleman the latest estimate of how the Iraqi forces meet the criteria; the Interim Government have established those 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>14 Nov 2005 : Column 678</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>criteria but they have not yet made an assessment. That will probably lie with the incoming Government. Secondly, what are the deficiencies of battalions trained and capable of operations but not of autonomously leading them? The answer is logistics, intelligence, leadership and, in some cases, mobility in terms of medical services and back-up.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51114-01_para0">
<a name="stpa_0">Thirdly, the hon. Gentleman asked about internationalising efforts to assist the Iraqis. This is truly an international effort. We are in Iraq under the framework of the United Nations and people should never forget that, whatever the differences of a few years ago. Resolution 1546, superseded last week by the unanimous decision of the UN Security Council in resolution 1637, is the framework under which we are now all operating in assisting the efforts of the Iraqis themselves, and resisting the efforts of the terrorists to destroy Iraqi democracy, economy and the build-up of their own security forces.

</p>


<p><a name="st_13"><a name="51114-02_spmin0"><b>The Minister of State, Ministry of Defence  (Mr. Adam Ingram): </b> 
 I am considering the recommendations of the joint combat aircraft basing review and hope to make an early announcement. The review has taken into account the potential impact of the joint combat aircraft on civil aviation operations at Newquay Cornwall airport.
</p>





<p><a name="st_14"><a name="51114-02_spnew0"><b> Matthew Taylor: </b> 
 The Minister will be aware that military operations at RAF St. Mawgan help to support the civilian service, which is crucial to the economy in Cornwall and whose withdrawal would create a gap in the maintenance of services. I understand that officials have asked the county council and others about the fact that the new aircraft&#039;s noise levels, which are double those of existing fighter aircraft, could render civilian operations at Newquay virtually impractical. On the one hand, there might be financial support in effect, but on the other, civilian operations may be impossible. Will the Minister clarify the position?
</p>





<p><a name="st_15"><a name="51114-02_spnew1"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 We have undertaken comprehensive consultation with local interests on all the airfields affected by the review. Cornwall county council said that it was concerned about the potential noise of the new aircraft and its impact on the viability of the airport and the lives of local residents. It has therefore stated that it is unwilling to support the use of RAF St. Mawgan for the JCA, so it is basically saying that it does not want us there. I do not know whether the hon. Gentleman supports the county council or whether he is campaigning for the basing to take place. As I indicated, I am considering all the representations.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51114-02_para0">
<a name="stpa_1">On the future relationship between the MOD and the civil airport, clearly, it would not be appropriate to spend MOD money on maintaining a civil airport if we have no use for it because people could ask why Newquay gets our support when others do not. If we have a use for it, we will see what we can do. I will consult the Department for Transport, as well as local interests, but clarity from the hon. Gentleman would help: what does he want to happen there?

<p><a name="st_18"><a name="51114-02_spnew3"><b> John Reid: </b> 
 The role of our troops is to help the Afghan people establish a democratic, secure Afghanistan and to develop its economy and security forces. There is no question but that an Afghanistan with 60 per cent. of its gross domestic product and more involving narcotics will not be sustainable economically or politically. Therefore, countering the narcotics trade is integral to building a democratic, pluralistic, and politically and commercially non-corrupt Afghanistan. The two are absolutely interlinked.

 Yes, indeed I can. My right hon. Friend the Minister of State issued a written statement today on training and preparation as a contingency for deployment to Afghanistan.

We liberated Afghanistan from the evil regime of the Taliban, which destroyed the spirit of that great country. Will he tell me the latest information about the position of the Taliban? In the end, eradicating and wiping out the Taliban must remain the focus of our intentions.

<p><a name="st_22"><a name="51114-02_spnew7"><b> John Reid: </b> 
 I agree. The expulsion, capture, or even death of members of the Taliban in the short term is not sufficient to ensure that Afghanistan never again becomes a Trojan horse for terrorists to enter and launch attacks on the west or elsewhere. Helping the Afghans to build a stable and democratic society, with their own security forces, is necessary so that we can ensure that the terrorists never return. Incidentally, that also helps to counter the narcotics trade from which is derived 90 per cent. of the heroin that arrives on our streets. It is in the interests of Afghanistan, our self-protection and the protection of our young people that we carry out such action.

 Similarly in Afghanistan, our strategy is to build up the economy, civil society and security forces of the Afghan Government not only so that we can withdraw and leave the country, but so that when we do withdraw, we will not have a Trojan horse that terrorists could enter and launch the sort of attacks that they previously carried out. I am sure that the Duke of Wellington would be the first to tell us that defence at a distance is just as important as defence in proximity.

 (Lab/Co-op): May I associate myself with my right hon. Friend&#039;s earlier remarks? With the hon. Member for Banbury (Tony Baldry) and my hon. Friend the Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney (Mr. Havard), I had an opportunity to visit Afghanistan as part of the armed forces parliamentary scheme. We stayed in Camp Soutar, so I can only imagine what the problems are. We were all impressed by the professionalism of the British Army, particularly the Royal Gloucestershire, Berkshire and Wiltshire Regiment, which hosted us for most of the visit. I should like to tease out from my right hon. Friend the solidity of the international community and the way in which its members are functioning. Two issues were raised with us. First, we have yet to put in place an effective legal system in Afghanistan, but it is vital to do so. Security is not just about the work of the Army but about what happens subsequently to people who are arrested. Secondly, will he say something about the training of the Afghan national army and the police, which need to be developed to make them as effective as possible?
</p>





<p><a name="st_30"><a name="51114-02_spnew15"><b> John Reid: </b> 
 I agree on both counts. First, as in Iraq, we are in Afghanistan with support and as part of the international community under the auspices and framework of the United Nations. Secondly, although military power is a necessary condition of the defeat of terrorism in the short, medium and long term, it is not a sufficient condition, so we must build the infrastructure of a democratic state and the rule of law. Of course, that is a multinational effort. Our Italian colleagues are doing what they can to attend to the judicial process. The Germans and others are dealing with the training of police, and we are working in the counter-narcotics field. That is all part of a common effort to ensure not only that we expel the terrorists in the short term but that we leave a sustainable Afghanistan that will prevent their entry in the medium and longer term.

<p><a name="st_31"><a name="51114-02_spnew16"><b> Tony Baldry  (Banbury)</b> 
 (Con): May I endorse everything that the hon. Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew) said, and ask the Secretary of State two questions? First, we move south to Helmand next year, so can he give the House an undertaking that a UK Army training team will be embedded with the Afghan national army, which is 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>14 Nov 2005 : Column 682</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>supporting our troops, to make sure that the ANA gives our troops optimum support? Secondly, if other NATO countries do not come up to the mark on the move south, whatever the caveats, will he give the House an undertaking that our forces will not be spread too thinly?
</p>





<p><a name="st_32"><a name="51114-02_spnew17"><b> John Reid: </b> 
 I can give the hon. Gentleman assurances on both points. Indeed, to take the second one first, I will not announce the deployment to Helmand until I am satisfied that we have the military configuration that we ourselves need, and until we have the necessary back-up and resources across government here to provide alternative livelihoods to farmers whose current livelihood may be dependent on narcotics. To take away one form of income without substituting another would encourage insurgency rather than stability. Finally, I will not make that announcement until I believe that the multinational jigsaw has been put together and we have the necessary input from our NATO colleagues both in and around Helmand.
</p>





<p><a name="st_33"><a name="51114-02_spnew18"><b> Mr. Michael Ancram  (Devizes)</b> 
 (Con): I join the Secretary of State in his condolences to the families of the servicemen and women who lost their lives, particularly as the Royal Gloucestershire, Berkshire and Wiltshire Regiment is my own regiment. I also join him in his condemnation of the terrorist activity in Kabul today. We all know the pressure that that put on our troops, and I pay tribute to them. I have seen the statement by his right hon. Friend the Minister of State about beginning contingency planning for the time when we take over the control of the leadership of the international security assistance force. That will happen in May next year, come what may, so we are up against a time limit. Why is there such hesitation about the announcement of the deployment of additional troops to Afghanistan, which only yesterday the Chief of the General Staff conceded would be necessary? Surely, the military implications of expanding ISAF into south Afghanistan are already well known? Is the delay not the result of failure to reach agreement with other participants on operational issues, not least as to whether the task is to be expanded into counter-insurgency, and is there not damaging confusion about the rules of engagement under which they will operate? Surely, the Secretary of State can be a little more forthcoming.
</p>





<p><a name="st_34"><a name="51114-02_spnew19"><b> John Reid: </b> 
 I will be as forthcoming as I can: the delay was caused not by the two elements mentioned by the right hon. and learned Gentleman, but by my desire to be assured that our international and multinational colleagues will provide the necessary elements of force configuration not only in Helmand, but around Helmand. In other words, I hope that he agrees that I am right not to announce the deployment until I am satisfied by not only our configuration, but the supporting elements of military forces in the area.

<p><a name="st_36"><a name="51114-03_spnew0"><b> Mr. Robertson: </b> 
 Is the Minister as concerned as me about the American Government&#039;s increasing tendency to favour American firms when awarding aerospace contracts? That will obviously happen to some extent, but it is happening at an increasing rate, and it is damaging employment in my area, which depends on the aerospace industry. Has he discussed the matter with the American Government, and if not, will he do so, because it is becoming much more important?
</p>





<p><a name="st_37"><a name="51114-03_spnew1"><b> Mr. Touhig: </b> 
 I reassure the hon. Gentleman that we are fully aware of the matter. We are in discussions with much of industry on developing the defence industrial strategy, to which I alluded in my initial response. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Defence made our views plain when he met the American Secretary of State and Defence Secretary last week. We are fully apprised of the problem, which we will keep on the agenda and which we will keep raising.

Where are we up to in the talks, and will he ensure that the work force is not let down?

 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Defence continued to press the matter when he was in Washington last week.

 I cannot add much to my previous responses.

I particularly praise the work of BAE Systems, which is working with Kelvin Hall school in my constituency to encourage boys and girls alike to think positively about a career in the aerospace industry. Does the Minister agree that that is a positive way forward?

 Yes, I share that view entirely. We do not value engineers as highly as we should. We tend to think of it as being a dirty-hands job, whereas most parents want their kids to have clean-hands jobs. However, engineering is not like that nowadays. I pay tribute to a great deal of British industry for encouraging and taking on more apprentices. We must do that, because they are our seed corn for the future. I would support any initiative, as does the MOD, to encourage defence suppliers to take on as many apprentices as possible and train our people with the skills that they desperately need for the job that we face in future.

<p><a name="st_47"><a name="51114-03_spnew10"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 I remind the hon. Gentleman that we have a defence debate coming up on Thursday. If he wants to return to his questions then, I will be happy to answer them.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51114-03_para0">
<a name="stpa_7">The issue of urgent operational requirements is important, but I do not accept the hon. Gentleman&#039;s criticism. Overall, the way in which we assess and then provide for UORs is very good and meets what is required. In the event of a shortfall, we quickly identify where lessons need to be learned and put in place mitigating approaches for the next time round. If there have been significant and measurable shortfalls in respect of the 1st Battalion the Royal Anglian Regiment, as the hon. Gentleman suggests&#151;I echo the tributes that he paid to it&#151;they will be identified and corrected.
</p>





<p><a name="st_48"><a name="51114-03_spnew11"><b> Mr. Evennett: </b> 
 Will the Minister confirm the report in today&#039;s edition of <i>The Guardian</i> that the Territorial Army is haemorrhaging severely in numbers, with its numbers being the lowest since it was founded? Is that because it has been used to cover for the shortages in the Regular Army? What is the Minister going to do to ensure that we have a strong TA that is maintained and retained for future deployment needs?
</p>





<p><a name="st_49"><a name="51114-03_spnew12"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 I am glad to have found a <i>Guardian</i> reader; I certainly do not pay much attention to it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51114-03_para1">
<a name="stpa_8">Since March 2005, the trend in TA manning has been reversed, with inflow exceeding outflow. TA manning strength has increased from 31,493 to 31,680. The number of new recruits to the TA remains relatively high, averaging 400 to 600 a month. We are doing a lot to recruit, we are getting a good response and we will continue to do more.
</p>





<p><a name="st_50"><a name="51114-03_spnew13"><b> Chris Bryant  (Rhondda)</b> 
 (Lab): The Minister will know that, in the vast majority of urgent deployments, British infantry troops will fight alongside allies from other countries, not only the United States of America but France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and even Romania. Yet the British troops serving in Bosnia, for instance, will not get medals although the servicemen of all the other countries will. Does he think that that is fair?
</p>





<p><a name="st_51"><a name="51114-03_spnew14"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 My hon. Friend knows that I do not have direct responsibility for the matter, so perhaps it would be best to write to him about the detail. However, I understand that we are examining the matter. We recognise its importance and it is right that people who serve with distinction should be properly recognised. I take his point on board and will ensure that my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary communicates with him.
</p>





<p><a name="st_52"><a name="51114-03_spnew15"><b> Mr. Mark Lancaster  (North-East Milton Keynes)</b> 
 (Con): I draw hon. Members&#039; attention to my entry in the Register of Members&#039; Interests in that I continue to serve in the Territorial Army. Let me take the Minister back to his earlier answer about the TA. Numbers may be increasing but does he accept that the number of people in the TA who are fit for role, and can thus be deployed on operations, continues to fall?
</p>





<p><a name="st_53"><a name="51114-03_spnew16"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 I am not so sure about that. It is easy to make such an allegation, but we must then examine the basis of the charge. If people are unfit for role, we would 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>14 Nov 2005 : Column 686</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>have to tackle that. We would have to locate the shortfall, determine the reason for that and consider how to change the focus. We are sometimes criticised for using the TA in operations. It has been used significantly and to great effect in Afghanistan, Iraq and elsewhere. When we consider the use that is made of TA members and the way in which they deliver, it tends to contradict the perception that may exist. There may be an element of truth in the hon. Gentleman&#039;s remarks&#151;that needs to be analysed and corrected if necessary. However, I have not met anyone in the TA who is unfit for role. Indeed, the opposite is true. One cannot tell the difference between TA soldiers and regular soldiers when they are on operations.
</p>





<p><a name="st_54"><a name="51114-03_spnew17"><b> Sammy Wilson  (East Antrim)</b> 
 (DUP): The Minister has suggested that there will be a permanent garrison of 5,000 troops in Northern Ireland. Unfortunately, from time to time, there is an additional need for urgent deployments. Is the Secretary of State prepared to consider supplementing that garrison, whichever regiment serves, with two to three companies of Royal Irish Regiment soldiers who wish to stay in the Army after the regiment is disbanded? Does the Minister acknowledge that that would add continuity, local knowledge and flexibility?
</p>





<p><a name="st_55"><a name="51114-03_spnew18"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 I understand where the hon. Gentleman is coming from. I recently visited Northern Ireland and met a good number of the Royal Irish Regiment on home service. We will examine the matter but the best advisers will be those who are responsible for advising Ministers on the structure and eventual utilisation of, in this case, the Army. We must consider how best to structure things and whether the hon. Gentleman&#039;s suggestion has a utility. The current indications are that that is not the favoured approach. However, everything has to be considered and we must examine the matter. He and his party have raised the point and we will rule nothing out until it has been properly examined.
</p>





<p><a name="st_56"><a name="51114-03_spnew19"><b> Mike Penning  (Hemel Hempstead)</b> 
 (Con): The Minister kindly commented on the 1st Royal Anglian, which has done a fantastic job in Iraq. However, the second battalion is under strength. Will he undertake that none of the 1st Battalion will be augmented into the 2nd Battalion when it is deployed? The 1st Battalion needs to stay here and have the leave and training that it so desperately needs.
</p>





<p><a name="st_57"><a name="51114-03_spnew20"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 That is the principle on which we would act. I recollect visiting Umm Qasr after the end of the conflict in Iraq, when some young soldiers from the Royal Anglians, who had not been posted there, wanted to see me. I asked why and when I saw them, I knew the answer. They had asked to be posted from Afghanistan to Iraq and I had met them in Afghanistan only a few months previously. We know that there are many willing horses and people who want to serve in the way   in which those young soldiers did. They made a    tremendous contribution. Some soldiers may volunteer&#151;as the hon. Gentleman knows, some like to take on those roles. However, we must be careful that we do not impose too much on individuals who come forward willingly in that way. We would not work on

 Imagine for a moment what would have happened if the Government in the early 1930s had said that they were going to phase out all their carriers by 1942, but that, seven years before that, they could not set an in-service date for the new fleet. There would have been a national outcry. Will the Minister confirm that we are in a similar situation now? All our existing carriers will be phased out by 2012 and 2015.

 We could trade history, but we need to go back only to the 1990s to recall the cuts that the then Conservative Government imposed.

 I do not think that the 1930s should be the base point. We should look at what we are doing now to build the Navy to meet the challenges of the future. This is the biggest warship building programme for 20 years, involving new destroyers, submarines, support vessels and aircraft carriers. I would have thought that the hon.

 (Con): Three weeks ago, the Minister for defence procurement said that he would not set an in-service date for the carriers until he had taken the main investment decision. Does the Ministry of Defence intend to apply that concept to other procurement projects as well?
</p>





<p><a name="st_67"><a name="51114-04_spnew8"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 The right hon. Gentleman recently subjected senior officials and the Minister for defence procurement to quite an intensive grilling, and he will know that this matter has been looked at very carefully and in a structured way. This is a very complex project and I am not sure whether the right hon. Gentleman is saying that procurement should be run according to a standard format, whereby we take what we did before off the shelf and apply it to the next project. Projects are different: they have different arrangements, different players, different demands and different configurations. If lessons can be learned from the way in which a particular project has been carried out, the answer to his question is yes, but I believe that we should treat each major project in a way that determines how best we can deliver it, in terms of the arrangement of the people who come together, and of how it is to be funded and taken forward. So the answer to that question is yes and no, but we shall always do what is best for defence.

<p><a name="st_68"><a name="51114-04_spnew9"><b> Mr. Brian Jenkins  (Tamworth)</b> 
 (Lab): My right hon. Friend will realise that I have no constituency interest in this question, as we do not build aircraft carriers in Tamworth. Will the Minister give us an assurance, however, that when we go out to tender, all the players involved will still be in existence? We need to ensure that any contractor that is picked to build the new carriers is able to remain in existence, given that, without any continuity of programme, it might have been unable to keep together its skilled manpower. What is the Minister doing to ensure that those manufacturers will be given a date towards which they can plan? At present, they do not have any such assurance.

<p><a name="st_69"><a name="51114-04_spnew10"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 My hon. Friend might not have a shipbuilding interest in his constituency, but he has clearly hit on one of the key questions in this matter. We are trying to build a maritime strategy to deal with the peaks and troughs in the flow of procurement orders, and their impact on the availability of a skilled work force. The shipbuilding companies&#151;indeed, companies right across the defence sector&#151;have to try to cope with that. We therefore have to discuss with them how best we can plan into the future, and that takes time. It also requires everyone involved to come to the table with the best solutions. It does not just rest with the MOD. We cannot suddenly plug a gap if there are not the resources, or importantly, the demand. We must therefore look a good number of years ahead, establish the profile of the industry, and consider how we smooth the impact of peaks and troughs. That will not be easy, but we are on the case, and everyone is working earnestly to find the best solution.

 First, I ask the hon. Gentleman to check   his figures, as I think that he is doing a bit of double-counting. We have tried at all times to ensure the accuracy of figures, and I think that he has added figures so that what was counted as part of the original project cost has come out as an increased cost. I cannot give the precise figures for that project off the top of my head, but I will certainly write to him so that he is aware of all the relevant parliamentary questions relating to costs. If he is saying, like his hon. Friend the Member for Gosport (Peter Viggers) who is not in his place, that he wants to see Swan Hunter closed, he should just come out and say that, because that would not go down well in the north-east.

<p><a name="st_73"><a name="51114-04_spnew14"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 That is the plan. I am not involved in those close negotiations and discussions, but I know that a lot of effort has been put into it. Everyone must be willing, when they come to the table, to face up to the hard realities as well as to offer their aspirations and demands. Reconciling those objectives can become difficult at times, but unless we do so, we might not have the future capacity, because failure to do so might have significant implications for certain parts of the defence industry. We are engaged in a serious attempt to address that capacity requirement. Work forces and their companies must face up to that reality and the MOD must have a clear view as to what we can purchase and what we need, and how to match all those needs and demands. As I said, my understanding is that the strategy is intended to be published before Christmas, but it is better to get it right than to put it on the Christmas tree.

In the light of his courtesy, I am somewhat relieved that he is not answering this question. The truth is that this crucial project is now in total disarray. There is uncertainty about whether the carriers will enter service, whether they can be provided within budget, or what the involvement of the French might be. Can the Minister assure the House that the potential collaboration with the French will not be allowed to delay this project even further? This is a sorry saga of incompetence, which is a shameful reflection of the mess into which the Government have got themselves in relation to defence expenditure.

Does he defend the equal treatment proposed in the Northern Ireland (Offences) Bill? Of course all wrongdoers must be disciplined, but the determination of the Prime Minister and the Attorney-General to prosecute serving soldiers for doing their duty in theatres from Northern Ireland to Iraq, from Trooper Williams to Colonel Mendonca, is destroying the trust between the armed forces and their political and military commanders.

 I think that the hon. Gentleman&#039;s language is somewhat excessive. There is no doubt that the armed forces of this country have the complete support of Members in all parts of the House. They have a high reputation of which they and we are proud.

<p>
<a name="51114-05_para2">
<a name="stpa_12">The hon. Gentleman should be aware that the investigation could involve whether a British serviceman had witnessed a certain incident. It might not involve any prosecution. The hon. Gentleman may scoff, but the important thing is for our forces to get the message that the MOD&#151;with, I hope, the support of the entire House&#151;will provide all necessary help, understanding and support if they are faced with difficult circumstances. The question of any prosecution is a matter for the police service and the prosecuting services in Northern Ireland, but our record is second to none, and if our soldiers are in difficulty and need help and advice we will ensure that they get it.

Despite the difficulties that the Prime Minister had with 45 minutes last year and 90 days last week, on this issue, he can count on the support of the Opposition to back him up, in the belief that Britain needs to have nuclear weapons as long as other countries have them. He will get our support even if he cannot rely on the support of his own Back Benchers.

 I am sure that that will be very helpful to me. I would point out that we had a manifesto that committed the Government to the retention of our independent, minimum nuclear deterrent. In all the many pages of the Conservative manifesto, there was no mention whatever of nuclear deterrence.

 On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. I would be grateful if you could offer me some guidance on how to ensure that right hon. and hon. Members do not abuse their parliamentary allowances in respect of the free postage that MPs are allowed. I have given notice to my neighbour the right hon. Member for Redditch (Jacqui Smith) that I would raise the issue of her use and potential abuse of the free House of Commons postage in her constituency of Redditch. She announced in a newspaper a few weeks ago that&#151;

 Order. I will give the hon. Lady some guidance. This is not something that she can raise as a point of order on the Floor of the House. The Serjeant at Arms is responsible for postage and she should take the matter up with him.

 Further to that point of order, Mr. Speaker. Are you satisfied that the Serjeant has adequate powers to deal with Members when allegations are made about this or that violation of allowances? You will realise, Mr. Speaker, that it puts any Officer of the House in a difficult position when they are asked to discipline or reprimand a Member. Are you satisfied that the Serjeant, who you have identified as responsible for this matter, has all the powers that he needs to ensure that there is no abuse of postage or of other allowances?

 The right hon. Gentleman knows that I should not be drawn into this argument. My opinion should not be sought at this stage on the Floor of the House. What I will say is that the House gives the Serjeant at Arms powers and if it feels that those powers are inadequate, the matter can be raised with the House of Commons Commission&#151;and I know that the right hon.

If the House feels that more powers should be given to the Serjeant at Arms, it is up to the House to proceed as I have said, and I serve the House in this matter.

 I support Government new clause 9 and resist Opposition new clause 8. I shall also convey my position in respect of the other amendments in the group, which I particularly look forward to debating with the hon. Members who tabled them.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51114-07_para0">
<a name="stpa_1">On Government new clause 9, we agree entirely that the power to search students and learners for weapons should be extended to further education colleges. We discussed this issue in Committee, when I gave a commitment to consider it further, and I have duly tabled a Government new clause on Report. Given the increasing number of pupils under 16 who are, or will be, attending courses at college under arrangements made by their school as part of their compulsory education, it is of course right that this power be extended to FE colleges. It is essential that there be a level playing field for schools and colleges, and this new clause will remove the anomaly of a person in school perhaps enjoying a higher level of security than his or her counterpart on a similar course at an FE college. I hope that the Opposition are satisfied with the new clause, that it meets all their expectations, and that in the circumstances, they will not feel the need to press their amendment on this issue to a vote.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51114-07_para1">
<a name="stpa_2">I am afraid that I am going to resist Amendment No. 22, which would actually reduce protection for a pupil who is searched. Under it, a member of staff would be able to search a pupil simply if they believed that they had an offensive weapon; they would need no grounds, nor any reasonable grounds, for that belief. Requiring reasonable grounds offers a pupil protection against arbitrary searches. That is a normal standard that we adopt in many different circumstances, and we want to keep that safeguard. Removing it could harm pupils&#039; and parents&#039; trust that school staff will act reasonably. On that basis, I ask the Opposition to withdraw the amendment.

<a name="51114-07_para2">
<a name="stpa_3">I also urge the House to resist Amendment No. 26, which would remove paragraph (a) from clause 41. Removing this paragraph would cause uncertainty to both the pupil and the member of staff, and reduce safeguards for both.

<a name="stpa_6">Such an amendment would ensure that both adults involved are members of staff, and not, for example, volunteers or parents; however, it does not prevent the presence of such people in addition to the two members of staff. We are prepared to consider this issue further, and in doing so we will want to consider requiring that the second person who must be present at a personal search also be a member of staff. If there is to be this extra safeguard, it is probably more important that it exists during a personal search than during a simple search of possessions. We also want to consider whether equivalent amendments should be made to the provisions relating to FE institutions and attendance centres, to ensure coherence and consistency throughout the Bill. On that basis, I ask the Opposition to withdraw their amendment, but I happily undertake to examine the matter further, and to consider whether we can build in the safeguards that the amendment is designed to introduce.

<a name="stpa_7">Government Amendments Nos. 79 and 81 provide a clear definition for the meaning of &quot;outer clothing&quot; in respect of searches conducted at schools and attendance centres. This definition will make it clear to both staff and the person being searched which items of clothing they may be required to remove during a search. We have added shoes and boots to the list, which is an important practical change. The amendments also provide that any item of clothing worn over a shirt or blouse&#151;a jumper or pullover, for example&#151;can be removed. Amendments Nos. 78 and 80 correct a minor drafting error.

<p>
<a name="51114-07_para8">
<a name="stpa_9">Amendment No. 22 relates to clause 1 and the issue of whether a member of staff should have reasonable grounds for believing that a pupil may have a weapon with him or her. My amendment would leave out the words &quot;reasonable grounds for believing&quot; and insert &quot;believes&quot;. We believe that a fairly tough and vigorous approach should be taken to the entire issue of knives and other weapons being carried by school children. The purpose of inserting &quot;believes&quot; instead of &quot;reasonable grounds for believing&quot; is to strengthen the position of the member of staff concerned before a search takes place, and not to put too great a burden on the teacher. If it is the case that the member of staff has to have reasonable grounds to believe, he or she may be expected to go through some sort of mental gymnastics before concluding that it would be right to search the child&#151;for example, &quot;What grounds do I have? Are they reasonable? Would they be open to challenge later?&quot; We are very used nowadays to children being able to challenge members of staff. I want to put that person in a slightly stronger position so that they could perhaps avoid unnecessary challenges in due course.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51114-07_para9">
<a name="stpa_10">The Minister, who is not happy with my amendment, talks about pupil protection and the need to ensure that trust is not damaged. However, we are dealing with a serious problem. In a sense, I want to give members of staff stronger powers to do what they think is right even if, from time to time, the grounds on which they want to search someone may not always be deemed to be reasonable by outsiders.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51114-07_para10">
<a name="stpa_11">For example, what is the position of a member of staff when a pupil comes up to them and says, &quot;I think that so and so may be carrying a weapon&quot;? Is that a reasonable ground for a search? What about a member of staff who overhears one pupil talking to another about carrying weapons? Would that amount to a reasonable ground? What about a bulge, for example, where a knife might be kept in a young man&#039;s trousers? Would that amount to a reason for a member of staff saying, &quot;I think that there may be a ground for a search. I believe that there may be a knife there. I am going to search.&quot; That decision would be reached without having to examine the whole issue of reasonable ground.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51114-07_para11">
<a name="stpa_12">The purpose of amendment No. 22 is to strengthen the position of the teacher rather than to weaken it.

<p><a name="st_68"><a name="51114-07_spnew2"><b> Michael Connarty  (Linlithgow and East Falkirk) (Lab):</b> 
 I was a teacher, and often taught in circumstances that were somewhat stressed. Removing &quot;reasonable&quot; puts the person who is trying to dissolve the conflict or resolve it at great risk. I do not understand why &quot;reasonable&quot; should be removed from any power that is given to a person in authority. That does not make sense to me as a former teacher.

 I understand what the hon. Gentleman is saying. The other side of the argument is that I do not want to put too great a burden on teachers in terms of always having to justify their actions. We seem to be in a world nowadays where the burden is always on the teacher to justify what he or she is doing rather than on the pupil or the parent. The purpose of my amendment is to toughen up the clause, to strengthen the position of teachers and to help them avoid challenges at a later date by some aggrieved child or by a parent who says, in terms, &quot;Justify this search by proving reasonable

 Does my hon. Friend accept that amendment No. 22 is reasonable because a teacher would use the power in the presence of someone else, who is clearly defined? That in itself would be a form of control.

<p><a name="st_71"><a name="51114-08_spnew1"><b> Mr. Malins: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is right. There are burdens on teachers to ensure that they do the right thing. As he readily says, they cannot do the search alone. There are already duties on a teacher without imposing on them too high a burden.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51114-08_para0">
<a name="stpa_13">Amendment No. 26 relates to clothing. We had a serious debate in Standing Committee about the clothing that could be removed during a search. The Minister will correct me if I am wrong, but I recall vividly that while we debated this Bill in one Committee Room, another Home Office Bill, on which I also had to serve, was being debated in another Room. A similar provision on searching through clothing was proposed in the other Bill. One of them&#151;I forget which&#151;mentioned the removal of a hat. The other one did not. I rely on the Minister to remind which it was.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51114-08_para1">
<a name="stpa_14">The serious point is that the Minister is trying to reach a position in which a proper&#151;a full and thorough&#151;search is made. As we said in Committee, the search must be realistic, by which we mean fairly full. To take an obvious example, if a child is required to remove only an outer coat, it is possible that a weapon might be concealed further down in their clothing. The Minister has to strike a balance. Her proposal goes further than the position taken in Committee. To that extent, I welcome what she said and thank her for it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51114-08_para2">
<a name="stpa_15">Amendment No. 27 is important. I am grateful to the Minister for the courteous way in which she received it. We are, after all, talking about searching and the need for the search to be carried out in the presence of another person. The Opposition agree with that concept, but it occurred to me shortly after proceedings in Committee that there could be serious disadvantages if the Bill were left in its current form, with the search taking place in the presence of another person who is aged 18 or over. That is a wide provision and could involve someone who is not a member of staff and teacher trained, such as a parent or a member of staff in the catering department who has no skills in dealing with pupils. Strictly speaking, it could involve another pupil at the same school. I do not think that the Minister intends the second person involved in the search to be another pupil who happens to be 18 or over.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51114-08_para3">
<a name="stpa_16">I thought that that was unsatisfactory and still do. The Minister said that she will look more closely at the matter, perhaps with a view to the Government tabling an amendment that is drafted in the same or similar terms as mine. I do not propose to ask the House to divide on the matter, but I do ask her to consider the position carefully, and I know that she will.
</p>





<p><a name="st_72"><a name="51114-08_spnew2"><b> Mark Pritchard  (The Wrekin) (Con):</b> 
 Does my hon. Friend agree that the Government also need to consider religious dress and that they should be sensitive to those 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>14 Nov 2005 : Column 700</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>who wear religious dress to school? Given that they have tabled the new clause, which relates to higher education, is not it the case that we now have a new problem of adults who carry religious knives? That is a sign of adulthood in Sikh communities such as mine in Shropshire. It is important that those communities are not offended and that the Government realise that Sikh male adulthood includes carrying ceremonial knives.
</p>





<p><a name="st_73"><a name="51114-08_spnew3"><b> Mr. Malins: </b> 
 I am grateful to my hon. Friend who raises the important issue of apparel&#151;for want of a better description&#151;that might be important to someone in relation to their religious beliefs. He is right to say that the House should be sensitive to such issues, which are very important to some members of our community. It is not unknown for members of certain religions to carry small knives, but I have to say to my hon. Friend that I cannot immediately form a decisive view on that issue except to say that it is an offence under section 139 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988 to carry a bladed article in a public place. All of us would wish to ensure that the law was properly upheld and enforced in that respect.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51114-08_para4">
<a name="stpa_17">The new clause deals with the power to search school pupils for weapons. It is not appropriate for the Government to introduce this clause as a flagship proposal to address the problem of knives in schools. As with so much of the law, it is a question of properly enforcing the existing laws of the land. For example, it is already an offence under section 139A of the Criminal Justice Act for a person to have a bladed article on school premises. Furthermore, under section 139B, a constable already has a power to enter school premises to search them and any person on them for any article to which that section applies. Tens of thousands of schoolchildren are carrying knives on school premises, disguised in their clothing, and it distresses me that the existing law as laid out in section 139 is not properly enforced.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51114-08_para5">
<a name="stpa_18">I asked the Minister some weeks ago if she could provide figures for the number of occasions on which a constable has entered school premises to conduct a search of a school pupil. The Minister was not able to tell us how many times that has happened. I asked the Minister in a written question a little earlier in the year about the current powers of head teachers to search and suspend pupils whom they suspect of carrying a form of weapon. The Minister replied that state and independent school head teachers may search a desk or locker without the pupil&#039;s consent, search a bag or jacket with consent or ask the police to do a personal search.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51114-08_para6">
<a name="stpa_19">We think that we have a problem with young people carrying knives, but it is now critical and needs to be addressed seriously. A Youth Justice Board survey last year showed that 1 per cent. of pupils aged 11 to 16 has, at some time in the previous year, carried a knife in school for offensive reasons, and 2 per cent. had done so for defensive reasons. I checked with the Library the number of schoolchildren of that age in the state sector, and it is more than 3.5 million. Even if one chooses a smaller number of children, if 1 per cent. of children carry a knife for offensive purposes, it means that more than 20,000 children are carrying knives in schools for offensive purposes. If 2 per cent. do so for so-called defensive purposes, it means that more than 40,000 children aged between 11 and 16 are&#151;according to the Government&#039;s figures&#151;carrying knives for 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>14 Nov 2005 : Column 701</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>defensive reasons. It is a horrible statistic: 60,000 children are carrying knives in our schools, yet what is the prospect of their being charged or prosecuted for that offence under existing law? We need only look at the figures.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51114-08_para7">
<a name="stpa_20">Over the last few years, how many of the 60,000 children who, according to the Government&#039;s figures, were carrying knives, were charged with and convicted of having a bladed article on school premises? In the past five years, fewer than 100 children were charged with that offence, and of those sentenced only nine received a custodial sentence. That is an astonishing statistic, which means that carrying&#151;

</p>





<p><a name="st_75"><a name="51114-08_spnew5"><b> Mr. Malins: </b> 
 Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I am anxious not to stray from the basis of the clause, which relates to search, so I shall come back to the point.
</p>





<p><a name="st_76"><a name="51114-08_spnew6"><b> Jeremy Wright  (Rugby and Kenilworth) (Con):</b> 
 Does my hon. Friend agree that there is little point in the Government legislating to provide teachers and members of staff with the authority to search pupils unless there is a result when the search discloses a bladed weapon? No doubt that is what my hon. Friend is pointing out to the Minister.
</p>





<p><a name="st_77"><a name="51114-08_spnew7"><b> Mr. Malins: </b> 
 I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that intervention, and also for his contribution in Committee. As he rightly says, there is no point in giving teachers those powers unless there is some result from their being used in practice. That is why I was illustrating that the Government&#039;s track record to date is so abysmal. The offence of carrying a knife on school premises already exists, but there is only one chance in 2,500 of a pupil being prosecuted for such an offence under existing law and only one chance in eight that any of those prosecuted will be sent to prison. The situation is terrifying.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51114-08_para8">
<a name="stpa_21">It is all very well for the Government to bring forward a so-called flagship policy of searching children for knives and giving head teachers the powers to do so, but the Government should be deeply ashamed of the fact that knife carrying in schools has risen so dramatically over the past few years, causing so much fear to so many people, yet it is under-prosecuted by the authorities. The culture of the blade is indeed with us.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51114-08_para9">
<a name="stpa_22">In Committee, I briefly raised with the Minister a particular case relating to search and I want to raise it again today. Some weeks ago, Opposition Members were horrified to read a newspaper report that a council was forced to pay &#163;11,000 to a boy expelled for taking a knife to school. Apparently, the council was ordered to apologise to the teenager and to pay his mother &#163;5,000 compensation for anxiety and uncertainty, plus &#163;6,000 for home tuition for her son. Not surprisingly, teachers reacted with fury. If that is what happens when somebody is expelled from school, it is a very sorry situation.

<a name="51114-08_para10">
<a name="stpa_23">Carrying a knife in school is a serious matter that should result in prosecution of the child, yet the reality is, as my figures show, that it is simply not happening. To return to the point that my hon. Friend the Member for Rugby and Kenilworth (Jeremy Wright) made a few moments ago, it is almost a waste of time giving the Government further powers if they do not use their existing powers properly. My general proposition is that although there are more than 60,000 offences a year of carrying a knife in school, the number actually being taken to court is paltry in the extreme.

 The hon. Gentleman referred to a newspaper article but drew the wrong conclusion. He did not tell us who was the author of the decision. If the power to expel a pupil exists and someone&#151;not the pupil or the Government but, presumably, someone in a judicial position&#151;made a judgement to overturn the initial decision, I do not understand why the blame should lie with the Government who gave those powers or with those who used them.

I appreciate what the Minister has said about clothing&#151;she has toughened up that clause&#151;but none of this will count for anything in life unless it is acted on.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51114-09_para1">
<a name="stpa_25">I stress that, if we are giving this power to teachers, it is absolutely vital that education authorities and teachers get to grips with the problem of the knife culture in school, which is currently almost out of control, and use, as well as the power to search pupils, the existing criminal law, which is ready to be enforced. It is simply not right that a handful of charges have been brought under the existing law. A much stronger enforcement of current legislation is needed.

 I rise to speak to new clause 8, tabled by the Liberal Democrats, which hon. Members may notice is not a million miles in difference from Government new clause 9. I very much welcome the Government&#039;s tabling of that clause, because it acknowledges the concern that we expressed about not giving further education colleges an equivalent power, thus sending out a worrying signal that only school pupils need protection and possibly even giving the impression that colleges are a soft touch.   More 16 to 18-year-olds in full-time education attend further education colleges and sixth form colleges than schools&#151;701,000, compared with 345,000&#151;and 120,000 14 to 16-year-olds choose to study vocational courses at college.

Schools obviously have powers not just to conduct searches under the legislation but to exclude pupils for violent activity, including the carrying of knives on the premises. We would certainly support teachers and head teachers who take such action to exclude pupils, but the compensation in the case mentioned by the hon. Gentleman was payable, I believe, for the failure to provide education provision rather than because of the initial decision to exclude. We would not want teachers to shy away from exclusion in such circumstances.

<p>
<a name="51114-10_para1">
<a name="stpa_33">The hon. Gentleman spoke about the importance of schools and the police working together closely, and I can confirm that police officers are stationed in 400 schools across the country, where they can build extremely good relationships with both teachers and pupils. Police officers who are based full time in schools have had a significant impact on the likelihood of violent incidents occurring in school. They can often nip problems in the bud, and do excellent educational work with pupils to show them that the carrying of knives and other weapons is not the way to resolve conflict. Basing police officers in schools is therefore an extremely good idea.

 The right hon. Lady is making an excellent case both for Government new clause 9 and for the presence of police officers in schools&#151;an initiative that is working well in my south Essex constituency. Can she explain to the House exactly what happens if, during a search on a pupil, a weapon is not found but other contraband, illegal substances or materials are found?

<p><a name="st_92"><a name="51114-10_spnew2"><b> Hazel Blears: </b> 
 If there is evidence of offences that have been committed, the police would take the action that they usually take in those circumstances. We have 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>14 Nov 2005 : Column 706</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>introduced powers for searches for alcohol and tobacco in the possession of underage youngsters, as well as for other substances. If the police found illegal substances they would retain them and dispose of them in the normal manner, just as they would for anyone else who had committed an offence. The age of criminal responsibility in this country is 10, and if people are found to have committed criminal offences the police will take appropriate action as a result of the evidence that they find.
</p>





<p><a name="st_93"><a name="51114-10_spnew3"><b> Mr. Malins: </b> 
 The Minister remarked on the number of police present in schools, which we all applaud. However, in what percentage of schools across the country are police present for much of the time? Does she, like the Opposition, think that it is a good idea to try to encourage a much greater take-up of that facility?
</p>





<p><a name="st_94"><a name="51114-10_spnew4"><b> Hazel Blears: </b> 
 Apart from the fact that my maths is not up to it, I do not know the total number of schools so I cannot give a percentage figure now, but I shall endeavour to find the hon. Gentleman some details. We encourage schools to have extremely close relationships with the police service. I find that police officers stationed in schools often build a relationship with pupils that diverts them from becoming involved in crime, antisocial behaviour and other activities that cause problems. Of course we now have 13,000 extra police officers, so there are more to go around our schools than there were a few years ago. With the advent of 24,000 community support officers and the ability to have a neighbourhood police team in every community by 2008, I anticipate even more schools being able to develop a better and more positive relationship with their police services.

We must try to give them alternative skills to deal with some of the problems they face at school, so that we can minimise the prospect of the horrendous events that we have seen all too graphically in the past few weeks recurring. The Government support a range of education projects, in particular with the police service, and I hope that the House welcomes that sort of work.

<p><a name="st_132"><a name="51114-11_spnew0"><b> Mr. Malins: </b> 
 We come now to one of the Bill&#039;s main purposes, which is to tackle alcohol-related disorder. I should say at the start of my remarks that I hope to divide the House on new clause 1 if the Minister does not accept it. I have some hope that the Minister will accept it, based on her comment a few minutes ago that my amendment No. 22 was one that she was inclined to accept in due course. In my many years in this House only extremely rarely have the Government accepted anything that I have said&#151;perhaps it is a fault in my arguments. However, it is terribly encouraging to start the debate this afternoon with the Minister saying that she approves of what I have said so far in relation to one amendment.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51114-11_para0">
<a name="stpa_37">I shall explain new clause 1 and speak to Conservative amendments Nos. 1 to 4, 13, 5, 6 and 14, then say a word or two about Liberal Democrat amendment No. 28. New clause 1 is simple: it would amend the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 to enable an antisocial behaviour order made under that Act to be made for a minimum period of three months, rather than two years, as now. Linked with the new clause is amendment No. 1, which would omit clauses 1 to 11.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51114-11_para1">
<a name="stpa_38">I make two general propositions in this, the most important debate of the day. The first is that although alcohol-related disorder on our streets is a major problem&#151;not ameliorated by the Government&#039;s plans to introduce extended drinking hours, which many people including the police regard as a retrograde step&#151;and one that is getting worse by the day, not enough is being done to address it. The second general proposition is that the existing law is entirely satisfactory when it comes to dealing with alcohol-related disorder. That general theme lies behind new clause 1, which seeks to alter the period of time for which an antisocial behaviour order must be made.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51114-11_para2">
<a name="stpa_39">When we discussed antisocial behaviour orders in Standing Committee&#151;I think that it was at the first sitting on 13 October&#151;my hon. Friend the Member for Hertford and Stortford (Mr. Prisk) asked the Minister to reflect on the fact that using existing law is often better than creating new laws. Our general proposition was not only that an antisocial behaviour order can do exactly what a drinking banning order purports to do, but that it can do more and that it may be effective. If that is right&#151;we thought that it was and still think that it is&#151;why give the police yet another power in relation to drink?
</p>

<p>
<a name="51114-11_para3">
<a name="stpa_40">The Minister seemed to indicate in Committee that antisocial behaviour orders are not applicable to the kind of activity&#151;alcohol-related disorder&#151;covered by the Bill, and when we asked her why, she pointed out two differences. First, she said that an antisocial behaviour order can be imposed on anyone from the age of 10 upwards, whereas a drinking banning order can be 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>14 Nov 2005 : Column 709</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>imposed only on over-16s. That is not an argument, however, because if we were to use antisocial behaviour orders in drink-banning situations, we would have a wider, better, less-limited power. I illustrate that point by saying that a lot of under-age drinking involves not 16 to 18-year-olds, but 14 and 15-year-olds, so the Minister&#039;s argument fails.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51114-11_para4">
<a name="stpa_41">The Minister&#039;s second point against the use of antisocial behaviour orders was that under current law&#151;the Crime and Disorder Act 1998&#151;the minimum period for an antisocial behaviour order is two years, whereas for a drinking banning order it is two months. That is a statement of the law, but we can cover the point by simply amending the 1998 Act to enable an antisocial behaviour order to be made for a more flexible period of time, which is the result that new clause 1 attempts to achieve.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51114-11_para5">
<a name="stpa_42">Earlier, I advanced the proposition that the existing law on alcohol-related disorder in our towns and cities is voluminous.
</p>





<p><a name="st_133"><a name="51114-11_spnew1"><b> Sammy Wilson: </b> 
 Is not a further reason why antisocial behaviour orders may not be suitable the amount of evidence required to issue them, as opposed to the evidence required to issue drinking banning orders? The Bill states that someone need only engage in criminal or disorderly behaviour on one occasion for a drinking banning order to be applied for, whereas an antisocial behaviour order requires a longer period of evidence gathering.
</p>





<p><a name="st_134"><a name="51114-11_spnew2"><b> Mr. Malins: </b> 
 With respect to the hon. Gentleman, that is not right. Both of those orders must be made by a court upon the production of evidence that satisfies the court that the appropriate order should be made.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51114-11_para6">
<a name="stpa_43">A third reason why an antisocial behaviour order could be more appropriate than a drinking banning order is the consequences of a breach. As I understand it, the penalty for a breach of a drink banning order is not the highest. Under clause 10&#151;the Minister will correct me if I am wrong&#151;a person who is the subject of a drink banning order is guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine: not a fine or imprisonment, but just a fine. The clause imposes a drink banning order and effectively says to the person who is its subject: &quot;Breach this order and the result will be a fine&quot;, whereas the breach of an antisocial behaviour order can, and often does, result in a custodial sentence, and rightly so.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51114-11_para7">
<a name="stpa_44">Let me illustrate further my proposition that existing law deals with problems of the sort that the Minister is trying to deal with. Some months ago, I asked her what powers courts have to ban defendants from entering licensed premises&#151;because, let us make no mistake about it, that is what the drink banning order purports to do. She replied:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_5">&quot;Under the provisions of the Licensed Premises (Exclusion of Certain Persons) Act 1980 a court can make an order prohibiting a person from entering specified licensed premises, following conviction for an offence committed on licensed premises involving violence or threats of violence.&quot;</p>

<a name="51114-11_para8">
<a name="stpa_45">The power already exists. Undoubtedly a great number of orders should have been made under the 1980 Act, but how many have been made? The Minister went on to say that

<ul>

<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51114-11_para9">
<a name="stpa_46">If an antisocial behaviour order that carries a custodial sentence in the event of a breach can be used to prevent certain persons from entering certain areas or premises, what does a drink banning order add, if anything, to the existing law?
</p>

<p>
<a name="51114-11_para10">
<a name="stpa_47">We suffer from a surfeit of laws. The House of Commons passes law after law, and the trouble is that they pile up and fall into disrepute, and quite often existing legislation that is perfectly fit for purpose are not properly used.
</p>





<p><a name="st_135"><a name="51114-11_spnew3"><b> Jeremy Wright: </b> 
 One of the difficulties that we noted when antisocial behaviour orders were first introduced was the substantial delay before courts started making such orders on a regular basis. Does my hon. Friend think that that might happen with drink banning orders; and if it did, would not that undermine the Government&#039;s proper desire to deal with such problems instantly?
</p>





<p><a name="st_136"><a name="51114-11_spnew4"><b> Mr. Malins: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is absolutely right. Such situations are becoming increasingly common. As we all know, in their early years antisocial behaviour orders were barely used at all. I remember the then Home Secretary telling the Home Affairs Committee that he thought that thousands would be used in the first year or two, but such is the bureaucratic nightmare involved that only a few hundred were used in that period. The use of antisocial behaviour orders has increased a lot in the past couple of years, and I congratulate the Government and the courts on that. There is always a very slow run-in period before such orders are used to their full effect. It could properly be said that antisocial behaviour orders are now the norm rather than the exception in such cases, and breaches usually result in a custodial sentence. So his parallel point about the drinking banning order, which, according to the Government, we need to cure an immediate problem quickly, is correct. If the antisocial behaviour order is anything to go by, it will be years before the drinking banning orders get under way and are used to their full effect.

<p>
<a name="51114-11_para11">
<a name="stpa_48">What problems do the drinking banning orders purport to attack? The answer is the alcohol-fuelled disorder, to which I referred earlier. No hon. Member doubts that one of the greatest problems that the country faces is binge drinking, especially by young people, both girls and boys. The Prime Minister&#039;s strategy unit&#039;s alcohol harm reduction project was established a year or two ago. It told us&#151;we knew it already&#151;that British teenagers, along with those in Ireland and Denmark, are among the heaviest teenage drinkers in Europe. They are more likely to drink to get drunk and to report problems that are associated with drinking than their counterparts in other European countries.

<a name="stpa_49">There is a telling statistic: more than one third of 15-year-olds in the United Kingdom report having been drunk at the age of 13 or earlier. That is a desperate figure. Given that an antisocial behaviour order can be made against someone as young as 10, the problem of young person&#039;s drunkenness could be better addressed through such an order.

Come with me, Mr. Speaker, to the streets of some of our towns and cities in the south on a Friday and Saturday evening, and see what happens when people, full of alcohol, are turned out of pubs and clubs at 11 pm or 12 am. It was probably different in our day&#151;I say that as a kindness to all hon. Members&#151;when there was no such thing as spirit chasers. In my experience in the courts, I have encountered many young people who commit alcohol-fuelled crime, who, in between their pints of bitter, have a double vodka or a double spirit shot. That is a relatively new and damaging trend which must be tackled.

<p><a name="st_137"><a name="51114-12_spnew0"><b> Jim Sheridan: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman has just said that the most dangerous time is when people are tipped out of pubs at 11 pm and 12 am and gravitate towards the centre of towns. Surely that is an argument for extending the licensing laws and for more flexible licensing laws so that people are chucked out at different times of night?
</p>





<p><a name="st_138"><a name="51114-12_spnew1"><b> Mr. Malins: </b> 
 The Government continually argue that the new licensing laws will lead to a continental caf&#233; culture, whereby everybody comes out of the clubs and behaves beautifully. However, the hon. Gentleman is na-ve if he believes that extended licensing hours will help. I understand that the Government always support the police and, if the police say something, the Government appear to believe that it must be right. The police have said that they are terribly worried about late drinking hours and the Judges Council has made a statement to the effect that alcohol consumption over a longer period of time&#151;the extended licensing hours&#151;is much more likely to fuel alcohol-related crime. I therefore urge the Government, even at this late stage, to think again, given that so many people are against them on permitting alcohol to be drunk round the clock.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51114-12_para0">
<a name="stpa_52">The problems of alcohol-related disorder are clearly there for all to see, but there is already a range of offences and orders to cover everything that happens on our streets in relation to drunkenness and drunken crime, and according to the Home Affairs Committee, which is dominated by Labour Members, those powers are grossly underused at present. So what is the point of introducing a new Bill with a complicated new kind of order when the existing law is wholly adequate?

<a name="51114-12_para1">
<a name="stpa_53">The whole issue is about the proper enforcement of those existing laws, and I shall give the House some examples. If a person is drunk, there is an offence of simple drunk. If they are drunk and disorderly, there is an offence of drunk and disorderly. It is interesting to speculate on the number of people who are prosecuted for being drunk or drunk and disorderly. In truth, the numbers are dropping dramatically, yet there is more drunkenness and disorderliness on our streets. Why, then, have the prosecutions dropped from about 124,000 in 1980 to fewer than 44,000 in 2001? I suspect that the Government would answer that most offences of drunk and disorderly are dealt with by issuing fixed penalty notices. That can sometimes send the wrong signal, however, because some people deserve to appear in court.

Does she also accept that such an order could prevent a person from entering a licensed premises? She must accept that the answer is yes to both those questions. Will she therefore tell me how many such orders forbidding persons to enter such licensed premises have been made so far by the courts? How many have been breached? How effective have they been? How many people have been sent to prison&#151;as is possible under an ASBO but not under a drink banning order&#151;for such breaches? Will she also confirm that another restriction that can be laid upon an individual is, before trial, to impose bail conditions forbidding a defendant from going into specified premises.

<a name="stpa_59">The Minister has said that antisocial behaviour orders are not appropriate for dealing with alcohol-related disorder. May I gently suggest to her that she is completely out of step with the courts, which, I can tell her from my own experience, are using ASBOs to deal with exactly the sort of alcohol-related disorder that we are facing? I repeat the point that they are stronger than drink banning orders, simply because the penalty for breach can be up to five years in prison&#151;I will be corrected if I am wrong&#151;whereas the penalty for breach of this drink banning order is only a fine. That troubles me, because if the breach only results in a fine, our means courts will be flooded with cases of people who have a drink banning order made against them, who breach it, and who do not pay the fine, which is the maximum sanction. That is the reality. If you and I were to know, Mr. Deputy Speaker&#151;I knew at one point&#151;the percentage of unpaid fines in the Greater London area in a particular year, we would be absolutely astonished at the volume of them.

<a name="stpa_60">The question of breach is important. The Minister said, during the Committee&#039;s third sitting, I think, on 18 October, that custody is not appropriate if people have merely breached a community penalty. I happen to take a different view, and I wonder where she has been all this time&#151;in fact, in courts up and down the land, breaches of community penalty often result in a custodial sentence, not least for the original offence.

</p>

<p>
<a name="51114-12_para20">
<a name="stpa_72">In fewer words than those used by the Government, my amendment absolutely covers the position. No Member in his right mind wants to stop someone from entering a garage, supermarket or village shop. I can tell the Minister that plenty of people live in areas so rural that the only shop within miles where they can obtain their daily provisions is one with an alcohol licence. There are also plenty of people who rely entirely on their sport to keep them going. They will want to go on visiting sports clubs which have licences. Why not accept an amendment&#151;amendment No. 4&#151;which allows them to do that, but states that the order can prohibit them from buying or attempting to buy alcohol there, or from consuming it?

Let us say that there are some high spirits and that&#151;in keeping with the example given in Committee&#151;they were making a bit of a noise running across the road.

<a name="stpa_90">As suggested by the hon. Member for Woking (Mr. Malins) in Committee, the amendment now says that courts &quot;may&quot; ask for a medical report so that they can be satisfied that the individual can understand and comply with a drinking banning order. I was persuaded by the Minister&#039;s argument about bureaucracy, and she offered to include in the guidance the need to consider asking for a medical report. On reflection, however, I decided that simply to place it in guidance is not enough of a safeguard for an individual who is thus incapacitated. I have modified the amendment to put the measure on the face of the Bill to ensure that all courts and advocates refer to it and recognise its relevance.

<a name="stpa_91">Guidance for mental health problems is used to support antisocial behaviour order legislation, but it has not worked. One does not have to look far to find examples of ASBOs being served inappropriately. The British Institute for Brain Injured Children provided me with many examples, one of which in particular stuck in my mind. A 14-year-old boy was given an ASBO that included a curfew. He had to stick to it, but he had a mental age below that of a seven-year-old and could not tell the time. The boy and his family needed help to deal with their problems, and an ASBO was inappropriate in enabling them to receive guidance and support.

A doctor or GP should also be able to give their opinion to a court to speed that process further. If drinking banning orders are to work in the way envisaged by the Government, they should be swift procedures, more akin to parents grounding their naughty children. It should be a short punishment that is not meant to last a lifetime but to shock them into the error of their ways. We need to be sure that the vulnerable are adequately and properly protected.

<a name="stpa_93">Amendment No. 30 returns to the issue of publicising individuals who are subject to a drinking banning order. The Government want to disapply the blanket ban on the publication of names and photographs of defendants under 18. We think that that contravenes the United Nations convention on the rights of the child. That is applied to the criminal law, and we are considering the civil law, but such publication would break with the spirit of the convention. We want to protect young people.

<a name="stpa_104">Technically, it would be possible to reduce the length of ASBOs and simply provide conditions tailored to drink issues, where that is the problem behaviour, but that would do no service either to ASBOs or to the proposed new orders.

</p>

<p>
<a name="51114-14_para10">
<a name="stpa_105">Antisocial behaviour orders cover the spectrum of antisocial behaviour. The motivations that drive that behaviour will be very varied. Those receiving ASBOs will often have poor educational records, a history of truancy, problems at home, parental issues&#151;a range of different things lead up to their offending behaviour. That is why ASBOs are fairly complex, with a range of prohibitions to try to target the antisocial behaviour. As Members have said, the complex nature of ASBOs meant that they were slow to take off when they were originally proposed in the Crime and Disorder Act 1998. We have made them simpler, but they remain significant and serious orders. Courts need to be pretty well convinced of the case for making an ASBO; indeed, some of my hon. Friends might say that courts, local authorities and the police are not using the powers to their full extent in many areas, although I am pleased to say that the situation is improving.

<a name="stpa_107">Let us not forget that, in other circumstances, binge drinkers can often be fairly responsible citizens who have decent jobs, good wages and normally conduct themselves as decent members of society.

They get involved in a fracas about a kebab or which person they will take home for the evening. They get involved in a fight in the taxi queue.

No great big, convoluted and complicated application is necessary, and the remedy is fairly simple. The whole idea is to try to get people to change their behaviour and to make them realise that going out on Friday and Saturday nights, getting into a completely drunken state where they cannot remember what they have done and getting involved in violence and disorder will simply not be tolerated and the court will make an order to do something about it.

 I understand a great deal of what the Minister is saying, but is not the logic of her remarks that those who deserve a drinking banning order are behaving antisocially?

<p><a name="st_171"><a name="51114-15_spnew1"><b> Hazel Blears: </b> 
 The description &quot;drinking banning order&quot; is very graphic and pretty easily understood. One of the prohibitions that the court must consider is banning people from premises that sell alcohol. The whole idea is for the order to contain prohibitions that tell people that they are not allowed to go to their favourite bars and clubs. That is quite a disincentive to carrying on in a drunken way. People may also be prohibited from going out with their regular group of friends, with whom they go out and create mayhem in communities.

In other words, they could decide not to drink, even though they would have breached their community penalty. If people can do that, does it not undermine the point made by my hon.

 No. We have a taken a view on this and do not think that there should be a direct custodial penalty. A community order can be made and if the case returns to the courts after the breach of that order, it will be for them to decide the appropriate penalty. It is perfectly proper for the courts to do that. That will sharpen up the distinction between antisocial behaviour orders and drinking banning orders. I am sure that hon. Members are not in the business of saying that people should go to prison for up to five years if the breach of the order has been to enter the single pub or club from which they have been barred from entering. It is important that penalties are proportionate to the breaches that they address.

<a name="stpa_122">The hon. Gentleman talked about high spirits, but in Committee some telling examples were given, particularly my hon. Friend the Member for Brent, South (Ms Butler), who said that &quot;high spirits&quot; was not an accurate description of the problems in her community.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51114-16_para3">
<a name="stpa_123">Amendment No. 5 would require that for orders on conviction the court must be satisfied that the individual was drunk, rather than under the influence of alcohol. That would raise the threshold at which a drinking banning order could be obtained and could lead to a wide range of offenders who were under the influence of alcohol escaping the prohibitions imposed by a DBO. I think that it is for the courts to come to a view based on the evidence before them on whether an offender was under the influence of alcohol when they committed an offence. I ask hon. Members to think about the sort of problem that we are trying to tackle. The courts are well placed to determine whether someone was under the influence of alcohol. I direct the House&#039;s attention to the second limb of the offence, which is that for an order to be made, it must be necessary to protect the rest of the community. The courts will examine that closely before making an order.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51114-16_para4">
<a name="stpa_124">Amendment No. 6 would ensure that a court must consider only applications by the Crown. That would defeat part of our purpose, which is to encourage the proactive use of DBOs. The court would have to wait for the Crown to make an application; it would not be able to consider the matter of its own volition. That would weaken our proposals.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51114-16_para5">
<a name="stpa_125">Liberal Democrat amendment No. 30 would reimpose automatic reporting restrictions in proceedings for an order on conviction involving young people. Several hon. Members have said that they consider it useful not to bind the court to automatic reporting restrictions. That does not mean that restrictions cannot apply in specific, narrow cases if they are necessary for the protection of the individual. I happen to believe that if people have gone out, deliberately got drunk, got involved in violent behaviour under the influence of alcohol, and acted in a such a way that the court finds it necessary to make an order to protect the rest of the public, it is extremely hard to make a case for their name and details being kept a secret from the rest of the community, who have been the victims of that behaviour. Far from being a badge of honour, being banned from one&#039;s favourite pubs and clubs is likely to be a good incentive to change one&#039;s behaviour. In addition, it is important that local people are able to report it to the police if they see the individuals in question in pubs and clubs from which they are banned, so that action can be taken in relation to the breach.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51114-16_para6">
<a name="stpa_126">Government amendment No. 43 gives district councils the same right as county councils to make applications for DBOs, which is entirely right and proper. Government amendment No. 42 is merely a small consequential amendment. The other Government amendments are welcome tidying measures. Clause 23 is to be removed because, on reflection, we realised that the DBO provisions make the Licensed Premises (Exclusion of Certain Persons) Act 1980 superfluous. We can achieve everything that we want to achieve through the DBO route, which is a much better provision. The 1980 legislation is extremely narrow&#151;it depends on a conviction on the licensed premises themselves.

<a name="51114-16_para7">
<a name="stpa_127">The DBO is&#151;dare I say to the hon. Member for Woking?&#151;a more modern and appropriate way in which to deal with the mischief we encounter in our communities these days. I ask him and his hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve), who has taken a very legalistic approach to various pieces of our legislation, to think carefully about making sure that legislation is modern, flexible, about changing behaviour and able to cope with the new challenges that we face, rather than cleaving to the traditional interpretation of the law and focusing simply on prosecution. Making available ASBOs and DBOs is about making sure that our criminal justice system is modern, flexible and able to meet the challenges of this day and age.
</p>





<p><a name="st_180"><a name="51114-16_spnew2"><b> Mr. Malins: </b> 
 I confess to being disappointed by the Minister&#039;s response. The truth of the matter is that the Government have presided over a massive rise in binge drinking and alcohol-related violence, which they are doing very little to stop. The existing laws are not being enforced, but all the Government want to do is introduce a new flagship policy on the basis that a headline and a new Act will solve all their problems&#151;tell that to the people on the streets who are suffering as a result of alcohol-fuelled violence.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51114-16_para8">
<a name="stpa_128">New clause 1 seeks to amend the ASBO legislation to make it more flexible. Why on earth can the Minister not accept that making ASBO legislation more flexible is a good idea? She does not want to accept any arguments from this side of the House, as a result of which I want to put the new clause to the opinion of the House.

<a name="stpa_129">Conservative Members feel strongly about new clause 2 and I hope to test the opinion of the House on it. New clause 7, which the Liberal Democrats tabled, is roughly along the same lines. I hope also to speak briefly about amendments Nos. 20 and 21.

<a name="51114-17_para1">
<a name="stpa_130">As was said in an earlier debate, knife crime has rocketed in the past eight years. Recent reports show that knife crime in England and Wales has leaped by as much as 90 per cent. in two years in some areas. Figures that were released not long ago under the Freedom of Information Act 2000 show a total of nearly 25,000 knife crimes last year logged by the 30 police forces that supplied figures. The highest rise in knife crime was recorded by Nottinghamshire police. In Nottinghamshire, offences involving blades increased from 338 in 2002 to 650 last year&#151;a rise of 92 per cent. The number of muggings that involve knives has shot up. That worries us all, including the police. The assistant chief constable of Devon and Cornwall, Tony Melville, who is the Association of Chief Police Officers&#039; spokesman on knife crime, stated:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_25">&quot;Lots and lots of people are carrying knives in public places&#151;in many parts of society it now seems to be a credible and normal thing to carry a knife.&quot;</p>

<a name="51114-17_para2">
<a name="stpa_131">I have some experience of our courts sitting judicially. The offence of carrying a bladed article, which is contrary to section 139 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988, is not only prevalent but increasing. It is a terrifying experience for a complainant or victim to witness somebody in the street taking out a knife. Far too many people carry knives for offensive purposes. Doctors report a marked increase in the number of patients who 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>14 Nov 2005 : Column 733</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>arrive at accident and emergency with stab wounds. Such crime is not only on the increase but deadly serious and must be stamped out.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51114-17_para3">
<a name="stpa_132">I have listened to witnesses who gave evidence in criminal trials and recounted with terror how they felt when someone in the street drew a knife. They suffered nightmares for months afterwards. The amount of knife crime has undoubtedly increased&#151;there is a culture of the blade. Many young people believe it to be brave to carry a knife. In truth, it is cowardly. However, the number of prosecutions against people for carrying knives and the level of detection remain abysmally low. The courts do not pass sufficiently stiff sentences. They seem sometimes to have forgotten the importance of deterrence.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51114-17_para4">
<a name="stpa_133">I strongly commend new clause 2 to the House because it would send a signal to the knife-carrying fraternity that we want to see them severely punished. Under section 139 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988, it is an offence to carry a bladed article in a public place. There are certain defences, including having a reasonable excuse or lawful authority, but that is the basic offence. It applies to knives with a blade of 3 in or longer. Earlier today, the prevalence of knife-carrying in schools was mentioned, but it is happening not only in schools but out on the streets. I suggest that the police, if asked their opinion, would say that knife-carrying is one of the fastest-growing offences at the moment. It is therefore essential to give the courts the facility to sentence people on indictment to more than two years in prison for this quite dreadful offence.

</p>

<p>
<a name="51114-17_para5">
<a name="stpa_134">Some statistics might be of interest to the House. Charges relating to bladed articles have run at between roughly 4,500 and 6,500 a year over the past five years. In 1999, about 4,500 people were proceeded against for carrying a bladed article, of whom about 3,500 were found guilty. In 2003, about 6,800 were proceeded against, of whom 5,311 were found guilty. One might have thought that more people would go to prison for such a serious offence. Being confronted at any time, but particularly at night, by someone carrying a blade in the street is the most terrifying experience.
</p>





<p><a name="st_197"><a name="51114-17_spnew3"><b> Mr. Greg Knight  (East Yorkshire) (Con):</b> 
 Will my hon. Friend confirm that the wording of his new clause provides for an increase only in the maximum sentence for such offences, and not the minimum? The courts would therefore still have full discretion to impose a lesser sentence if they felt that the circumstances of the case warranted that.
</p>





<p><a name="st_198"><a name="51114-17_spnew4"><b> Mr. Malins: </b> 
 My right hon. Friend is absolutely right. The new clause would simply give a different maximum sentence, not a different minimum. By giving the courts that power, the Minister would permit them to retain the flexibility that they sometimes need. It would not at any stage prevent a court from imposing the sentence that it thought fit, be it considerably less than five years or even less than the current maximum of two years. As my right   hon. Friend says, however, it would permit the heavier sentence of five years to be passed in the worst cases. Critically, it would also send a signal to the 

<br>&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>knife-carrying fraternity that we will not put up with them and that Parliament is beginning to take notice of this increase in crime.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51114-17_para6">
<a name="stpa_135">As I said, 5,311 persons were found guilty of the offence of carrying a knife in a public place in 2003. How many of them were actually placed in custody? We might think that 50, 60 or 70 per cent. ought to have been placed in custody&#151;these figures include repeat offenders&#151;but the truth is that only 755, out of well over 5,000, faced a custodial sentence. That means that the people who carry knives on our streets understand that their chances of being caught are very slim, that detection rates are dropping, that they are unlikely to be prosecuted and that their chances of receiving a custodial sentence on conviction are only about one in seven. Times have never been better for the knife carrier, and it is high time that Parliament sent a message to the knife carrier that times are going to get worse.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51114-17_para7">
<a name="stpa_136">It is clear that knife crime has increased dramatically in the past few years, but I shall not go further into the figures. I shall simply repeat the fact that it is a terrifying crime. I cannot see any reason for the Government to object to new clause 2, which simply says that the maximum penalty for carrying a bladed article should be increased from two to five years. Such a sentence would not have to be imposed in every case. The advantage of such a measure is that it would send a signal to the courts that Parliament takes knife-carrying very seriously. It would send a signal to the people who carry knives that the maximum sentence that they could face had been increased from two years to five. It would also send a signal to the victims of knife crime that we take their side and want the courts to be much more robust in dealing with those who carry knives.

<a name="stpa_138">I have no criticism of the Government for introducing this measure; indeed, I would go further and say that it is much to be valued as a tool in our armoury against people who are part of the knife culture. The amendments are designed to tease out from the Minister whether bladed articles are included in the description &quot;dangerous weapon&quot; in clause 24.

<p>
<a name="51114-17_para12">
<a name="stpa_141">It is not entirely clear to me that section 141A actually applies to a bladed article, although such an offence is covered in section 139 of the Act. Will the Minister explain whether minding a weapon&#151;which, under clause 25 of the Bill, carries a sentence of up to four years&#151;includes minding a bladed article? For example, if it is an offence to mind or look after a knuckle-duster, a sword or some other weapon that is undoubtedly an offensive weapon per se, and the offender is liable to up to four years in prison, I can understand and readily accept that. However, the purpose of my two probing amendments is to determine whether a bladed article is covered by the description &quot;dangerous weapon&quot;. If it is, we shall find ourselves in a slightly odd situation.

<p>
<a name="51114-17_para13">
<a name="stpa_142">The maximum penalty for carrying a bladed article in public is at present two years in prison, but if I were to ask someone to look after that bladed article off the street, it would be an even more serious offence, carrying a four-year prison sentence. That would be slightly odd. Frankly, it is more serious for me to carry a bladed article in the street than to ask a friend to look after it in case I wanted to carry it in the street next week. The friend would thereby keep it off the street. It is strange, if I am right, that I am liable to four years for the second of those activities&#151;asking my friend to look after it&#151;but liable to only two years if, in effect, I am carrying it on the street.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51114-17_para14">
<a name="stpa_143">If bladed articles are included, can the Minister cover what appears to be an odd situation in terms of sentencing powers? If they are not included among dangerous weapons, can she tell us whether it is an offence if I ask somebody to look after a bladed instrument on the basis that I might shortly need to take it out on the street for offensive purposes? If that is not an offence, why not? The culture of the knife is on the up and it is vital that Parliament recognises that and sends a signal to the criminal fraternity, the world at large, the judiciary and victims of knife crime that we recognise how terrible it is and propose to give the courts a higher sentencing option in relation to the dreadful offence of carrying a bladed article in a public place. I can see no arguments from the Minister that can possibly resist my proposition in the new clause.

 I want to speak to new clause 7, which is not totally dissimilar to new clause 2, except that our provision exceeds that of the Conservatives by two years. I agree with everything that the hon. Member for Woking (Mr. Malins) said, because having a bladed article in a public place is punished with two years&#039; imprisonment whereas carrying a firearm is an offence punishable by up to seven years&#039; imprisonment.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51114-18_para0">
<a name="stpa_144">Whether one is murdered by a knife or gun, the result is precisely the same&#151;one is dead. That exactitude of outcome needs to be reflected by an exactitude of punishment, and perhaps more so in the case of knives as the incidence of knife purchase, carrying and use has soared in recent years, as has been said. That needs to be tackled. In response to an oral question from my hon. Friend the Member for Winchester (Mr. Oaten), the Home Secretary said that he would examine bringing gun and knife crimes more into line. The Bill provides the ideal opportunity for the Government to address that differential.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51114-18_para1">
<a name="stpa_145">I acknowledge that this part of the Bill presents a difficulty, and I appreciate what the Government are trying to achieve in relation to the reduction of knife crime. I fear, however, that one of their measures&#151;raising the age at which one can purchase a knife to 18&#151;might bring the law into disrepute, as it is difficult to imagine how it could be prosecuted. Under the Bill, all knives, however commonly available, would be subject to the offence if purchased under-age. The enforceability and effectiveness of the provision must therefore be questioned. It is ridiculous that people can get married and have children at 16 but not buy their cutlery. Someone under 18 might also legitimately ask a third party to purchase a knife for them, and no satisfactory answer has been given as to the culpability of the third party if a knife so circuitously purchased were used to kill.

<a name="stpa_146">A gun has limited use, but knives do not, so we believe that it would be better to strengthen the law in other areas and to propose restrictions on carrying in a public place and restrictions on what type of knife might fall under the provision. In relation to increasing the sentence for carrying knives in a public place to parity with that for guns, we believe that we are better able to tackle irresponsible and criminal use of knives and the mischief that the Government seek to address if we still allow the purchase of knives where that is done responsibly and for a harmless purpose.

I am pleased that he is campaigning on the issue and is trying to get the Government to take suitable action to deal with it.

Of course, it must be a legitimate defence that someone is carrying a dangerous-looking knife in the cause of their trade&#151;when people come to fit carpets or other floor coverings they often carry really frightening-looking knives, but they seem effective at doing their job, and such people would not be using them for criminal purposes. Although there is nothing about that in the Bill or in my hon. Friend&#039;s new clause, I hope that the Minister will reassure us that that is implied and will carry forward from previous legislation. Some mistaken comments have been made, which are unfortunate. We want a world in which law-abiding citizens, if they need a knife for the purpose of their trade or wish to take new knives back to their home, should be free to do so.

<a name="stpa_148">A stronger signal should be sent out, however, that the rising tide of knife crime is unacceptable and that if people are caught in public places with knives around their person for no good reason, very strong action will be taken. Although a person carrying a knife might not go out with a criminal intent, if they get involved in an argument or come under the influence of drink all sorts of dreadful things might happen that could not happen if that person has been persuaded not to carry the knife in the first place.

<br>&nbsp;<br>different though related offence&#151;possession of an offensive weapon, under the Prevention of Crime Act 1953&#151;which has a maximum penalty of four years. Which offence people will be charged with, and which offence is fulfilled, is a matter of circumstances. It is sometimes said that the second offence of possession of an offensive weapon is hardly ever prosecuted. I am happy to reassure Members that figures for 2004 showed that around 5,800 people were convicted of the more serious offence, which has a maximum penalty of four years, which is broadly the same number as were charged with the lesser offence of possession of a knife or bladed weapon. It is not a little-used offence, which is why the prosecuting authorities and police consider carefully which category defendants ought to fall into.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51114-18_para6">
<a name="stpa_150">An &quot;offensive weapon&quot; means any article made or adapted for use for causing injury to the person, or intended by the person having it with him for such use by him or some other person. Clearly, therefore, the nature of the weapon, and the intention of the person carrying it, are an issue. There are certain key factors that put the offender into one category rather than the other. The first is the weapon itself&#151;there is a whole schedule of different weapons that cannot be perceived as having any innocent use, such as butterfly knives, disguised knives and sword sticks, which are offensive weapons per se. If one is caught with those, one is automatically subject to the offence that carries the higher maximum penalty of four years. An offender can be charged with that more serious offence if he is in possession of, say, a kitchen knife, but threatens others with it&#151;as was mentioned, if he draws it in the night, frightens people with it, or it is shown that he planned to use it. Someone who draws what would otherwise be an innocuous item in a threatening way, with intention to use it, may be judged to have committed the more serious offence, which carries a maximum of four years&#039; imprisonment. The two-year maximum relates to the simple act of being in possession of a knife that is capable of being used non-violently in a public place. As the hon. Member for Woking says, we want to ensure that decent law-abiding citizens can still buy knives that could be used entirely legitimately without falling foul of the law. There is already a defence of having a knife with good reason or lawful authority.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51114-18_para7">
<a name="stpa_151">I think we agree that maximum penalties should generally be proportionate, the aim being to indicate the relative seriousness of the crime. New clause 2 would raise the maximum sentence to five years, while the Liberal Democrats&#039; new clause 7 would raise it to seven. I do not think that we are in the business of having a Dutch auction, but a comparator might be the offence of causing actual bodily harm, which carries a maximum penalty of five years in prison. Injury caused by that offence can be minor, but it is nevertheless real injury. Someone who simply possesses a knife without any intention of using it or threatening anyone with it could be subject to a higher maximum prison sentence than someone who had actually caused physical injury. That is why we believe that a two-year sentence is adequate for the former offence. Of course those who use knives are subject to penalties for offences ranging from actual bodily harm, grievous bodily harm and wounding with

<a name="stpa_160">Let me return to the important principle of a maximum sentence. I repeat that it is a maximum, not a    minimum. Conservative Members believe that a maximum sentence of two years for carrying a bladed article is too low, in view of the enormous increase in such offences. The Minister said that the maximum sentence for carrying an offensive weapon was four years. We do not need to discuss what constitutes an offensive weapon; we know that a knuckleduster, for instance, is an offensive weapon per se. On the other hand, items made or adapted for offensive purposes can also come under the definition of offensive weapons. A perfectly innocent item such as a baseball bat, or a cricket bat&#151;I apologise to the cricketers among us, if there are any&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i> I understand that there are distinguished cricketers on the Conservative Benches; and I forgot to mention your vital role, Mr. Deputy Speaker, in relation to parliamentary cricket, which is on our minds all the time and is much appreciated. Anyway, carrying a cricket bat in public with unlawful intent would put someone in the frame for carrying an offensive weapon. Actually, I would rather come across someone carrying a cricket bat in public than a bladed article. On that note, I believe that it is important to test the House&#039;s opinion on whether the maximum sentence for a vicious, nasty offence of carrying a bladed article in public should, in these difficult times, be lifted to five years maximum. I believe that it should and I hope that the House does, too.

<p><a name="st_255"><a name="51114-21_spnew1"><b> Lynne Featherstone: </b> 
 I suppose that this chapter is probably where lies most legislative disorder. In all the amendments, I am trying to separate the chaff from the wheat, the good from the bad, and the honest and good landlord from the misbehaving landlord. We have concerns about the one-for-all and all-for-one approach in the imposition of alcohol disorder zones. We have been promised that guidance will make a differential in charging between the good and the bad, but as yet we have not seen formal guidance of any clarity that would allow us to have confidence that there will be a sufficient differential so that good landlords are not penalised.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51114-21_para1">
<a name="stpa_162">There should be cause and effect, and punishment should be set out in the Bill. There seems to be more emphasis on location than on behaviour. I am not sure that that is a good principle or approach in terms of charging. We need a more causal link to establish whether premises or a pub have contributed to alcohol-related disturbances. Amendments Nos. 38 and 39 would establish a causal link between the alcohol-related disturbance and the licensed premises, be they a club, a pub or whatever.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51114-21_para2">
<a name="stpa_163">If responsible establishments are caught in an area where ADZs are brought into being and those responsible find that they have to pay the charge, that is not only unfair but is a disincentive for licence holders to maintain good standards, when they are effectively to be penalised by the irresponsibility of other establishments. This approach appears to be somewhat contrary to the Government&#039;s consultation paper, &quot;Drinking Responsibly&quot;, which has very much targeted responsible premises.
</p>

<p>

 I am pleased to be able to speak against the amendment. The proposals for the alcohol disorder zones are an important tool to deal with the specific syndrome that has developed around drinking in some of our towns and inner cities. Of course some licensees are good, but others are worse. However, the sum effect of having a large number of drinking venues in a small area is a cycle of behaviour that is destructive to the environment in a town centre and to behaviour in general. It also has an effect on what happens to crime and disorder in those areas.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51114-21_para8">
<a name="stpa_169">We all know of that type of behaviour, which I described to some hilarity in Committee. It ranges from the mildly disorderly to the outrageously criminal. Some serious fights can happen in the course of an evening. If we are to crack that behaviour, which damages the economy in the town centre, spoils the environment and is a massive drain on police resources, we must have an effective tool. The alcohol disorder zone provides just that. It makes it possible to consider the servicing of a designated area and to make the industry realise that if it is going to take large amounts of money from young people in the area, it also has to deal with the consequences of their behaviour.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51114-21_para9">
<a name="stpa_170">Many sections of the leisure industry oppose the measure. Indeed, I consulted some licensees in my area and they were opposed to it. I can understand why. No one wants to pay out money, and they do not want to pay what they perceive to be an extra amount when they 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>14 Nov 2005 : Column 750</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>have already paid their business charges. However, there is good reason for saying that it is appropriate to charge people in the sector extra for the services that they receive.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51114-21_para10">
<a name="stpa_171">One argument to support that is the amount that is made out of alcohol. When I went around with the police in my patch some time ago, I talked to licensees about the money that people spent across the bars. Northampton is reckoned to be part of the golden triangle for 18 to 24-year-olds, and they have one of the highest levels of disposable income of people in their age group anywhere in the country. The owner of one of the venues in the town centre thought that some of the best clients spent about &#163;1,200 a person a month just on drink. That is an astonishing amount. High profits are to be made, and it is only fair that the industry is told about the costs of running the sector.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51114-21_para11">
<a name="stpa_172">Any town centre business has to pay for a certain level of policing because town centres need extra policing. They also need more street cleaning because there is a heavier footfall. I would also argue&#151;the industry needs to consider this&#151;that the cost of policing the late-night leisure industry is a disproportionate burden that should not be borne by general council tax payers. There is a disproportionate amount of littering from all kinds of sources. There is also more substantial cleansing because of people&#039;s behaviour when drunk. In addition, there is the completely disproportionate cost of policing.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51114-21_para12">
<a name="stpa_173">The policing of Northampton town centre&#151;I guess other areas are the same&#151;is a drain on the routine police resources that are supposed to cover the whole county. It is unjust that people who expect to pay for policing to cover burglaries and crime in the suburbs should have the staffing resources pulled into the town centre on a Friday and Saturday night to manage the behaviour of one section of the community&#151;the young people&#151;and to manage objectionable events, such as fights, which can also be serious crimes. People do not think that the police should spend their time chasing drunken young people and managing their behaviour in the middle of town. The football industry has had to take account of its special policing needs and the costs fall on the clubs. We should say to the leisure industry in certain areas, &quot;Look. The costs are disproportionate and you have to bear some of them.&quot;

<a name="51114-21_para13">
<a name="stpa_174">I hope that Northampton borough council takes note of the Bill and uses it to sort out the town centre. The problem with the amendment, as with other amendments throughout our deliberations, is that it would make the measures unworkable. That is wrong. On the causal link, the problem is what happens in a town centre as a whole, not in one pub. Young people will go from one licensed premises to the next in the course of the night. They will end up in the worst place, where the drinks are cheapest, but there will be problems right the way down the line. It is wrong to table an amendment that would make the provision unworkable.

 That is not the case. We think that we have to tackle town centre disorder and believe in the &quot;polluter pays&quot; principle, but we want to make the legislation more workable because there might be the unintended consequence of small businesses going broke. Does the hon. Lady think that it would have been more convincing if the Government had widened the powers of local authorities to apply saturation policies and limit the number of establishments? She is right: most trouble is caused where many places are close together.

 When we talked about another provision in Committee, the Liberal Democrats said that we could not issue drinking banning orders without psychiatric reports. That was nonsense&#151;I was going to say nutty&#151;because, again, it would have made the provisions unworkable. Young people move around a town centre where there are a number of licensed premises, drinking as they go. It is ridiculous to ask, &quot;Where did you drink the particular tot that got you over the top?&quot; One might just as well ask where they ate their fish and chips that night and ban the fish and chip shop.

 In that case, why does the hon. Lady reject the idea of capping the amount that could be charged?

Given that there will be no cap, businesses are scared that they will go broke.

<p><a name="st_260"><a name="51114-22_spnew3"><b> Ms Keeble: </b> 
 Of course businesses will claim that they will go broke, but that happens for all kinds of different reasons. The issue is how to manage the behaviour that is seen in town centres and encourage the industry to act more responsibly. The Bill contains a range of measures, and the provision for alcohol disorder zones is an important one. The zone and the charging can be structured in various ways, but it will not work if only applied to bad licensees. No one will admit to being an irresponsible licensee.

 No, I do not, because some areas have had voluntary charging schemes that have worked fine.

Frankly, if the Government had introduced a Bill in which they had set out certain other purposes for which it should be used, including street cleansing, as least we would have something to debate tonight, whereas the truth is that we have nothing to debate at all.

There are ways of prosecuting such people, but if we accepted the Liberal amendments we would have to find out which pub caused the alcohol level that induced the violent offence, which would be absolutely impossible.

Member for Stockport is passionate about wishing to control disorder in Stockport, I am passionate about wishing to control disorder anywhere in our country, especially places near my constituency.

Drunkenness spills out across the town centre, and councillors are likely to want to make the whole area into a zone.

The only thing that it is likely to do is drive more of the decent businesses out of town centres to areas where they will not become part of a zone, thus compounding the problem in the town centre, where the wrong kind of businesses will remain.

Members, so I will not address it at length. However, the problem does not, as the hon. Member for Northampton, North (Ms Keeble) suggested, stem from the fact it is difficult to isolate individual premises that supply the drink that makes someone drunk or pushes them beyond that point, causing them to come into conflict with the forces of law and order. The problem is that the Government are introducing proposals that financially penalise businesses that operate in the alcohol disorder zone, whatever they do, whether it is right or wrong.

<a name="stpa_234">Under those circumstances, the burden of proof rests with the Government to demonstrate that all those businesses share the blame. There is a risk that the proposals will be counter-productive. In Committee, the Minister talked about various programmes and schemes, including the &quot;best bar none&quot; scheme, to which premises could subscribe. They could sign up to best practice proposals and do everything that the Government and the rest of society expected of them by refusing to serve people who were drunk, by behaving responsibly, and by operating their businesses in a way that minimised any disorder outside their premises, but they would still be liable for payment in an alcohol disorder zone. If that is the case, there is a danger that those businesses will simply throw up their hands and say, &quot;Why should I bother?

The assumption made by those who framed the proposal is that people who live or operate and work in a particular area of town that the council has designated an alcohol disorder zone must be contributing to the problem and will therefore be charged for the expense of sorting it out. That is fundamentally unfair. If we want premises to comply with all the wonderful schemes and positive measures that have been introduced they will not be encouraged to do so if they are subject to a financial penalty, whether or not they take those measures. The Government must address that difficulty if alcohol disorder zones are to be as effective as they want them to be and, even more worryingly, if they are not to cause our town centres, pubs and clubs to be less inclined to do precisely the things that they would like them to do.

<a name="stpa_235">The principle of the polluter pays together with the use of market forces to meet the social costs incurred by businesses is well established. Our debate has centred on whether everyone engaged in the licensed trade is responsible to some extent for those social costs. A number of hon. Members have concluded that some people in the licensed trade sell alcohol but do not contribute to the social costs and, if we accept that argument, the legislation is unjust and unfair. I have listened closely to all the arguments, and some Members said that some individuals are more culpable than others. It was said that some are culpable, but others are not culpable at all.

<a name="stpa_236">We have heard a wide range of examples, but when people sell alcohol, especially in an area with a collection of pubs and licensed premises, everyone is culpable to some extent. As has been pointed out, when people go out for the night, they often go from pub to pub until the alcohol in their blood stream builds up and they engage in antisocial behaviour. It is difficult to pinpoint the premises concerned because, as all our constituents know, the disorder is not always associated with premises. It does not happen inside or immediately outside the door&#151;it could happen half a mile away. It is therefore difficult to identify who is culpable.

 Whether one sells alcohol responsibly or not, someone could buy one drink in one pub and another drink in another pub.

 It is a difficult question. We have to define the zone fairly well, but just because there are difficulties we cannot take the view that we should not try to recoup some of the costs associated with alcohol-related disorder.

I do not accept that we can take a black-and-white view in which some are wholly guiltless and make no contribution to the problems. We would run into great difficulties if we tried to do so. No landlord will say, &quot;I am a bad landlord.&quot; All will say that they are good landlords, but we know that some try to get as much money as they can from youngsters in as short a time as possible. Those people will be penalised more than those who attempt to reduce the effects of the sale of alcohol.

 The hon. Gentleman talked about someone going to 10 pubs and having one drink in each. Does he agree that it is likely that the landlord of the 10th pub is being less responsible because the chances are&#151;it depends on the individual&#039;s tolerance&#151;that by that point the individual is already intoxicated and selling alcohol to them is already an offence? Does he agree that enforcing the existing law is a way of dealing with the problem.
</p>





<p><a name="st_295"><a name="51114-26_spnew4"><b> Sammy Wilson: </b> 
 That point has been made, and I accept it. However, it is not just the last landlord&#151;others have contributed to the individual&#039;s drunkenness. Disorderly behaviour does not require a person to be totally drunk&#151;sometimes their inhibitions are lowered

<br>&nbsp;<br>simply by the consumption of some alcohol. It would be difficult to establish a cut-off point&#151;to determine the point at which the person became drunk and hold only the one landlord responsible.

<p>
<a name="51114-26_para4">
<a name="stpa_241">The whole idea of alcohol disorder zones is that they will be a last resort. It is not that we think that police and local authorities should seek an ADZ in the face of one or two irresponsible premises. They should use the powers under the Licensing Act 2003 and the much strengthened powers available under our new licensing legislation to bear down on individual premises. An ADZ is designed to deal with a significant number of premises and a general problem, and the process of applying for an ADZ makes that clear. In Committee we debated the process at some length&#151;there will be an initial proposal, then an action plan and time to implement it, and only if that does not work will the point of designating an alcohol disorder zone be reached. Just as drinking banning orders are designed to achieve behaviour change on the part of individuals, ADZs are intended to secure behaviour change on the part of licensees of licensed premises, nightclubs and other organisations. Our aim is to ensure that people take some collective responsibility for the problems that all too often beset us in our town and city centres. The hon. Member for East Antrim (Sammy Wilson) made some good points about differentiation, which I shall deal with later in my speech.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51114-26_para5">
<a name="stpa_242">Liberal Democrat amendments Nos. 38 and 39 are about culpability&#151;their aim is to make a connection between the behaviour and the charge. My hon. Friend the Member for Stockport (Ann Coffey) gave a most passionate explanation of the policy and made it clear that if we were to accept the amendments, ADZs would be unworkable. The note I made asks, &quot;Was it the gin and tonic in the cocktail lounge that caused the bad behaviour, or was it the pint of lager in the Rat and Parrot that made the people drunk and get involved in a fight later, when they were seeking a kebab or a taxi?&quot; It is almost impossible to ascertain which was the drink that tipped someone into committing the sort of violent crime and disorder that we want to tackle.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51114-26_para6">
<a name="stpa_243">Having said that, we have tried to ensure that the charges that we shall introduce relate to the degree of risk emanating from individual premises and reflect as far as possible the extra services that will be provided to those premises, whether they be extra enforcement visits by the police, extra test purchasing by trading standards to determine whether alcohol is being sold to under-age youngsters, or extra street cleaning directly outside the premises to deal with the unfortunate behaviour of the patrons of those premises. A real attempt is being made to make sure that we take a bespoke approach.

 I am pleased to hear the Minister talk about behaviour change because more emphasis should

<br>&nbsp;<br>be placed on that aspect. Bournemouth has a lot of challenges with the night-time economy. Clause 12(2) states that provision will be made for a local authority to impose charges. What might the maximum charge be?

 I am aware that the hon. Gentleman&#039;s constituency experiences a lot of night-time disorder and I commend his local police force, which was one of the first to issue fixed-penalty notices in the city centre, which has made a big difference. I am not in a position to say that there will be a specific maximum charge; I am trying to ensure that there is some local flexibility regarding different premises.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51114-26_para7">
<a name="stpa_244">I say to the hon. Member for Woking that no, we do not have the regulations before us. However, since before the Committee stage the hon. Gentleman has had a fairly extensive paper that set out the range of costs based on the level of interventions and on factors such as basic pay, allowances, national insurance and superannuation. The paper offered a detailed calculation of the potential costs. It described several options for charges and we decided on option 1, which is to aim as far as possible for bespoke charges for individual premises without creating a completely bureaucratic system. The paper discussed exemptions from the compulsory charge&#151;restaurants, hotels, theatres and gyms would be exempt under the two limbs of the exemption clause. We set out the process for obtaining an alcohol disorder zone designation and, in annexe B, we set out in some detail all the types of activity that could be funded under an ADZ, including employment of door staff and taxi marshals and additional street cleaning. It is uncharacteristically unfair of the hon. Gentleman to say that that information was not provided. The paper was a lengthy exposition of the matters that will be covered in regulation and guidance.

 Can the Minister see that it is difficult for hon.

If she wants us to eat her dish&#151;she says that it is tasty&#151;she should tell us its price.

<p><a name="st_302"><a name="51114-27_spnew1"><b> Hazel Blears: </b> 
 We will introduce regulations, which will be subject to debate, but today we should debate the principle of alcohol disorder zones.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51114-27_para0">
<a name="stpa_247">I am happy to confirm to the hon. Member for East Antrim that different charges will be based on a risk assessment of extra enforcement activity in relation to individual premises, and the risk assessment for a 1,000 capacity nightclub may be very different from that for a small local pub. We will also examine discounts, which cannot be introduced until we have introduced the principles and standards code of practice to which the industry will sign up. Once that agreement is in place, people who abide by the provisions in the code of practice will be eligible for discounts, which, at least partially, addresses the point raised by the hon. Member for Hornsey and Wood Green that people who comply with the action plan should be subject to a lower charge. When bar and pub owners do their best to be responsible, it should be acknowledged.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51114-27_para1">
<a name="stpa_248">I want to discuss the individual amendments, because we need a little time to discuss some of the other provisions in the Bill. I reject the amendments that seek to establish an audit trail and culpability, which is not the idea behind alcohol disorder zones. I reject the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Woking on decisions being made in Whitehall, which would be extremely bureaucratic. This is a local power and it should be used locally. When an area is defined, tension may arise, which is why I said in Committee that the police and the local authority must be careful when they draw the boundary and make sure that it is not either too wide or too narrow to catch the mischief that they are seeking to address.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51114-27_para2">
<a name="stpa_249">Opposition amendments Nos. 15 and 16 would prescribe the purposes to which funding may be put, but we do not need to include such a provision in the Bill. I made it clear in Committee that the range of additional interventions will be set out in regulations and guidance and I discussed police enforcement and trading standards test purchasing. For example, environmental health officers can deal with excessive noise, which causes a significant problem for many of our constituents, and areas such as street cleaning are important, too.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51114-27_para3">
<a name="stpa_250">Liberal Democrat amendments Nos. 33, 40 and 41 seek to widen the exemption. At the moment, the exemption has two limbs&#151;whether the principal use of the premises is the sale and supply of alcohol and whether the principal reason why people visit a premises is to obtain alcohol. In order to obtain an exemption, people must meet both limbs of that test, and as I said in Committee, hotels and restaurants&#151;I also mentioned gyms and theatres in my letter&#151;would meet that exemption test.

</p>

<p>
<a name="51114-27_para4">
<a name="stpa_251">The Liberal Democrat amendments seek to narrow the exemption test in one way and to widen it in another. Under those amendments, an irresponsible hotel or restaurant would be responsible for the charges, despite having met the test. However, that returns us to the first issue, which is that one would have to be able to see that that individual premise was causing the problem. If an individual premise causes a problem, consideration should be given to using the powers in the Licensing Act 2003 to address that narrow point.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51114-27_para5">
<a name="stpa_252">Amendment No. 41 seeks to widen the limb, but it is not appropriate. It would allow people who comply with the action plan not to contribute to costs, but that might be difficult. If the action plan included making a financial contribution in order to facilitate the introduction of proper street-cleaning services, the viability of the alcohol disorder zone might be at risk if several premises did not have to contribute.

<p><a name="st_303"><a name="51114-27_spnew2"><b> Lynne Featherstone: </b> 
 In Committee, I tabled an amendment about moneys going on other services, such as cleaning, but the Minister said that it was not necessary because services in an alcohol disorder zone will be provided by the police and the local authority only, so there will be no need to distribute any other money.
</p>





<p><a name="st_304"><a name="51114-27_spnew3"><b> Hazel Blears: </b>

<a name="51114-27_para6">
<a name="stpa_253">Amendments Nos. 7 and 9 address the regulations. In Committee, I said that regulations will be introduced to cover appeals on payment collection and enforcement of the charge. I cannot give the hon. Member for Woking the precise details of the appeals process, but the procedure to appeal against local authorities&#039; charging facilities is well established and I am sure that we will follow it. If we intend to depart from that course, I will let him have the information.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51114-27_para7">
<a name="stpa_254">Amendment No. 9 includes a more general right of appeal to a court and, again, we have been over that ground before. The process of making an alcohol disorder zone includes sufficient checks and balances to make a formal appeal structure&#151;which would simply drag out the process&#151;unnecessary. The joint local authority and police trigger means that both of those bodies must consent, and there is also a formal consultation process, the eight-week period to allow the commencement of an action plan and a formal three-monthly review of designation. Those robust checks and balances should be sufficient for us not to have a formal appeal process.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51114-27_para8">
<a name="stpa_255">The final issue concerns the offence of persistently selling alcohol to under-age youngsters, which is clearly important. The hon. Member for Woking wants to increase the fine to a level not exceeding &#163;10,000. However, the Licensing Act 2003 increased the fine from &#163;1,000 to &#163;5,000, which is proportionate, and it also includes the power to suspend a licence for up to three months, which is a vigorous remedy. A premises licence holder could be based in London while their business is located in Manchester, and if their offence is simply a matter of neglect, even if it is criminal neglect, a custodial sentence would be a harsh punishment.

</p>





<p><a name="st_324"><a name="51114-28_spmin1"><b>Mr. Deputy Speaker:</b> 
 The right hon. Gentleman is right. We are proceeding in the way in which the House has already agreed. The time spent on each group of amendments is entirely a matter for those taking part.

 With little time on the clock, I declare my interest as the holder of a shot gun licence, the owner of an air rifle and a member of the British Association for Shooting and Conservation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51114-28_para1">
<a name="stpa_259">I am belatedly pleased that the Government have tabled amendments to deal with some matters that we raised in Committee. However, many thousands of people continue to be worried by the uncertainty that has been caused by the manner in which the Bill has progressed. We wholeheartedly support measures that will have a genuine, practical effect on reducing gun crime in the UK and making our systems safer. However, we do not support clauses that create laws for the sake of being seen to be tough on gun crime, but whose effect will be felt almost exclusively by legitimate users of weapons, not the criminals on whom we intend to crack down.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51114-28_para2">
<a name="stpa_260">The root of the remaining problems with part 2 is that we do not believe that sufficient consultation has been held with affected as well as expert bodies. Where is the firearms advisory committee, which should have been 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>14 Nov 2005 : Column 773</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>the proper body to consult about the Bill? The Government said that they would form that committee before abolishing their previous consulting committee, but they failed to do that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51114-28_para3">
<a name="stpa_261">The Government have yet to publish anything that relates to the 4,000-odd responses to the May 2004 consultation paper on controls on firearms. I submitted a request under the Freedom of Information Act 2000, but it elicited the entirely unsatisfactory response that the information would still not be released. This adds further weight to our grave concerns about the fundamental basis of this part of the Bill.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51114-28_para4">
<a name="stpa_262">On amendment No. 108, our position remains that the impact of the changes to the law two years ago should be assessed fully before yet further laws penalising legitimate users of air weapons are introduced. Clause 27 requires anyone who sells air weapons by way of trade or business to register with the police as a firearms dealer. The Minister said in Committee that the registration fee was likely to be &#163;150 per establishment. Will she please confirm that that is the case?
</p>

<p>
<a name="51114-28_para5">
<a name="stpa_263">In Committee, the Minister undertook to provide information on how the licensing regime was to work. On Thursday night last week, we received a letter which hardly explained the situation. Perhaps she could now explain, for example, what a fishing store would have to do in order to continue to be able to sell air weapons, and how long it would take to do it. Clause 27 would prohibit any person other than a registered dealer from selling or transferring air weapons. Where is the evidence that airguns are misused through being obtained through trade sources rather than private sales? It is hard enough to accept these changes to the Bill so late in the day, but to do so without being given anything to support, explain or justify the clauses relating to air weapons is quite another matter. As I said in Committee, clauses 27 and 28, when taken together with clause 29, will have a serious and unjustifiably adverse effect on legitimate users of airguns and on persons carrying on the business of selling them.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51114-28_para6">
<a name="stpa_264">Amendment No. 108 seeks to remove the burdensome, impractical and pointless requirement to keep a register of air weapons. I want to address the amendment in the context of clause 27 as a whole, because they are inextricably linked. I raised this issue in Committee, but the Minister did not address it at the time. There are an estimated 7 million air weapons in circulation in this country. I do not think that the Government are proposing that those 7 million weapons should be registered; I believe that only future sales will be affected. Perhaps the Minister will confirm that. If that is the case, how would the measure work in practice? If clause 27 does not propose to register the existing 7 million air weapons, will not subsection (2)&#151;which would require a register of transactions&#151;be futile? There will be 7 million unregistered air weapons in circulation, and this proposal would merely impose a disproportionate administrative burden on registered firearms dealers. The requirement to maintain full records of air weapons sales in a firearms register would simply be unnecessary red tape.


<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>

<p>
<a name="51114-28_para7">
<a name="stpa_265">Fewer than 50 per cent. of airguns are sold by registered firearms dealers. The majority are sold by sports shops, fishing shops and similar outlets. No evidence has been produced to show that airguns sold through registered firearms dealers are more or less likely to be misused than those sold through other retail outlets. There is no evidence that retailers who are not registered firearms dealers are irresponsible in selling airguns to the public. Nor is there evidence to suggest that the proposed restrictions will improve public safety.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51114-28_para8">
<a name="stpa_266">A simpler system would involve creating a lawful check on the sale of firearms, but without the need for registration. One such system could involve ensuring that any person who wished to sell air weapons should apply in writing to the police for written authority to do so. This would essentially be a much simpler system of licensing. If the police believed that the applicant was not a fit person to sell airguns, they could refuse to give their authority. The applicant could then be given the right of appeal. As we said in Committee, a modified form of licensing would be more acceptable, but no changes have been forthcoming from the Government since then. Rather than requiring full registration, regulation could be achieved by using simpler, less restrictive regimes. What I continue to find most bizarre is that the Home Office consultation paper of May 2004 stated that
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_56">&quot;we do not therefore believe that there should be a system of licensing or further restrictions on the sale of air guns&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>

<p>
<a name="51114-28_para9">
<a name="stpa_267">I must ask the Minister why the Government are ignoring their own advice.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51114-28_para10">
<a name="stpa_268">Banning the sale of air weapons except through registered firearms dealers approved by the police is an impractical, draconian, burdensome and disproportionate measure, and the Government have failed to provide any evidence that it will have any effect on violent crime. It will serve only to penalise business people and sports persons involved in shooting.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51114-28_para11">
<a name="stpa_269">In the Home Office regulatory impact assessment, the Home Office recognises that licensing all air weapons would result in a significant decrease in sales of air weapons and a significant impact on business. The assessment stated:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_57">&quot;We understand that the majority of air weapons are sold through small dealers and tackle shops, so small firms would be affected disproportionately.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51114-28_para12">
<a name="stpa_270">It remains unclear exactly how many small sellers would actually convert to getting a firearms licence. The cost and inconvenience could be disproportionate, and again, business as well as sport could suffer.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51114-28_para13">
<a name="stpa_271">The more important point for the Minister to show is exactly how that will reduce violent crime involving air weapons. While the clause will make it more difficult for lawful users to acquire air weapons, there is no evidence that that will affect the level of misuse.
</p>





<p><a name="st_326"><a name="51114-28_spnew3"><b> Stewart Hosie  (Dundee, East) (SNP):</b> 
 I am listening carefully to the hon. Gentleman, as I did in Committee. He is very much opposed to a licensing scheme, and I know that he was very much opposed to a personal purchaser licensing scheme. In the light of that, can he explain why the Conservative group on Dundee city council, along with the Labour and Liberal group, voted tonight for such a licensing scheme?

<p><a name="st_327"><a name="51114-29_spnew0"><b> Mr. Djanogly: </b> 
 I have no idea why the Conservative group voted for such a scheme. The policy of this Conservative group is that the scheme as proposed by the Government is unworkable and impractical. If we are to have any scheme at all, that which is offered tonight is not the correct one.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51114-29_para0">
<a name="stpa_272">Amendment No. 190 relates to clause 28, which requires the sale of air weapons by way of trade or business to be face-to-face. Once again, we find ourselves asking where exactly the evidence is to support this draconian measure. It is appreciated that the clause is intended to outlaw all sales via the internet or mail order, but in Committee the Minister raised more questions than she answered. We tabled the amendment to draw attention to that. Under the amendment, the clause would be restricted to apply only to air weapons with a muzzle energy in excess of 1 J. As we discussed in Committee, that is not regarded as a lethal barrelled weapon, and is the kind commonly used in airsoft and other legitimate activities. To recap on our little Committee chat on muzzle energies, which Members will remember, 1 J is the equivalent impact to a tennis ball being bounced against the floor.
</p>





<p><a name="st_328"><a name="51114-29_spnew1"><b> Mr. Philip Hollobone  (Kettering) (Con):</b> 
 I am grateful to my hon. Friend for raising the sport of airsoft. I have been contacted by Mr. Christie from my constituency, on behalf of 100 airsofters in Kettering who are very worried about the implications of the Bill. I welcome my hon. Friend&#039;s contribution on that subject.
</p>





<p><a name="st_329"><a name="51114-29_spnew2"><b> Mr. Djanogly: </b> 
 My hon. Friend makes a valid intervention, not least because, as a result of timetabling, unfortunately, we will not reach the relevant amendments on airsoft, which, he will be pleased to know, we defended in Committee, and I would have done so again today if I had had the opportunity.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51114-29_para1">
<a name="stpa_273">The point about the muzzle velocity is that it is very low impact&#151;that is the sort of air weapon that I suspect would be involved in the majority of mail order sales. Precisely for those reasons, we believe that air weapons with a muzzle energy of 1 J or less should be exempted from this unnecessary red tape. We raised legitimate concerns about internet sales from outside the United Kingdom, and the Minister assured us that she was doing all that she could in relation to internet sales and ensuring international co-operation on that front. Will she tell us how she plans to achieve that international co-operation, and what plans are in place to facilitate that?
</p>

<p>
<a name="51114-29_para2">
<a name="stpa_274">In relation to internet sales, a major source of concern is sales originating outside the United Kingdom, where guns are more readily available and often cheaper. About 2,500 registered firearms dealers are spread across Great Britain, of which between 1,000 and 1,200 sell airguns by retail. The remainder are specialist dealers or those who do not sell by retail. There are between 1,000 and 1,200 retailers of airguns that are not registered firearms dealers. Thus there are some 2,400 retail outlets for airguns spread across England, Wales and Scotland. It follows that in many areas, particularly rural ones, direct access to a retailer of airguns would involve considerable time and expense without mail order.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51114-29_para3">
<a name="stpa_275">As we well know, clause 29, to which amendment No. 110 relates, raises the age from 17 to 18 at which a person may purchase or hire an airgun or ammunition for an

<b>14 Nov 2005 : Column 776</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>airgun. The clause also raises the minimum age from 17 to 18 at which a person may have with him an airgun or ammunition for that airgun. We remain totally unconvinced as to the justification for raising the age limit for buying an air weapon from 17 to 18. The Minister has repeatedly avoided giving any evidence to show that 17-year-olds are heavily involved in air weapon misuse.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51114-29_para4">
<a name="stpa_276">The fact is that the evidence needed to justify the clause has not been forthcoming. Airguns are the gateway to other shooting sports and unjustified diminution in airgun sales will therefore have a knock-on effect on all shooting sports. Furthermore if a reduction in the number of retail outlets is coupled with a requirement for face-to-face sales, people in rural areas will be hit especially hard, and many will be deterred from acquiring airguns.

 So far the hon. Gentleman has concentrated on sports clubs and rural communities. Has he anything to say about the Bill&#039;s effect on urban communities, particularly in inner city areas such as those in London where gun crime is rife and people have been killed and maimed daily?

 If the hon. Gentleman thinks that restricting airgun sales to those aged 17 or 18 will have any material impact on violent crime by youths in our inner cities, he has another think coming.
</p>





<p><a name="st_332"><a name="51114-29_spnew5"><b> Mr. David Heath  (Somerton and Frome) (LD):</b> 
 May I ask a question that is relevant to what was said by the hon. Member for Paisley and Renfrewshire, North (Jim Sheridan)? Surely the effects of airgun use on an inner city estate are very different from the effects on a constituency such as mine or that of the hon. Member for Huntingdon (Mr. Djanogly), where most people who use airguns will use them responsibly as part of their sport. Should we not be extremely careful about imposing unnecessary restrictions on the sporting use of guns&#151;a road down which we have gone before&#151;if it will not have the practical effect for which we all hope, which is the reduction of illegal gun use in cities?
</p>





<p><a name="st_333"><a name="51114-29_spnew6"><b> Mr. Djanogly: </b> 
 That is a fair point. The truth is that the measures that we are discussing now will not have the effect that the Government want. Of course, we are discussing elements of a much larger Bill. Along with other Conservative Members and, indeed, Liberal Democrats, I made it clear in Committee that we wanted to reduce gun crime. We have a problem with specific issues, and this is one of them.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51114-29_para5">
<a name="stpa_277">As I have said, changes in firearms legislation should be soundly based on consultation and evidence, not just on a perceived need to be seen to be doing something for the sake of it. According to the regulatory impact assessment, the vast majority of the 4,000-odd responses to the consultation paper that commented on air weapons&#151;incidentally, we have not had access to those responses: they were received by the Government, but not by us&#151;favoured tackling misuse, but suggested that that should not be achieved through further restrictions on possession or sale.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51114-29_para6">
<a name="stpa_278">The Anti-Social Behaviour Act 2003 tried to deal with airgun abuse&#151;for instance, by raising the age at which airguns could be purchased to 17&#151;but it is less than two

<br>&nbsp;<br>years old, and there has not been time for its effects to be properly monitored and evaluated. Having consulted widely, we maintain that it would be wrong to impose further restrictions in the absence of alternative evidence.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51114-29_para7">
<a name="stpa_279">Tightening the restrictions will penalise the shooting community, and there is no evidence that it will have any benefit in reducing airgun misuse. It will merely deprive 17-year-olds of the opportunity to be taught safely and responsibly how to handle firearms. Training young people to shoot can be valuable in teaching skills, discipline and responsibility. Introducing them to safe, responsible firearms use makes it far less likely that they will ever misuse guns. If young people were prevented from having reasonable access to airguns, all shooting sports would suffer, with little or no effect on crime figures. This attack on airgun ownership constitutes a veiled attack on shooting and on entry to the sport.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51114-29_para8">
<a name="stpa_280">Bizarrely, on page 11 of its consultation paper of May 2004 relating to specifically to age limits, the Home Office categorically recommends that there should be no further restrictions on the sale of airguns because of the disproportionate enforcement effort.

 Will my hon. Friend confirm that when we last tried to restrict the sale of handguns for sporting use, there was no increase in illegal gun use, and that it has gone through the roof since this Labour Government took office?
</p>





<p><a name="st_335"><a name="51114-29_spnew8"><b> Mr. Djanogly: </b> 
 My hon. Friend makes an important point, which I would have brought up myself if we had enough time, but we will need to move on to other groups of amendments. I agree with what my hon. Friend said.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51114-29_para9">
<a name="stpa_281">It is obvious that all improper use of airguns should be an offence, irrespective of the age of the perpetrator, but existing legislation provides for that. The way to crack down on weapon misuse is through better enforcement of existing legislation. That is what will impact on gun crime. Tinkering with age limits in respect of air weapons will do little but anger and upset people who use guns safely and responsibly. The Minister has simply failed to explain how the clause is likely to reduce crime, never mind violent crime, so we believe that clause 29 should be removed entirely from the Bill. I intend to divide the House on amendment No. 110.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51114-29_para10">
<a name="stpa_282">Finally, I want to say that in respect of Government amendments Nos. 46 to 48, we are very pleased to see that the Minister has listened to our legitimate concerns about shooting beyond premises with consent. We want to thank the Minister for acting on our concerns in that regard, even though once again, she has unfortunately provided a defence rather than an exemption.

<p><a name="st_336"><a name="51114-30_spnew0"><b> Mr. Paice: </b> 
 I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Huntingdon (Mr. Djanogly) on the way in which he has proposed the amendments. I support them all, but I want to comment particularly on amendment No. 110 and the matter of raising the age from 17 to 18. As my hon. Friend noted, the Anti-social Behaviour Act 2003 raised the age limit from 14 to 17 only two years 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>14 Nov 2005 : Column 778</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>ago. At that time, I took on the same role as my hon. Friend of challenging the Government. It is fair to say that, even at that stage, there was little evidence that increasing the age at which one could buy or use, without supervision, an airgun from 14 to 17 would make any difference. What is abundantly clear now is that, since that Act came into force, there is no evidence that it has made any difference and there is certainly no evidence that the gap between 17 and 18 is a problem issue.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51114-30_para0">
<a name="stpa_283">That is not to say, as I said umpteen times in Committee, that there are no problems with airgun misuse. We know that there are&#151;in rural as well as urban areas&#151;but there are already 30 different offences on the statute book for the misuse of airguns. As my hon. Friend rightly said, the answer lies with proper enforcement of those 30 existing offences. That is what the Government should be concentrating on, rather than this wilful act that appears to come from the &quot;something must be done&quot; school. What can we do about airguns? Let us raise the age limit from 17 to 18 without any evidence that it will do any good. If the Minister seriously believes that it will make any difference to airgun crime, let us hope that in the few minutes left for debate, she will stand up and present the evidence.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51114-30_para1">
<a name="stpa_284">How many young people between 17 and 18 have been convicted for one of the 30 offences to which I referred earlier? In how many cases would the offence not have been committed if those young people had been unable to get hold of an airgun? It would be helpful if the Minister provided us with that information. Since the Anti-social Behaviour Act 2003, how much violent crime has been reduced by the fact that the age was increased from 14 to 17? Can the Minister provide us with some clear examples and statistical evidence&#151;not just wishful thinking or what the Government think or believe&#151;from the Dispatch Box this evening to justify taking away the opportunities of a group of 17-year-olds whose only interest is in using airguns lawfully, legally, safely and often in connection with their occupation in the countryside? That is the sort of evidence that she must put before the House if we are to accept that clause 29 will make any difference whatever.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51114-30_para2">
<a name="stpa_285">Finally, we want to hear the Minister&#039;s justification for her stance, so she should tell the House what is wrong with simply ensuring that the 30 existing offences are properly enforced. Before she answers that, she might just check her book, so that she can give us the statistics on how many people have been prosecuted in the past few years. She will find that the figure is woefully small, compared with the existing problems. If the Government enforced the law properly, they would not need to take steps such as this.
</p>





<p><a name="st_337"><a name="51114-30_spnew1"><b> Hazel Blears: </b> 
 I have not seen such passion in the House for some time. It is clear that Conservative Members are very attached to their guns&#151;and they doubtless mean to stick to them during this debate.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51114-30_para3">
<a name="stpa_286">I will resist the Opposition&#039;s amendments and I shall explain why. It is worth reminding the House of how serious this problem is. In 2003&#150;04, 13,756 crimes were committed in which air weapons were used; in 2,395 cases, they caused injury; in 156 cases, they caused serious injury. Occasionally, someone is killed with an air weapon, as happened in the tragic cases of two-year-

<br>&nbsp;<br>old Andrew Morton and 12-year-old Alex Cole. The misuse of air weapons is a serious problem and this Government are determined to meet it with effective action.
</p>





<p><a name="st_338"><a name="51114-30_spnew2"><b> David T.C. Davies: </b> 
 Will the Minister give way?
</p>





<p><a name="st_339"><a name="51114-30_spnew3"><b> Hazel Blears: </b> 
 No. We have heard a lot tonight about legitimate shooting and I have no doubt that there are legitimate shooters who act responsibly, but the Bill&#039;s purpose is to deal with people who use weapons irresponsibly, just as its purpose is to deal with those who use alcohol irresponsibly. It is about directing our action at the mischief that undoubtedly is caused in our communities. If the hon. Member for Huntingdon (Mr. Djanogly) represented a slightly different area, he would know that older people, in particular, have been plagued by the misuse of air weapons. Various members of the Committee, such as my hon. Friend the Member for Brent, South (Ms Butler), pointed out that some older people are cowering in their homes because people are taking pot-shots at them and their families. So I make no apologies for trying to ensure that sufficient restrictions are in place.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51114-30_para4">
<a name="stpa_287">Amendment No. 108 would remove the requirement for air weapon retailers to keep a register of transactions, but that register is an important part of the controls. It removes purchasers&#039; anonymity and should deter casual and irresponsible sales, which is what we want to achieve. At the moment, people can buy air weapons at car boot sales, through mail order and on the internet. Requiring that a register be kept and that air weapons be sold face to face brings a little more rigor to the system. I do not pretend for a moment that we are introducing a licensing system for the millions of air weapons in existence, but we are doing what we can, in a practical and proportionate way, to ensure that the sale of air weapons is at least a little safer. I realise that the licensing fee is &#163;150, but that is for three years, so it is not an onerous requirement for those stores and shops that want to be responsible air weapon retailers. I am sure that many of them will be delighted to register with their local police force to enable them to sell their weapons properly.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51114-30_para5">
<a name="stpa_288">Amendment No. 109 would modify the requirement in clause 28 by applying it only to air weapons with a muzzle energy in excess of 1 J, but such weapons are already included. I discovered in Committee that weapons of 1 J or greater are the only ones that meet the firearms definition of a lethal barrelled weapon in the Firearms Act 1968. Lethality does not occur until a muzzle energy in excess of 1 J is reached, so a weapon with a muzzle energy of less than 1 J is not a lethal barrelled weapon and does not fall within the definition of a firearm. It is very strange for me to be telling the hon. Member for Huntingdon (Mr. Djanogly), an avowed shooter and an expert on the technicalities of such matters, that his amendment is therefore superfluous; nevertheless, I ask him to withdraw it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51114-30_para6">
<a name="stpa_289">Amendment No. 110 would remove from the Bill the increase in the age limit. It is right and proper that we bring the air weapons provision into line with that for knives, because we want to ensure that young people have access to potentially dangerous weapons only in the proper circumstances. Young people will still be able to shoot at approved clubs under adult supervision, or,

<a name="51114-30_para7">
<a name="stpa_290">I am glad that Government amendments Nos. 46, 47 and 48 have been welcomed by the Opposition. They clarify the situation in cases where people fire an air weapon beyond the boundary of one premises and into another, with consent.

 I beg to move, That the Bill be now read the Third time.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51114-31_para0">
<a name="stpa_293">I am grateful to Members on both sides of the House for their constructive approach during consideration of the Bill in Committee and on Report. Many helpful points, including points of clarification, were raised in Committee, which have enabled us to make more explicit the intention of the Bill and to improve it. I thank the right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Mr. Forth) and my hon. Friend the Member for Bootle (Mr. Benton) for their excellent chairmanship of our discussions.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51114-31_para1">
<a name="stpa_294">I also thank the hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross (John Thurso), who is not in the Chamber. I learned more about the Atholl Highlanders during the proceedings of the Bill than I could ever have contemplated. I also know more about managing a rural estate, which is how the hon. Gentleman seems to spend some of his time. The Committee stage was extremely good-natured.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51114-31_para2">
<a name="stpa_295">I hope that Members will agree that we responded positively to many of the points raised and that the Bill we are sending to the other place has been significantly improved by the scrutiny process. I welcome the broad measure of cross-party support for many of the provisions. In Committee, we shared the desire to tackle gun and knife crime and to try to reduce the unacceptable, alcohol-fuelled violence and disorder, which we unfortunately see on too many of the streets of our towns and cities, to protect the decent, law-abiding majority of people.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>14 Nov 2005 : Column 784</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51114-31_para3">
<a name="stpa_296">The British crime survey data show considerable falls in violent crime since 1997&#151;a total fall of 34 per cent., which is significant by anybody&#039;s reckoning&#151;but we are not complacent, nor would the public want us to be. Too many people are still victims of crime, including violent crime. Too many people live in fear of crime and we need to tackle that, too. We are doing everything we can to try to make a real difference and the Bill contains a good cross-section of provisions, giving the police and local communities the powers they need further to reduce violent crime, particularly in relation to knives, guns and alcohol.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51114-31_para4">
<a name="stpa_297">Although most people drink responsibly, we all agree that the scale of alcohol-fuelled violence is too high. I believe that responsibility for ending the binge-drinking culture rests both with individuals, because it is important that they make correct choices about drinking, and with the people who run pubs, clubs, supermarkets and off-licences. I realise that the hon. Member for Woking (Mr. Malins) wanted to make a distinction between on and off-licence premises in terms of responsibility, but I reject such a distinction. If Members consider the results of the recent test purchasing in off-licence premises, they will see that there is still a significant problem of such premises selling to under-age youngsters. It is not simply a problem for the on-licence trade. Everybody has to take responsibility and the alcohol disorder zone provisions are about ensuring that collective responsibility.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51114-31_para5">
<a name="stpa_298">We debated drinking banning orders at some length. I hope that Members will accept the difference between drinking banning orders and ASBOs, although I do not have a great deal of real hope in the case of the hon. Member for Woking. There is a significant difference. We want the orders to be used proactively by the courts whenever people come before them.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51114-31_para6">
<a name="stpa_299">There is a series of exceptions to the drinking banning order, because we want to ensure that people can access their home, education and place of work, even when they are under a drinking banning order. We also said that people should still be able to attend their place of worship. That could help them to desist from the demon drink, so it will certainly be included as part of the guidance.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51114-31_para7">
<a name="stpa_300">We debated alcohol disorder zones again today. The Bill tries to build on the efforts already made by responsible licensees. My hon. Friend the Member for Brighton, Pavilion (David Lepper) referred to business improvement districts. We talked about the city safe scheme in Manchester and similar schemes in Swansea, Leicester, Cardiff and York, where licensees are working voluntarily with their police and local councils to tackle the problems.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51114-31_para8">
<a name="stpa_301">Members have expressed concerns that good operators will be caught with the bad ones. The hon. Member for East Antrim (Sammy Wilson) put the point extremely well: everybody is culpable but there should be differentiation in the degree of culpability. We shall try to achieve that in the regulations.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51114-31_para9">
<a name="stpa_302">I am disappointed that the Liberal Democrats have continually moved amendments that&#151;in the words of my hon. Friend the Member for Northampton, North (Ms Keeble)&#151;would ensure that the provision for alcohol disorders was unworkable. We should be honest enough to say either that we support the principle of 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>14 Nov 2005 : Column 785</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>such zones and ensure that we have practical, effective legislation or that we do not support such zones and would do away with them. What causes me immense frustration is that, time and again, the Liberal Democrats will the ends but not the means.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51114-31_para10">
<a name="stpa_303">The Liberal Democrats say that they are against antisocial behaviour, but they will not support ASBOs. They say that they are against gangs hanging around, but they will not support dispersal orders. They say that they want to tackle alcohol-fuelled violence, but are not prepared to support alcohol disorder zones. In politics, it is very important that we are very clear about what action we want to take. Theirs is a party that has not been in government and is not likely to be in government. It simply wills the ends but not the means to get there. Sometimes, government is about making some pretty hard decisions.
</p>





<p><a name="st_347"><a name="51114-31_spnew1"><b> Mr. Kevan Jones </b> 
: Does my right hon. Friend agree not only that the Liberal Democrats say one thing in the House and do another thing in the country, but that, tonight, Liberal Democrat Front Benchers have supported the perpetrators of crime, rather than the victims?
</p>





<p><a name="st_348"><a name="51114-31_spnew2"><b> Hazel Blears: </b> 
 My hon. Friend makes a good point. When he put it to the Liberal Democrats earlier that perhaps they would like to include in their &quot;Focus&quot; leaflets their support of the human rights of the perpetrators of antisocial behaviour, he got a resounding silence from them.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51114-31_para11">
<a name="stpa_304">Part 2 seeks to address a number of serious problems associated with armed crime and the misuse of imitation firearms, air weapons and knives. I am pleased that it has generally received broad support, although some minor issues have been raised. The appalling deaths and injuries that have been caused by gun and knife crime deeply hurt families and communities and leave a legacy of fear.
</p>





<p><a name="st_349"><a name="51114-31_spnew3"><b> Ms Celia Barlow  (Hove) (Lab):</b> 
 Does my right hon. Friend agree that airguns, which are sometimes called BB guns, can be used recreationally? Although I do not take part in such recreation, I am concerned that such legislation might damage sports such as airsoft or historical re-enactments. Does she agree that perhaps a distinguishing mark on the barrels of such guns could play a part in reducing the criminal use of such items?
</p>





<p><a name="st_350"><a name="51114-31_spnew4"><b> Hazel Blears: </b> 
 It is excellent to see that Labour Members are interested in practical legislation that can work. I am delighted at my hon. Friend&#039;s suggestion. She will know that we have made some amendments to cover historical re-enactments and museums, and she makes an excellent suggestion in relation to airsoft. Clearly, if imitations are not realistic, they can be used in that fashion.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51114-31_para12">
<a name="stpa_305">I may as well be even in my disappointment as between the Liberal Democrats and the Conservatives. I was disappointed with the Conservatives in relation to mandatory sentences for people who seek to get others to hide and mind their guns for them. We included a provision that mandatory five-year sentences, such as 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>14 Nov 2005 : Column 786</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>those for the possession of weapons, would be imposed for seeking to use particularly children to mind illegal guns. Frankly, I was amazed at the Conservatives. The hon. Member for Huntingdon (Mr. Djanogly) said:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_58">&quot;For this crime, it seems inappropriate that the sentence should be mandatory&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report, Standing Committee B,</i> 20 October 2005; c. 187.]</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51114-31_para13">
<a name="stpa_306">The Opposition must know that, since we introduced the mandatory five-year sentence for being in possession of an illegal gun, people have reduced their usage of real guns and moved to using imitations, which is why we have the provisions on the banning of realistic imitations.
</p>





<p><a name="st_351"><a name="51114-31_spnew5"><b> Ms Dawn Butler  (Brent, South) (Lab):</b> 
 I, too, was extremely disappointed with the Opposition&#039;s attempts to remove the mandatory five-year sentence. With a constituency such as mine, where we have a firearms-related incident every 17 days on average, the removal of such sentences would be absolutely detrimental to the good work that the police are doing in ensuring that gun crime is reduced. We should act responsibly when the Government introduce measures that will effectively save people&#039;s lives and ensure that younger people do not take up guns because they know that doing so will carry a mandatory five-year sentence.
</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051114/debtext/51114-32.htm"/>




<p><a name="st_352"><a name="51114-32_spnew0"><b> Hazel Blears: </b> 
 My hon. Friend has a great deal of personal experience of these really devastating problems in her community. I am sure that Labour Members not only share her disappointment, but are shocked by the Opposition&#039;s position and the fact that they divided the House to vote against mandatory sentences, which was a great surprise.
</p>





<p><a name="st_353"><a name="51114-32_spnew1"><b> Mr. Fraser Kemp  (Houghton and Washington, East) (Lab):</b> 
 Does my right hon. Friend agree that the restrictions on airguns in the Bill are good news for one of my constituents, Andrew Ross, who was shot in the face three weeks ago? He needed six stitches and nearly lost an eye. Such restrictions are an important step forward. If, as I hope, the Bill is passed tonight, will she join my call to urge forces throughout the country to have an amnesty for airguns? If fewer such weapons are lying around in people&#039;s houses, it is logical that people such as my constituent will be safer.
</p>





<p><a name="st_354"><a name="51114-32_spnew2"><b> Hazel Blears: </b> 
 I entirely agree with my hon. Friend that the restrictions will help to ensure that air weapons are better regulated. As I said earlier, there were 156 serious injuries involving air weapons last year. He suggests an amnesty. If such weapons are no longer being used, they should be kept out of the hands of people who could misuse them, so his suggestion would be a positive way forward.
</p>





<p><a name="st_355"><a name="51114-32_spnew3"><b> Gordon Banks  (Ochil and South Perthshire) (Lab):</b> 
 I commend the Bill because in the smallest county in Scotland, of which my constituency is part, in the first seven months of the year, 41 of the 50 crimes involving firearms related to airguns. There was an incident similar to that raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Houghton and Washington, East (Mr. Kemp) when a 13 or 14-year-old boy was shot under the eye. Anything that can be done to tighten the registration of, and 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>14 Nov 2005 : Column 787</b>

</p>





<p><a name="st_356"><a name="51114-32_spnew4"><b> Hazel Blears: </b> 
 Yes. I know about my hon. Friend&#039;s personal commitment to the issue because I was delighted that he recently presented me with a petition through which many of his constituents expressed their worry about the misuse of air weapons.

 <i>rose&#151;</i>
</p>





<p><a name="st_358"><a name="51114-32_spnew6"><b> Hazel Blears: </b> 
 I give way to the hon. Gentleman with the striking tie.
</p>





<p><a name="st_359"><a name="51114-32_spnew7"><b> Mr. Hollobone: </b> 
 I thank the right hon. Lady for her compliment. I raise a genuine constituent&#039;s concern. Mr. Cockayne from Kettering is a member of the Great War Society, which has a distinguished record of re-enacting scenes from the great war. The Governments of France and Belgium have invited the society to re-enact the battle of the Somme in July 2006&#151;the right hon. Lady will know that that has special significance. Mr. Cockayne wants to know whether members of the society will be allowed to leave the country with their deactivated original weapons and then be allowed back into the country with those weapons when they return.
</p>





<p><a name="st_360"><a name="51114-32_spnew8"><b> Hazel Blears: </b> 
 Yes. The Bill now provides an exemption for deactivated weapons, so they will not fall under the category of realistic imitation weapons, which will be banned from being manufactured and imported. If the weapons are deactivated, those people will be able to take part in their activity. I have been keen throughout the Bill&#039;s passage to try to ensure that we do not cast our net too wide and affect people who do extremely good work, especially with schoolchildren, by re-enacting and taking part in living history lessons to try to bring such history alive. I am conscious of the excellent work done by people in my constituency in that regard.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51114-32_para0">
<a name="stpa_307">We had a good debate on air weapons and I think that we have dealt sufficiently with the matter. I was disappointed that we did not have the chance to debate primers because I was looking forward to telling hon. Members that I had learned about not only muzzle joule energy, but percussions caps for UN metallic-cased ammunition. Our chance has now disappeared, but those matters have added to the sum of my knowledge, if not to the sum of human knowledge.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51114-32_para1">
<a name="stpa_308">We did not have the chance to discuss imitation firearms, but I am glad that we have been able to include in the Bill exemptions for television and theatrical productions, historical re-enactments and museums. We have struck a pragmatic and realistic balance between the mischief at which we are aiming, which is the misuse of realistic imitations&#151;the use of which has increased by 66 per cent. in the past year, so we need to crack down on that&#151;and protecting legitimate use.
</p>





<p><a name="st_361"><a name="51114-32_spnew9"><b> Adam Afriyie  (Windsor) (Con):</b> 
 I echo a question asked by my hon. Friend the Member for South-East Cambridgeshire (Mr. Paice). How many such crimes were committed by children aged between 17 and 18? Although the Minister cited many other figures, she did not tell us that information.
</p>





<p><a name="st_362"><a name="51114-32_spnew10"><b> Hazel Blears: </b> 
 No, I am afraid that I do not have to hand the figures on 17 to 18-year-olds. However, a 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>14 Nov 2005 : Column 788</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>strong case has been made about the danger of young people obtaining weapons that could be misused at the age of 18. As I have set out, there is a range of circumstances in which youngsters as young as 14 can continue to use air weapons provided that they do so under supervision. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman welcomes such provisions, which aim to achieve the right balance, so that people have the freedom to use their weapons, but certainly do not have the freedom to misuse them and harass good, decent, law-abiding citizens.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51114-32_para2">
<a name="stpa_309">I have nothing further to add save to commend the Bill to the House. As I said, violent crime has been reduced by 34 per cent. since the Government came to power, which is an excellent record. There is always more that we can do, however, to try to make sure that the people of this country have the right to live in safe and secure communities. The Government will try to achieve that with every measure that we introduce to try to ensure that the criminal justice system and the police service are on the side of the decent, law-abiding majority. I commend the Bill to the House.

 I should like to begin in the same way as the Minister by telling the House that all the members of the Committee have good reason to be grateful to our Chairmen, my right hon. Friend the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Mr. Forth) and the hon. Member for Bootle (Mr. Benton), and to the Clerk of the Committee, who looked after us very well during the course of our deliberations.

<p>
<a name="51114-32_para3">
<a name="stpa_310">I particularly thank the Minister, because throughout the Committee, she, like the rest of us, ensured that our debate was reasoned and measured. Although there were disagreements, as is always the case, there were also points on which we agreed, and we approached everything in a constructive manner. I should like to thank my hon. Friends who contributed a great deal in Committee. My hon. Friends the Members for Hertsmere (Mr. Clappison), for Hertford and Stortford (Mr. Prisk) and for Rugby and Kenilworth (Jeremy Wright) were particularly helpful, but I should like to give special mention to my hon. Friend the Member for Huntingdon (Mr. Djanogly) for taking on his shoulders the heavy burden of dealing with firearms matters. I am grateful to him for that work.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51114-32_para4">
<a name="stpa_311">The majority of correspondence that hon. Members received before the Bill went into Committee was sent by people who were interested for personal reasons&#151;they often had relevant hobbies&#151;in the provisions on firearms. We all received many letters from concerned constituents. I thank the hon. Member for Hornsey and Wood Green (Lynne Featherstone) for her contributions in Committee. We had some useful exchanges with Government Back Benchers, including the hon. Member for Northampton, North (Ms Keeble). Although I rarely agreed with her, and she rarely agreed with me, that does not alter the fact that such exchanges are worth while.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51114-32_para5">
<a name="stpa_312">The Bill has completed its Committee and Report stages, and it will shortly proceed to the other place. Earlier, the Minister said that one or two of our amendments may find favour with her, given what they set out to achieve, although not necessarily as drafted. That shows the House of Commons at its best. From 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>14 Nov 2005 : Column 789</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>time to time&#151;I wish it happened more often&#151;Governments accept Opposition amendments if they think that there is merit in them. I therefore look forward very much to hearing the Government&#039;s proposals on those amendments, sooner rather than later. We have been talking for weeks about the Violent Crime Reduction Bill, which draws our attention to three areas that are of great concern to everyone in the House of Commons and in Parliament generally. First, drink-fuelled crime and alcohol-related disorder are a huge concern. The Minister properly said that the figures are too high, and there is concern about the problem on both sides of the House, particularly among Members who represent urban areas. I understand and respect that concern, because sometimes people from urban areas see things differently. They are not always correct, but they see things differently from people who come from areas that are not so urban. I understand the difference, and accept that there is a balance to be struck.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51114-32_para6">
<a name="stpa_313">Hon. Members have expressed throughout our debates&#151;this is a non-party point&#151;their great concern about the increase in binge drinking and alcohol-related violence on our streets. Earlier today, I remarked that all of us are concerned about binge drinking among very young people. Something must be done about it. I hope that hon. Members will accept in the spirit in which it is intended my comment that a number of us may have drunk too much when we were 18, 19 or 20, but in our day it was most unusual to see binge drinking and heavy drunkenness among much younger children such as 13, 14 or 15-year-olds. The fact that we see that quite a lot now is troubling, not least because of the health implications. Setting aside for the moment the obvious public and criminal costs, I fear that there is a generation growing up now who have become used to heavy doses of alcohol in their mid or early teens. We should all worry about that very much.

<a name="51114-32_para7">
<a name="stpa_314">Tackling drink-fuelled crime is important and the Government&#039;s approach in the Bill is to introduce two new measures: drinking banning orders and alcohol disorder zones. I have said throughout our debates that I feel that the existing law is in many respects sufficient to cover the mischief with which we are attempting to deal. There is a variety of offences in the criminal law relating to alcohol-fuelled disorder and violence, as well as the range of penalties and criminal offences that&#151;I repeat&#151;the Home Affairs Committee has said are underused by the police. What is important is to enforce existing law, rather than consistently to give in to the apparent need to make new law, which is the Government&#039;s answer to everything. If existing law were seriously enforced, we might not be having this debate now. It is a great worry that current law is not being enforced. During his remarks on guns, my hon. Friend the Member for South-East Cambridgeshire (Mr. Paice) referred to 30-odd offences on the statute book the proper enforcement and policing of which would ensure that we did not need to debate much of what we have debated today.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51114-32_para8">

<a name="stpa_316">We had a long debate on knives. All of us on both sides of the House accept that knife crime&#151;in particular, the offence under section 139 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988 of carrying a bladed article&#151;is increasing dramatically. That is a great worry, yet the only reference to that crime in the Bill is in the fairly narrow, perhaps relevant in their own way but not generally applicable, clauses that deal with knives in schools&#151;a growing problem, with up to 60,000 children aged between 11 and 16 carrying knives in school, which is a terrifying statistic&#151;and the offence of using someone to mind a weapon. The offence of carrying a bladed article in public is one that we must address much more strongly, so I was disappointed by the Government&#039;s response to our new clause in which we proposed a new maximum&#151;not minimum&#151;penalty for that offence, increasing it from two years to five years. The Government did not take our arguments on board and made no conciliatory comments in that respect.

<a name="stpa_317">My hon. Friend the Member for Huntingdon carried on his own shoulders a great deal of the burden of our debates on firearms. Tonight, he spoke on the clauses that deal with air weapons, and we were able to force a Division. However, the time ran out, although I do not blame the Minister because it was one of those things. I wish that we had had more time to debate the amendments covering ammunition and realistic imitation firearms and re-enactments, but I repeat that no blame attaches to the Minister.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51114-32_para11">
<a name="stpa_318">On firearms, my hon. Friend the Member for Huntingdon has made it clear, and I shall make it clear, too, that today&#039;s position is different from that a couple of weeks ago. Conservative Members thank the Minister for her reasonable and responsive approach to many of the matters that we raised in Committee, and we are pleased that the Government have tabled amendments that go some way to assuaging our concerns and those of the millions of law-abiding weapon users who stand to be affected by the legislation. However, many thousands of people are still concerned about the uncertainty surrounding the Bill&#039;s progress&#151;we know that from our correspondence.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51114-32_para12">
<a name="stpa_319">I repeat our support for the intent behind the clauses on weapons, because we support wholeheartedly measures that will have a practical effect on reducing gun crime in the UK and making our citizens safer. However, we do not support creating laws for the sake of being seen to be tough on gun crime, the effect of which will be felt almost exclusively by legitimate users of weapons and not by the criminals on whom we intend to crack down. My hon. Friend the Member for Huntingdon and I take the view that clause 32 is one of most inherently flawed clauses in the entire Bill. It stands to penalise collectors and create a further unnecessary administrative burden while doing virtually nothing to combat violent crime.

I was sad and sorry when I received hundreds of letters from those who indulge in the harmless and in many ways laudable sport of airsoft. Their letters&#151;they wrote to many other hon.

<a name="stpa_323">I have three points for the Minister. First, I wish the Bill good fortune in the other place. Secondly, it is vital that we focus on what works: I hope that the Government demonstrate a real need for the particular measures in the Bill and explain why current legislation has been deemed ineffective. Thirdly, I hope that the general principle, with which surely all hon. Members agree, that there is no point in punishing the innocent in the vain belief that it will help to punish the guilty is raised in the other place. That principle goes across the Bill, and it will affect premises that serve alcohol and law-abiding people who are involved in the gun trade. One of my great fears is that we are rapidly moving towards a situation that has arisen under previous Governments whereby we tend far too much to penalise those who are innocent, honest and genuine in the belief that we will affect the mindset of those who are wicked and criminal. The truth is that we will not. It is very important to take that on board.

<a name="stpa_324">I say a final word of thanks to the Minister for her courtesy. Conservative Members look forward to seeing the progress of the Bill in the other House.

Although we disagree with their approach to many of those issues, we share a common purpose and will always work towards that end.

 I add my congratulations to the Minister on steering the Bill through. It is an excellent Bill that adds to the existing menu of laws and other restrictions that are being introduced to control antisocial behaviour in our neighbourhoods.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51114-33_para0">
<a name="stpa_325">I wish to concentrate on two aspects, the first of which is firearms. There are lots of scaremongering stories in the press suggesting that the Bill limits the freedom of people who use replica weapons. In Committee, my hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington (Ms Abbott)&#151;unfortunately she is not here tonight&#151;graphically described the siege mentality in parts of her constituency as regards the use of replica guns. Any move to ensure that one less life is taken on the streets of our cities has to be welcome.

<br>&nbsp;<br>that context. The <i>Newcastle Evening Chronicle</i> has run a well-supported campaign in the north-east on introducing tougher measures on air weapons. Its readers will welcome the Bill, which increases such powers. In my constituency, which is semi-rural, the misuse of air weapons leads to tragic events, including the shooting and mutilation of people&#039;s pets, as well as wildlife. The Bill will be welcomed by numerous constituents who have written to me asking for tougher controls on the use of firearms.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51114-33_para2">
<a name="stpa_327">I am pleased that the Mobile Telephone (Re-Programming) Bill, which I introduced as a private Member&#039;s Bill in the last Parliament, has been incorporated into the Bill. That Bill ran out of parliamentary time, although I did secure my Christmas Day (Trading) Bill. The theft of mobile phones&#151;a crime against the young&#151;is a growing menace in our cities. The amount of money involved in the theft and reprogramming of mobile phones is mind-boggling. The police and the industry believe that the Bill will be a welcome new piece of weaponry in their armoury in bearing down on a crime that did not exist 30 years ago but now plagues many communities. The police in the north-east have told me that there is a clear connection between the stolen mobile phone trade and drug dealing. The Bill makes it an offence to offer the service of reprogramming mobile phones. That gives the police much-needed weaponry to bear down on such crimes, albeit that the perpetrators will probably find ways around it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51114-33_para3">
<a name="stpa_328">We have discussed antisocial behaviour caused by alcohol misuse. The Bill will improve our communities in that respect. Many of the problems in my constituency are caused not by public houses but by youngsters who have access to alcohol and hang around on street corners and estates, making people&#039;s lives a misery. I was struck in Committee and today by the difference between the world that I live in and that of the hon. Member for Woking (Mr. Malins). Perhaps he still lives in a quaint age in which people in villages in his constituency think that people getting drunk at weekends is down to high spirits. I certainly do not, and neither do many of my constituents.

That is a great pity. One of the main ideas was staggering the hours at which people would leave pubs, yet I understand that, instead of leaving at 11 pm or 12 am, they all come out at 2.30 am or 3 am.

<a name="51114-33_para12">
<a name="stpa_337">I should also like to pay tribute to Strathclyde police, who are a force to be reckoned with. They deal very severely with knife crime. They have seen at first hand the way in which the gun and knife cultures have grown in the west of Scotland in the past 20 years, resulting in knives, blades, swords and Stanley knives becoming the weapons of choice among the gangsters and criminals. Anyone who has spoken to members of their local hospital staff will understand the problem that they, too, face in regard to health and safety. The country would be facing an increase in murders of tidal-wave proportions if it were not for the tremendous skill and professionalism of our surgeons and nursing staff.

I have said that no area is exempt or excluded from the threat of gun crime. However, if further proof is needed, last week in a neighbouring constituency to mine in Renfrewshire, the police raided a flat and removed a 12-bore pump-action shotgun, a bolt-action .22&#150;250 rifle, a 12-bore single-barrelled sawn-off shotgun, a converted replica pistol, and 98 bulleted cartridges.

<p><a name="st_387"><i>Motion made, and Question proposed</i>, That this House do now adjourn.&#151;<i>[Mr. Heppell.]</i>
<a name="time_28">
<a name="51114-35_time0"><h5>10.2 pm</h5>
</p>





<p><a name="st_388"><a name="51114-35_spnew0"><b> Julia Goldsworthy  (Falmouth and Camborne) (LD):</b> 
 I welcome this opportunity to bring the issue of high water bills and water poverty in the south-west to the attention of the House. My hon. Friends and many other colleagues in the House have been assiduous in drawing Ministers&#039; attention to the issue over many years, through debates, questions and meetings, and the Minister has been good in responding. The fact that many Members across the south-west are still plugging away on it bears testament to the fact that it remains a major unresolved issue in my part of the world.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51114-35_para0">
<a name="stpa_343">The problem of unaffordable water bills in the south-west is not new. It was originally caused by the privatisation of the water industry, which led to massive increases in south-west water bills. While many of the facts that I will set out are already known, because the issue has been so well debated, it is important that we re-rehearse some of those facts for the record.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51114-35_para1">
<a name="stpa_344">We know that the problems were caused by a series of fundamental errors in the privatisation process under the Conservatives in the 1980s. Water companies and private investors initially made big profits on privatisation, because of big discounts. The amount of money set aside for a &quot;green dowry&quot; massively underestimated what the coastline clean-up would cost. The result was huge increases in water bills once that was realised, and the south-west&#039;s great expanse of coastline meant that it bore the brunt of clean-up costs, leaving us with the highest water bills in the country. That has been the case since then.
</p>





<p><a name="st_389"><a name="51114-35_spnew1"><b> Mr. Dan Rogerson  (North Cornwall) (LD):</b> 
 My hon. Friend rightly pointed out that there has been considerable investment in the sewerage infrastructure around the coastline of the south-west peninsula as a result of various clean-up initiatives. Does she agree that that investment has not just led to high water bills now, but is likely to lead to higher water bills for people in the south-west because of the cost of maintaining the infrastructure in future years?
</p>





<p><a name="st_390"><a name="51114-35_spnew2"><b> Julia Goldsworthy: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is right&#151;the clean-up will leave a legacy. People will have to maintain the cost of the infrastructure, and because the peninsula is rural and isolated the costs will be higher than they would be otherwise.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51114-35_para2">
<a name="stpa_345">Since water privatisation, people living in the area covered by South West Water have consistently paid the highest bills in the country. This year&#039;s increases were about 17 or 18 per cent., and by 2009&#150;10 the bills will hit an average of nearly &#163;700 a year. That is not the only problem, however. As well as paying the highest water bills, people in the south-west have some of the lowest incomes and the highest house prices in the country.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51114-35_para3">
<a name="stpa_346">Cornwall is the poorest county in the country. Wages are &#163;100 a week lower than the national average and houses are among the most unaffordable. The peninsula also has more pensioners than the national average, and many people subsist on low fixed incomes. For people on low fixed incomes&#151;hard-working families, 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>14 Nov 2005 : Column 799</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>pensioners and other individuals&#151;the cost of water becomes increasingly unaffordable as increases rise, year on year, above inflation. They are the same people who find increases in unfair council tax unaffordable, but at least some people have the option of council tax benefit if they are on the lowest incomes. No such support is available to help these people to meet the cost of their water and sewerage, essential utilities.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51114-35_para4">
<a name="stpa_347">Water bills and council tax were the two main issues that I encountered on the doorstep in the run-up to the last general election. While people in my constituency understood that the unfairness of the council tax was a national problem and they were not the only ones suffering, they were outraged that they were being discriminated against and facing a disproportionate burden compared with the rest of the country when it came to their water and sewerage bills. The figures are depressing. Towards the end of the decade, some of the poorest pensioners in the south-west could be spending 7 per cent. of their disposable incomes on water and sewerage. Indeed, WaterVoice estimates that it could be as much as 10 per cent. The average working household will be spending twice as much of its disposable income on water and sewerage as the national average. The poorest households in the country will be those paying the highest water bills&#151;bills that are set to increase by 25 per cent. by 2010.
</p>





<p><a name="st_391"><a name="51114-35_spnew3"><b> Alison Seabeck  (Plymouth, Devonport) (Lab):</b> 
 The hon. Lady is right to speak of the disproportionate effects of water bills on low-income pensioners. According to the Department for Work and Pensions, a quarter of a million children across the south-west are living in households in the bottom quintile of income distribution. If we are to address pensioner and child poverty, we must find a means of mitigating the effects of water charges, particularly in our region. I hope that the hon. Lady welcomes the proposed south-west affordability pilot, which may provide information enabling us to deal with part of the problem.
</p>





<p><a name="st_392"><a name="51114-35_spnew4"><b> Julia Goldsworthy: </b> 
 I am coming to that&#151;and I understand that, slowly, the Government are as well.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51114-35_para5">
<a name="stpa_348">Given the amount that is being paid, it is not surprising that people are so enraged about the increases. People in London pay an average of &#163;200 a year, about &#163;4 a week. That is relatively insignificant compared with the figure, three times that amount, that my constituents will be asked to pay by the end of the decade. It is the further increases that have aggrieved people so much. Before the increases they were unhappy about their water bills, but prices were stable and they were prepared to swallow hard and pay. Now, with the likelihood of further dramatic price hikes, the issue is bubbling up again.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51114-35_para6">
<a name="stpa_349">The Government know of the problems but, as the hon. Member for Plymouth, Devonport (Alison Seabeck) pointed out, they have failed to address the inequalities adequately. While they publicly acknowledge in debates and meetings that water poverty is a problem in the south-west, we have seen no action to tackle the structural problems that have caused the increases. There has been a cross-Government review of water affordability and, following that&#151;as the hon. Lady also mentioned&#151;we have heard the announcement of a water affordability pilot in the south-west. It was heralded a year ago, 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>14 Nov 2005 : Column 800</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>conveniently ahead of the general election, but we were not told a year ago that it would not be up and running until well into 2006. So far, no customer in the south-west has seen the benefit of the pilot or of any reduction in water bills. Sadly, under the present Government they do not look likely to.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51114-35_para7">
<a name="stpa_350">The reality is that the pilot will benefit only a small number of people&#151;a fraction of the percentage of the population who are paying the bills&#151;who are already on water meters. They will see benefits in some respects, such as a benefits entitlement check, advice on debt management and repayment planning, water efficiency advice and the installation of water-efficient appliances and devices such as hippos for toilet cisterns, tap inserts and efficient shower heads. As my hon. Friend the Member for North Cornwall (Mr. Rogerson) has already said, the pilot takes no account of the infrastructure costs of providing sewerage to housing. For many people, that is the largest part of their bill. It is not the water they use&#151;no matter how efficient they are, they will still face massive bills on account of sewerage costs.
</p>





<p><a name="st_393"><a name="51114-35_spnew5"><b> Mr. Anthony Steen  (Totnes) (Con):</b> 
 Does the hon. Lady agree that as the largest part of the water bill is for sewerage charges and as they have been inflated by the EU, which has insisted on increased quality of bathing and ordinary drinking water, the Government should help with those charges, as the water charges are quite reasonable?
</p>





<p><a name="st_394"><a name="51114-35_spnew6"><b> Julia Goldsworthy: </b> 
 I certainly agree that the Government should do so, but residents and visitors to the south-west alike appreciate having clean beaches to visit.
</p>





<p><a name="st_395"><a name="51114-35_spnew7"><b> Andrew George  (St. Ives) (LD):</b> 
 My hon. Friend is well aware that all the regulations that the hon. Member for Totnes (Mr. Steen) mentioned were already well telegraphed by the time that privatisation was well under way. Does she agree that the proposed pilot for 2006 has not even reached its scoping level and will benefit only up to 1,000 out of 600,000 households in the south-west?
</p>





<p><a name="st_396"><a name="51114-35_spnew8"><b> Julia Goldsworthy: </b> 
 I agree, and I am as disappointed as my hon. Friend about that. The concern is that it will not help the people&#151;many of whom will be older or on low incomes&#151;who are not currently on a metered water supply. Certain households would not benefit from switching to a meter because they use a high volume of water, perhaps because one of the household members is ill or because it is a large family. The pilot does not even begin to tackle the structural problems that are due to the existing tariff structures and high sewerage costs that generate high bills for some people.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51114-35_para8">
<a name="stpa_351">The pilot may help around the edges, but it does not address the fundamental problem that 3 per cent. of our population is having to pay the costs of maintaining 30 per cent. of our coastline, and the costs required to regenerate and maintain water and sewerage infrastructure across a large, peripheral and rural area are higher than in urban areas. That is the fundamental issue that has not been addressed.


<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>

<p>
<a name="51114-35_para9">
<a name="stpa_352">I think that I am right in saying that my colleagues and I are not particular about exactly how this problem is resolved, providing that it is dealt with. Many new suggestions have been made about how to help reduce the bills. One example is the introduction of new tariff structures. In previous debates, the Minister has said:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_66">&quot;We have not shut down the idea of review of structures, prices and tariffs. We remain open to new ideas about them.&quot;&#151;[<i>Official Report,</i> 10 November 2004; Vol. 426, c. 312WH.]</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51114-35_para10">
<a name="stpa_353">If he has not shut down that idea, I would welcome any information about the work that his Department has undertaken to review those structures, prices and tariffs and about what conclusions were reached.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51114-35_para11">
<a name="stpa_354">Another alternative was suggested by WaterVoice, which drew attention to the Water Charges Equalisation Act 1977. Enacted by the Labour Government, it recognised the problem caused by disparities in water bills across the country. Of course, it was repealed in 1983 by the Conservative Government and several years after that came water privatisation.

<p><a name="st_397"><a name="51114-36_spnew0"><b> Adam Afriyie  (Windsor) (Con):</b> 
 The hon. Lady is casting aspersions on the former Conservative Government of eight years ago and she has demonstrated concern about privatisation, but she has not advanced any positive suggestions about what the Liberal Democrats would do. Is she proposing that water and sewerage charges should be harmonised throughout the UK?
</p>





<p><a name="st_398"><a name="51114-36_spnew1"><b> Julia Goldsworthy: </b> 
 I am proposing a variety of   suggestions. The last one is another precedent set by    a Labour Government&#151;indeed, this Labour Government&#151;in an attempt to mitigate the unfair costs that some people face in respect of utility bill payments.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51114-36_para0">
<a name="stpa_355">My hon. Friend the Member for Truro and St. Austell (Matthew Taylor) unearthed an interesting piece of information from Trade and Industry questions the other week. The Minister for Energy helpfully informed him that the typical household electricity bill in Scotland saw a saving of &#163;27 a year&#151;the result of a subsidy to electricity consumers in northern Scotland introduced in April this year. My hon. Friend also asked the Minister for Energy to have a word in the ear of Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Ministers to explain why such a subsidy was required in northern Scotland to keep down fuel bills and reduce fuel poverty.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51114-36_para1">
<a name="stpa_356">Surely the Minister recognises that increasing water bills in the south-west will pose very similar problems. I encourage him to make a foray on to his own patch on this issue, as the Trade and Industry Minister was very keen to ensure that he did not trespass on his. What are the Minister&#039;s views on the potential applicability of such an idea to water consumers? He will doubtless agree that it would appear hypocritical for his Government to provide support in one part of the United Kingdom but not in another.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51114-36_para2">
<a name="stpa_357">This problem has a very long history. I hope that tonight&#039;s debate will bring some hope to my constituents and that they will finally get a fair deal on water bills. They do not care what form the solution takes, just as long as it results in bills that are more affordable. I do not consider that an unreasonable request.

<p><a name="st_399"><a name="51114-36_spmin0"><b>The Minister for Climate Change and the Environment  (Mr. Elliot Morley): </b> 
 I congratulate the hon. Member for Falmouth and Camborne (Julia Goldsworthy) on making a case that, as she rightly stated, has been made on many occasions by various Members of this House, including her predecessor, who was very active on this issue. That case was also made recently by my hon. Friends the Members for Plymouth, Sutton (Linda Gilroy) and for Plymouth, Devonport (Alison Seabeck), and by a delegation organised by the hon. Member for Truro and St. Austell (Matthew Taylor).
</p>

<p>
<a name="51114-36_para3">
<a name="stpa_358">I start by considering the very roots of the problem. I know that the hon. Member for Windsor (Adam Afriyie) said that the previous, Conservative Government are completely blameless on this issue, but the green dowry is a real problem that stems from 1989, when, as part of the privatisation process, the then Government wrote off existing debt of some &#163;5 billion for all water companies. They also provided an additional cash injection of &#163;1.5 billion&#151;the so-called green dowry&#151;in recognition of the upgrades that a number of companies would need.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51114-36_para4">
<a name="stpa_359">Of course, hindsight is a wonderful thing, but it seems questionable whether the green dowry for the south-west was anything like sufficient at that time to compensate for the poor infrastructure, especially given the important point that it was calculated that such infrastructure investment would not be needed, as sea disposal of sewage was considered acceptable in 1989. It is not acceptable, and although there is no doubt that prices have gone up, people appreciate&#151;as the hon. Member for Falmouth and Camborne said&#151;that our beaches and rivers now enjoy record water quality. That is very desirable, but it is clear that it has come at a price. A better dowry for the south-west would have been sensible, recognising the scale of the problem in 1989. Had that happened, we would not face the difficulties that we currently face.
</p>





<p><a name="st_400"><a name="51114-36_spnew2"><b> Adam Afriyie: </b> 
 The dowry to which the Minister refers dates from some 16 years ago. One can argue that the decision was right or wrong, but this Government have had eight years to resolve the situation. Surely he will come up with answers this evening, rather than simply laying the blame at the door of a previous Government in respect of events that took place many years ago.
</p>





<p><a name="st_401"><a name="51114-36_spnew3"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 Far be it from me to lay the blame on previous Conservative Governments; I am simply painting the background to the existing problems and describing their root. However, I will certainly touch on potential solutions.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51114-36_para5">
<a name="stpa_360">I should point out to the hon. Member for Falmouth and Camborne that there are no easy answers to this problem, and one reason why is that the companies involved are private companies. I take it that the hon. Member for Windsor is not suggesting that we provide public subsidies for private companies, because that does not quite go with Conservative philosophy. It should not be forgotten that during the previous price round, the regulator, rightly or wrongly, cut bills by an average of just over 10 per cent. Although prices will rise between now and this time next year, which will affect customers in the south-west, in real terms they will still 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>14 Nov 2005 : Column 803</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>be paying less than they did in 1999. In 2006, the average bill will still be 2 per cent. lower, in real terms, than it was in 1999. These are nevertheless average prices, and such prices can mask disproportionate effects upon individuals. I am not being complacent about that. It is also fair to point out that the number of pensioners in relative poverty in the south-west fell by about a quarter between 1996&#150;97 and 2002&#150;03, from 270,000 to 210,000. It is true that pensioners&#039; incomes in the south-west are marginally lower than those in Great Britain as a whole, but they are higher in all regions outside London, the south-east and the east. Pensioners&#039; incomes have risen faster than earnings over the past nine years.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51114-36_para6">
<a name="stpa_361">In the country as a whole, pensioners&#039; incomes have risen by 27 per cent., compared with 15 per cent. for wages, as a result of uprating the basic state pension in line with inflation, or by 2.5 per cent. each year, in uprating the guaranteed credit element of the pension credit in line with earnings so that the poorest pensioners will see year-on-year increases in income that are greater than inflation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51114-36_para7">
<a name="stpa_362">I stress these points because one of the ways in which the Government have approached the issue has been to tackle low incomes generally. That is a powerful argument. There are many different mechanisms in respect of utility prices, but low incomes are key to the problem. Affordability is also a key point. That problem applies throughout the country. There are certain improvements in the south-west that are dedicated to the area, including, in particular, water coloration and drinking water quality. There is also the issue of connecting homes to mains sewerage, which is a particular problem in the south-west. I understand that the current price round is designed to connect 261 properties to the mains, which is quite a lot. It is designed also to address sewer flooding, which is a problem in parts of the south-west, as it is in other parts of the country.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51114-36_para8">
<a name="stpa_363">It would be wrong to think that the costs that fall upon south-west consumers are for the benefits of other people. Many of the costs are for the benefit of south-west customers and consumers. However, I recognise the point that the hon. Lady is making.
</p>





<p><a name="st_402"><a name="51114-36_spnew4"><b> Andrew George: </b> 
 The Minister has given figures for average pensioner income. In the area that we are talking about, many pensioners come from a more wealthy background to retire in the area, which masks the underlying trend among local pensioners. Do the figures that the Minister has given reflect the figures for pensioner income throughout the far wider Government south-west zone than the area of South West Water, which is clearly geographically much smaller than the Government zone?
</p>





<p><a name="st_403"><a name="51114-36_spnew5"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 I do not dispute the point that the hon. Gentleman makes. There will be distortions as a result of wealthy pensioners who retire in the south-west, and that can mask real poverty. We are aware of that as a Government; we take it seriously.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51114-36_para9">
<a name="stpa_364">I shall deal with the idea of lifting some of the price burden on to other areas to lower the price within the south-west. There are some problems, as I have said before when discussing these matters with hon. Members who have suggested that there should be 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>14 Nov 2005 : Column 804</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>cross-subsidy. Ultimately, all costs fall on the consumer. Ofwat sets an upper limit on prices. There is a strong argument for a strong and visible link between what the company spends and the customers who fund those moneys through their bills. If some of the cost is offset, that reduces the pressure on companies to ensure that they are offering the best service to their consumers.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51114-36_para10">
<a name="stpa_365">There is also a problem with how we shift prices into other regions, because each region has its own problems and costs. The hon. Lady mentioned the Thames region. There is much discussion about the Thames interceptor, which would cost between &#163;3 billion and &#163;4 billion. As a result of particular problems with the Thames region, particularly with leakage, the level of increase in the region has been higher than in the south-west, although the overall bill is lower. I accept that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51114-36_para11">
<a name="stpa_366">On the logic of what the hon. Lady argues in terms of transferring costs, she must surely recognise that many consumers in the Thames region think that as the Thames runs through the capital, it is important that the river should be clean because of the Olympics and London&#039;s role as a national showcase, and that some of the cost should be spread to other people. How do we explain to poor people in Newcastle, Liverpool or Sheffield that their bills have to rise? Although what she proposes would help poor people in the south-west, it would also help wealthy people in the south-west&#151;the very people who, as the hon. Member for St. Ives (Andrew George) said, have gone there to retire. How can we offload their charges on to poor people?

However, will he encourage people to look across the piece to other Departments&#151;the Department for Work and Pensions and the Treasury&#151;to find solutions, rather than telling us that we cannot do something about a situation that is patently unfair?

<p><a name="st_405"><a name="51114-37_spnew1"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 My hon. Friend has a distinguished record on the subject, especially with her involvement in the Public Utilities Reform Group and the relevant all-party group. She raises an interesting point. I repeat that there are no easy solutions, but I also repeat that I have an open mind. I am willing to explore new ideas. She has some thoughtful ideas on how we might address the problem. They raise issues for DWP and other Departments, but I am happy to examine her ideas in detail.

<a name="stpa_368">The assistance for areas with high electricity distribution costs scheme has been presented as a panacea. I regret that that is not the case. I have, however, looked carefully at the AAHEDC&#151;assistance for areas with high electricity distribution costs&#151;scheme and can claim to be something of an expert on its intricacies and details. I regret to say that I cannot

<br>&nbsp;<br>understand how it could act as a solution. The electricity and water companies are very different. They have different infrastructure, operation and regulations. The big difference is that the electricity company has a national grid, on which the scheme is based, but water companies tend to be self-contained within their regions. There is no comparison.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51114-37_para2">
<a name="stpa_369">Under the AAHEDC scheme, electricity suppliers in Britain subsidise the distribution company in northern Scotland. It works through National Grid Transco. The company collects a designated payment from all GB suppliers to be paid to the Scottish hydroelectric distribution company, which passes on its benefits to suppliers in its region by reducing its distribution use of system charges. The scheme is designed to assist the development of hydropower. That is part of its background and the reason for its existence. The benefits of hydropower are distributed throughout the grid. I am afraid that there is no comparison and, in that sense, the scheme is irrelevant. What is important is how it works.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51114-37_para3">
<a name="stpa_370">There is no national grid for water. There are no network charges between water companies that can be adjusted in the same way. There are also other differences. The electricity scheme represents the continuation of a scheme that has been in place since 1943. As a matter of fact, it was put in place by a coalition Government. The scheme is not new. Indeed, the AAHEDC is a continuation of it. As I said, in part it is a form of support for renewable energy development. We have other mechanisms for renewable energy. The scheme is an early version of those. I am afraid that the comparison is a dead end.

<p><a name="st_406"><a name="51114-37_spnew2"><b> Andrew George: </b> 
 The Minister says that there is no comparison, but the comparison between the support that the Government wish to give to renewable energy is equivalent to the support that we would wish to give to the tourist industry and the viability of the coast line around the south-west. That carries a premium by comparison with the clean-up costs in the rest of the country.
</p>





<p><a name="st_407"><a name="51114-37_spnew3"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 It does carry a premium, but other regions, companies and customer groups could make similar arguments about their circumstances. I mentioned Thames, but other parts of the country also have high costs. The hon. Gentleman&#039;s argument is a difficult one to make.

<a name="stpa_371">The issue is one of affordability for those least able to pay. We want to address that issue and that is why we have the vulnerable groups regulations. Last year, a cross-Government steering group reviewed the way in which lower income households are helped with their water and sewerage charges. The Government are working with Ofwat, the water companies and the Consumer Council for Water to take forward the recommendations of the affordability report. That includes looking into alternative tariff structures and charging options, and a pilot study in the south-west.

<p>
<a name="51114-37_para5">
<a name="stpa_372">The first strand of work is to look at the scope for redistributing the burden among customers of a company through tariff and charge structures. We did review the water charging system in 1997&#150;98 and that resulted in the Water Industry Act 1999, which introduced protection against disconnection, and the free meter option. I stress that for many people in the south-west going on to a meter would cut their costs&#151;

 Not for everybody.
</p>





<p><a name="st_409"><a name="51114-37_spnew5"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 I do not dispute that, but I urge people to take up the option. It is free and they can try a meter for a year, after which they have the right to have it taken out if they do not think that it saves them money. That is a fair offer and I urge the hon. Lady to encourage her constituents to take it up.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51114-37_para6">
<a name="stpa_373">We are open to new ideas on charging methods and tariffs. A working group will look at the current charging system and explore a range of tariff options. The group includes representatives from the Treasury, Ofwat, the Consumer Council for Water and the water companies. The group will consider how tariffs might distribute the total burden of a company&#039;s charges in ways that might address affordability. It will consider, for example, the block tariff, which has great scope for improving the situation.

<a name="51114-37_para7">
<a name="stpa_374">As the hon. Lady says, we are setting up the south-west affordability pilot study, and I regret that it has taken some time. It is a new approach and we have to tender for the work, which takes a little time, although we have reached the closing stages. The pilot is limited&#151;we never pretended otherwise&#151;but it will benefit the most vulnerable, and that should be our priority.
