She is right to say that DFID and all the other agencies that we work with are operating in partnership in Malawi. DFID is recognised as being the gold standard when it comes to such work: that is why it is important, even though the fund being administered is small compared to the vast sums of money at DFID&#146;s disposal, to make sure that it does not suffer from duplication of effort.

It is this Government&#151;led, in this instance, by the Chancellor of the Exchequer&#146;s international leadership&#151;who have led the way in cutting debt and helping the most heavily indebted poor countries.

 The hon. Gentleman raises an important matter that I have acknowledged previously from the Dispatch Box. Essentially, this is a matter of engineering. The full suite of programmes can be broadcast from the main transmission masts, but that cannot happen from the relay transmitters because the signal is weaker. That is where the two-tier element comes in. On Thursday, I am due to meet Vicki Nash of Ofcom Scotland at the organisation&#146;s office in Glasgow. I assure the hon.

 The European rules on subsidised ferry services in Scotland are clearly a piece of useless bureaucratic nonsense.

 May I begin by declaring that the headquarters of CalMac are in my constituency? That allows me to say that I am aware of the concerns over this protracted tendering exercise, which is, as I have said, a matter for the Scottish Executive. Both the Executive and the UK Government agreed that we had to go through the tendering process, although it has led to some slightly ill-informed speculation, and comparisons with the Paris Metro. There is a different regulatory regime for the Metro system and the maritime system&#151;and as far as I am aware, there are no boats on the Paris Metro. People who want to make that comparison should think twice before doing so.</p>

If re-elected, we are going to introduce a scheme that will give a 40 per cent. discount to inhabitants of the islands&#151;not just the Clyde islands such as Arran and Cumbrae, but the western islands. The move to introduce that important ferry subsidy is due to the intense lobbying and great activity of Alasdair Morrison, the Member of the Scottish Parliament for the Western Isles, who, more than anyone else, has helped to bring this scheme about.

Some&#163;15 million has been wasted&#151;enough for three years of free travel to my constituency, and especially Stornoway. My constituents have been kept on tenterhooks.

All those projects have a massive success rate, so does the Secretary of State agree that for that group of people, who have traditionally found it hard to get into employment, such a one-to-one, soft-skill, motivation, mentoring and coaching process might be more applicable than the traditional one-size-fits-all approach on finding employment that Governments have historically taken?</p>

 Yes, we have. The reason we went through a search process was because the community cohesion element of the work that was with the Home Office came to the new Department for Communities and Local Government. It is right that it has done so, because now we are able to think about equalities in the round, taking account of the views of faith groups as we take account of the views of other equalities groups. That give us a huge opportunity, going forward, to think through how we make this country and this society a fairer and better place for people to live. We have a candidate of fantastic calibre in that job to take that work forward.</p>

 I welcome all the good work that the Secretary of State and the Minister for Women and Equality are doing on the equality agenda. On inter-faith activity, does my right hon. Friend agree that getting young people together in those forums is particularly important? Bridging the divide at an early age is crucial to tackling it later.

 My right hon. Friend is right to say that involving young people in inter-faith work and in joint and shared activity is vital to our future. Evidence shows that young people are particularly prone to the messages from violent extremists. If we are to ensure that they have the defences that they need and that communities are resilient to the threat posed by violent extremists, we need to engage as many young people as possible. The new Commission for Equality and Human Rights, to which my right hon. Friend referred, will have a particular role in making sure that people of all ages and across all faiths are able to have their voices heard. In the Muslim community especially, and also at local authority level, we face a challenge as a Government to make sure that the voices of young people and women are heard in the debate&#151;voices that have for too long been neglected.</p>

In particular, we set out new planning policy guidance before Christmas in order to prevent inappropriate development in flood areas and ensure that homes are sustainable for the future.</p>

 Do we not need to target more new housing specifically at young people, particularly those who find themselves in a position of being or about to be homeless? Will the Government develop a strategy to promote the building of foyer projects in each town throughout the country?</p>

 My hon. Friend is right to highlight the good work that foyer projects do. We have set a target to end the use of bed and breakfast for young homeless people, as we think it inappropriate. Foyer schemes are one way of doing things, but there may be other ways of providing supported housing for young people in communities. My hon. Friend is right to say that it should be a priority. We have made great progress helping families out of homelessness and now we want to do more for young people.</p>

 Thirty-three years ago, I was vice-chair of housing in Luton when we had a housing waiting list of 4,000 families. We simply built and bought thousands of homes and housed all on that waiting list. Our housing waiting list is even bigger now and the majority of people on it cannot contemplate home ownership, as it is simply beyond them. I suggest that my hon. Friend should look again at what we used to do in the 70s and perhaps replicate it now.</p>

 My hon. Friend will know that the housing market has changed substantially since the 1970s, and that we now have far more home owners than we did then. He will also know that it is right to increase more market housing, along with more shared ownership and social housing. I think that councils need to play a stronger role in that process as part of the investment in new housing for the next few years.</p>

 The mandatory licensing of high-risk houses in multiple occupation and discretionary powers for local authorities to license other private rented accommodation were introduced in April 2006. From 6 April this year, we will introduce a scheme to protect tenancy deposits.</p>

 There has certainly been excellent short and medium-term progress at the bottom end of the market in the schemes for HMO licensing and tenancy deposit protection, but does the Secretary of State agree that we need some long-term reforms in this sector&#151;either by licensing rented property or encouraging landlords to sign up to minimum management standards, greater security of tenure and only linking rent rises to inflation? That would make private sector renting much more attractive and guarantee a lot more tenants decent homes. Does my right hon. Friend agree?</p>

 I agree with the thrust of my hon. Friend&#146;s comments. We should have a dual approach. First, we should encourage minimum standards and the spread of good practice across the sector. We are doing that by supporting accreditation schemes, where local authorities work with landlords to drive up standards across the sector. Secondly, we should give local authorities the powers that they need where management and landlords are clearly failing in their duties. If we take that two-pronged approach, we will avoid a situation in which hundreds and thousands of tenants throughout the country face the consequences of extraordinarily poor management on occasion and insecurity in their tenure as well.</p>

It would not be safe to return people who bear tribal scars and who are immediately identifiable by hostile authorities.

 On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. I seek your advice in respect of an answer that I received during Health questions on 6 February from the Minister of State, Department of Health, the hon.

So far, we have not had a statement of the official position from Her Majesty&#146;s Government.

questions on the Order Paper were appropriate for raising the matter just now. In the county of Bedfordshire, there is confusion and consternation about the written statement. It is not at all clear what will happen to local government, particularly in the middle and southern part of Bedfordshire. Chief executives of local authorities do not know what to tell their staff about whether they will still be in jobs. My constituents deserve better. It is impossible to take forward important local matters when we do not know what councils will exist in future. The House rises in two days, and it is too late for an Adjournment debate.

I agree that we are about to enter a recess, but one of the advantages of that is the Easter recess Adjournment debate, in which the hon.

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o16"><a name="70327-0004.htm_para7"><a name="07032777000192">As Liberal Democrat spokesperson for women and equalities and for small businesses, I often have to balance the needs of both groups when looking at policy. It might be thought that flexible working is a topic that would require such balancing. I introduce this Bill, however, in good conscience that I am serving the interests of equality and good business.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o17"><a name="70327-0004.htm_para8"><a name="07032777000193">I am indebted to Mrs. Susie Ankrett, who is both a constituent and a small business owner, for suggesting this Bill to me. Mrs. Ankrett runs an award-winning recruitment agency, Plum Personnel, and is well placed to understand the issues from all sides&#151;as indeed am I, having had my own small business and brought up my family at the same time. Even if someone is Superwoman, doing such things while developing a career is tough. That is the dilemma facing so many families today. Women begin their career with roughly equal status with men. I say &#147;roughly&#148;, because women graduates still earn on average 14 per cent. less than men at the start of their career, and by the time they reach the age of 35 to 40 the gap has widened to 40 per cent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o18"><a name="70327-0004.htm_para9"><a name="07032777000194">What happens? It starts when children come along. For me, having my daughter was the most wonderful experience of my life bar nothing, and I am sure that many women feel the same. I am also sure that being a father carries the same sense of privilege for many men. Men want to exercise that privilege, but there is a problem. In many companies there is a long-hours culture&#151;I call it &#147;presentism&#148;&#151;under which someone&#146;s worth is valued more by the number of hours that they are at work than by the economic contribution that they make. So when baby comes along, the option of both parents taking their share in the caring is often not feasible. One partner has to make a career sacrifice and take the lion&#146;s share of the child care. That is often gladly and willingly done, but the trouble is that the parent who makes that sacrifice will pay the price in future career advancement&#151;and, let us face it, that is usually the mother.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o19"><a name="70327-0004.htm_para10"><a name="07032777000195">The mother will, therefore, often take part-time work far below her skill level to fit in with school hours and holidays, and when she wants to return to work full time she finds that the boys have raced ahead. She still takes the main responsibility for the children, and she is unattractive to employers as a result. The equalities review published only a few weeks ago found that, in the recruitment stakes, women with children under11 are 45 per cent. less likely to be employed than men. Employers are, therefore, missing out on a wealth of talent that they could be tapping into for fear that a mother will need time off to exercise her caring responsibilities. She has hit the glass ceiling, and they are losing real ability, loyalty and a much stronger economic contribution to their company.</p>

economic responsibilities have fallen to a disproportionate extent on his shoulders. The inequality of the relationship is reinforced by the economic divide, but it does not have to be that way. Flexible working can rescue the situation for the employer and the family.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o21"><a name="70327-0004.htm_para12"><a name="07032777000197">Research into flexible working by the Department of Trade and Industry in the 2003 work-life balance study discovered that employers who provided flexible working found that that had a positive impact on employee relations, enhanced employee commitment and motivation, reduced labour turnover, and had a positive effect on recruitment, absenteeism and productivity. Two thirds of respondents to a survey by the Work Foundation said that flexible working helped to reduce absenteeism, and research has shown that flexible working practices have enabled small businesses to recruit and retain higher quality staff. DTI research in 2000 found that some small businesses saved up to &#163;250,000 through reduced staff turnover, simply by adopting flexible working policies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o22"><a name="70327-0004.htm_para13"><a name="07032777000198">For businesses small or large, flexible working can bring benefits. Let us consider Microsoft, some 85 per cent. of whose UK employees work flexibly. Need I say more? In fact, I do need to, because there are many situations where flexible working would not work for some employees. There are good business reasons for companies to say no, and everyone understands that. Under the current legislation, no employer is forced to accede to a request for flexible working if there is a business case not to. I know that some small businesses feel that employment legislation puts them at a great disadvantage. Small business people want to put their energies into building their businesses, rather than getting bogged down in worrying about falling foul of Government legislation, or acting as an unpaid revenue collector for the Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o23"><a name="70327-0004.htm_para14"><a name="07032777000199">Maternity leave is a bte noire for many small companies. When one employee constitutes 25 per cent. of the work force, losing them on maternity&#151;or paternity&#151;leave obviously causes a problem. How much better it would therefore be if such an employee could work flexibly, continuing to contribute&#151;in an albeit more limited way&#151;instead of being lost altogether for a period.</p>

Flexibility works both ways; when there is appreciation of the needs of each party, the situation works to mutual advantage. I would therefore like to see more flexibility in the implementation of Government legislation, allowing mutual agreements that are in the spirit of accommodating the needs of both parties.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o25"><a name="70327-0004.htm_para16"><a name="07032777000201">I have talked about businesses, but let us consider fathers for a moment. Again, research supports what is common sense: the more time a dad spends with his child, the less likely that child is to experience developmental problems. That is a benefit to society, as well as to the father. A more balanced home/work life also means that the father is less likely to suffer the stress that damages productivity and increases absenteeism. For women, flexible working could help to raise that glass ceiling, enabling them to enjoy a career and a family without having to be Superwoman to achieve both.</p>

Member for Stretford and Urmston (Beverley Hughes), have called for. I would like to see a definition of flexible working that is wide enough to accommodate the needs of all parties.

When he sat for the very first time alongside the leader of Sinn Fein, the Member for Belfast, West (Mr. Adams), in Parliament buildings at Stormont yesterday, they took Northern Ireland closer to a final political settlement than anyone has ever before thought possible. Their pictures together resonated around the world, a graphic manifestation of the power of politics over intolerance, bitterness and horror.</p>

They have together taken charge of the process from the British and Irish Governments. As a result, the political settlement that will emerge will be far stronger and more robust than anything imposed by Government, precisely because it is grounded in local agreement. That is where we have wanted to be since beforethe Good Friday agreement was signed almost nine years ago: locally accountable politicians taking responsibility for the future; locally accountable politicians showing that whatever their differences&#151;and it is hard to imagine two parties with greater differences&#151;they can work for the common good without sacrificing either principle or integrity.</p>

The IRA has declared its war over and decommissioned its weapons. It has closed down the criminal activity that used to fund the conflict, because there is no conflict to fund. Sinn Fein has committed to the active support of the police and criminal justice institutions. There has been a new beginning to policing and the rule of law, stretching right across the communities. There is peace, and there are more jobs and more prosperity than ever in Northern Ireland&#146;s history. The final piece in the jigsaw is long-term political stability.

 The Secretary of State will know that thousands of people voted at the ballot box on the understanding that his words had some meaning when he promised that devolution would happen on 26 March&#151;that is, yesterday.

<p><a name="stpa_o41"><a name="70327-0005.htm_para9"><a name="07032777000223">The St. Andrews agreement, with its twin pillars of support for policing standing alongside the commitment to share power, provided the basis for a lasting settlement. Last November, during the passage of the St. Andrews legislation, I made it clear that, if a power-sharing Assembly and Executive did not result, it would be a considerable time before an opportunity like it ever came round again. That was quite simply because I, and many others, thought that the parties themselves would never agree a way forward on their own. I am delighted to have to revise that view in the light of the extraordinary events of the past few days.</p>

The House will recall that the legislation set in statute the date for the restoration of devolved government in Northern Ireland. That date was 26 March&#151; yesterday. The legislation was explicit: if an Executive were not formed on that date, the Assembly would dissolve. As a consequence, Members&#146; salaries and allowances would stop. Water charges would come into force, academic selection at age 11 would go, and partnership with the Irish Government would deepen.</p>

I said more than once that 26 March was a deadline that would not move, and that failure to meet it would have consequences. There would only ever be one set of circumstances in which progress outside that framework could be made and that would be if the parties, for the very first time ever, formed a consensus around an agreed way forward.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o44"><a name="70327-0005.htm_para12"><a name="07032777000226">It is axiomatic in Northern Ireland that there is not a political wire down to which the parties do not go.

Friend the Prime Minister, we made it clear that there would be no extension to the deadline in the absence of an agreed way forward brought to us by the  <br>

parties. When we were asked by the Democratic Unionist party last Wednesday to grant an extension we said no, because we could not credibly return to this House and ask for more time unless the DUP could persuade the other parties that there was a credible reason for doing so. We were asked again last Friday. Again we said no&#151;unless the DUP managed to get other parties, including Sinn Fein, to agree.</p>

It is for that reason that this Bill, which will have the effect of moving the date of the restoration of devolution to8 May, is before the House today. Both the DUP and Sinn Fein have agreed on that date, and both have asked that the introduction of water charging be deferred until the Executive are formed. I have agreed to both requests, and I ask for the support of the House in that.</p>

This morning, I noted that a number of newspaper commentators made a comparison between the events at Stormont yesterday morning and the famous meeting between Yitzhak Rabin and Yasser Arafat on the lawn of the White House; but we know now that the hopes that Prime Minister Rabin and President Arafat held then lie in ashes.

Bogus distinctions between so-called civic and so-called political policing will undermine the credibility on this issue that the Sinn Fein leadership seeks to achieve.

I was accused of not shaking hands with the leader of the Sinn Feiners and I said, &#147;Why should I?&#148; All the people who shook hands with him are gone&#151;do you want me to go too?

When the first agreement was signed, I remember that they celebrated with songs, handshakes, dancing and kicking me, for I happened to be there. I was well kicked by them all and cursed as well. Then the Secretary of State at the time, Mo Mowlam, got me wrongly arrested, and the Assistant Chief Constable had to come and get me out. I have been through all that, but people who know me will realise that I am not saying that just to bring back the old bitternesses. Let us get the old bitternesses away. As I said to the leader of Sinn Fein, it is not a love-in but a work-in that we are engaged in, and when the people start to work for the things that they need, we will find a cure for some of the terrible problems that are still there; that is when we will get those bitternesses away.</p>

You can even be stern with them, but if you bully them, you&#146;ll get nowhere.&#148; He did not believe me, but he believes me now; the proof of the pudding is in the eating. I do not think that we should rub that in. <i> [Laughter.]</i> Perhaps I have done enough rubbing already. All I am saying is that I am glad that Ulster people, whether they be Sinn Feiners or Unionists, will, at the end of the day, have some say in how they are governed.

 Having listened to the contribution of the right hon. Member for North Antrim (Rev. Ian Paisley), I think that I can speak for the House when I say that I feel the hand of Paisley on my shoulder, not least because he is sitting right behind me. I have covered Northern Ireland issues for the Liberal Democrats for 10 years now, but I have lived with Northern Ireland politics for 40 years. I remember the feeling of fear and, frankly, hopelessness of the 1970s, when politics in the Province was measured more in lives lost than votes won. Even as a teenager, the hate that I observed seemed as endemic as the violence&#151;and back then, it probably was.</p>

I congratulate the Government for getting as close as they have done. I have known the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland for many years, and I regard the measures that we are discussing as his greatest political achievement. I share his vision for a stable and sustainable Stormont Assembly and a shared future for the people of Northern Ireland. The right hon. Gentleman has the right to feel a sense of gratification that his endeavours have helped to achieve it.</p>

I was optimistic enough to believe it could happen, even though others were not. I am glad to say that it is a testimony to the optimism of the Secretary of State that we have come this far.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o64"><a name="70327-0007.htm_para2"><a name="07032777000271">When Sinn Fein&#146;s ard fheis and its leaders encouraged supporters to co-operate with the Police Service of Northern Ireland, I said then and I say now that it was a momentous move forward. Again, the optimists were right and I praise the journey that Sinn Fein and the IRA have taken. Others doubted that this would be so, but I never did. My confidence in the republican movement was based on the people I met, and I judged them to be sincere. They have proved that faith in their positive intentions was not misplaced, though of course it must now result in action.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o65"><a name="70327-0007.htm_para3"><a name="07032777000272">In yesterday&#146;s momentous meeting, the DUP categorically committed to entering a power-sharing Government with Sinn Fein on 8 May. That is six weeks from now. The right hon. Member for North Antrim has taken a very strong position throughout and his conditions have been met. It is important to recognise that. His party said that it was condition-led. He has achieved what he laid out as his goals in the previous two Assembly elections. In large part it is thanks to his contribution that the restoration of devolved government is now just weeks away. So we must recognise the potentially historic significance of the statement yesterday.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o66"><a name="70327-0007.htm_para4"><a name="07032777000273">However, I am disappointed that the deadline of 26 March, as set down by the emergency legislation passed last November, has not been met. We are faced with yet another delay, yet another piece of legislation on Northern Ireland rushed through Parliament, despite Government assurances that there was no time to do so. I understand the reasons for this. I understand why the Minister has felt the need to let deadlines come and deadlines go, reassuring us almost every time that there was no plan B, and always, of course, there was. The most reliable insurance policy to guarantee that8 May will be the date for the restoration of the Assembly comes not from the Government, but from Sinn Fein and the DUP. It is their deadline that I choose to believe.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o67"><a name="70327-0007.htm_para5"><a name="07032777000274">It follows that if for any reason 8 May does not work out, there is no point in the Government pretending that they have any leverage left to threaten anybody in this place, in another place or in Northern Ireland with deadlines again. They have put all their cards on the table, for reasons that I understand. When it comes to deadlines, they have no more cards to play.</p>

 I will leave the hon. Gentleman to check <i> Hansard</i><i> </i>with regard to his former question, but on the latter, I am in no doubt at all that the Secretary of State told the House that the deadline was immovable and absolute. As I say, I understand why he has taken this position, and thus I do not condemn him for it. Instead, I make an observation about the future, rather than about the past. The future allows the Government no leverage with regard to deadlines, so we must hope that on this occasion it works.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o68"><a name="70327-0007.htm_para6"><a name="07032777000277">There are many people who remain sceptical about the ability of the DUP and Sinn Fein to produce genuine power-sharing. However, it is those two parties who primarily have been entrusted by the electorate with the mandates and responsibility to govern. It is up to them to rise to the challenge, and it is up to others, including my sister party, the Alliance party, to hold them to account and to provide constructive opposition as and when necessary. I am determined to ensure that the next six weeks are used to their full advantage. There are discussions ongoing about an entire programme for government, including the Treasury&#146;s financial package. I hope sincerely that the details are hammered out.

Resources would be much better spent on providing quality public services for the entire community, rather than providing services a few hundred metres and a physical or psychological wall apart in a fashion which, in 2007, is out of date. After all, if Sinn Fein and the DUP can do business together in the dining hall of Stormont, surely Catholics and Protestants can exercise together in the sports halls of Belfast and the Province.</p>

Northern Ireland currently receives a larger subvention than any other region in the United Kingdom, a position that is not sustainable. I hope that the Government will work in the weeks ahead, before 8 May, to ensure that there is a clear programme of economic government to accompany the political changes that are taking place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o72"><a name="70327-0007.htm_para10"><a name="07032777000283">The mutual respect that I want to see in the community must also apply to political parties. There are many in Stormont who have been loyalists to the cause of a shared future, a cross-community approach to the governance of the Province. They were shown attention when the Government needed them and ignored when the Government did not. That is disrespectful, thoughtless and ultimately a betrayal of a decade of good faith.</p>

 Indeed. Contrary to all predictions in the Chamber&#151;apart from mine&#151;the Alliance increased the number of its seats. I have made that point, and the Minister knows exactly what I mean.

It must not consist simply of the relating of decisions made to the exclusion of the minority parties.</p>

they entered into a sort of political compact. That is very positive. The fact that they were able to present the option of a new date for devolution on 8 May and to make the commitments that they did is a much more hopeful sign of how things are going to work than what we legislated for in this House previously, when we had to remove, at the DUP&#146;s insistence, the provision for the joint election of the First Minister and Deputy First Minister because it was said that they could not be jointly elected under the Good Friday agreement and that it should be done separately.

We insisted on the principle of inclusion because we wanted to ensure that, when the agreement came to be endorsed, nobody had the excuse for voting against it because that would have created a form of government that included some parties and excluded others. We therefore succeeded in maximising the endorsement in the referendum, but we also wanted to ensure that even those who voted against the agreement would not, by virtue of that, be excluded from its institutions but could participate in them to the extent that they saw fit.

Member for Mid-Ulster (Mr. McGuinness) take up their responsibilities as joint First Ministers, they can enter that office free from the sort of harassment and hassle to which parties that previously took that course were subjected. I want to assure them that, as they undertake work, not in the interests of their parties, but&#151;in that office and working with others in the Executive&#151;on behalf of the entire public, they will have my party&#146;s understanding, good will and, every time it is deserved or necessary, our support. That is the only way in which we can take matters forward. I am no less a believer in the institutions of the agreement just because my party is weaker in them than it was. The level of our party support has not determined our judgment.</p>

As on other occasions when there is much talk in the media of progress and a lot of hype and spin, victims are left with very mixed feelings, as the Secretary of State has rightly said. There is an added twist of futility that adds to the hurt that they have carried when they see people settling for power-sharing institutions, which Sinn Fein previously denounced so many times as equivalent to surrender and a sell-out. Even in the weeks running up to the Good Friday agreement, Sinn Fein was saying, &#147;No return to Stormont&#148; and was insisting that because we were canvassing models for power-sharing institutions in the north and structures for north-south co-operation, the SDLP was a neo-Unionist party.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o89"><a name="70327-0007.htm_para27"><a name="07032777000307">Similarly, the DUP and others within Unionism totally opposed power sharing and set their face against any attempts at it in the past. When people see parties that then rejected those concepts settling for and embracing them now, they have to wonder whether we needed to go through the suffering, the hurt, the political stalemate, the stagnation and the divisions that we went through&#151;and the answer is that we did not.</p>

We could have been and we should have been where we are now far sooner. If it is our destiny now, it was always our destiny. If it is the only way forward now in circumstances of peace, then surely it was the only way forward in circumstances of difficulty, division, violence and ongoing suffering.</p>

The Secretary of State knows that we have been frustrated many times about how the process was handled, and we believe that if the Government had been firmer and fairer in the earlier years after the agreement, we would have got further faster. A certain destabilisation of the institutions was allowed and was tolerated&#151;at the expense, we believe, of the long-term process.</p>

If the Government had shown good authority on those two basic points, we would not have had the running instability that led to delays in establishing the institutions and then the various suspensions and subsequent difficulties.</p>

We ensured that it was a better agreement than perhaps he suggested in the faxes that he sent us in the weeks before its negotiation, but if it were not for him and his ministerial colleagues, I do not believe that we would have had the agreement. I believe that we could have had a better agreement and more from it sooner if different approaches had been followed, but the agreement is still there and we are essentially returning to it. It is a case of back to the future on 8 May.</p>

He has not always done the things that I would have liked him to do, but he has always been determined to see the day that we now see. I pay tribute to him and to the Prime Minister. As my hon.

remember sitting on the Government Benches in the summer of 1970, when we came to this House as new Members. I literally sat under him, and I almost had to send for earplugs so resonant was the voice. In a spirit of charity and friendship, I say to him that he has moved a long way since then. He is now the elder statesmen of Northern Ireland politics, and so much depends on him. We wish him and all the others, including, although it sticks a little to say it, the hon. Member for Belfast, West (Mr. Adams) and his colleagues, well.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o99"><a name="70327-0008.htm_para5"><a name="07032777000318">I entirely approve of what the right hon. Member for North Antrim said about the handshake. A handshake is a gesture, and there is always a time for gesture, but what he and the hon. Member for Belfast, West must do is work together. They come from different backgrounds and have different legacies, but if they can work together alongside the other political parties in Northern Ireland&#151;the Ulster Unionist party and the SDLP, for which I have a lot of time&#151;there will indeed be true hope, and a real chance of taking Northern Ireland to a condition of real normality alongside the other parts of the United Kingdom.</p>

Member for North Antrim is, understandably, a great one for biblical texts, and one thinks of beating spears into ploughshares and lions lying down with lambs, although he is certainly not a lamb. One also thinks of another First Minister, although differently designated, who stood on the steps of a certain house and read the prayer of St. Francis. We all need to remember the context of that prayer, because it applies to Northern Ireland. We need a time of determination and a time without bitterness, which is the most corrosive of all emotions. There is plenty that one can be bitter about: there are those in Northern Ireland who have lost loved ones and suffered, and we have discussed that many times in the House. Like the hon. Member for Foyle (Mark Durkan), I wish that we had reached this stage a few years ago, but we are here now, and we must therefore look forward.</p>

This is a time for determination, and a time when we must hold in our hearts&#151;and if we so believe, in our prayers&#151;all those who are working for the good of Northern Ireland. We must recognise that the road ahead will not be easy. There will be moments of verbal conflict and raging rows, when people will feel like throwing in the towel, slamming doors and walking out. I say to the right hon. Member for North Antrim and to all my colleagues in Northern Ireland that the temptations to turn their back must not be succumbed to. The greater good of the greater number must be recognised as the goal for all. It matters not whether a man or woman&#146;s background is Protestant or Catholic, or which part of Northern Ireland they come from. Each one is individually important, and each one must be able to look to the power-sharing Executive as representing them, irrespective of their own political views and prejudices, of which we all have both.</p>

We toured Northern Ireland, and saw what an incomparably beautiful part of the United Kingdom and the island of Ireland it is.

It must be possible for the people of Northern Ireland to decide how the vexed question of water charges will be worked out.

Fortunately, the IRA failed on that occasion. I would not like to speculate on how many casualties there would have been if it had succeeded. Sadly, two weeks later on 21 March&#151;the day after mothers&#146; day&#151;the IRA set off two bombs in Bridge street in Warrington. They immediately killed a young boy called Johnathan Ball, and on 25 March Tim Parry&#146;s ventilator was switched off after he had been injured by the explosions in Bridge street.</p>

They always look forward and they have strived to contribute to the peace process in Northern Ireland. Through the Tim Parry Johnathan Ball peace centre in Warrington, they have established and developed links with the communities in Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic and attempted to take forward the reconciliation process.</p>

 There is one certainty in politics: when there is an historic moment of progress and promise there will be at least two reactions, one of which is that persons and parties attempt to justify the positions that they have adopted, and the other is that there will be those who seek to ensure that no one forgets the role that they played in events. My right hon. Friend the Member for North Antrim (Rev. Ian Paisley) and other Democratic Unionist party Members of Parliament care nothing about those issues. The only important factor in any agreement that is reached is the benefit that it will bring to the people of Northern Ireland.</p>

I have not been asked to make any remarks on this, so my word will, I hope, be all the more sincere and genuine. No such agreements were ever reached with the Home Secretary. He is one of those Cabinet Ministers who would never pass one in the corridor without having a word&#151;I have often had to console him about the defeats of Glasgow Celtic&#151;and he has an abiding interest in Northern Ireland matters. From time to time, of course, we talk about progress that is being made, but at no stage did the Home Secretary interfere in any way in the responsibilities of the Secretary of State.

decided what the consequences might be. It was not bullied into that position by anybody. No threats from the Secretary of State, the Prime Minister or anyone else would have altered the considered opinion of the DUP. We put our position forward to the Government publicly, as we have in the past, publicly, making it clear that this was what the DUP believed to be the right thing to do. I shall not remind people in any detail of the debate that we had on the Northern Ireland(St. Andrews Agreement) Act 2006 and the amendment that we put forward, which suggested that there should perhaps be some flexibility on the date of 26 March. If our amendment had been passed, we could have saved ourselves some time tonight and got on with the business of the Budget.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o112"><a name="70327-0008.htm_para18"><a name="07032777000333">The reality is that deadlines are much less important than agreements. Let us consider the reality for Northern Ireland if we had proceeded yesterday to set up an Executive without all the essential preparatory work that is required. We saw that in our meetings with the political parties yesterday, as we stacked up the issues that we had to deal with between now and May, with barely enough time between now and then to complete those preparatory tasks. It was abundantly clear that to do the job properly and to bring the community with us, we needed that additional time. The substance of what will happen in future will be much more robust because we have that additional time, irrespective of the deadlines.</p>

She seems to be disappointed that agreement has been reached in six weeks to a greater extent than she would have been if things had collapsed yesterday. That is sad and disappointing, and she needs to reconsider her position because it certainly is not the position held by her constituents. Indeed, with the same attitude, the leader of her party said yesterday, &#147;Isn&#146;t it a pity&#151;all this could have been done nine years ago.&#148; Of course it could not have been done nine years ago. Nine years ago, the IRA was still killing people. Nine years ago, it still held on to their illegal weapons. Nine years ago, it still continued with its paramilitary activity. Nine years ago, it still continued with its criminal activity. Nine years ago, it gave no support to the police, to the courts, to the rule of law. Nine years ago, there were no accountable structures under which we could operate. Nine years ago, legislation had not gone through this House ensuring a triple lock on the devolution of policing and justice&#151;ensuring that if ever a policing and justice Minister were put forward, he had to be somebody who could command the support of the Assembly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o114"><a name="70327-0008.htm_para20"><a name="07032777000335">So, nine years ago this could not have been done. Indeed, nine years ago, without those things being done, some people did enter into government, and it was followed by suspensions, by crisis after crisis and, ultimately, by collapse. It will be no good to the people of Northern Ireland if we simply go for a deadline to get things moving. We need to get things right, and that was the slogan that this party adopted in the elections. However long it took, it was necessary to get things right.</p>

However, nothing changed yesterday in Gerry Adams&#146; desire to bring to an end the union between Northern Ireland and Great Britain, and neither did anything happen to alter the determination of my right hon. Friend the Member for North Antrim that that link shouldbe retained and strengthened. With two such constitutional opposites in an Executive, there is bound to be tension. If Gerry Adams really believes that there should be a united Ireland, that is what he will work towards. It will be the job of all Unionists in the Executive to ensure that Northern Ireland goes in exactly the opposite direction.</p>

hon. Member for North Antrim (Rev. Ian Paisley) and the hon. Member for Belfast, East (Mr. Robinson)&#151;are a great ray of hope, both for me and for the people whom I have had the privilege to represent here for the past 20 years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o124"><a name="70327-0009.htm_para1"><a name="07032777000348">In fact, my memory goes back even further. Despite my youthful appearance, I have been involved in this process for more than 40 years, as I was first elected in 1961&#151;almost another century ago. In that time, the transition undergone by the people of Northern Ireland has been slow but remarkable. It may sound like a clich&#233;, but the reality is that they have had to cope with legacy that is many centuries old. Today, the orange and the green&#151;the men of extreme violence and words&#151;are joining together to promise a future that will embrace all the people in Northern Ireland and the island of Ireland. That is a day that I have long sought and long hoped for, and sometimes even prayed for. The communities of Northern Ireland have suffered greatly&#151;I need not repeat that there have been 3,000-plus deaths, 30,000 maimed, and many, many maimed mentally for life as well, and we are still suffering the consequences of an enormous suicide rate. The divided communities are still there, with high walls between them. It is a huge challenge to translate the good will and the getting together from the hierarchy of political parties into the ghettoes that, unfortunately, are still to be found in some parts of Northern Ireland.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o125"><a name="70327-0009.htm_para2"><a name="07032777000349">We need not be pessimistic because the process is ongoing, and it has enabled this momentous occasion to take place. I know&#151;I hope&#151;that the agreement made yesterday between the two primary parties and the other parties will sustain us into a much more peaceful, tolerant and prosperous society than we have ever had in my lifetime. That is a huge dream to fulfil in many ways and I hope that I will not be disappointed in any respect. I remember many years ago in the House when the first ceasefire was announced, and I know that we cannot expect a sudden switch-off of violence and attitudes of hatred. It will be a slow process and the new arrangements will be tested, perhaps unfortunately, on the streets on the Northern Ireland. I hope that that does not happen, but the political will of the major parties and all the parties in the Assembly will be hugely tested.</p>

On 7 March, the people will elect combatants rather than Governments, because never before in these islands or, indeed, in Europe,have people gone into an election where the Prime Minister has already been appointed from one party and the Deputy Prime Minister from another. The Governments, the media and everyone have encouraged people to involve themselves in what was a gladiatorial political contest. We have a result&#151;and, yes, the people have spoken&#151;but it was a contest of strength rather of policy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o127"><a name="70327-0009.htm_para4"><a name="07032777000351">There is a huge dichotomy in most of the major areas of social and economic development in Northern Ireland.

did not have the capability to collect them from 1 April onwards. I am only too happy for those rates to be shelved and used as a carrot for the parties coming into power. They will be shelved for one year, and it is their problem thereafter. There is a huge question, too, about the review of public administration. Sinn Fein wants seven super-councils, and the other parties are roughly united on a figure between 11 and 15. That must be resolved because it directly affects every aspect of life in Northern Ireland, perhaps for the next two decades. In education, one of the major parties supports the concept of selection for secondary education, but other parties do not.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o128"><a name="70327-0009.htm_para5"><a name="07032777000352">Those huge differences have to be ironed out, hopefully before 8 May&#151;although that may not be possible&#151;so that people who committed themselves to the new partnership have a vision of where they are going and so that their problems can be addressed. It has taken a long, long time to arrive at this point, and if it is the final resolution of our problem it truly is an historic day not only for the north of Ireland, but for Ireland and the UK. Indeed, our diaspora throughout the world is taking solace from what has happened in Northern Ireland; perhaps we can even apply some of the lessons in conflict resolution in other areas. That may be presumptuous, but we have some experience.</p>

We had a good, constructive debate and more than 90 per cent. of the membership of that body backed the resolution proposed by the party officers.

The people of Northern Ireland have seen too many false dawns. How many times have we been here before? How many times has there been the prospect of a breakthrough and delivery of the peace for which we hoped, only for those hopes to be dashed? We do not want to do that.

More than 60 per cent. of the electorate voted for parties&#151;including Sinn Fein&#151;on manifestos that committed all the parties to sit in Government yesterday and to be paid yesterday.

If I was sitting in Lagan Valley and another party was taking over as the leading party, I would not attack that party and make churlish remarks like the ones she has just made.

However, I also realise that some people have difficulties with the measure. This morning&#146;s edition of the Belfast <i> News Letter</i> includes comments made by William Harpur, a disabled former police officer who survived four IRA attempts on his life. He is unhappy with what has occurred. I respect Mr. Harpur&#146;s opinion and understand where he is coming from.

He was my cousin. I can well rememberthe day that my uncle came to our front door to deliver the news of his death at a place called Crossmaglen in south Armagh. I am glad that we have the prospect that his death and the others that have occurred in Northern Ireland might be the last of the deaths of gallant officers who have stood at the front line to serve and protect the community of Northern Ireland. If the price that I have to pay to ensure that that happens is to swallow hard, look to the future and perhaps face difficult and challenging decisions, I am prepared to pay it, and so are my colleagues. We want to be sure that when people say that they support the police, they actually do support the police, and that when they say that they want to uphold the rule of law, that is precisely what they do.

If we have a peaceful society, will they reflect that it was not worth taking the extra six weeks so that we could secure that future for them and our children? I do not believe that they will. I do not think that anyone will remember much about 26 March as a deadline. They will remember it as a day that offered hope for the future.</p>

Our objective is to rebuild our economy so that we can pay our way in the United Kingdom, because we are a proud people, and we do not want to be dependent on others. We want an economy that enables us to be fully part of the UK, and we want to be capable of securing our place by paying our way and playing our full role in this United Kingdom.</p>

 A lot of people present in the Chamber have come a long way to get where we are today. I was just thinking about some of the things that I have gone through since I first got involved in Northern Ireland politics. In 1988, a group of 11 parents came across to north-east England to tell us about the children whom they had lost due to plastic bullets. We went with them to Brock&#146;s fireworks factory in Sanquhar in south-west Scotland, where the plastic bullets were made. They were pilloried by local people for going there and for asking, &#147;Will you please stop making these weapons, because they are killing our children?&#148; It was a salutary lesson for me about man&#146;s inhumanity to man, and particularly about inhumanity towards young people.</p>

of speech that had been imposed on Sinn Fein. It was not that I necessarily approved of what Sinn Fein was doing, but I disapproved of silencing people, as that is the wrong thing to do. Again, we were met with howls of protest, and the demonstrators faced real and present danger in the streets of Glasgow. Thankfully, we have come a long way since then, but even so, there have been milestones and setbacks.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o142"><a name="70327-0009.htm_para19"><a name="07032777000376">In the early 1990s, I was involved with a group called the Agreed Ireland Forum. Its members, who were from virtually every part of Irish society, first came across to this country for a meeting, and then went back to hold meetings in Ireland to try to take things forward. I was pleased to be able to organise a conference in Newcastle, County Down, just a few days after the bombing of Canary Wharf. People from every political party in Northern Ireland bar one&#151;unfortunately, it was the Democratic Unionist party&#151;came to that meeting, as well as people from the ethnic minorities, a growing group whose needs must be taken care of in the new Northern Ireland. The meeting was opened by the President of the Republic of Ireland; that was a very strong statement, all those years ago. It said, &#147;Yes, we can work together.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o143"><a name="70327-0009.htm_para20"><a name="07032777000377">In an intervention on the Secretary of State, I mentioned the work of the trade unions. I am proud of the fact that I worked with trade unions in Northern Ireland that tried to ensure normalcy when their members were working in chaos. Their members were threatened every day by people trying to jump queues and abuse public servants and public services. I was convinced and guided by people on both sides, including a branch secretary at a hospital in Belfast, who had served time as a young man for robbing banks to fund the loyalist cause, and civil rights marchers on the Republican side who have carried the flame from the 1960s to the 1990s and beyond, to try to develop peace in Northern Ireland. I was attacked by so-called London Irish representatives of my own union, who said that we should not even be organising in Northern Ireland, despite the fact that we were by far the largest trade union in Northern Ireland, and despite the fact that 30,000 people wanted to be members of my union. I am very glad that we ignored those voices.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o144"><a name="70327-0009.htm_para21"><a name="07032777000378">We developed structures that crossed sectarian barriers and we said, &#147;If it&#146;s wrong, it&#146;s wrong. It doesn&#146;t matter where you went to school. It doesn&#146;t matter where you go to church. It doesn&#146;t matter what your name is. If you&#146;re being treated badly, the union will stand up and oppose that.&#148; I probably had more problems in the trade union movement with people arguing among themselves than we had in arguments about the country&#146;s politics.</p>

My union was responsible for funding much of the work that Mo Mowlam did before she went in as Secretary of State. That meant that as a Minister she was able to confront civil servants and wipe them out of the way, so that she could sit down and talk directly with the politicians on the ground who were developing a way forward that was not blocked by the stagnant, cold hand of the civil service in Northern Ireland.</p>

72 days, but in that short time the work of people like the hon. Member for Foyle (Mark Durkan) showed that despite the opposition from outside the Assembly, there was a chance to make progress. People did get together and work positively. After suspension, the Assembly returned. All the arguments and problems were described earlier by the hon. Member for Belfast, East (Mr. Robinson). We went from crisis to crisis to collapse.</p>

The real worry in the past was that when a deadline failed, a vacuum followed. The history of Northern Ireland is that if a political vacuum occurred, the terrorists filled it. I wish the deadline had not passed yesterday, but there is no vacuum. Instead, people are working their socks off to try and pull things together and make the agreement work. That is a massive change.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o148"><a name="70327-0010.htm_para2"><a name="07032777000382">Since I entered the House two years ago, there have been enormous frustrations. We have sat down and worked together for hours, and it has been pointless, going forwards, then backwards. We sat for 27 hours on one Bill. The Secretary of State had to come to the House and acknowledge that it was not working. He had egg on his face that day, as well as yesterday. That was frustrating for those who wanted to see the process move forward.</p>

It is unrecognisable, compared with what it was 10, 20 or 30 years ago. In every sense it is a much better place, and we should all be proud of that. The Northern Ireland Assembly is to be led by probably the two most polarised parties anywhere in Europe, if not the world, and there will be ideological problems, but in a democracy that must be accepted.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o150"><a name="70327-0010.htm_para4"><a name="07032777000384">Since I entered the House, I have worked closely with the hon. Member for South Staffordshire (Sir Patrick Cormack) on the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee. Twenty years ago I was ideologically opposed to his Government, and I still am. As a miner, I was ideologically opposed to what his party was trying to do to my community. That has not stopped us, along with other Members with similar experiences, working together for the betterment of the people whom we represent and for the people of Northern Ireland. That demonstrates the possibilities for the people who will take up responsibility.</p>

The positive things that were said yesterday not only by the DUP, but by Sinn Fein, about being serious and making the agreement work, have set an agenda. Collapse is no longer an option. Yes, there will be crises. That is part and parcel of the democratic process, but walking out, deliberately undermining the process because one group cannot get their own way, is not on. That would be a betrayal of the people whom they represent, of the House and of the trust that the House has placed in them. It would also betray the people of Great Britain, who for 40 years have supported the people of Northern Ireland in every sense and want to continue to do so.

 It is interesting to follow the hon. Member for Blaydon (Mr. Anderson). I am sure that throughout my time in the 1980s and 1990s our views on the position in Northern Ireland would have been diametrically opposed, but we certainly agree today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o153"><a name="70327-0010.htm_para7"><a name="07032777000388">I was an Army intelligence officer in Northern Ireland in 1994. I therefore had a unique insight not only into the thinking of the Government of the day and the efforts that they were making towards peace, but into what was going on inside the terrorist organisations. It is right to pay tribute at this time to the men and women of the Royal Ulster Constabulary&#146;s special branch, the military and the security services, who not only worked to achieve justice and catch criminals and terrorists, but had worked towards peace for many years before the 1994 ceasefire. They continue to work towards peace, whatever their titles are today, because we always worked not just to catch members of the IRA or the loyalist paramilitaries but to achieve a settlement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o154"><a name="70327-0010.htm_para8"><a name="07032777000389">Ministers will be aware, although they may not be allowed to say it in a public forum, of the work that has taken place, and is taking place today, to ensure that the Government of the United Kingdom are in the best position to use information to achieve peace. There was no great conspiracy to make war and continue conflict; the conspiracy was only to achieve a good resolution for peace.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o155"><a name="70327-0010.htm_para9"><a name="07032777000390">I must give some credit to a man to whom it is not easy for me to give credit. I must give credit to Gerry Adams, and to Sinn Fein. I know from experience, from members of Gerry Adams&#146;s organisation and indeed from the IRA, how much horror and murder was inflicted by some of those individuals, but I must give Gerry Adams credit for what he has achieved in persuading a terrorist organisation to come to the table to talk and, moreover, commit itself not just to a ceasefire but, apparently, to a permanent ceasefire. The constitution of the IRA army council has always denied any form of peace. It was a military organisation, and what Gerry Adams has achieved deserves some credit in this arena.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o156"><a name="70327-0010.htm_para10"><a name="07032777000391">I can say that because I have had many experiences of Gerry Adams&#146;s organisation, none of them jolly.

actions. I can say that in memory of people such as Tim Parry and others who lost their lives on this side of the argument.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o157"><a name="70327-0010.htm_para11"><a name="07032777000392">More importantly, I want to pay tribute to the right hon. Member for North Antrim (Rev. Ian Paisley) and the DUP. Throughout the process people were keen to say &#147;Appease, concede, give in, make the gesture, go for peace&#148;, and every time it was said the right hon. Gentleman responded &#147;Not until we achieve the best deal for our constituents, our electorate: not until we are sure that these people mean peace.&#148; Actions speak louder than words in Northern Ireland. They always have, to Ulstermen. Those who forget that may find themselves in the position of the Secretary of State today. I believe that the slipping of the deadline was probably nothing more than an Ulsterman&#146;s wish to have the last word. That is very much the way of Ulster. The Secretary of State may have thought that he was in charge of all the blackmail and the bullying, but in the end the Ulstermen will tell him when they want to start the process. So I pay tribute to the DUP, which stuck to its guns.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o158"><a name="70327-0010.htm_para12"><a name="07032777000393">I never agreed with all that the DUP said in my time. I remember stopping the right hon. Member for North Antrim one day; he was not a Member of Parliament at the time. It was a Sunday, so he would not speak to me, a member of the security forces. He was on his way to do God&#146;s bidding. When I saw the press trying to interview the party leader on yesterday&#146;s television news, I knew that nothing would be said on God&#146;s day. The right hon. Gentleman has stuck to his guns, and I believe that without that, Sinn Fein would never have recognised the Police Service of Northern Ireland or worked with the forces of law and order; but no doubt it will be tested by the DUP in the Assembly, to establish that its words mean actions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o159"><a name="70327-0010.htm_para13"><a name="07032777000394">We should not, however, forget the efforts of the United Kingdom Government under this Prime Minister and those of a number of previous Conservative Governments to ensure that we achieved what we have achieved today: a peace process with, hopefully, a conclusion. Last March I went to Northern Ireland and stayed in Headquarters Northern Ireland. I remember it as a pulsating citadel of the power of the United Kingdom, under threat sometimes, and sending men and women out to risk their lives&#151;but it was a ghost town. Much of it was empty: many of the places that I recalled having purpose and function no longer existed, because there was no longer any purpose and function.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o160"><a name="70327-0010.htm_para14"><a name="07032777000395">I went to visit my old bases, but I could not do so because they are now housing estates. In Cookstown there are a number of houses and no base, which is ironic because it was in Cookstown, in 1994, at the time of the first ceasefire, that I made the decision to close two vehicle checkpoints for a couple of hours. That was interesting, because the habit among the population of that town was to stop at the checkpoints; they were not used to being able to drive on. As a result there was a traffic jam, although no soldiers were present.</p>

from Headquarters Northern Ireland. I asked in the guardroom how I could book an &#147;approved&#148; taxi. In my day, to risk a taxi that had been booked by telephone might be to take one&#146;s life in one&#146;s hands, if the taxi had been booked from the wrong part of town. I was told, &#147;There is no approved list. Just dial a number.&#148; I dialled a number, a taxi duly appeared at the gates of Headquarters Northern Ireland&#151;I was not used to that either&#151;and I was driven to the centre of the city.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o162"><a name="70327-0010.htm_para16"><a name="07032777000397">I did not look at the driver&#146;s tattoos, terrified lest I catch sight of the Red Hand of Ulster, &#147;God Loves the UVF&#148;, a tricolour or &#147;IRA&#148; on his arms. Instead, I engaged him in conversation about what he thought of the current peace deal, or peace process. He did not mind&#151;he wanted it to happen&#151;but he was most aggrieved at the act that politicians were receiving allowances for doing nothing. If anything could have told me that normality was arriving in Northern Ireland, it was that. It sent a signal that the <i> Daily Mail </i>might have a circulation in Northern Ireland in future; that people were obsessed with, and angry about, the fact that politicians were wasting time rather than dealing with the issues of the day.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o163"><a name="70327-0010.htm_para17"><a name="07032777000398">There is a challenge for the Assembly. As a former Member of the Scottish Parliament, I have seen devolution in action, and I am not opposed to it. I have also seen nationalists in action, on a far better footing than I have in Ulster. The challenge for the Assembly and the Assembly parties is not to become bogged down in petty squabbling. If on day one the parties in Northern Ireland become involved in discussing whether they should have green, orange or blue tablecloths, or whether there should be lilies in the hall of Stormont, they will betray not only themselves but the electorate who sent them there.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o164"><a name="70327-0010.htm_para18"><a name="07032777000399">When at a time of peaceful politics the nationalists&#146; agenda is to exploit such difficulties&#151;such tiny, petty differences&#151;for their own ends, my advice will be to ignore it. The best way in which to counter nationalist pettiness is to say, &#147;You can argue about whether the cross of St. Andrew or the Union flag should go on top of a Government building all day long, but it will not give people a better health service, a better education and a better transport system.&#148; That type of real politics usually puts the nationalists down. I advise people not to play into the nationalists&#146; hands if that is what they set out to do&#151;and I am sure everyone knows from what happened the first time that that is exactly what some of them set out to do. I say, &#147;Be better and bigger than that, and I believe that the electorate of Ulster will, in the end, reward you for it.&#148;</p>

With devolution a success, it must give up the bullying and the blackmail that has sometimes characterised trying to get the Ulstermen to the table. It needs to become the strong voice of Ulster in Westminster, not Westminster&#146;s voice in Ulster. It needs to be at the top table of the Cabinet and to say, &#147;We need a fairer corporation tax so that Northern Ireland can compete better with the south of Ireland.&#148; If it is the champion of Ulster in the constitutional environment of Downing street and the House of Commons, the electorate will again be less tempted to move towards a nationalist agenda. If it does that, the symbol that we are all chasing&#151;a handshake&#151;will become a reality,  <br>

Stormont will become a lasting, successful settlement, and in the end peace will be achieved. Then the electorate, who have throughout this put up with death, murder and threats, will be able to focus on what is really important in Northern Ireland&#151;education, health, industry, business and a future for the Province, which, as a Unionist, I hope will remain in the United Kingdom.</p>

However, I would say to the Secretary of State and his ministerial team that they might still have some way to go in explaining to the younger generation how we ended up with the meeting that took place yesterday. My teenage daughter, who was born in Northern Ireland, wanted to know why, if all it took to get devolution in Northern Ireland was to threaten to send out water rates bills, it had not been done many years ago.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o167"><a name="70327-0010.htm_para21"><a name="07032777000403">Of course, we all know that it is much more difficult and complex than that. That is why I pay my main tributes to the right hon. Member for North Antrim (Rev. Ian Paisley) and to the hon. Member for Belfast, West (Mr. Adams) for the truly extraordinary meeting that happened yesterday. I congratulate them not only because the meeting took place&#151;it was certainly an historic event in itself&#151;but because of the measured and careful language that they used in the statement that was given to the press. Great care was taken to acknowledge each other&#146;s histories and the positions that they had come from. I very much pay tribute to them for doing that, because it gave all of us, particularly those of us who grew up in Northern Ireland and were used to hearing very different language, hope that things might be different, and better, in future. I suspect that when the Assembly is up and running, comments will not always be so measured. However, it is good that the difficulties of Northern Ireland will be played out across a chamber, with disputes settled through political discourse, not through violence on the streets of Northern Ireland. That is what we all hope will happen.</p>

 Members come to this debate with many different emotions and feelings. Some are full of elation and praise. There was once a song about Barry McGuigan called, &#147;Thank you very much Mr Eastwood&#148;, because he was always thanking people. Some are full of excitement because of the possibility of devolution in the month of May. There is a wide breadth of opinion in any political party. A party is always stronger, and democracy is always stronger, for that. I am exactly who I am; I am not going to be somebody else. That sometimes pleases and sometimes does not.</p>

Member for Lancaster and Wyre (Mr. Wallace) mentioned Cookstown. I was educated in Cookstown, and we lived just outside it. I represented that constituency for some 14 and a half years. It was ravaged by IRA terrorism and was for a considerable period known as the killing fields of Northern Ireland. Today, I represent another constituency on another side of the Bann. Many constituencies had different experiences during the years known as the heart of the troubles in South Antrim.</p>

He said that it could not be changed under any circumstances and that no legislation would be brought before this House. With one stroke of the pen, he promised that on 26 March it would be devolution or dissolution, one or the other, with no clouding of the issues or equivocation; it was black and white, and the people of Northern Ireland had better realise that.

people and politicians of Northern Ireland into accepting 26 March. I am glad that that plan has been thwarted and that once again a message has gone out that it will not be possible to carry out such blackmail, and that whenever Unionist politicians take a principled stand, they will stand by that principle. That message should exercise the minds of many. I believe that a message has been conveyed for the future: Unionist politicians will not yield in the face of threats and blackmail.</p>

Members of the reality of delivery. The Democratic Unionist party made it abundantly clear in its resolution at the executive that it will accept no regression on the issues already determined, and that we will press to ensure delivery by Government and Sinn Fein and make it a reality. On the St. Andrews declaration, we said that no delivery means no deal.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o174"><a name="70327-0010.htm_para28"><a name="07032777000413">There is still a need for delivery, for example, by the Chancellor. The Government must provide an adequate financial package to ensure that any Administration in Northern Ireland have the finances to meet the challenges. Promises that have been made are inadequate and will only undermine devolution when it comes. Let us consider corporation tax and the challenge of getting the engine of industry going again. We are not spongers, as Harold Wilson once said. We are a proud people, as my hon. Friend the Member for Lagan Valley (Mr. Donaldson) rightly said. We are a people with dignity and we want to provide for the future and for the prosperity of our children, but we are confronted with challenges just over a land border that we, as political people, must face and tackle. We can do that only when a sufficient financial package is in place.</p>

When the Government on this side of the water in the United Kingdom decided to privatise, they increased the standard of and modernised the infrastructure before doing so. Unfortunately, in Northern Ireland, they used the budget and the money given through taxation&#151;there was taxation through the regional rate for that infrastructure&#151;for other purposes. Our infrastructure was left to decline and was being destroyed. For many years, the people of Northern Ireland paid for infrastructure that they never got. The Chancellor and the Exchequer owe it to the people of Northern Ireland to restore&#151;not as a handout&#151;the money that they paid for that infrastructure.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o176"><a name="70327-0010.htm_para30"><a name="07032777000415">The other side of the deal and of delivery is Sinn Fein. We said and we say&#151;we have not changed our minds&#151;that Sinn Fein must unequivocally support the Police Service of Northern Ireland, the courts, the rule of law, a complete end to paramilitary and criminal activity and the removal of terrorist structures. That is where we stand today. The apex of those structures is the so-called army council. There is no need for an army council when there is no need for an army to threaten the people of Northern Ireland. It must therefore be dismantled.</p>

agreement. One was DUP support for power sharing and the other was Sinn Fein support for policing. The DUP election manifesto provided for the first pillar. Our executive endorsed that on Saturday at a meeting that I chaired. However, Sinn Fein must prove beyond doubt that it is capable of fully delivering the second pillar.</p>

The Secretary of State quoted Michelle Gildernew, who is absent from this House but was elected to it&#151;her party gets an awful lot of money for not coming here from the Government, who talked about Assembly Members getting paid for not doing their full work. The Secretary of State was selective in his quotation. He said that Michelle Gildernew said that she would give information to the police. That certainly constitutes movement&#151;I will come back to that. However, she also said that no republican attacked Councillor Brush and, in the same article, that the attack was not sectarian. Councillor Brush and the people of that area believe that it was a deliberate sectarian, republican attack, but Michelle Gildernew has decided that it is neither. She was asked whether, if she knew of weapons in dissident terrorist hands, she would report it to the police. She said that she would not. That is not what was demanded of Sinn Fein. There was to be unequivocal support for the PSNI, the courts, the rule of law and a complete end to paramilitary and criminal activity.</p>

It is therefore abundantly clear that it is important to take such weapons from those who have them. For example, I am led to believe that, last week, dissident republican groupings brought in a cache of arms. That fact has been hidden; it has not yet been published. A cache of arms was brought into republican hands. What for? What will the Government do about it? If Sinn Fein wants to call itself completely democratic, it must declare that any terrorist uprising, irrespective of the proponents, must be crushed, and that the organisation must be stopped in its tracks and face the full rigour of the law.</p>

As far as I am concerned, the idea of Sinn Fein in a Government is obnoxious. It makes me sick to the pit of my stomach. My thoughts are with the innocent victims, Protestant and Roman Catholic, throughout the community, who have been slaughtered by the IRA and so-called loyalist terrorist organisations.

 First, I apologise for not being here at the start of the debate. I was attending events in my constituency, but I wanted to take the opportunity to say a few words in this debate representing a constituency that is home to a large number of Irish people from both the north and the Republic.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o185"><a name="70327-0011.htm_para8"><a name="07032777000425">Last week, I attended an Irish pensioners event in my constituency and met people who had been driven to London by the poverty in Ireland.

But it has actually happened and I would like to place on record my tribute to the Secretary of State and his ministerial team for their efforts towards achieving yesterday&#146;s very important meeting. Previous Secretaries of State over the past10 years should also be praised for doing so much over that time to bring about some kind of resolution to what was seen to be a wholly intractable problem.</p>

violence that can lead to the most horrible deaths. One hopes that this is the end of that particular chapter in the history of Ireland.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o187"><a name="70327-0011.htm_para10"><a name="07032777000427">The history of Ireland has indeed been very bitter and bloody in the north and the south. If we look at the history of Ireland from the occupation onwards, we see the famine, the hunger, the Easter rising, the civil war and all that went with it. Then there is the history and process in Northern Ireland itself. One hopes that today sees at least an acknowledgement of the contribution that both communities have made to the history of Northern Ireland and will continue to make in future when the Assembly starts up.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o188"><a name="70327-0011.htm_para11"><a name="07032777000428">One also has to recognise that all four of the main parties in the Assembly have made enormous jumps and changes&#151;Sinn Fein, the Democratic Unionists, the SDLP and Ulster Unionists. I have been a Member of the House since 1983 and like many other Members I have sat here and opposed many of the pieces of legislation to do with Northern Ireland: the Prevention of Terrorism Acts, the broadcasting ban, the travel ban and all sorts of legislation designed to support the idea that there could be a military solution in Northern Ireland, which suppression of speech could help to bring about. I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Blaydon (Mr. Anderson) about that. Indeed, not so long ago, I voted with SDLP Members on the Justice and Security (Northern Ireland) Bill because I believed that it provided the possibility of continuing the Diplock courts system&#151;a system that was wholly discredited. One hopes that normality will return and that Northern Ireland will get jury trials just like, I hope, in the rest of the UK.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o189"><a name="70327-0011.htm_para12"><a name="07032777000429">We should pay tribute to a number of people today. In particular, I want to pay tribute to Gerry Adams and John Hume, who both had the courage to go into secret talks and subsequent talks that brought about the Hume-Adams accord, which began to bring about the possibilities of the 1994 ceasefire. That was broken, as we know, and we then moved on to the 1997 ceasefire and subsequent developments. Then there was yesterday&#146;s historic event when the Reverend Paisley, as we should call him&#151;the right hon. Member for North Antrim (Rev. Ian Paisley)&#151;sat down with Gerry Adams and finally announced that an agreement had been reached. I pay tribute to both of them for bringing that about. It is very difficult to lead a community that is set in a particular direction to recognise the values of other communities within Northern Ireland and lead the way towards a devolved assembly, which we hope will come into operation at the beginning of May.</p>

Six weeks is absolutely nothing for the prize that lies at the end. I hope that, in passing this legislation tonight, we recognise the huge sacrifices that have been made by many people in all communities. The brutality and the awful pieces of legislation of the past are now hopefully behind us, as we move to a peaceful and democratic future in Ireland. People there deserve the opportunity to live in peace. We should remember those who have sacrificed so much for todayand recognise those who have made important contributions in civil society.</p>

At Leeds castle, a deal was close, but it did not happen&#151;in many ways, I am thankful that it did not happen, because the Northern bank robbery took place afterwards.

Although many people contributed to the process, it is important to note the resolve of the leader of our party, my right hon. Friend the Member for North Antrim (Rev.

 However, the Minister did not get five salaries. Northern Ireland business was put through this House in an unacceptable way. I remember when the Secretary of State introduced legislation that would have changed the face of education in Northern Ireland. That legislation went through this House with one and a half hours&#146; debate and without any opportunity for further discussion. At the same time, a similar Bill, which had less far-reaching effects, was subject to two major debates in this House and to weeks in Committee. I do not believe that that is a good way to do business or to rule another part of the United Kingdom. Now we are moving towards a situation in which legislation can be considered properly and Northern Ireland business can be attended to properly, which is why yesterday was a good day.</p>

Different people have reacted in different ways. Shortly after the election, I held an advice centre. A lady led her husband into the advice centre&#151;she led him by the hand, almost like a child&#151;to talk about incapacity benefit. The lady&#146;s husband had been a policeman, and he was unable to put behind him the attacks on him and what he had witnessed, which had affected his mental capacity and everything else. After we dealt with the business, she said to me, &#147;Sammy, make sure you go through and sort this thing out. I don&#146;t want anyone else to suffer the way my husband has suffered.&#148; The very same day, another lady came in who had lost a son who had been in the Ulster Defence Regiment. Of course, her attitude was completely different: &#147;Have nothing to do with that bunch of murderers,&#148; she said. Different people will have viewed yesterday in different ways.</p>

Member for North Down is weeping because the Secretary of State said, &#147;Those who believe that they can push devolution back to May or October are making a catastrophic mistake, and if devolution is not up and running on 26 March, we will shut up shop.&#148; Perhaps she would have preferred the shop to be shut, but it is still firmly opening, and the official opening will take place on 8 May.

When he and I were first put on the Northern Ireland Policing Board, the same predictions were made that it would not last six months, and that it had to face the insurmountable problems presented by the Patten proposals, many of which the police and the Unionist community opposed. We worked our way around that. I could tell many stories about his role in taking on some of the Patten purists in his party, but I will not. During the four years that he and I were on the Policing Board, we disagreed and were unhappy about things, but we worked our way around them, and as a result policing in Northern Ireland was improved, despite the predictions.

We must deal with them through a form of government that parties in this House would find impossible to work. I listened to the Leader of the Opposition and the Prime Minister promise that they would never engage in Punch and Judy politics, but they still do so. We in Northern Ireland are being asked to overcome even greater differences than those between the two main parties in the House in order to work together. All parties are being asked to work together in a coalition.</p>

Ultimately, however, we can do the business for people in Northern Ireland, and that is why yesterday was a good day.</p>

 This is the last day of the debate on the Budget proposed last week by my right hon. Friend the Chancellor. I want to focus on the Budget far as it affects business in this country, because we live in a time of massive and rapid economic change that will affect each and every one of us as individuals, and which brings new challenges for British businesses and for our economy. This budget will help us to meet those challenges. It encourages investment to build Britain&#146;s long-term future. There are measures to help us deal with the consequences of the economic changes to the world climate, as well as measures to increase prosperity.</p>

We expect the economy to grow with historically low mortgage and interest rates&#151;just half those of the 1980s and 1990s. If we are to compete in the new global economy, we need to invest. We need to invest in transport and other infrastructure, and in education and skills and science, and we must also ensure that we have a flexible and highly skilled work force.</p>

Ten years ago, we had the lowest level of investment of the G7 countries, but now, alongside North America, we have the G7&#146;s fastest growing business investment. It has risen in real terms by 48 per cent. since 1997. In the last quarter of 2006, total business investment rose by 4.5 per cent. and manufacturing investment by 3 per cent.

It is not only the new industries that are doing well; established industries are doing well, too. The automotive industry has had its problems, but it produced more than 1.5 million vehicles last year, almost reaching the number of vehicles that were produced in the 1970s, which is regarded as the heyday of British car, van and lorry manufacturing. There is a new model of Mini, and Nissan has the most productive plant in Europe. There are many other examples that show that the British car industry is doing well.

 The Secretary of State is giving us a list describing the golden uplands of Labour economic management, but will he explain why there has been a decrease in the number of people employed in manufacturing since Labour came to power?

 The hon. Gentleman carefully picked a few years of the 18 years that the Conservatives were in power, because of course if he had cared to look across the entire 18 years he would have seen that there were substantial job losses in manufacturing. It is the case that, for a long time now, structural changes have been taking place in our economy, and that has been happening in other economies as well. There has been a move away from manufacturing towards the service industry. For example, our financial services industry is indisputably a world leader, and it has grown massively since the 1980s.</p>

When I visit countries such as China and India, people recognise that we have something in the City of London and our financial services industry that other parts of the world do not have. So manufacturing does matter, but what is also important is the strength of the economy overall. On any view, what we see today bears comparison with what we saw in 1993, or in 1983, for that matter.</p>

 There are new jobs in the public sector. Indeed, it is a matter of some pride that there are more teachers, doctors and nurses&#151;that makes a difference. Such spending has not been supported by the Conservatives these past 10 years, although they do give the impression at every Prime Minister&#146;s Question Time that they would like even more spending on health and education, for example.

 Given the Secretary of State&#146;s experience with the Pilot taskforce, he will know that a lot of manufacturing investment comes from the North sea oil and gas industry, and that many manufacturing employers in my constituency support that industry. Is it not therefore vital&#151;not only for those jobs but for the long-term income of the Treasury&#151;that we have a tax regime that does not frighten off investors, and which maximises the long-term attractiveness of the North sea, so that we can maximise the gain in terms of our energy and employment needs?</p>

 I agree with the hon. Gentleman and, as he knows, I am making a point of chairing the six-monthly meetings with the oil supply industry because it is very important that we have a regime that encourages investment. Two interesting things are happening in the North sea. Some of the forecasts of those who said that the tax changes that we announced at the end of 2005 would be bad for the industry were not borne out. Investment is up, and a very healthy list of people are applying for the last round of licences to explore. We are also working closely with the industry in examining the possibility of extracting oil west of Shetland, where the waters present extreme difficulties, as the hon.

For the Scottish national party, which has predicated so much on North sea oil, that is extremely worrying. A lot of the money that it has already &#147;spent&#148; simply will not be there.</p>

 I thank the Secretary of State for giving way again. Does he recognise that a lot of that extra investment came about because of a very high oil price throughout the world? The gas price is now dropping, which is obviously benefiting users. However, when oil is extracted, gas is often extracted at the same time, so the North sea price is effectively dropping. The Chancellor made it clear that the original tax increase was predicated on the very high prices around the world. Given that gas prices are falling, costs are rising dramatically and fields are getting smaller&#151;moreover, the projected forward investment from the industry appears lower&#151;the Government have to be careful not to kill the goose that lays the golden egg.</p>

 The current North sea oil price is not so very different from 12 months ago. We have made it clear over the past 10 years that we would of course look at the North sea oil tax regime. It is thought that there might be only 30 years-worth of oil and gas left in the North sea, but in order to maintain security of supply in this country it is in our interests that we do everything that we possibly can to continue to extract oil and gas. Last week&#146;s announcement is not going to change but, through the hon. Gentleman, the industry will doubtless want to look at the response document that the Treasury published on the same day, and which examined the very issues that he has set out.</p>

Indeed, more than half the Department of Trade and Industry&#146;s budget now goes toward science and technology. Last week&#146;s Budget provided a further rise in science spending&#151;from &#163;3.4 billion this year to &#163;4.9 billion by 2010-11. That is in addition to more spending for the Department for Education and Skills, particularly on universities.</p>

We have 1 per cent. of the world&#146;s population, but 5 per cent. of its science and some 12 per cent. of scientific citations. In the past few years, we have spent more than &#163;3 billion building world-class laboratories, and anyone who visits universities throughout the country will see the result. Ten years ago, many scientists were working in buildings on which money had not been spent for years; now, across the country we increasingly see modern, up-to-date laboratories.  <br>

Patents are up 98 per cent., and income from intellectual property is up by more than 100 per cent. In the past three years, 25 companies have emerged from universities and have floated on the stock exchange&#151;they have been valued at &#163;1.5 billion. University spending and research on fuel cells and nanotechnology, and in the biomedical field, also show how such spending and research can be turned into commercial opportunity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o234"><a name="70327-0013.htm_para1"><a name="07032777000491">Last week, I announced a &#163;100 million competition to bring universities and business together to lead in high-tech innovation&#151;from medical research to environmental transport&#151;in order to convert that scientific breakthrough into commercial success. We already fund more than 600 projects with over&#163;430 million of Government funding. Research and development as well as innovation are keeping the UK at the cutting edge of international competition. R and D tax credits, which I understand the Conservatives now oppose, have delivered nearly &#163;1.8 billion in support for business and have made a real difference. Large companies such as Nissan have used them to support investment in design, and smaller companies such as Wolfson Microelectronics&#151;an Edinburgh university spin-out company that developed the technology at the heart of iPods&#151;have used them to continue to grow and to innovate in their business. The Budget increased the amount of R and D tax credits available, and in total about 4,500 small and medium-sized companies are claiming more than &#163;250 million a year in tax credits. Those credits are absolutely essential if we are to support the investment that will enable us to compete in the future. It is no wonder that we have attracted more R and D projects than any other country in the European Union.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o235"><a name="70327-0013.htm_para2"><a name="07032777000492">It is also important that we continue to invest in education and skills, which the House debated last week. Education spending has doubled since 1997. Then, funding per pupil was &#163;2,500, but it will rise to &#163;6,600 by 2010. It is providing us with better equipment, modern schools, more teachers and more spending on universities.</p>

In the Budget, we announced reforms to employment law that simplify procedures and cut the cost of workplace disputes. We are very conscious of the need further to reduce burdens on business. Because of the strength of Britain&#146;s economy, the Chancellor was able to cut corporation tax again, to 28p, and it is lower than that of all our major competitors. We also believe that investment decisions should be driven by commercial, not tax, considerations. Of course, the reduction in the basic rate of income tax helps not just individuals but many small businesses. Up to 3.4 million sole traders will benefit from personal tax reforms and allowances. They will also benefit from the new annual investment allowances of up to &#163;50,000. Those allowances show that we recognise the need to encourage that investment, as well as research and development into new products.</p>

 It is worth bearing it in mind that of the just over 4 million small businesses in this country, about 3.4 million are sole traders and are therefore taxed through the income tax system. Because of small business rate allowances such as the annual investment allowance, which is quite generous&#151;many forms of business spending that people might typically contemplate are deductible&#151;if a business invests, say, just over &#163;2,300 in additional investment, the amount of tax that it has to pay is reduced. The regime that we are putting in place helps small businesses and individuals who benefit from the lower rate of income tax and the annual allowance. The research and development credits that are available will also help businesses do more. It must be right that we focus our tax allowances on the behaviour that we want to encourage, and we want businesses to do more research and development and to reinvest and grow, because that is how they will flourish. Our regime is and will be beneficial for small businesses and I believe that we will see that sector grow.</p>

 The annual investment allowance changes mean that unless one invests &#163;50,000, one receives no benefit. Therefore, the change in corporation tax will mean a lot of losers among small companies. Does the Secretary of State agree with Robert Peston, the BBC commentator, who has looked at the issue in some detail and shown that the vast majority of service businesses will be automatically excluded because they do not make the capital investments that the Government are trying to support?</p>

<p><a name="st_o206"><a name="07032777000497"><a name="70327-0013.htm_spnew3"><a name="07032777000865"><b>Mr. Darling:</b>
 I have not studied Mr. Peston&#146;s reports, or heard them recently, but I will take the trouble to do so when I have the time. It is not the case that a company would have to invest &#163;50,000 before it saw any gain. As I have just been explaining, a medium company that might be faced with a &#163;500 increase in tax would need to invest only &#163;2,300 more to offset it. In other words, they would not pay more tax. There are many companies and sole traders who, if they use the research and development tax credits, will pay less than they do at present.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o237"><a name="70327-0013.htm_para4"><a name="07032777000498">The objective of the reforms of corporation tax and business taxation is to reduce the rate and to target the allowances in a way that encourages investment and research and development. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman would agree&#151;although perhaps not in public&#151;that some of the allowances that are claimable today were put in place after the second world war when entirely different objectives were important, such as reconstruction, for obvious reasons. It must be right that the Government take the opportunity in the21st century to ask what is appropriate to encourage investment. Our future depends on us being able to encourage businesses to invest, especially in research and development, on which we have a good record. The Budget will encourage further investment. From a position of economic strength, we have been able to increase investment in science and in education as well as other public spending. We have been able to do more to help businesses invest in the future, as well as making  <br>

This weekend sees further rights to request flexible working, which will be extended to more than 2 million carers, and that builds on our other reforms. On that issue, as on so many others, the Opposition are pointing in two separate directions. A few months ago, the Leader of the Opposition said that he wanted more flexible working. He presented himself as the thoroughly modern man. However, in today&#146;s <i> Financial Times </i>he has briefed that he does not want to see any extension to flexible working. He has gone back to the position that we would expect from the Tories.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o239"><a name="70327-0013.htm_para6"><a name="07032777000500">It is not just on family friendly policies that the Tories are saying different things. On climate change, as my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary pointed out in last night&#146;s debate, the Opposition are saying one thing and doing another. On energy, where we have to meet the twin challenges of security of supply and climate change, the Tories are against the climate change levy, but in favour of a tax on holidays. They would tax individuals who fly, but allow businesses to claim back that tax. They say that they are in favour of renewable energy, but up and down the country Tory councils are opposing the biggest single source of renewable energy&#151;wind farms or &#147;bird blenders&#148;, as the Leader of the Opposition calls them. They are also opposed to the renewables obligation. In contrast, this Budget has a range of measures that help tackle climate change, as the House debated yesterday. If it is successful, carbon capture and storage will present us with an opportunity not just to reduce the amount of carbon we produce, but to export that technology across the world.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o240"><a name="70327-0013.htm_para7"><a name="07032777000502">If we are to continue to remain competitive in the face of the investment being made by China, India and other developing countries, we must also recognise the key role that public expenditure plays in, for example, schools and universities. Perhaps today, the last day of the Budget debate, the Opposition will finally tell us whether they will match our spending plans. Public expenditure, which is &#163;552 billion this year, will rise to &#163;674 billion at the end of the spending review period. That is investment in schools, hospitals, law and order and support for business. Are they prepared to match that spending? Why cannot they tell us?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o241"><a name="70327-0013.htm_para8"><a name="07032777000503">The problem for the Opposition is that they are trying to convince one audience that they really want to cut spending and taxes, and another that they want to spend more on public services. I feel sorry for the shadow Chancellor and shadow Chief Secretary, because hardly a day goes by when the Tories are not promising to spend more money on extra prison places, more housing, and a new border police force. At the same time, they have already promised to cut another 1p off corporation tax. They also have a commitment to abolish stamp duty at a cost of &#163;4 billion, as well as to introduce a transferable married couple&#146;s allowance that would help only 1 million of the 12 million married couples.</p>

That is why they have their third fiscal rule, which attempts to square a circle, but that cannot be done. The rule would have meant &#163;21 billion less spending this year alone. That third rule is a rigid, inflexible approach that takes no account of what the economy needs. It would not have allowed the investment that we have made in public services over the past seven years. The Leader of the Opposition said that his policy would make a &#147;dramatic difference&#148;. Indeed it would: he would have spent substantially less at the very time that our economy needed that spending over the past 10 years.

His speech, however, was as notable for what he left out, as for what he actually said. The Chancellor did not, for example, tell us that productivity growth&#151;the measure that he oncecalled the fundamental yardstick of economic performance&#151;is now barely half the rate that it was under the last Conservative Government. He did not mention that business investment, a key driver of future economic growth, has now fallen below 10 per cent. of GDP for the first time since records began. He also neglected to mention that while Britain had a balance of trade surplus in May 1997, under his stewardship there has been a trade deficit every month since January 1998, with last year&#146;s deficit being an all-time record of more than &#163;54 billion. The sleight of hand did not end there. While the Chancellor was proud to boast that his borrowing forecast was&#163;1 billion better than in his pre-Budget report, he forgot to mention that it was still &#163;16 billion worse than he predicted in last year&#146;s Budget.</p>

But perhaps the most interesting omission was on the UK&#146;s declining competitiveness. The World Economic Forum is the leading independent authority which assesses international competitiveness. It has found that in recent years the UK has fallen further and further behind. For example, when it comes to starting up a business, the UK now ranks 22nd in the world, behind Latvia and Tunisia. When it comes to the burden of the tax system, we are now down at No. 25, below India and Nigeria. When it comes to the burden of  <br>

It is a con that hits the poorest hardest. Thus a full-time employee on the minimum wage will pay more than &#163;160 more in tax as a result of the Budget. The Chancellor says that people can claim the money back through higher tax credits, but he knows full well that take-up rates on tax credits are often only 60 per cent. It is not even a Budget that takes money with one hand and gives it back with the other: it is one that takes people&#146;s money and then gives them a form to fill in instead.</p>

In 1997, Tolleys yellow tax handbook was 4,550 pages long; in just nine years, it doubled in size to more than 9,000 pages&#151;not least as a result of more than 100 stealth tax changes.</p>

The hon. Member for Hertford and Stortford (Mr. Prisk), who has just spoken, repeated some of them. Anyone taking an objective view over the past15 years would say that someone who could be Labour&#146;s shadow Chancellor for five years in the build-up to Government, and then perform as my right hon. Friend has in the role of Chancellor for 10 years, yet remain fundamentally sane&#151;<i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> I do not think Opposition Members question my right hon.

Finally, throughout the country, he enjoys general respect, if nothing more.</p>

I cannot believe that that is the last word from my right hon. and hon. Friends onthe subject. It is hurting many people whom the Government never set out in any of their policies&#151;I accept that that is a consequence and not an intention of the Budget&#151;to hurt. Indeed, when the 10p rate was introduced it was precisely to alleviate those problems that, in part, we are now creating. I know that there are tax benefits and that there are many other things that we have done for that category of taxpayer, but the matter should be revisited, and I hope that we will do so before the next Budget. Having made my point, I shall leave it at that. I wish to make one more point, as I see that the hon. Member for Mid-Worcestershire (Peter Luff) is not quite as keen to intervene as he was.  <br>

Of course, as my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry clearly said, roughly 3.5 million of the 4 million small companies in the UK are sole traders, so they are not affected by the measure, but there is still a substantial group of companies that are affected. We should not undertake one of those big, complicated bureaucratic reviews, but we should take a clear-headed sharp look at how we spend the money in support of small companies.</p>

 I reassure the hon. Member for Coventry, North-West (Mr. Robinson) that I do not intend to question the Chancellor&#146;s sanity, but I do rather question his commitment to social justice for the same reasons that the hon. Gentleman does, with his qualification.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o268"><a name="70327-0014.htm_para4"><a name="07032786000004">Six months ago, I proposed an alternative dream Budget that was tax neutral and included the following features: a 2p cut in income tax; lifting the upper earnings threshold and aligning income tax with national insurance; making greater use of environmental taxes; cutting corporation tax, and offsetting it with reduced allowances on business taxation; and getting rid of the 10p rate of tax. When I got over the frisson of flattery at discovering that that had been mercilessly plagiarised in the Budget, I realised, as many of us did, that there was one important detail that was different: the conversion of the 10p rate not to zero but to 20 per cent. That is a big difference, because instead of 2 million people paying no tax at all, they are paying more tax. That goes to the heart of what the Budget is about. It is not about economic management&#151;it is economically neutral, which is a positive factor&#151;but it is about redistribution and equity and how the gains and losses have fallen.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o269"><a name="70327-0014.htm_para5"><a name="07032786000005">There has been an attempt to introduce another dimension to the debate: what the Conservatives call distributing the proceeds of growth and what the Government call the third rule. That is a somewhat arcane debate because, as I perhaps rather simple-mindedly see it, the Chancellor is already redistributing the proceeds of growth. Approximately 40 per cent. of any increment in growth has been allocated to the public sector, and the remainder has been allocated to private investment and consumption. That is the forecast, and I am perfectly comfortable with it. Unless the Conservatives are willing to set out a different number and how they propose to achieve it, we all have to operate on the working assumption that we are reasonably content with the share of the state in gross domestic product. That is where I start from.</p>

On fairness, a useful benchmark is where we are in income and wealth distribution. The data that the Government have made available are a little dated, but the Government suggest that income distribution, measured in the usual statistical way&#151;Gini coefficients and so on&#151;is roughly what it was when the Conservatives left office. It deteriorated for a while, it then improved a little, and it is now more or less what it was when the Conservatives left office. Help for income redistribution has been provided by tax credits, whatever their other problems, but income redistribution has been worsened by the  <br>

council tax, which is regressive in relation to income. The problem area is the distribution of wealth, and that was the purpose of the question that my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for North-East Fife (Sir Menzies Campbell), the leader of the Liberal Democrats, asked the Prime Minister last week.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o271"><a name="70327-0014.htm_para7"><a name="07032786000007">It is shocking&#151;and it is difficult to explain&#151;that when the Conservatives left office the wealthiest 1 per cent. of the population had 26 per cent. of marketable wealth or financial assets. That figure has now gone up to 34 per cent. When the Conservatives left office, the bottom 50 per cent.&#151;the lowest half of the British population&#151;owned 6 per cent. of the country&#146;s asset wealth. That has now shrunk to 1 per cent. under a Government and a Chancellor who often use the language of social justice, which is an appropriate criterion against which to measure the Budget.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o272"><a name="70327-0014.htm_para8"><a name="07032786000008">The impact of the combination of the 10p tax rate change and the reduction in the standard rate is complex. The Institute for Fiscal Studies has run through the numbers, and it has concluded that one in five people lost out. Almost all of them are low earners who are single or childless couples. A couple of people who came to my advice surgery last Friday illustrate the problem perfectly. One was a widow with part-time earnings, who has never paid more than the 10 per cent. tax rate, as she is in the &#163;5,000 to &#163;8,000 band. She will simply pay more tax, without any offsetting credit. She is struggling to pay council tax and all the other impositions that she faces. The other was a young man who has just graduated and is starting life as a graduate scientist in the under &#163;18,000 band. He is a loser, and he does not have any offsetting gains. Those are the kind of people who lost out in the Budget. In a way, that is not surprising when we recall what the Chancellor said when he introduced the 10p tax rate&#151;the progressive policy that he is now reversing:</p>
<a name="70327-0014.htm_brev0"><a name="07032786000246"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Nearly 2 million people will see their income tax bills cut in half, and take home 90p of every pound they earn.&#148;&#151;[<i> Official Report</i>, 9 March 1999; Vol. 327, c. 188.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o273"><a name="70327-0014.htm_para9"><a name="07032786000009">That policy is now being reversed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o274"><a name="70327-0014.htm_para10"><a name="07032786000010">On the other side, we have to ask who benefits from the Budget, because people clearly have benefited. Some groups have benefited substantially. It is particularly worth focusing on one group: wealthy pensioners. Someone with a pension pot of &#163;1 million, which is certainly reasonably wealthy, and from which with sensible investments they will receive an income of &#163;50,000, will benefit substantially in several ways. They benefit from the lifting of the upper rate of tax. They will not pay national insurance and crucially, and rather oddly, the Government have retained the 10p rate for unearned income. That is difficult to understand. I remember the days when the Labour party put 98 per cent. tax on unearned income as it was considered rather evil, but now it is treated preferentially. When people earn income they have to be charged 20 per cent. at the first rate, yet they pay only 10 per cent. on unearned income. Affluent pensioners who are paying into their savings will receive additional top-rate relief of 40 per cent. and so on, so they benefit in several respects. I do not begrudge them that, but it is worth noting that they are the principal beneficiaries of the Budget.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o275"><a name="70327-0014.htm_para11"><a name="07032786000011">Pensioners who are not merely wealthy but have large capital assets that they realise in the form of  <br>

capital gains, and take advantage of the maximum taper relief, could also pay as little as 10 per cent. The 10 per cent. rate has gone for wage earners but it remains for unearned income and for capital gains. We saw a good practical illustration of that the other day. When Sir John Ritblatt stood down as chairman of British Land he described frankly how he had been able to benefit from the Chancellor&#146;s tax relief. He had gained about &#163;20 million simply by being able to take advantage of the reliefs on the large share portfolio that he held as chairman of that company. There are beneficiaries of the Government&#146;s tax changes, but they are not the people about whom the Government should primarily be concerned.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o276"><a name="70327-0014.htm_para12"><a name="07032786000012">I have one more point about distribution and fairness. We know that the Government have laboured for 10 years to produce changes and alternatives to the council tax system. We have had the Lyons report, which runs to about 600 pages&#151;I do not know whether anybody in the Chamber has actually read it yet. The report offers the Government two alternatives. One is to change the system radically in a way that reflects ability to pay, but the Government clearly do not want to go down that route. They were offered the alternative of ameliorating the system somewhat by changing the number of bands. It is striking that we have heard not a peep about how the Government propose to respond to the Lyons report, if at all. Their most regressive tax has been laboured over and endlessly reviewed, but at the end of the day the Government have absolutely nothing to say about it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o277"><a name="70327-0014.htm_para13"><a name="07032786000013">In terms of greenness, it is clear that there are some changes which, as far as they go, are perfectly welcome and are things that we have advocated. We would argue for a much wider band of vehicle excise duty rates, along the lines recommended by the all-party environment group. The Government have made a small move in that direction and we have no question about the principle of vehicle taxation. However, we are more critical about what they have been doing in respect of the aviation sector. It has long been realised that airlines pay nothing remotely like the amount of tax they should, for a variety of reasons: partly because of pollution and the absence of any form of fuel duty, although there are of course good treaty reasons for that; partly because the slots available to them free of charge take no account of the externalities and congestion involved; and partly because their landing charges are cross-subsidised. For a long time there has been a powerful case for significantly increasing and changing the nature of taxation on aviation, but in a very cack-handed way the Government have introduced ticket duties that have caused a great deal of damage to small tourist operators because of the retrospective way in which they were applied.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o278"><a name="70327-0014.htm_para14"><a name="07032786000014">The more important economic point is that the tax bears absolutely no relation to the environmental impact. Charges are on tickets rather than on aircraft. We have the absurd phenomenon that in Mr. Stelios&#146;s Easyjet, full to the gills, every passenger pays the full air traffic duty, whereas half-empty flights leaving from major airports pay far less tax because it is levied per passenger rather than per aircraft. It is a highly inefficient, environmentally ineffective form of taxation  <br>

and needs to be radically changed if the Government are really serious about environmental impacts.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o279"><a name="70327-0014.htm_para15"><a name="07032786000015">My third question is whether the Budget has introduced more simplicity. The answer is yes in some respects, and that is welcome. We have got rid of a rate of direct taxation, which is desirable. The alignment of national insurance and income tax is a difficult reform, for which tax reformers have long argued, so it is welcome that the Government are moving in that direction. It is also welcome that they have embraced at least the principle of cutting corporation tax and reducing allowances.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o280"><a name="70327-0014.htm_para16"><a name="07032786000016">However, in some respects the simplification is not working&#151;or not working satisfactorily. I wholly identify with the comments made by the Conservative spokesman, the hon. Member for Hertford and Stortford (Mr. Prisk), about the impact on small business, which will lose about &#163;850 million as a result of the changes to incorporation. Corporation tax rate on such businesses will rise in effect from 19 to 22 per cent. and they will receive only a proportion&#151;we do not know how much&#151;of the new capital allowance. There will be damaging effects for them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o281"><a name="70327-0014.htm_para17"><a name="07032786000017">Where the tax system is inherently complicated there are the severest problems. My hon. Friend the Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine (Sir Robert Smith) rightly raised the appalling problems that are being created for North sea oil revenue. The Secretary of State dealt with them at some length, so I shall not rehearse all the arguments. The key point is that the Government cannot entirely escape responsibility for the collapse in revenue. Tallow, one of the operators, describes the current tax rate, subsequent to the supplementary tax of two years ago, as punitive relative to the vast increase in costs. I think costs have risen by several hundred per cent. in the North sea. Another operator, Premier Oils, says that it no longer makes sense to develop the fields. It is not as though the situation was not foreseen. The Liberal Democrats opposed the tax increases; my hon. Friend the Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine spoke eloquently and at great length predicting exactly what has now occurred.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o282"><a name="70327-0014.htm_para18"><a name="07032786000018">Complex tax changes are involved in another area where they are bound to have negative impacts: the provisions relating to management service companies and IR35. The Conservative spokesman did not mention it, but we argued the case several years ago. I can understand where the Treasury is coming from. There are undoubtedly people who abuse the system. There is evasion of national insurance and we understand that the Revenue has an obligation to try to deal with it, but our practical experience is that the Government&#146;s actions, unless they are carefully calibrated, will be completely counter-productive. Although there are people who cheat, hundreds of thousands of people need to operate on flexible contracts. Unless the tax system captures that there will be considerable costs. I shall give some examples.</p>

It is worth remembering that, although our performance in growth terms is relatively good against the big G7 countries, particularly in Europe, if we compare it with all the countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the picture is much less flattering. Indeed, we are 22nd out of 27 EU countries in terms of economic growth, because the small countries are much more dynamic.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o286"><a name="70327-0014.htm_para22"><a name="07032786000024">We also need to remember why, although the Chancellor talks a good story about economic performance, it is clearly is not appreciated at street level. At the moment, people&#146;s real disposable income is being squeezed. People are experiencing a real reduction in their take-home pay, because the rate of inflation, which has spurted and is now at its highest level for something in the order of 12 or 13 years&#151;4.5 per cent. more in the retail prices index&#151;is considerably greater than the growth of earnings. People&#146;s take-home pay is being squeezed. That is how people perceive economic performance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o287"><a name="70327-0015.htm_para0"><a name="07032786000025">There are also two major problems looming up with which the Chancellor&#146;s successor will have to deal. They are not easy. The first is the big squeeze that the Government envisage in respect of public spending. I do not want to exaggerate it. The Institute for Fiscal Studies captured it very well: in the Government&#146;s period of office, public spending growth has moved from famine to feast to diet. Whether that diet is painful depends critically on what happens in respect of the so-called Gershon efficiency savings. The Government are making some heroic assumptions about the ability to deliver improved front-line services through efficiency. I hope that they succeed, but the  <br>

problem that the recent National Audit Office study identified is that, of all the savings in efficiency that the Government have claimed, they can verify only 25 per cent. The rest are either non-existent or cannot be traced. That is a pretty damning indictment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o288"><a name="70327-0015.htm_para1"><a name="07032786000026">The other area where the public spending squeeze will be more painful than it is currently appreciated is in relation to the knock-on costs of a lot of the hire purchase agreements&#151;normally called private finance initiatives&#151;that are feeding their way through the system. It is striking to look at the table in the Red Book showing the current PFI contracts. Half of them are in the Ministry of Defence, which is not an obvious area for PFI negotiation. Essentially, the Ministry of Defence is purchasing services on an HP basis. That is already taking up 4 per cent. of its budget and it has another &#163;50 billion of contracts on the way. In that way, it is postponing the choice between front-line military services and military equipment, but that will have to be faced&#151;and it will be brutal&#151;when the comprehensive spending review appears in a few months&#146; time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o289"><a name="70327-0015.htm_para2"><a name="07032786000027">My final point is about stability. Of course we have had economic stability and let us hope that it continues, but there was a revealing comment last week from Eddie George, looking back retrospectively on the period that he spent chairing the Monetary Policy Committee. He acknowledged that, in order to save the country from a serious downturn in 2000-01, he and his colleagues had injected monetary expansion into the economy, the consequence of which was a major bubble in debt and in the housing market. He used the phrase, &#147;This is not sustainable.&#148; If we look at the figures, it is all too clear why it is not sustainable. House prices in relation to disposable income have doubled in the period since the Government came into office. That is exactly what happened in the period between 1982 and 1988. This is a cyclical and unstable market.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o290"><a name="70327-0015.htm_para3"><a name="07032786000028">I do not want to predict doom and gloom; I have no idea what will happen, but at the very least the Government should think ahead about a scenario in which things go badly wrong, debt becomes unsustainable and the market deflates. They should talk to the banks about how to handle the large number of people who may well find themselves having mortgage payment difficulties. The numbers are already growing rapidly. There are no safety nets, because the right hon. Member for Hitchin and Harpenden (Mr. Lilley), when he was the Minister with responsibility for social security, removed social security support. The argument at the time was that the gap would be filled by insurance in the market. That has not happened. People are not protected if their incomes disappear and they are made redundant. We are going to face large numbers of people who are in great distress and who are unable to service their debts. At the very least, the Government should give an indication that they are thinking ahead about how to handle a problem that in the medium-term could be the most serious threat to stability.</p>

truth is that employment has risen by over 2.6 million since we came into office. We have the highest employment rate in the G7 economies. The new deal has helped nearly 900,000 young people into work. The adult rate of the national minimum rage will soon be &#163;5.52 an hour and the national minimum wage will be &#163;4.60 for young people. But those of us from areas that have suffered economic deprivation over the last 20,30 or 40 years, are watching closely to see the impact of the Budget.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o291"><a name="70327-0015.htm_para4"><a name="07032786000030">I accept the points raised by the Opposition about the impact of the 10p rate being removed and also about the issue of working tax credits. Working tax credits themselves are a good thing. If they are not working properly&#151;as in far too many cases&#151;they do not help. If they help, it will be true that, by 2009, a family with two children will, in effect, be able to earn &#163;24,000 before paying tax. That is a good thing. However, it behoves the Government, the Treasury and the Department for Work and Pensions to make sure that the tax credit system is sorted out and works&#151;for the benefit of people outside and of our party and our Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o292"><a name="70327-0015.htm_para5"><a name="07032786000031">The TUC brief was clear. The TUC said that it believes that, as a result of the personal tax changes, by April 2009 families will be at least &#163;200 a year better off. The poorest fifth of the population could be&#163;50 better off. A single earner, on median earnings, with two children could be as much as &#163;500 a year better off. But that will happen only if we get the tax credit system right. That is a challenge for our Government. Child poverty figures will be 200,000 lower. It is welcome that 600,000 fewer pensioners will pay income tax. It is right that only 43 per cent. of pensioners will pay tax.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o293"><a name="70327-0015.htm_para6"><a name="07032786000032">I want to talk about what is happening where I live. In 1986, I worked in the coal-mining industry in a village where male unemployment was 19.6 per cent. Then the pit was shut and 720 men were sacked, so the situation got even worse. Today, unemployment is3.7 per cent. Even going back to 1997, there has been a drop in unemployment of 57 per cent. Two years ago, the jobcentre was knocked down so that a factory that builds earth-moving equipment could be extended. That is a great sign of progress and we should all welcome it.</p>

The truth is that education spending will rise to &#163;90 billion by 2011&#151;the highest level ever. Spending will be increased from 4.7 per cent. of GDP in 1997 to 5.6 per cent. in 2011. Surely we should all welcome that. Because of that increased investment, we will be able to provide one-to-one tuition for 600,000 children, to double apprenticeship numbers to 500,000 and to increase higher education student numbers to 1.2 million. We will be able to make every school an extended community school&#151;the schools are up for that. We will be able to increase spending from &#163;2,500 per pupil in 1997 to &#163;6,600 in two short years from now. Surely we can all say yes to those figures.</p>

When the Bill to achieve that comes before the House, I hope that it will receive cross-party support.

 The hon. Gentleman&#146;s passion for education and support for increased investment is clear to the entire House. Does he feel betrayed by the breaking of the promise in the Labour manifesto to increase the share of national wealth spent on education, which the Budget fails to deliver? By 2011, which is the year that he cited, the proportion will not have increased.</p>

 I could argue about the figures, but I will not because I do not have time. The reality is that the spending will be more than it was when we came to power. It will represent 5.6 per cent. of gross domestic product&#151;&#163;90 billion. I wonder what the amount would have been if the hon. Gentleman&#146;s party had won in 1997. It would have continued going backwards, as it did when the Conservatives were in power.</p>

I will probably bore people to death by telling them what has happened on the ground, but I do not mind that. Let me point out the A-level pass rate in five comprehensive schools in my constituency. The pass rate at Whickham comprehensive school is 98 per cent. It is 94.4 per cent. at Hookergate and 100 per cent. at Ryton comprehensive. The rate is 100 per cent. at St. Thomas More and 97.1 per cent. at Lord Lawson of Beamish.</p>

In 2005, Gateshead was ranked as the eighth best performing local authority in the country with 65 per cent. of pupils achieving five passes at A to C. Last year, nearly 70 per cent. of pupils achieved those grades, which made Gateshead the fifth best authority in the country, with a figure well above the national average of 59 per cent. The percentage of passes at A to C increased at Hookergate from 39 per cent. to 52 per cent. The figure at Lord Lawson stabilised at 78 per cent. The rate increased at Ryton from 59 per cent. to 62 per cent. At Whickham, the figure increased from 78 per cent. to 84 per cent. Unfortunately, the rate at Thomas More stayed the same&#151;at 100 per cent. We should all be proud that those people are getting more than five O-levels.</p>

That was far too many&#151;1,446 too many&#151;but it was not the 21,000 nurses that the Tories were talking about last year. That really was a con trick.</p>

 My hon. Friend and parliamentary neighbour is absolutely right. Phrases such as &#147;winter beds crisis&#148; and &#147;waiting on trolleys&#148; have gone out of the vocabulary.

That is welcome, but I need to say something to my Government: phasing this year&#146;s pay rise is out of order. That is not what the nurses and health professionals of this country expect or deserve. The pay review award should be paid in full.

I have listened to 10 of them, and they are a fairly bewildering collection; he has had some fairly dull ones, and some odd ones. This was probably one of the most political that he has made. I suppose that he lived up to my constant expectation that he will surprise everybody. On this occasion, as I shall try to illustrate, his mind was fixed on headlines and politics, not on a responsible policy on public spending, and tax and spend. That distorted his judgment in ways that I shall seek to demonstrate.</p>

Of course I do not claim that he has been a bad Chancellor.

10 years added to them, and we have no idea when they are likely to come to an end. However, our performance has not been remarkable compared with that of many other countries, so I do not think that the eulogies that are sometimes heaped on him, and the claims that he is a remarkable Chancellor, are thoroughly deserved, but he has been a good, average Chancellor, and he has certainly performed better than an awful lot of Labour Chancellors.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o314"><a name="70327-0016.htm_para1"><a name="07032786000060">I attribute his 10-year record to a combination of the legacy that he was given&#151;he inherited an economy that was in good shape, and that was enjoying a run of growth with low inflation&#151;and a remarkable degree of luck, which is something that every Chancellor needs. The fact is that the global scene has been remarkably benign throughout his period of office. Most Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries have enjoyed fairly unprecedented periods of growth with low inflation. The nearest that he got to a global crisis was when the dotcom bubble burst in America, causing great problems in 2000-01. That crisis was averted, as the hon. Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable) rightly said, by an influx of liquidity hastily put into the system by Alan Greenspan in the United States and Eddie George in this country. Otherwise, the background has been one of increasing globalisation, which has been extremely beneficial. It has made it much easier to achieve growth with low inflation, because it means that there is downward pressure all the time from low-cost competition from around the world.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o315"><a name="70327-0016.htm_para2"><a name="07032786000061">In addition, the supply-side reforms of the Thatcher and Major years have begun to feed through steadily, and we find ourselves far more able to adapt, as an industrial economy, to the rapidly increasing amount of change taking place in the global economic climate. The result is that the Chancellor has presided over a reasonably benign scenario.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o316"><a name="70327-0016.htm_para3"><a name="07032786000062">There are always fragilities, and there are considerable ones in the present situation. It is well for the Chancellor&#146;s successor to have an eye to the risks that we face that might stop the current period of growth with low inflation. Some of the unknowns are global ones utterly beyond the control of the British Government, such as the question of what will happen to the American economy over the next year or two, after the remarkable sudden collapse of America&#146;s housing market, and given a likely reduction in consumer demand there. There are political problems throughout the world and our situation is not good, either. If I were asked why we are sustaining a reasonable level of growth, I would answer that it is dependent to a remarkable extent on the huge number of immigrants who have come to this country from eastern and central Europe in the past year or two. That has brought in a very industrious work force, but it has probably had more effect on the growth of the economy as a whole than on gross domestic product per head, in terms of improving our performance. The other thing sustaining our present level of growth is the rapidly rising level of public spending, which has not yet begun to slow down.We are too dependent on those two factors.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o317"><a name="70327-0016.htm_para4"><a name="07032786000063">I will not repeat all the figures that my hon. Friend the Member for Hertford and Stortford (Mr. Prisk) gave at the beginning of his excellent speech to show  <br>

how our underlying competitiveness in the global economy has steadily deteriorated in recent years. To pick out just one of the indicators that he used, I think that one of the starkest indications of our decline in competitiveness is our balance of payments position. I remember the years when a ridiculous amount of attention was paid to monthly balance of payment figures. Governments changed if the figures went wrong in the wrong month, in the run-up to an election. Of course, the balance of payments figure is only one among many, but our balance of payments now is the worst since records began. It continues to deteriorate and we have to go back hundreds of years to find a similar position.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o318"><a name="70327-0016.htm_para5"><a name="07032786000064">The balance of payments is a good measure of competitiveness, because it indicates that people overseas find it much easier to sell their goods and services in this country than we find it to sell our goods and services in outside markets. We are not in a particularly competitive position. That is the background to this year&#146;s Budget.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o319"><a name="70327-0016.htm_para6"><a name="07032786000065">The Budget certainly surprised me, because I thought that it was fairly obvious that we would have a low-key Budget, as there was really only one subject that the Chancellor had to address. One of the big weaknesses in our economic performance is the fact that the Chancellor has made a dreadful mess of the public finances. Nowadays, the stability and growth to which I referred depend to a considerable extent on the performance of the Governor of the Bank of England. During the Chancellor&#146;s period in office, there have been two Governors, who performed their task excellently. Of course, I congratulate the Chancellor on his excellent decision to make the Bank independent, but the fact is that responsibility for the health of the public finances is now a bigger part of the Chancellor&#146;s role, and he has got himself into an ever deeper mess on public finances. We are still running substantial deficits, and he still fails to forecast the size of those deficits successfully.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o320"><a name="70327-0016.htm_para7"><a name="07032786000066">Recently, there have been some very good years for growth, and if we had any sensible fiscal rules, such as the one that I held, which was to ensure a balanced Budget over the cycle, we would run a surplus in the current good years of the cycle; that is what we should do if we are to achieve any kind of sensible health in public finances in the longer term.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o321"><a name="70327-0016.htm_para8"><a name="07032786000067">I shall not bother with the Chancellor&#146;s discredited fiscal rules, which he always tells us he still adheres to, having so manoeuvred the goalposts over the years that they are rendered completely and utterly meaningless. The fact is that we are running an unstoppable deficit and he had to address it. Everybody knew that and, to be fair, he has done so in the Budget, though he certainly tried to bury it.</p>

Gentleman has been a tax and spend Chancellor on a colossal scale since his Pauline conversion back to taxing and spending in about 2000. He came into office saying that he abhorred the whole idea of being a tax and spend Chancellor, and he was extremely severe in his first few years. When he was following my figures, as he always used to say, he finally got the level of public spending in this country down to 37.1 per cent. of GDP in 1999, but in 2000 he began to  <br>

expand public spending on a grand scale, and he began to increase the tax burden and public borrowing greatly as well.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o323"><a name="70327-0016.htm_para10"><a name="07032786000069">The result is that the budget deficit was troublesome, needed to be addressed and no sensible fiscal rule could be hit over the next cycle unless something started being done with that deficit now. We have reached a situation in which tax in terms of the tax burden and the tax take from the GDP and spending levels as a proportion of GDP have been taken back to levels that we have not seen for about 20 years, since the early years of the Thatcher Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o324"><a name="70327-0016.htm_para11"><a name="07032786000070">The difference between the position of the present Government and the Thatcher Government in the early 1980s is that the Thatcher Government had inherited a fiscal crisis from their predecessor, and Sir Geoffrey Howe made determined efforts to get it under control and to get budget deficits and public borrowing requirements on a downward path, whereas this Government have presided over a steady growth in the level of public debt and are belatedly, after many years of warning, finally realising that they have to address that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o325"><a name="70327-0016.htm_para12"><a name="07032786000071">So the Chancellor has got himself into a position where he had to increase taxation and he had to announce more controls on public spending. It was plain as a pikestaff to everybody looking at the principal problem facing the Chancellor of the Exchequer when he came to the House that he had to do those two things. On tax, I regret that he had to do that. I would have controlled public spending very much earlier than the Government have started to do so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o326"><a name="70327-0016.htm_para13"><a name="07032786000072">I did not think the Chancellor would raise taxation in his Budget because he had done what he always does nowadays&#151;get that out of the way in the pre-Budget report before Christmas. He now makes a regular habit of that. The pre-Budget report, which started as a process, allegedly, of consulting for the Budget to come, is now a lesser-noticed occasion on which he tucks away bad news that he does not want to save up until he makes the major speech in March. In that pre-Budget report he raised &#163;2 billion worth of extra tax revenues.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o327"><a name="70327-0016.htm_para14"><a name="07032786000073">If we take not only the last pre-Budget report, but the last two pre-Budget reports and the 2006 Budget, we can see that the Chancellor has raised &#163;6 billion worth of extra taxation. Hence he has got the tax burden on the economy as a whole up to a near record-breaking level. As has been pointed out, in this Budget he added a further &#163;1 billion to the burden of taxation on business. I shall return to that in a moment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o328"><a name="70327-0016.htm_para15"><a name="07032786000074">Tax was not the Chancellor&#146;s principal concern. I waited for more news on spending, which is the key thing. There is, of course, the comprehensive spending review. The Chancellor is trying to impose on his successor much tighter controls on the level of public spending once he is out of office than he was ever prepared to accept since 2000. It is a strange comprehensive spending review, because it keeps being put out in dribs and drabs to make bits of it sound more attractive than they otherwise would be.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o329"><a name="70327-0016.htm_para16"><a name="07032786000075">To be fair, the Chancellor has added to our knowledge of the expectations under a Brown Government for the growth of public spending. It will  <br>

be sharply reduced. It will be reduced below the likely level of growth of the economy as a whole, which Conservatives from the Front Bench and I and others from the Back Benches have been urging for a considerable time. It is called sharing the benefits of growth. That is what he is doing. We now know that over the next three years, the growth of total public spending will be, in real terms, 2 per cent. per annum, well below trend growth of the economy and, if we are lucky, assuming that benign conditions continue, well below the likely actual growth rate that we will achieve. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o330"><a name="70327-0016.htm_para17"><a name="07032786000076">So public spending as a proportion of GDP will at last start coming down again, though in fact, on the Chancellor&#146;s own figures, it will still be above 40 per cent. at the end of the three-year period, so it is not as drastic as it should probably be. I always aimed to get it below 40 per cent. and the Chancellor followed that target when he first came into office.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o331"><a name="70327-0016.htm_para18"><a name="07032786000077">The other announcement that the Chancellor made was about education. We now know that education spending will be, in real terms, about 2.5 per cent. over the next three years. That is a very sharp reduction in the growth of education spending, which has been at about 4.5 per cent. in real terms in previous years. Following on from the remarks of the hon. Member for Blaydon (Mr. Anderson) in his very good speech, which I have the pleasure of following, that seems to me a reduction in the proportion of GDP being spent on education, as it is likely to be below the growth in the economy. I seem to recall that at the last election, the Government were pledging the reverse, as has been pointed out.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o332"><a name="70327-0016.htm_para19"><a name="07032786000078">We have very sharp falls in the rate of growth of public spending. I do not dispute that. It is long overdue. We should not have had a period of famine followed by feast followed by famine, or by diet. Given that the years of feast have resulted in the money being spent so badly and public authorities getting casually used to considerable increases in real terms spending each year, I know of no policy direction that the Government are following that will help those who manage the services to cope with the sharp reduction in the growth of their budget.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o333"><a name="70327-0016.htm_para20"><a name="07032786000079">When I talk to people in education or the health service, they are completely unprepared for that. There is a slight tendency out there to believe that that cannot happen, after they have been buying their way out of trouble on most fronts so much for the past few years. The money has gone largely into payrolls, very considerably into pay increases in some important parts of the health service, and has mainly achieved a sharp drop in productivity in our key public services, without adequate improvement in the quality of service to show the hard-hit taxpayer.</p>

He first tried to build a reputation for prudence, then he panicked in 2000 and he and the Prime Minister started to throw money at everything.

slowdown in spending. Across the public service as a whole, that will cause great difficulties, some of which we already know.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o335"><a name="70327-0016.htm_para22"><a name="07032786000081">Maintaining a freeze on Home Office spending after years in which the Government have been doing their best to increase the prison population at a fantastic rate seems to me to be almost impossible. If the prison population continues to rise at the rate at which it has risen in recent years, as the Home Secretary has tried desperately to get the right headlines in all the most popular right-wing newspapers, it will merely mean a tremendous squeeze on spending in every other part of the criminal justice system, including the police, the probation service and the Courts Service. No doubt that explains the Prime Minister&#146;s sudden and remarkable conversion to the policy of reducing the number of people in prison. We will see that sort of thing across the board as the real impact of the comprehensive spending review hits public services, and the Budget has given us a few more of the details.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o336"><a name="70327-0016.htm_para23"><a name="07032786000082">Of course, the Chancellor did not confine himself to that. I had expected his speech to contain a great deal about the public finances and about how he had already covered the tax situation and would now cover spending, but that was not the sort of speech he wished to make on the eve of his translation to the office of Prime Minister, when he will have the pleasure of appointing a Chancellor of the Exchequer who can preside over the difficult nitty-gritty of returning the public finances to some sort of healthy state. Instead, he made a wholly political speech aimed, as far as I could see, at the next day&#146;s headlines. However, it did not even work on that front, because he only secured headlines of the sort that he wanted in the most gullible newspapers, which I strongly suspect had been briefed to look for a particular theme in his speech before he delivered it. The other newspapers, which were able to analyse it overnight, realised that it was not a great tax-cutting speech, but that was the political note on which the Chancellor wished to leave.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o337"><a name="70327-0016.htm_para24"><a name="07032786000083">The first thing that impressed me about the speech was that it was governed entirely by the Chancellor&#146;s position vis- -vis my right hon. Friend the Member for Witney (Mr. Cameron), the Leader of the Opposition. The hon. Member for Coventry, North-West (Mr. Robinson) said that he admired a Chancellor who was not concerned by the up-and-down fluctuations of opinion polls. I do not believe a word of that. The Budget speech was written when the Chancellor had read some opinion polls and seen what his ratings were in relation to my right hon. Friend the Leader of the Opposition. He then decided on the old new Labour practice of triangulation, which the hon. Member for Coventry, North-West remembers only too well: he decided to go for what he believed were the strong points in my right hon. Friend&#146;s position. As he appears to imagine that our appeal depends on tax-cutting, he presented himself as the tax-cutting Chancellor, cutting income tax and business taxes in one and the same speech.</p>

put the stability of the economy first. No one will follow this Government&#146;s period in office by being able to make quick reductions in taxation. Indeed, my right hon. Friend usually gets into more trouble through disappointing the more enthusiastic of our party&#146;s supporters by refusing to hold out the prospect of near-term tax cuts. The Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Government decided that the Chancellor would shoot a fox of some kind&#151;one that he, at least, saw coming out of the burrow&#151;by announcing himself as a man who would cut the rate of income tax and business taxation; but, of course, he did not do so. That was rapidly discovered, and has had some fairly perverse effects.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o339"><a name="70327-0016.htm_para26"><a name="07032786000085">I shall deal with the two principal issues. First, there is the cut in corporation tax. There is a case&#151;indeed, many Conservative Members have been making it&#151;for reducing the headline rate of corporation tax, which has steadily been left behind as all our competitors have reduced it, by making some cuts in allowances. We might have been given a little more explanation of how the impact would fall, however, because different sectors of the economy will be affected in different ways. There is no doubt that the move is of huge benefit to the financial services industry, but cutting all the capital allowances overnight will have been very unattractive to heavy manufacturing and the utilities, which will be very adversely affected.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o340"><a name="70327-0016.htm_para27"><a name="07032786000086">I agree with all the Members who have said that the most baffling aspect of the headline cut in corporation tax was that it had to be paid for in part by an increase in the small business rate of corporation tax. The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry did his best, saying &#147;No, no, there will be no trouble whatever.&#148; He has set out the allowances, which some businesses can claim. It is true that some small businesses will be able to take advantage of the allowances, but he does not believe that they all will. A 3 per cent. increase in the small business rate is an extremely unattractive way of raising some of the money so that the overall burden of business taxation will still increase. The extra tax on small business raised &#163;850 million, with the result that the burden of taxation on business is still rising while the Chancellor stands there trying to bask in the glory of being the man who cut corporation tax and taxes on business in his last Budget.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o341"><a name="70327-0016.htm_para28"><a name="07032786000087">The effects are even more perverse in relation to personal taxation. I always put my cuts in the standard rate in the last paragraph of the Budget as well&#151;usually after I had put up a lot of other taxes. As a theatrical gesture, it is not original, but this one was neither successful nor very well concealed. Because the Chancellor wanted the headline about 2p off the standard rate, he has had little regard to how that redistributes between different sections of the population, especially given the other things he has done to the national insurance ceiling and the bottom rate of income tax.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o342"><a name="70327-0016.htm_para29"><a name="07032786000088">To an extent, I welcome that because the Chancellor has found a way of paying for it by taking from Peter to pay Paul, and some of the Pauls are quite deserving. One of the recent problems in our economy has been how little of the benefits of economic growth have got down to ordinary wage earners and workers on ordinary incomes, and they will benefit from a cut in the standard rate. A remarkable feature of recent years,  <br>

<notus-date day="27" month="3" year="2007" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><b>27 Mar 2007 : Column 1384</b><br>
which the Chancellor has not addressed, is that the disposable incomes of people in the middle bracket have hardly risen at all&#151;by less than 1 per cent. a year&#151;during the past four years of economic growth. It is worse than that. The discretionary spending available to the ordinary family on average earnings has dropped, because while their incomes have remained pretty much stable, they have found that bills they cannot avoid paying, such as council tax, utility bills and mortgages, are going up. The retail prices index, which covers the kinds of items that the ordinary family spends heavily on, has been outstripping the rising incomes of many ordinary families. They will benefit from this Budget.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o343"><a name="70327-0016.htm_para30"><a name="07032786000089">It is inescapable, however, that low earners have suffered most. Couples and single people with no children in the lowest earnings bracket will be most out of pocket. Attempts have been made to compensate some people with children through tax credits. However, the take-up of child tax credit still cannot be got above 80 per cent. The system is fiendishly complicated, and I have always criticised it for that. I never predicted that the Revenue would get 50 per cent. of cases wrong each year, and I never expected to meet so many people suffering hardship and coming to my surgery, and those of other hon. Members, because they have received tax credits and then found that the Revenue is demanding from them thousands of pounds in repayments because of a mistake that it has made. I have never met a tax credits claimant who understands how the figure for their tax credits has been arrived at. It seems from the cases that I have dealt with that half the officials of the Inland Revenue do not understand how to get the calculations right.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o344"><a name="70327-0016.htm_para31"><a name="07032786000090">That is not a very good mitigation for taking away the 10p rate, despite the hon. Members for Coventry, North-West and for Blaydon trying to cheer themselves up when they reflected on the effect on lower paid earners in their constituencies. There are plenty of two-earner families where the second earner cannot claim child tax credit even if they have children. I disapproved of introducing the 10p rate. It was a gimmick when the Chancellor introduced it. He used it for political purposes, and it complicated the system. I always looked forward to its being removed, but it has been done in an extremely cack-handed way. I assumed that it would be impossible for any Chancellor to increase the tax burden on lower earners again. I assumed that we would have to wait until we could eventually afford to freeze the ceiling and raise the threshold of the rate until the ridiculous invention eventually vanished. Doing it because he needed the headlines now will reduce the income of some very poor people next year.</p>

understand why people like me are benefiting at the expense of those on low incomes, who earn at the level where the 10p rate was important to them. There is no rationale for that. For political purposes, the Chancellor has made headline-seeking announcements, which have a fairly arbitrary effect on businesses and individuals.

I hope that the next Chancellor will go back to being a little nearer the rules for Budget speeches. The old rules were quite strict and made for boring long stretches of speech, but they required all tax changes to be properly explained. I must admit that I got away from some of that a little, by leaving things that were of interest only to accountants with a handful of clients to the Red Book. However, I did not do what happens now. The Budget speech used never to be a political speech that was designed to give a totally misleading impression to the next morning&#146;s newspapers. No Chancellor in the past attempted to gabble out figures at the rate that this Chancellor does, in a not unintended attempt to ensure that nobody can follow the Budget&#146;s precise impact on the public finances. The Chancellor switches from cash figures to percentage figures. The dates all come out in a tumble. It requires a miracle for anyone in the House to follow the details of the speech because he wants us to hear the headlines of 2p off corporation tax and 2p off income tax. He is determined that no one in the House or the Press Gallery will understand any of the downside by the time he sits down.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o347"><a name="70327-0017.htm_para2"><a name="07032786000093">That is unhelpful and I fear for the Chancellor&#146;s reputation when he becomes Prime Minister. His good friend the hon. Member for Coventry, North-West did his best to protect him as an individual, and I have always acknowledged that I do not dislike the Chancellor as a man, but his political style puts him in serious jeopardy as he embarks on his next job. He is not charismatic and never will be&#151;I do not criticise him for that. He has the reputation with the public of being a political heavyweight. He scores well on trust and has been around for so long that he is almost part of the British constitution. He is a formidable figure in a Government of whom one cannot say that the entire Cabinet is composed of formidable political figures. However, the Chancellor&#146;s reputation has been sinking recently and the public&#146;s reaction to the Budget speech will be damaging to him. It was not the right farewell to his period as Chancellor to go in for a Budget that was a blatant attempt to mislead the public about what he was doing. Only the most loyal sections of the Murdoch press were inclined to buy it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o348"><a name="70327-0017.htm_para3"><a name="07032786000094">I was looking forward to a period of more straightforward presentation of public policy&#151;a little less spin, to use the clich&#233;&#151;and less of the extraordinary manner whereby information comes out of the Government, but the Chancellor, under the pressure of events, the pressure from my right hon. Friend the Member for Witney, and impending responsibilities, is showing signs of taking up new bad ways of disseminating information. It will not work. If he continues in that way, I am afraid that I wish him a premiership that is much shorter than his tenure at the Treasury.</p>

 I was interested to hear what the right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke) had to say. It sounded to me that he wished he was in a position to deliver what the Chancellor is delivering. There is nothing wrong with admiring the Chancellor. In fact, the hon. and learned Gentleman has had his admirers. When he said that he thought the Chancellor was average, could he have been describing himself? He mentioned the Prison Service, for example, and prisons are pretty full, but I remember when Lord Ferris was in Stoke Aldermoor in Coventry&#151;his attitude was &#147;bang them up&#148;. That was the attitude of the ex-Chancellor&#146;s Government and the general attitude to law and order. </p>

Well, he alleged that this side of the House is obsessed with them, but his new leader is also obsessed by opinion polls and image. Reductions in tax were mentioned, so let me remind the right hon. and learned Gentleman about debates on 17 per cent. VAT on fuel. We had many a debate in the Chamber on a Friday morning about the &#163;10 winter allowance, which the previous Government did not do much to putup. We should also remember the Conservative Government&#146;s record on the pensions link&#151;they actually broke the link. To hear Conservative Members on their high horses tonight, nodding their heads when people talk about restoring the link, is, quite frankly, nothing short of hypocrisy when they were the party that took it away.</p>

 Will the hon. Gentleman travel back in time to 1980 when the link was broken? At that time, this country was economically on the floor after years of failed socialism, so the Government were forced into making that cut.

Member for Beverley and Holderness (Mr. Stuart), who brought up the issue of the 1980s&#151;about the mis-selling of pensions. I recall companies such as Rolls-Royce spending a lot of money trying to encourage people to leave SERPS and go into private pension schemes.</p>

It is one of the most fundamental things that the Government have done, whereas the previous Government presided over a pensions disaster. So when we look at what this Government have done for pensions, the pension protection scheme is well worth taking note of, when 120,000 people will be able to benefit from it to the tune of 80 to 90 per cent. of their pensions. Certain companies such as Rover could have been excluded, but they are now going to be included. When people want to talk about who did what in the 80s and 90s and probably into the new century, they should be careful about what they say.</p>

I also welcome the fact that there are more nurses and doctors now&#151;although we have had difficulties in the health service, the situation is not as diabolical as the right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe tried to make out, because we can overcome the present problems. One of the problems in the health service is the change in the way in which finances are administered. We are going from an old culture to a new culture, which is payment by results. That will take time to feed through because we are changing from an old culture, which involved running deficits, to a new culture, where people get paid for what they buy. That is a fundamental difference and it will take time to come through. I welcome the fact that we have more schoolteachers than we have ever had, that they are better paid than they ever were and that we have more new schools. We could go on all night about what the Government have or have not done, and other hon. Members have outlined the Government&#146;s achievements.</p>

I was interested to note a few comments made in William Gladstone&#146;s first Budget speech on18 April 1853&#151;comments which are strangely relevant to the present day and to what the Chancellor should be trying to achieve:</p>
<a name="70327-0017.htm_brev0"><a name="07032786000250"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;These are the proposals of the government. They may be approved, or they may be condemned, but I have at least this full and undoubting confidence, that it will on all hands be admitted, that we have not sought to evade the difficulties of our position&#151;that we have not concealed those difficulties either from ourselves or from others; that we have not attempted to counteract them by narrow or flimsy expedients...While we have sought to do justice to the great labouring community of England by further extending their relief from indirect taxation&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o358"><a name="70327-0017.htm_para13"><a name="07032786000110">Those are useful lessons from some time ago for the present Chancellor. I wonder whether the House is absolutely convinced that the present Chancellor has not used the &#147;flimsy expedience&#148; to which I have just referred and that he has managed to make an effective cut in indirect or, indeed, direct taxation on what William Gladstone called &#147;the labouring classes&#148;, namely all of us now&#151;perhaps not all of us, but most of us.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o359"><a name="70327-0017.htm_para14"><a name="07032786000111">The Public Accounts Committee was founded four years after that speech, so we are celebrating our150th anniversary this year. Even in those days, and I hope even more so now, people appreciated the importance of parliamentary audit of the public finances as a key component in driving out waste and ensuring economy and efficiency. Over the years, I have attempted to convince others of my personal mantra. Sometimes it has been a lonely battle, but I remain convinced of its truth: in a growing economy with modest and costed efficiency gains, which are achieved through proper parliamentary audit, it is possible to deliver better public services and sustained and real tax cuts. That is my personal mantra. In a few minutes, I shall show how we might deliver that.</p>

He spoke of &#163;100 million a year of our taxpayers&#146; money going to Nigeria. Despite Nigeria&#146;s being the sixth largest oil producer in the world, and despite the generous provision for help that, once again, we will make to it today, the poor in Nigeria are getting poorer. They are getting poorer even in the Nigerian delta&#151;despite and often because of overseas aid&#151;as a result of massive corruption, which is leading increasing numbers of people in this country to doubt the value of overseas aid. Rather than simply colluding with and congratulating the Chancellor on spending more on overseas aid, the Conservative party and others should put more pressure on him to ensure good civil governance and that the money is properly spent.</p>

The Committee is surprised that further efficiency gains were claimed in the Budget so soon after the National Audit Office report mentioned by the hon. Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable). That impartial report by Parliament&#146;s auditors questioned the credibility of the figure previously claimed&#151;the relatively modest figure of &#163;13.3 billion. Therefore, if the Gershon claims are not in the bag, how credible is the Government&#146;s claim that they will have saved an additional &#163;26 billion by 2011? How ambitious is even that claim given that, as we are repeatedly told, the public sector as a whole spends well over &#163;550 billion?</p>

 Yes, that is a problem; it relates to an issue to do with cashable and non-cashable gains. We could have an entire debate on that. We need to have a serious debate on the impact of some of the Gershon reforms on public sector efficiency. If I may give a brief advertisement, let me say that there will be a Public Accounts Committee debate in a couple of weeks&#146; time at which we can talk further about this important point, and I am grateful to my hon. Friend for raising it in her intervention.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o365"><a name="70327-0017.htm_para20"><a name="07032786000119">I was talking about the savings of &#163;26 billion. That is an exciting promise&#151;or promissory note given to us by the Government. It could reduce the basic rate of income tax by up to 8p in the pound&#151;a real reduction of 8p in the pound. Of course, the actual amount of that reduction would depend on the state of the economy at the time, but I offer that figure as a headline figure to show what could be achieved by efficiency gains&#151;promised by this Government and audited by the Treasury. If we did not want to reduce income tax by 8p in the pound, we could build860 schools or 130 hospitals, or use the money to reduce borrowing considerably. So that is an exciting claim.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o366"><a name="70327-0017.htm_para21"><a name="07032786000120">Efficiency gains are an essential aspect of the debate. They are becoming increasingly important, and they are doubly important because we need to restore public trust in respect of what is happening to all the extra money that we have put into the public services. A recent King&#146;s Fund study&#151;a reputable study&#151;showed that of the &#163;19 billion that we the taxpayers have put into health, &#163;6.6 billion went on pay, &#163;2.2 billion went on the rising costs of drugs, &#163;1.6 billion went on hiring more doctors to comply with new European Union employment laws, &#163;1.1 billion went on new buildings, &#163;1 billion went on medical equipment and &#163;600 million went on negligence law suits.

We should be aware of that&#151;I say that especially to my party. The public are becoming increasingly dubious about the claims of politicians that such large amounts of their own money are making a real difference. Indeed, we know that productivity in the NHS is declining.</p>

It was a dissection of the Budget which I shall not even attempt to emulate because there is no need to, as that has been done so well by him, and also by my hon.

changing things. One of them is the Chancellor&#146;s apparent conversion to simplification by merging the tax and NHS bands, for which I praise him. I accept that complications are also introduced in respect of tax credits, but simplification is the aim; that is the headline that the Chancellor wants the public to remember. The other key aspect of the Budget is the Chancellor&#146;s apparent conversion to cutting the base rate&#151;and therefore to tax cuts.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o370"><a name="70327-0018.htm_para1"><a name="07032786000124">That offers a challenge to Conservative Members. It will become increasingly difficult for the Government and the Chancellor now, in the next couple of years and up to the general election, to argue, as he has so successfully argued in the past, that tax cuts promised by an incoming Government will inevitably lead to worse public services. Such claims have been made to devastating effect in the past against my party. As a result of the Budget, they will be increasingly difficult to sustain.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o371"><a name="70327-0018.htm_para2"><a name="07032786000125">Efficiency gains and growth can ensure better public services. We should be aware of that at all times. After all, as my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Rushcliffe made clear in his speech, the Chancellor wants to increase spending by only 2 per cent. in real terms&#151;by less than the inflation rate. Before I sit down, I want to make what might be considered a fairly radical suggestion&#151;that we should limit increases in total public spending, once there is a new Conservative Government, to the rate of inflation. Even last year, that would have been considered a way out, radical, right-wing suggestion, but it is one that the Chancellor himself has taken up. As well as limiting himself to only a 2 per cent. spending increase, he is promising at least 2 per cent. in efficiency gains.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o372"><a name="70327-0018.htm_para3"><a name="07032786000126">So there is a challenge for us. There is a real possibility that the new Chancellor of the Exchequer, whoever it may be&#151;whether it will be somebody sitting in the Chamber at the moment or someone else, we do not know; we can only speculate&#151;will be able to deliver very substantial tax cuts before the next general election. It is therefore important that my party be aware of that, prepare the ground and not wait for the general election to make its own promises, when, as happened in the past, they can be immediately rubbished. We should have the moral and intellectual courage to make the case for the state&#146;s taking a lower share of people&#146;s valuable earnings.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o373"><a name="70327-0018.htm_para4"><a name="07032786000127">As I said, public opinion is changing, and it is doing so because people are being taxed so much more. Because of the failure since 1997 to raise income tax thresholds in line with earnings, in excess of an additional 3 million people are paying income tax, and an additional 1 million are paying it at the higher rate. Whatever they might say to public opinion pollsters who stop them in the streets, and whatever focus groups might say about the apparent reluctance to trust politicians who offer tax cuts, those people are out there in very considerable numbers and paying more tax.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o374"><a name="70327-0018.htm_para5"><a name="07032786000128">The rise in taxes in both relative and absolute terms, and the well documented increase in the system&#146;s complexity, has had a damaging impact on families, incomes, jobs and businesses.

Do not listen to me, even for a second; instead, look at what is happening in other parts of the world. Since 1996, the Conservative Government of John Howard has carried out a major reform of Australia&#146;s tax system. Its four income tax rates have been reduced from 20, 34, 43 and 47 per cent. to 15, 30, 40 and 45 per cent. respectively. Income tax thresholds have been increased considerably; indeed, the top rate threshold has trebled: it now starts at 150,000 Australian dollars, which is more than &#163;60,000. So the results have been dramatic and show that in one country, at least, it is possible over time to combine falling interest rates, falling unemployment and falling tax rates with increased tax revenue, increased growth, increased Government spending, budget surpluses and the elimination of Government debt. If it is possible in that country, is it so unbelievable that it is possible in others?</p>

 It is impossible for me, sitting where I do, to give an absolute figure on what should be the starting point for paying top tax rates. Nobody can expect us Opposition Members to do that. I am saying that we should at least have an open mind on this issue, look at what is happening in other countries and realise that it is possible to make considerable progress on these fronts. If Members do not want to consider the example of Australia, which is a long way away, they should consider Ireland.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o376"><a name="70327-0018.htm_para7"><a name="07032786000132">In 1987, Ireland&#146;s economic position was precarious. It had stagnant growth, high unemployment, spiralling deficits and the International Monetary Fund threatening to intervene in the Irish economy. That sounds familiar: it happened a long time ago in our country before the reforms under Lady Thatcher and John Major. Ireland&#146;s 1987 budget began a process of major economic reform, cutting spending drastically to bring the deficit under control. The next budget reduced current spending by 3 per cent. and capital spending by 16 per cent. Those spending reductions were accompanied and followed by major and continuing tax cuts. Among others, the standard rate of corporation tax was steadily reduced from 50 per cent. in 1987 to 12.5 per cent. in 2003&#151;the lowest rate in the EU. Personal tax rates were steadily reduced from 35 per cent., 48 per cent. and 58 per cent. in 1987 to 20 per cent. and 42 per cent. in 2001.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o377"><a name="70327-0018.htm_para8"><a name="07032786000133">One might think that that was dramatic, and if anyone suggested such cuts here they would be dismissed as out of touch with reality or as coming from a right-wing think-tank, or criticised by Matthew D&#146;Ancona in <i> The Sunday Telegraph</i>. However, between 1987 and 2003, overall tax receipts in Ireland increased fourfold and corporation tax receipts increased 16-fold.  <br>

That has allowed public expenditure to grow by 220 per cent., compared with a rise in the UK of 120 per cent. in the same period. I know that other factors were involved and we cannot entirely replicate what the Irish managed to achieve. Ireland, for example, has benefited unduly from receipts from the EU, but the fact is that the simple case is very interesting, and we should be aware of it.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman paints an interesting picture of alternative tax scenarios drawn from countries across the globe and across the Irish sea. He is known and recognised as one of the free, radical and independent thinkers of the Conservative party and it seems only a few months since that group was flirting with and promoting the virtues of a flat-rate tax. What is the present thinking on that in his party?</p>

 I am famously not in the loop, so I do not know. I was very heartened by what the shadow Chancellor said in his early days about the benefits of moving to a much simpler and flatter tax system. I agree with the shadow Chancellor that in a complex economy such as ours it is not feasible to do suddenly what the east Europeans did and move overnight to a flat rate of tax. It is a caricature of our position to suggest that that is what we advocated. The Chancellor presumably believes in a simpler tax system himself. Why otherwise would he have sought simplification in this Budget?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o378"><a name="70327-0018.htm_para9"><a name="07032786000136">Why is it beyond the bounds of credibility to suggest that a Conservative Government, over the lifetime of a Parliament, could move to a much flatter, simpler tax system, as suggested by Lord Forsyth, in an excellent, well documented paper? It showed, incidentally, that &#163;21 billion of tax cuts were entirely deliverable. Of course, there was an attempt to rubbish that paper, with the same old arguments. Ministers trotted out the tired arguments that Lord Forsyth&#146;s tax cuts would scythe a horrible hole through our public services, when in fact &#163;21 billion is within the margin of error.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o379"><a name="70327-0018.htm_para10"><a name="07032786000137">The point that my friend, Michael Forsyth, made to me on the phone when I was discussing flat taxes with him today&#151;and I put it to my right hon. Friends on the Front Bench&#151;is that unless one reduces the overall burden of taxation, it is difficult, indeed impossible, to achieve flatter and simpler taxes without creating a considerable number of losers. Therefore, we have to have the courage as a political party to start arguing the case for a lower overall burden of taxation, because that is the only way in which we can make progress towards a much flatter rate of tax.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o380"><a name="70327-0018.htm_para11"><a name="07032786000138">I think that there is now an overwhelming case for change, and that the intellectual consensus is starting to change as a result of this Budget.

<p><a name="stpa_o381"><a name="70327-0018.htm_para12"><a name="07032786000139">That is where the moral case for lower taxes comes in. Too many caricature the argument as one that is posed by people who have no interest in compassion and who want simpler and lower taxes only to help the rich. The truth is that higher taxes affect the poorest and most vulnerable members of society to the greatest extent, and that is unfair and immoral.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o392"><a name="70327-0018.htm_para23"><a name="07032786000150">That higher personal allowance would apply to all taxpayers, including pensioners, and it would benefit senior citizens as well as people of working age. Currently, people of working age can earn just over &#163;5,000 a year before they pay tax, and for pensioners the figure is just over &#163;7,5000. However, if those people were able to earn &#163;15,000 before paying tax, that would constitute a major improvement in the quality of life for all taxpayers. It is difficult for non-experts&#151;for MPs even&#151;to cope with long Budget statements, but if the personal allowance was raised to &#163;15,000, more than 13.5 million people would no longer have to pay any income tax at all. That is more than the number of people who voted for Labour in the 2005 or 2001 general elections. <i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> I agree&#151;I am not the Chancellor, I do not have all the books, and I am not suggesting that we should do all of that now. I am just saying that hon. Members can use the Treasury model and work it out for themselves&#151;it is do-able. If the personal allowance was raised, it would automatically raise the threshold at which people start to pay top-rate income tax. People start to pay the 40 per cent. rate when they earn just under &#163;40,000, but raising the personal allowance to &#163;15,000 in today&#146;s prices and abolishing the starting rate of income tax would mean that people could earn more than &#163;47,000 in today&#146;s prices.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o393"><a name="70327-0018.htm_para24"><a name="07032786000151">That is just one example, but it is realistically achievable over a Government&#146;s lifetime if we take into account economic growth and efficiency gains. However, important choices have to be made, and that is where the pain&#151;the slight pain&#151;comes into my Budget statement. In recent years, the government sector has enjoyed record spending increases, which were mentioned by my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Rushcliffe. Since 2000, the share of the economy taken up by the state has increased by7.8 percentage points of GDP, which is faster than for any other country in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. The Government are literally awash with money&#151;and borrowed money, to be paid for by taxpayers now and in future.</p>

First, raising the higher personal allowance for pensioners is extremely important. Pensioners have come to my surgery&#151;and I am sure that this is the case for many hon. Members&#151;as they are concerned about their level of taxation. The measure to take 600,000 pensioners out of taxation is a very good one, as are the measures to increase child tax credit, to increase the threshold for working tax credit and to reduce corporation tax as well as the basic rate of tax. It is important, too, that vehicle excise duty has been increased, although personally I think that the Chancellor could have gone much higher in taxing gas-guzzlers, which have a negative impact on the environment. I am not sure that the current level of excise duty will deter sufficient people from driving them. Lastly, the rise in investment in education to2.5 per cent. in real terms is an important measure to which I shall return.</p>

I should tell the right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke) that my experience of education under the Conservatives&#151;I was a vice-chair of education in a large unitary authority and a governor at a school&#151;was one of decreasing budgets, having to close schools and continually having to make cuts. It is only in the past five or six years as a governor that I have seen real investment in our schools. The Government are continuing to invest at record levels. The figures have increased from &#163;2,500 per pupil in 1997-98 to &#163;6,600 in 2010-11.</p>

That will require us to build on the decent homes standard. How will councils be able to deliver more rented housing when there is a demonstrable need to do so?</p>

 That is the case. Tenants in my city voted against a transfer some years ago. However, those tenants desperately need money to be invested in their properties. A lot more affordable housing needs to be delivered in Durham city. The absence of such housing is partly due to the fact that the Lib Dem council has built and delivered little in the past few years.

as mine, which is a largely rural community, investment in bus services has reduced. Alternatively, investment increasingly goes towards subsidising services that do not meet the needs of the local population. We also need more investment in trains, especially local trains that can transport people throughout the region more efficiently than those on the main line.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o417"><a name="70327-0019.htm_para17"><a name="07032786000187">I want to pay particular attention to Barker. We are told that there will be a White Paper later in the spring on improving responsiveness and efficiency in land use planning. That makes me very nervous. I realise that it is sensible to take a more strategic approach on economic development and the need for planning. Positive planning for economic development needs to happen and an improvement in the processes of economic development is required. However, planning, by its nature, is a very blunt instrument. Different places have different economic development needs. I hope that the White Paper will acknowledge the difference between areas. My constituency is a historical town, and while it needs economic development, it needs a particular sort of such development to protect and enhance its heritage. Having read Barker, I am not convinced that that will happen. Many people in my constituency are fed up with the increasing number of blocks of luxury flats, which do not meet housing need and impact negatively on the heritage of the city. That movement has to be stopped. Planning policy statement 3 is a step forward, but the regional spatial strategy needs to address that issue in the north-east. We need additional housing if there is to be growth in the north-east, but the area needs to be developed sensitively.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o418"><a name="70327-0019.htm_para18"><a name="07032786000188">My last point but one is about the planning gain supplement, which is another subject that makes me nervous. I agree that we should have a betterment tax; in fact, I have long argued for one, but I am worried about local authorities being given incentives to approve planning applications. A percentage of the money will come back to them, but that is a dangerous thing to do, because it could allow local authorities to sell every bit of green space and brownfield land that they have for development, as they will get a percentage of the money.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o419"><a name="70327-0019.htm_para19"><a name="07032786000189">Of course it is important that money should be spent on infrastructure, but I was concerned about paragraph 3.150 of the Red Book, which says that all local authorities and partners will have to work together locally to improve the infrastructure. That does not happen often at local authority level, particularly where there are different tiers of government. It is bad enough if the tiers of local government are of the same political party, but if they are of different political parties, it is just not likely that they will work together to increase infrastructure. I would appreciate it if the Government took that proposal away and looked again at how money from planning gain can be allocated sensibly throughout the country to support development.</p>

I am proud that the Government have set ambitious targets to reduce it; it is better to have very ambitious targets and not meet them than not to have any targets.

We worked hard for many long hours&#151;burned the midnight oil&#151;and spent sleepless hours worrying about cash flow, which is one of the greatest problems for small business.

The prime objective for a business man is to look at the bottom line and make sure every month that he is successful with the volume that he creates. The second lesson that I learned is that it is not about sales. Indeed, sales can easily be given away. Unless he is very careful, a business man can easily price his product or service at a level that does not create what he really needs in a small business&#151;a steady, credible, managed cash flow.

That is another aspect of the creation of small businesses that should be taken into account. However, even with a deliberate policy of controlled growth, we faced serious problems on many occasions: problems caused by customers going bust, by debtors not paying up&#151;not just not in time, but sometimes not at all&#151;and by clients pulling work unexpectedly.

That is the reality of growing a small business. We faced risk, we faced hardship, we faced long hours, we faced sleepless nights; but we grew to a point at which we employed more than 220 people collectively. The Chancellor should be delighted with the work that we have done to service his income. We should be given a medal, but what do we get from him?

He should have recognised that small businesses employ more than 12 million people&#151;that is 58 per cent. of the private sector employment figure. He should have recognised that adding that figure to the UK&#146;s medium-sized businesses shows that together they will create more than 2 million jobs in a 10-year cycle. When he looks at UK plc, he will recognise that they will, conversely, shed 1.5 million jobs in the same period.

Look at the cost of business support, in which small business plays a part&#151;a staggering &#163;12 billion per year according to the Richard review on small business and Government. Look at the National Audit Office report of 2006, which was scathing about Government support services, comprising 3,000 schemes that the Government now say that they are going to cut down to 100.

I declare an interest as an accountant to small business in a long period leading up to 1997. What the hon. Gentleman has said is a masterclass in how to take the seed of an idea from a micro-business through to a small and then a medium-sized enterprise. Does he accept, however, that a basic element missing from his remarks is that organisations should not choose a business format for fiscal reasons? Is it not the case that artificial incorporation of small businesses has been a costly mistake, and that it was right for the Chancellor to tackle that abuse?</p>

 As the hon. Lady well knows, the Conservative Government signed Kyoto&#151;<i> [Interruption.] </i>The noble Baroness Thatcher made the original commitment before it was later signed. She was the first of this country&#146;s major leaders to put the focus on climate change. As we can see from the figures revealing the attention that the Chancellor has paid to the issue over many years, the Conservative leadership, particularly that of my right hon.

It has happened because of the arrival of my right hon. Friend the Member for Witney as the new Leader of the Opposition. Last week&#146;s Budget was designed not only to give a false impression of tax cuts, which has been demonstrably torn apart by Conservative Members, but to give the impression that the Chancellor will simplify the tax system&#151;that he is a straightforward Chancellor who can be trusted, and who can tackle the allegations made against him. As we know from a leaked Treasury staffing report, staff who work for the Chancellor recognise his character as being anything but that. More than half of those who left the Treasury cited dissatisfaction with the job as the reason for doing so and almost a third mentioned low morale or cited boredom. The truth is that the Chancellor&#146;s character is one of the central issues of the political debate as we move towards having a new leader of the Labour party. Even more than the details of the Budget, it is the Chancellor&#146;s character that has been brought into the greatest relief since the announcement of the Budget last week.</p>

There was an opportunity to introduce a new tax category for people who have to use those vehicles for work, which would have made a tremendous difference to those in rural areas who are currently struggling to survive economically, but it was not taken.

Some waste cannot be dealt with otherwise, and it should attract a lower level of landfill tax. There was also an opportunity to deal with incinerators, which are springing up all over the country&#151;that development is driven by the Government. There should be an incineration tax to maximise the use of greener ways of dealing with waste.

We have heard this evening about the public debt and the Chancellor&#146;s stewardship of public borrowing. My right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke) eloquently highlighted the problem with the Chancellor&#146;s forecasting skills.

The political tone of the Chancellor&#146;s endeavours suggests to me that he wants to make sure that it will be his hand on the tiller, and not the current Prime Minister&#146;s, when the CSR is eventually published. That means that he will be seeking to tie the hands of the Chancellor who succeeds him.</p>

A huge cheer went up, and people might be forgiven for thinking that the entire amount would be put to use. However, on making a closer inspection&#151;and as the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions clarified for members of the parliamentary Labour party&#151;we see that the money is to be spread over 60 years. If we apply conventional net present value calculations to &#163;8 billion over 60 years, the total is reduced to &#163;1.9 billion&#151;not quite such an attractive figure to announce. That is another example of smoke and mirrors. The financial assistance scheme has cost almost &#163;9 million to administer, and as of the last month it had paid out the princely sum of &#163;3.2 million to a mere 1,000 of the 125,000 pensioners who have lost their pensions and for whom it was designed in the first place.</p>

Financial services companies will benefit the most, but capital-intensive non-financial businesses will not achieve the benefits that the Chancellor seeks to introduce. That is curious. Manufacturing industry is under intense pressure as a result of threats from low-cost countries to which manufacturing has migrated in recent years, and profitability in manufacturing is at its lowest level since 1992. The Bank of England recently produced research that described the loss of industrial capacity in this country as the most dramatic of any G7 country.

 I am grateful to my hon. Friend, who is a tremendous champion of manufacturing, particularly in his constituency, where he regularly raises those issues. Undoubtedly, manufacturing jobs are something that we should encourage. By penalising investment in capital-intensive goods we will make manufacturers less able to continue to invest and to take on the challenge of the low-wage economies with which they are constantly, and increasingly, competing. The measure is therefore of little help to them. The other losers in the so-called Budget for business are small businesses, which must  <br>

 I am grateful for that reminder.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o495"><a name="70327-0022.htm_para3"><a name="0703289000064">That is damaging, because small businesses are the source of much innovation, employment and growth in the economy. There are 4.3 million small businesses in the UK, and 97 per cent. of firms employ fewer than20 people. More than half a million people start up a new business every year, and 12 million people work in small firms. One of my hon. Friends mentioned that the number of people who voted for the Labour party in the last two elections is similar to the number of people employed by small firms. Despite what the Chancellor said in the Budget, and despite the attitude of the Treasury and the Revenue, in many respects the Budget undermines some of the most creative and entrepreneurial sectors of the economy. I shall give a couple of examples to show what was happening in the weeks before the Budget.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o496"><a name="70327-0022.htm_para4"><a name="0703289000065">The Budget included specific measures on venture capital trusts, which are a form of tax-efficient investing that have been successful in raising equity and closing the equity gap for emerging businesses when it is difficult for them to secure capital from other investors, or purely from bank debt. Last year,&#163;750 million was raised for VCTs and more than&#163;500 million was raised in 2004-05. Each year, the Government have tinkered with the VCT regime and I welcome some of the minor measures introduced this year&#151;some in response to points raised by me and other Conservative Members in the Finance Bill Committee, but rejected by the Government. However, they have now recognised that we were talking sense and introduced some of those proposals. I congratulate the Government on listening to the industry&#151;as will the industry.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o497"><a name="70327-0022.htm_para5"><a name="0703289000066">Those provisions were completely overwhelmed, however, by the astonishing inclusion of two measures that limit investment in individual companies by VCTs to a mere &#163;2 million, which will create a substantial equity gap between &#163;2 million and &#163;5 million to&#163;10 million, at which level there are more sources available through the City. Even more damaging has been the limit on the number of employees in companies into which VCTs can invest: a mere 50 employees. I believe that is also the case for enterprise investment schemes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o498"><a name="70327-0022.htm_para6"><a name="0703289000067">The Government&#146;s excuse for that astonishing restriction on the flexibility of those investment vehicles is that it is all down to our friends in Brussels. The European Union, my hon. Friends may not be surprised to hear, has reinterpreted the rules for state aid and decided that any funds raised for the benefit of tax incentives now qualify as state aid, so European definitions of small and medium-sized enterprises need to apply. That move needs to be vigorously resisted by the Government, yet in the Budget they seem to have  <br>

rolled over with no serious attempt to fight it off. I look forward to hearing their views&#151;perhaps in the wind-ups&#151;of how the position can be restored.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o499"><a name="70327-0022.htm_para7"><a name="0703289000068">One impact of the clamp-down on VCT flexibility has been significant in an industry close to the Chancellor&#146;s heart&#151;the film industry. The head of Ealing Studios, Mr. Barnaby Thompson, who was, as it happens, at university with me, said:</p>
<a name="70327-0022.htm_brev0"><a name="0703289000136"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;It&#146;s a massive kick in the nuts.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o500"><a name="70327-0022.htm_para8"><a name="0703289000069">I think that must be a film expression. A St. Trinian&#146;s remake, starring leading British actors, is in production at Ealing Studios and after the Budget announcements, two weeks before filming was due to begin, the producer lost &#163;2 million of pledged funding through the VCT route, which amounted to 30 per cent. of his budget. That is an example of the practical impact of the measures.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o501"><a name="70327-0022.htm_para9"><a name="0703289000070">Two days after the Budget, I received a letter from one of the leading commentators on VCT funding, Mr. Peter Hargreaves of Hargreaves Landsdown, who said:</p>
<a name="70327-0022.htm_brev1"><a name="0703289000137"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;In our opinion this means that after 6 April it will be much harder for VCT managers to find companies worth investing in, and in all probability this will radically reduce the VCT capacity for investors.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o502"><a name="70327-0022.htm_para10"><a name="0703289000071">His colleague, Mr. Ben Yearsley, was rather more direct. He said that the Chancellor</p>
<a name="70327-0022.htm_brev2"><a name="0703289000138"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;has effectively killed off the sector in two years. In 2006, he wounded them&#148;&#151;</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o504"><a name="70327-0022.htm_para12"><a name="0703289000073">That is what the industry believes will happen as a result of the measures that the Chancellor has introduced in what was supposed to be an innovative Budget for entrepreneurial small businesses.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o505"><a name="70327-0022.htm_para13"><a name="0703289000074">The second specific issue arose shortly before the Budget. I have been trying to work out why, on 2 March, Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs chose to publish some detailed notes under the guise of reducing abusive avoidance schemes. The notice has effectively brought to a halt the ability of investors to deduct losses generated through a partnership in one activity against their other income&#151;it is known as sideways loss relief. My understanding is that the Revenue had identified various categories of activity where there may have been some genuine abuse. I am not seeking to criticise attempts to clamp down on genuine abuse or tax avoidance. Such attempts are appropriate. However, this announcement was slipped out on a Friday evening with no prior warning. Having scoured the Red Book, I now think that I understand why.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o506"><a name="70327-0022.htm_para14"><a name="0703289000075">The measure is estimated to raise &#163;400 million for the Treasury, and &#163;400 million is close to the amount of money that the Chancellor claims that the Budget will produce in the first year by way of a tax cut. If he had not already announced the measure, he would not have been able to say that this was a tax-cutting Budget. He introduced a tax-raising measure three weeks before. Is that smoke or a mirror? I think that it is smoke. A large cloud of smoke has been blown all over the Budget by that measure.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o507"><a name="70327-0022.htm_para15"><a name="0703289000076">What does this mean? It means that the Chancellor has introduced a measure that will stifle innovation and lead to a significant reduction in investment across a whole range of industries. The original intention, I believe, was to address abuses in the forestry and shipping sectors and latterly possibly also the property sector. Where it is actually going to bite is in the creative industries&#151;the sectors so close to the Chancellor&#146;s heart. Film, theatre, electronic games publishing and biotech investments&#151;high-risk genuine venture investments&#151;will find it difficult. The combination of the VCT and enterprise investment scheme rules that I have just referred to and the elimination of sideways loss relief means that investors who have other activities and are prepared to invest, typically in limited liability partnerships, in order to fund those high-risk ventures will no longer be able to relieve the loss.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o508"><a name="70327-0022.htm_para16"><a name="0703289000077">The Chancellor might say that we have a generous regime for film finance in this country as a result of the measures that he took in the last Budget. I do not deny that the 20 per cent. production credit available to film producers is a useful assistance. However, if the other 80 per cent. is no longer going to be offsetable against other income, that is going to amount to a row of beans, because there will be no funding available for ventures such as film productions if investors are no longer going to be able to offset losses incurred from those very high risk, typically binary, investments. Those investments either work or they fail, and if they fail one loses all one&#146;s money. If people cannot offset that loss against their other income, in effect productions will not get the 80 per cent. funding to which the 20 per cent. credit would apply.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o509"><a name="70327-0022.htm_para17"><a name="0703289000078">The instrument needs to be carefully considered by Ministers and their advisers in the Treasury. I hope that when the Finance Bill works its way through the Committee stage, Ministers will pay more attention to the matter than they are at the moment. [Hon. Members: &#147;Hear, hear.&#148;] I am grateful to my hon. Friends for drawing attention to the fact that I am still speaking. It woke up the Members on the Labour Benches.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o510"><a name="70327-0022.htm_para18"><a name="0703289000079">I want to conclude with a few remarks about the Chancellor&#146;s environmental measures. In 1997, the Treasury issued a &#147;Statement of Intent on Environmental Taxation&#148; setting out the Government&#146;s aim:</p>
<a name="70327-0022.htm_brev4"><a name="0703289000140"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;to reform the tax system to increase incentives to reduce environmental damage&#148;&#151;</p>
</ul>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o512"><a name="70327-0022.htm_para20"><a name="0703289000081">I think that we have heard that elsewhere recently. They wanted to</p>
<a name="70327-0022.htm_brev6"><a name="0703289000142"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;encourage innovation in meeting higher environmental standards; and deliver a more dynamic economy and a cleaner environment, to the benefit of everyone.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o513"><a name="70327-0022.htm_para21"><a name="0703289000082">For 10 years, the Chancellor failed to provide a green Budget. In the eight years before Labour came to power, green taxes rose as a percentage of overall taxes from 7.8 per cent. to 9.4 per cent. However, by 2005, which is the latest year for which information is available, the Chancellor had allowed that percentage to fall to 7.7 per cent., which was its lowest level since 1987, when the information was first recorded.

<a name="70327-0022.htm_brev7"><a name="0703289000143"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;probably one out of ten. He&#146;s got a terrible record&#148;&#151;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o515"><a name="70327-0022.htm_para23"><a name="0703289000084">I will cite two specific measures in the Budget that were an attempt to demonstrate the Chancellor&#146;s green credentials. Under the changes to the rates of vehicle excise duty, the most polluting car will pay &#163;400. The hon. Member for Falmouth and Camborne (Julia Goldsworthy) referred to a measure that she and her party tried to introduce during consideration of last year&#146;s Finance Bill, which would have made VED increases appropriate for various parts of the country. I represent a rural constituency, and I am chairman of the all-party group on rural services, of which many hon. Members in the Chamber are members. We are extremely concerned that imposing a blanket tax in the way in which the Government are doing completely and utterly ignores the needs of rural communities and, especially, people in employment who also happen to be motorists. For example, many farmers drive a 4x4 so that they can do their job.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o516"><a name="70327-0022.htm_para24"><a name="0703289000085">If you will allow me, Mr. Deputy Speaker, I will give a couple of specific examples. One of my constituents, Mr. Tony Machin, sent me an e-mail in which he wrote that he owned a 4x4 that was a 15-year-old, 3.2-litre, V6 petrol engine vehicle. He said that he realised that it was not the most economical mode of transport, so18 months ago he converted it to run on liquefied petroleum gas at a cost of &#163;1,900. The emissions of the vehicle are such that it is cleaner to drive than a small car, but it has not been re-rated and consequently it will attract the new higher rate of VED. Is that the intention behind the Government&#146;s measures? If not, why did they not recognise that the instrument that they have introduced is blunt and try to think more carefully about it?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o517"><a name="70327-0022.htm_para25"><a name="0703289000086">Another of my constituents, Richard Hill of Intelligent Energy Systems, has asked whether we could</p>
<a name="70327-0022.htm_brev8"><a name="0703289000144"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;have some common sense and increase the fee for &#145;unnecessary&#146; 4x4s.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o518"><a name="70327-0022.htm_para26"><a name="0703289000087">He has a 4x4, and I am sure that the Minister will be interested to hear that his business is the installation of intelligent energy systems, such as wind turbines and solar panels. Those things are relatively heavy, so he needs a 4x4 to tow his trailer to transport the equipment around the country. He says that it is quite obvious which vehicles are genuine utility vehicles and which are not. He thinks that the measure should have created a distinction between sports utility vehicles, which, I suspect, are the vehicles that the Chancellor would wish to attract higher duty&#151;I would have no problem with that&#151;and genuine utility vehicles that are used in business. I urge Ministers to rethink the measure before it is considered in Committee.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o521"><a name="70327-0022.htm_para29"><a name="0703289000090">Finally, I would like to raise the issue of the Chancellor&#146;s stop-start scheme to promote the use of renewable energy in domestic households, a conversion scheme called the low carbon buildings programme, which many hon. Members, including me, have mentioned in recent weeks. The programme is now known in the trade as &#147;fund a fiasco&#148; after the managing director of the Renewable Energy Association described the operation of the scheme with the word &#147;fiasco&#148;. The Chancellor has recognised that the scheme was woefully inadequately funded in the first place and was poorly administered. As a result, expectations have been raised among householders across the country&#151;they thought that if they were interested in converting to a renewable energy source, there would be Government money to help them. That is a perfectly reasonable assessment to make, if one reads the Government&#146;s promotion of the scheme. However, anyone who tries to use the scheme will find that fewer than 2 per cent. of applicants are lucky enough to get a grant. If the Chancellor were to run the country in the way that he ran the scheme, heaven help us.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o522"><a name="70327-0022.htm_para30"><a name="0703289000091">To conclude, the devil is in the detail of the Budget. It raises risk, the country is running on a public finance tightrope, and the Chancellor&#146;s micro-managing risks damaging innovation, as I tried to explain. The risk for the Chancellor is that he may think that he has shot the Tory fox, when he has in fact shot himself in the foot. He has conceded the argument&#151;Government spending will grow less than the economy, and he will have to share the proceeds of growth.</p>

business and the operation of the enterprise society are the people on the Conservative Benches, and that has been demonstrated in this debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o524"><a name="70327-0023.htm_para1"><a name="0703289000094">The most intellectually stimulating contribution from a Conservative Member this evening was that of my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough (Mr. Leigh). He set out his own alternative Budget, which would involve raising the starting rate for paying tax to &#163;15,000 in income. That would take 13.5 million people out of tax. It would also raise the starting point for the 40 per cent. rate to &#163;47,000. That is an aspiration and it should be a policy for the Conservative party. I am delighted that so many members of our Treasury team are on the Front Bench, including the shadow Chancellor.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o525"><a name="70327-0023.htm_para2"><a name="0703289000095">In my remarks I shall concentrate on the issue of air passenger duty. We do ourselves a disservice in the House if we do not show that we are in tune with the concerns of the people out there. There have been full-page advertisements in our popular press over recent weeks expressing concerns about air passenger duty, particularly the increase, which is provided for in resolution 13. The increase will result in an extra&#163;1 billion for the Treasury. What I find particularly offensive is that the increase is retrospective. It goes back to 1 February and therefore breaks new ground with respect to Budget resolutions. That is one of the reasons why I described it as unconstitutional in an Adjournment debate that I was lucky enough to secure.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o526"><a name="70327-0023.htm_para3"><a name="0703289000096">Anyone travelling by air after 1 February has to pay the extra tax, regardless of when the flight was booked. That means that people who booked their flights for the coming spring holiday in, say, October or November, find that when they go to the airport they have to pay an extra sum of money because of the retrospective legislation. Most of the adverse tax consequences are being borne by individuals. I am sure they will find a way of getting their own back against the Chancellor and this ghastly Government when the next election comes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o527"><a name="70327-0023.htm_para4"><a name="0703289000097">However, there is a significant group of people who do not have that protection. They are the package tour operators. They have taken a financial hit of some&#163;44 million because regulations under the European package holiday regulations prohibit them from passing on the increase to their customers. That is outrageous. Because of the impact on the package holiday industry, when the Conservative Government introduced air passenger duty they gave about one year&#146;s notice of its introduction to deal with those involved in the package holiday business. I am delighted that the package holiday industry is taking the Chancellor to court on the matter, and I wish it well.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o528"><a name="70327-0023.htm_para5"><a name="0703289000098">Air passenger is offensive not just because it is retrospective. It is a good little earner for the Chancellor. He has presented it as a green tax, but we know that it is no such thing. As a result of the change announced on 6 December, there will be savings of about 0.3 million tonnes of carbon per year by 2010-11. Let us compare that with the latest figures that I have for how many million tonnes of CO2 are emitted by China, India and the United States&#151;2,700 million tonnes, and rising by 10 per cent. a year or  <br>

more. By comparison with that, 0.3 million tonnes by 2010 will hardly change the planet. However, it will provide another &#163;1 billion for the Chancellor&#146;s coffers, and we will do the people who are concerned about the matter a disservice if we allow the Chancellor to present air passenger duty as a green tax. It certainly is not. It is just a revenue raising measure, and an unfair one at that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o529"><a name="70327-0023.htm_para6"><a name="0703289000099">Fortunately, the demand for aviation is inelastic. That means that however much we charge in taxes on aircraft flights, people will not be deterred from using aircraft. That has become apparent from discussions that have been taking place in the House on the European emissions trading scheme and the proposals to extend that to aircraft. If aircraft carbon were charged at &#163;20 a tonne and average load factors of70 per cent. prevailed, the result would be increases in the cost of an air journey of between &#163;3 and &#163;25. The growth in aviation by 2020 would be 135 per cent. rather than 142 per cent.: in other words, air travel would be double plus one third. There would be a minimal impact on the large growth in aviation. Why? Because of the inelasticity of this particular economic activity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o530"><a name="70327-0023.htm_para7"><a name="0703289000100">The number of passenger journeys from United Kingdom airports is set to increase from 228 million in 2005 to 490 million by 2030. I think that that is jolly good news, because it shows that all those people will be able to enjoy an improved quality of life. They will be able to enrich their experience by travelling and seeing the world. That probably applies to their children as well. Other Members, like me, will have children who, over the coming Easter holidays, will fly to the continent to engage in school exchanges and become more familiar with foreign languages. Why should we think it a bad thing for those children to have the enriching experience of travelling abroad by plane? Why should we tax hard-working families in this way?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o531"><a name="70327-0023.htm_para8"><a name="0703289000101">Each year, United Kingdom aviation produces36 million tonnes of carbon dioxide. At a market price of &#163;10 per tonne, which I think is the current basic market price, aviation would have to contribute&#163;360 million a year to meet its environmental carbon costs. But air passenger duty already yields 1 billion, and the increase proposed in resolution 13 would double that to &#163;2 billion. Far from this being an effort to make the aviation industry pay its environmental costs, the industry will be charged more than five times those costs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o532"><a name="70327-0023.htm_para9"><a name="0703289000102">The tax burden of air passenger duty is disproportionate, and its impact on the environment is minuscule. Less than 1 per cent. of aviation&#146;s 36 million tonnes of carbon will be saved. I welcome the realisation in my party that this is not a green tax, and I welcome the publication of the discussion document &#147;Greener Skies: A consultation on the environmental taxation of aviation&#148;.

<p><a name="stpa_o538"><a name="70327-0023.htm_para15"><a name="0703289000110">Let me refer to the way in which the Budget has covered up the work of Sir Michael Lyons. His commission was set up in July 2004 to consider the whole issue of how we pay for local government. After almost three years, he reported in a way that many of my elderly constituents would find encouraging. He said that 1.8 million people, mainly poor pensioners, are unable to get the full benefit of the council tax rebate and that as a result there is an enormous extra burden on those poorer members of our communities. He suggests that we should bring in new measures to help those people who are paying &#163;1.8 billion a year more than they should be because of the inefficiency of the council tax rebate system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o539"><a name="70327-0023.htm_para16"><a name="0703289000111">Sir Michael came forward with the radical idea&#151;I hope that it will be taken up by my hon.

 What does my hon. Friend think that his hard-pressed and long-suffering council tax payers, particularly the elderly, would make of the proposals to remove council tax capping or to make additional charges for waste collection, or the proposed tourist tax?</p>

 They would be rather less enthusiastic about those proposals; indeed, they would think that they smacked of being additional stealth taxes. They would also note with concern that the Lyons report says that in today&#146;s terms a local income tax would result in the basic tax rate going up by 7.7p in the pound.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o541"><a name="70327-0023.htm_para18"><a name="0703289000117">My last point about Sir Michael Lyons&#146;s report is that he suggests the option of helping households that pay an unacceptably high council tax. Paragraph 174 of the executive summary proposes &#147;a circuit-breaker rebate&#148; to ensure that no householder pays more than a set proportion of income in property tax. I have long argued in favour of such a system. An enormous number of pensioners are, for want of a better expression, in council tax poverty. People are described as being in fuel poverty if they pay more than 10 per cent. of their income towards the cost of their fuel. However, many of my constituents pay much more than 10 per cent. of their net income towards the costs of council tax. They are, therefore, in council tax poverty. Limiting the percentage of income that was attributed to council tax would be a helpful mitigation. Of course, the Chancellor took up none of those suggestions in the Budget because he is more interested in filling his coffers and deceiving the people.</p>

No wonder that the quality of education in our country is declining so rapidly when the Chancellor sets such a poor example from the top. &#147;Next&#148; means next, not the year after &#147;next&#148; or the April after next. If the Chancellor becomes Prime Minister, I hope that he will pay greater heed to the English language and, in so doing, to the need to increase public confidence in the straight talking of politicians.</p>

The overall impact of the income and national insurance contributions changes means that working families will be paying &#163;340 million more tax on their income next year.</p>

Nurses, cleaners, care workers, police community support officers, shop assistants, catering workers: those are the sort of people who are losing out. The Budget involves a transfer of the burden of tax from those on middle incomes to those on low incomes. This is the Budget that Labour Back Benchers cheered, by the Chancellor who claims he wants to tackle poverty.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o556"><a name="70327-0023.htm_para33"><a name="07032822000016">The Chancellor seems to think that hitting the poorest with a higher income tax bill is not a problem, because tax credits soften the blow. What he is saying, in effect, is, &#147;I&#146;ll take away more of your money, but you can have some of it back if you wade through these 72 pages of forms and explanatory notes on tax credits.&#148; The Budget will drive more people into the benefits system and into dependency.</p>

Thousands of the most vulnerable people in our society are in desperate straits, driven into the hands of loan sharks when faced with huge overpayment bills that they cannot afford.</p>

Figures released today show the incomes of the poorest 20 per cent. falling and poverty increasing. How right the right hon.

No Budget can claim to be simplifying when it increases dependency on highly complex tax credits. There are, it is true, some modest steps in the Budget towards tax simplification. We have put the issue at the top of our agenda and it is good news that the Chancellor has been pulled along in the wake of my hon. Friend the Member for Tatton (Mr. Osborne), but these limited reforms cannot make up for the continual meddling and instability that has characterised our tax system since the Chancellor&#146;s first Budget.</p>

Last week, we called on him to do that and he has responded, but, frankly, the impact will be limited when set against&#163;50 billion in extra business taxes levied since 1997.

 I do not agree with the hon. Gentleman&#146;s figure. I refer him to Lord Turner&#146;s report and I hope that he will support the reforms to the pension system that we will take forward.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o593"><a name="70327-0025.htm_para1"><a name="07032822000080">Public expenditure next year will rise by &#163;34 billion to &#163;587 billion. Do the Tories support that figure, when they have a third fiscal rule that requires only half of growth to go to spending and, at the same time, they want to cut corporation tax further and refund North sea oil companies to the tune of &#163;2 billion? In 2008-09, public expenditure will rise by &#163;29 billion to&#163;615 billion. Do the Tories support that, given that they have said that they would have a cut in stamp duty on shares, worth &#163;4 billion to &#163;5 billion a year on top, of course, of the third fiscal rule and the further corporation tax cut?</p>

<p><a name="st_o333"><a name="07032822000081"><a name="70327-0025.htm_spnew2"><a name="07032822000685"><b>Mr. Ben Wallace (Lancaster and Wyre) (Con):</b>
 All over the world the brave men and women of the British armed forces are serving our country and doing this Government&#146;s bidding. Why is it that our privates and troopers, who bear that heavy burden, will have to pay more tax after the Budget? Is that any way to reward them?</p>

<p><a name="st_o334"><a name="07032822000082"><a name="70327-0025.htm_spnew3"><a name="07032822000686"><b>Mr. Timms:</b>
 I invite the hon. Gentleman to look at the details of the package and see, in particular, how helpful it is to improving incentives to work, and providing extra support for families with children and pensioners. I notice that the hon. Gentleman has not wanted to support the public spending totals that we published in our Budget Red Book.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o594"><a name="70327-0025.htm_para2"><a name="07032822000083">In 2010, public spending will rise by an additional &#163;29 billion to &#163;674 billion, as we continue to invest in the future. Do the Tories support that figure, given that they have to meet the third fiscal rule, and pay for corporation tax cuts, stamp duty cuts and a married couple&#146;s allowance? If they cannot make a commitment to meet our spending totals, and they have not done so in this debate, we will draw the conclusion that the country will draw&#151;that in every constituency there will be cuts in schools and hospitals.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o595"><a name="70327-0025.htm_para3"><a name="07032822000084">We will have increased education spending by&#163;14 billion by 2010. We have cut pupil-teacher ratios, we have spent more than 20 per cent. extra per pupil and we have cut the basic rate of tax to 20p. We have delivered stability, affordable tax cuts and increases in spending. This Budget secures those achievements and I commend it to the House.</p>

Cumbria. More than 8,000 signatures are from Penrith and The Border constituents, and have been collected in almost 100 post offices the length and breadth of the largest constituency in England and Wales. My colleague John Stephenson, the Conservative candidate for Carlisle, has collected 3,500 signatures from sub-post offices in the Carlisle constituency. Collectively, all those signatures indicate the strength of feeling among constituents in the northern half of Cumbria that our network of sub-post offices is vital, and that we do not want to lose any of them.</p>

 I am very lucky to be speaking to the House at this witching hour. However, the Table Office has somewhat marred the beauty, simplicity and elegance of my title, which was &#147;The Enforcement of Road Traffic Fines by Bailiffs&#148;. I want to raise that issue because it is producing a huge extortion racket, with local authorities&#151;which should protect the people&#151;colluding with cheating bailiffs to impose huge and excessive charges that are then justified by lies and enforced by bullying. Those charges are imposed on motorists who have unpaid fines, many of whom do not even know that they have offended. That is the group I wish to talk about in particular. I am talking about the innocent, not the Nigerian embassy or the American embassy, or habitual offenders who do not seem to get caught. This is an extortion racket against the innocent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o707"><a name="70327-0031.htm_para24"><a name="07032835001274">I want to give an example involving my daughter, Susan Mitchell. She lives in Dulwich&#151;all my kids are middle-class and have moved up in the world faster than I have. She arrived home from work on 5 March this year and set off to take the kids to their swimming class only to find that her car had been clamped by an enforcement firm called JBW. It was demanding &#163;706.22, plus &#163;1 if she paid by credit card&#151;&#163;707.22&#151;to release it. It said that if that was not paid it would tow the car off and sell it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o708"><a name="70327-0031.htm_para25"><a name="07032835001275">This incident was related to an unpaid parking charge from 8 September last year. My daughter says that a ticket was not stuck on the car, and given that she was moving house at the time to a house two streets away, it seems clear that any reminder to pay and any notice of the court order had gone to the old house. We have this obstinate British habit of not sending court orders, reminders to pay and other such documents by recorded delivery. Every other European country requires proof of delivery; we do not, but we should.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o709"><a name="70327-0031.htm_para26"><a name="07032835001276">The local authority, Southwark council, had been notified of my daughter&#146;s move. It had the change of address, but it did not bother to check its records; it simply handed the case to the bailiffs. The attitude was, &#147;Here&#146;s a nice contract for JBW. Let&#146;s give them a nice little earner.&#148; JBW, the enforcement agency, claim to have checked with the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency&#151;indeed, it charged my daughter &#163;5.32 for that check&#151;which had been notified of the change of address, so JBW knew of that change. Nevertheless, it claims to have made three visits to the old address, for which it charged my daughter &#163;152. Incidentally, the new residents at the old address did not notice those visits, so they cannot have been door-knocking visits.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o710"><a name="70327-0031.htm_para27"><a name="07032835001277">JBW also claims to have written to the old address warning of distraint action, as it is required to do. Again, it did not send that letter by recorded delivery. It explained to my daughter that it is too expensive to send these things out by recorded delivery. It gets only a statutory allowance for writing one letter&#151;&#163;11.20. Recorded delivery costs 68p and a first-class stamp 32p&#151;a total of &#163;1. So it prefers the certainties of  <br>

second-class mail for the delivery of these documents, to the wrong address. It did not waste any more stamps writing to the new address, when it found it. In fact, it did not write to it at all; it simply snuck round and clamped the car.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o711"><a name="70327-0031.htm_para28"><a name="07032835001278">This is the fundamental problem. Bailiffs do not want people to pay up on a first approach, which my daughter would have done once the situation had been explained to her. There is no money for the bailiffs if the person coughs up. They get fees only if they visit the house, so we get these phantom claims for calls that were never in fact made. The streets of London are presumably filled with ghostly visitors flitting from house to house, unnoticed by the householders. They get money only if they distrain or clamp the vehicle, because that entitles them to charges, which they set.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o712"><a name="70327-0031.htm_para29"><a name="07032835001279">JBW clamped my daughter&#146;s car and charged her &#163;240 for doing so, which is double the rate that it says it charges for that service. That made a total of &#163;707, of which &#163;155 went to Southwark. Jamie Waller, the boss of JBW, says in an affidavit that he varies charges by area, so presumably the posh areas get the higher charges and the less well-off ones get the lower charges. My daughter must therefore live in a middling-posh area.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o713"><a name="70327-0031.htm_para30"><a name="07032835001280">Eventually, once my daughter had paid, JBW came to remove the clamp&#151;at 6 o&#146;clock in the morning the next day. Anybody in that situation would be as distressed as my daughter was. What do they do? Who do they turn to? Naturally, she rang Southwark council for help. It told her that the charge was &#147;not unreasonable&#148;. A charge of &#163;707 seems to me absolutely monstrous, but to Southwark council it is not unreasonable. It must pay its staff very well indeed if they can afford to pay such charges out of their own pockets. The council is very courageous in committing itself to the phrase &#147;not unreasonable&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o714"><a name="70327-0031.htm_para31"><a name="07032835001281">Southwark council also told my daughter that this was none of its business&#151;it was between her and JBW. That is not true, because the council has a duty of care toward its residents; however, it also has a contract with JBW. However dodgy JBW might be, Southwark has a contract with it to perform this service. That makes it liable for the acts of its agents, because JBW is acting as the agent of the council. Instead of giving that useless and untrue information, the council could have told my daughter that she could have made a statutory declaration in the county court, which would have cost her &#163;5. That would have gone to the Northampton parking fines centre, stayed the process and the clamp could have been removed. However, Southwark council was spectacularly useless and did not give my daughter that information. It did not do so because it is in collusion on this issue with JBW, because it has a contract with JBW for the charges. People are left defenceless and bullied by the bailiffs into coughing up. My daughter coughed up &#163;707.22.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o715"><a name="70327-0031.htm_para32"><a name="07032835001282">I was appalled by that enormous and ridiculous charge, so I began to investigate with the help of the London motorists action group. Sheila Harding, Philip Evans, Alison Laughton and others were all very helpful and very angry. Through those investigations, I have built up a picture of what is a huge extortion racket operated by a &#163;6 billion industry, primarily in London but all over the country. They are private contractors on contract to public bodies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o716"><a name="70327-0032.htm_para0"><a name="07032835001283">The industry is cutting corners, lying and pretending that it has done things that it has not, because the fee structure does not pay it for simply getting the money, which is what the local authority presumably wants. That is not the real job of bailiffs. Their real job is to distrain goods. That is their traditional role and they only get any fees if they distrain goods&#151;or clamp cars. So they fabricate charges, claim for phantom visits and use uncertified staff. In fact, Sheila Harding keeps a record of 103 inquiries about acts that should have been done by certified bailiffs, but when checked only 47 had been. I do not know whether Mr. Marsh, who clamped my daughter&#146;s car, is certified. Southwark council does not seem to know and the firm is not saying. He may be certified or he may not be. All I know is that I do not like his tone or aggressive attitude in a recording of his interview with my daughter.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o717"><a name="70327-0032.htm_para1"><a name="07032835001284">Sheila Harding&#146;s research also shows that there are only 1,521 certified bailiffs in the country. Those 1,521 certified bailiffs are dealing, on 2006 figures, with4 million liability orders for unpaid council tax, 900,000 unpaid parking charges in London and 1.6 million people in arrears of child support. They cannot do that, so they are using uncertified staff. Sheila Harding&#146;s research shows that the local authority contracts, which should be open and used to regulate the bailiffs, are useless. Some of them are secret and people have had to apply under freedom of information legislation to find out about them, none of them is published, and many of them have lapsed. One contract, Hammersmith&#146;s, was lost and all of them are weak. The result is that the extortion racket is unchecked.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o718"><a name="70327-0032.htm_para2"><a name="07032835001285">I shall give some examples. Equita, which is a subsidiary of Crapita&#151;I am sorry, I mean Capita&#151;is the biggest firm in the business. Alex Henney was clamped by Equita and he took the case to the local ombudsman and proved that Equita and Camden had both lied about the visits made&#151;phantom armies making phantom visits. Simon Aldridge was charged &#163;704. He took Equita to court and the judge accepted that the visits had been claimed for but not made. Duncan McGowan was charged &#163;2,084 and he got &#163;1,426 back through the small claims court. I have many more examples&#151;these are just a sample. In one case, a man had a letter dropped through his letter box saying that a certified bailiff had visited him. He dashed out and followed the man who had delivered the letter. That man was delivering a sheaf of similar letters, and he turned out not to be a certified bailiff but just a messenger. In 2004, Equita&#146;s pre-tax profits amounted to &#163;7.4 million, against capital employed of &#163;5.8 million&#151;a return on capital of 127 per cent. The company does not make that much from &#163;10 letters and regulated fees.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o719"><a name="70327-0032.htm_para3"><a name="07032835001286">Bailiff certification is a licence to filch money from people over unpaid charges. That was exposed by the BBC&#146;s &#147;Whistleblower&#148; programme last September. Given what I have learned through my daughter&#146;s experience and my research, the question that I want to ask is, &#147;What should we do about it?&#148; The problem is that private bailiffs are working on public authority contracts, so my first suggestion is that local authorities must exert tighter control over contractors.

Transport Committee recommended that in 2005. It wanted careful regulation by the local authority to ensure that charges, operations and practices were all transparent. That should be put in place: when they hand out a contract, local authorities should exercise their powers to ensure that it is not a nice little earner, but a duty to be fulfilled.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o720"><a name="70327-0032.htm_para4"><a name="07032835001287">Secondly, the fees need to be regulated. The present structure is based on the old fashioned view that bailiffs distrain goods, but it should recognise that nowadays they are about getting the money to pay charges. We need a structure that places the emphasis on getting the fines paid, not on grabbing goods&#151;something that bailiffs want to do because that gives them access to bigger fees. Some industry leaders are trying to develop a more transparent fee scale. Good on them&#151;I hope that they are successful and that the Government encourage them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o721"><a name="70327-0032.htm_para5"><a name="07032835001288">Finally, we need a regulator. Cowboys need a sheriff, and the mafia cannot be regulated by the mafia. Crooks&#151;and I use that word in the Australian sense, to describe people who are &#147;crook&#148;&#151;need a rule-maker to control them. The Government have proposed that the Security Industry Authority should be the regulator, but I do not think that it is up to the job. The SIA is a licensing authority, not a regulator, and bailiffs are not part of the security industry. We need a proactive regulator who can investigate complaints.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o722"><a name="70327-0032.htm_para6"><a name="07032835001289">The Government began a consultation process in January but, unfortunately, they have set their face against giving the regulator the ability to investigate complaints. It is essential that someone protects people who suffer the sort of problems that I have described. It is daft to exclude investigation from the regulator&#146;s role. The regulator should disqualify, discipline, regulate fees, hear appeals, and be available to help people faced with the sort of bullying that my daughter experienced. </p>

Department for Transport is responsible for policy and the statutory framework for the enforcement of some road traffic regulations, including parking penalties and debts resulting from them. My Department is responsible for the bailiff certification process. Section 78 of the Road Traffic Act 1991 allows the Lord Chancellor to make orders for road traffic debts to be enforced by certificated bailiffs. It should be those certificated bailiffs, working for local authorities, who deal with the enforcement of road traffic debts. My hon. Friend referred to the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Bill, which finished its Committee stage in the House of Commons today. It includes important changes to enforcement agent law, which I hope he will find more convincing than he expects. Enforcement agent law is mixed up in myriad legislative fragments and in the common law. The role of bailiffs has evolved piecemeal over centuries. There is a need for the law to be clear, as well as a need to regulate the individuals and businesses responsible for the activities. What we are doing is to legislate and to regulate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o726"><a name="70327-0032.htm_para10"><a name="07032835001294">The Bill consolidates enforcement agent law and puts it all in one place, which is going to make it a lot easier for enforcement agents, creditors, the advice sector and debtors to understand it. Those provisions will apply to the enforcement of road traffic debts. Schedule 12 sets out a new procedure that must be followed when enforcing debts by taking goods. It is a framework, and further detail will be provided in the regulations to follow. A detailed policy statement has been laid before the House that sets out what we intend to include in regulations. In paragraph 160 of that statement, we set out what the enforcement agent will need to provide to the debtor when entering the premises. That information will include charges which have been made, information on any further charges that could be made in relation to the debt, and an outline of avenues of complaint and rights of appeal, including how to appeal against excessive fees.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o727"><a name="70327-0032.htm_para11"><a name="07032835001295">There are different fees depending on the type of debt. The Bill provides for one fee structure and puts all fees in one place, which should empower people to resist abuse. Importantly, there will be an up-front fee element, payable to bailiffs so that they do not act entirely in pursuit of a cut of the cash recovered&#151;we hope that that will help. It will be necessary, through the consultation on the detail, to ensure we get the level and nature of the fees right to avoid possible abuses such as grabbing goods and phantom visits of the kind discussed by my hon. Friend. As I said, there will be an appeal route and a complaint route. The Bill includes an enhanced and extended certification process, which will make a major contribution towards our goal of a fully regulated, trained and professionalised enforcement industry. No one at all save state employees can practise as an enforcement agent or bailiff unless they are certificated after that provision comes into force.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o728"><a name="70327-0032.htm_para12"><a name="07032835001296">Under the new certification process, certificates will be issued by a county court judge, as they are now, but the conditions will be much stricter. There will be a greater emphasis on training, especially in diversity awareness, conflict avoidance and dealing with the vulnerable. In my view, that is about getting all members of the bailiff industry to understand, as many of them already do, that they are working in the public  <br>

interest&#151;they are not simply debt collectors working single-mindedly in the interests of their creditors on a commission. They are agents of the public authorities, notably the courts. However it is our longer-term intention for the whole enforcement industry, other than Crown employees, to be overseen by an independent regulatory body, and we are confident that the Security Industry Authority is an appropriate body to cover such bailiffs. An affirmative order under the Private Security Industry Act 2001 will bring bailiffs within the terms of the Act. On 30 January, as my hon. Friend said, a joint consultation paper was issued by the Department for Constitutional Affairs and the Home Office on the regulation of enforcement agents. The SIA contributed to that consultation, and we indicated that it is our preferred option. The consultation will end in about a month, and an announcement will be made in the summer.</p>

Since it has been in a position of being able properly to regulate doormen, it has done a good job. It has raised standards immensely&#151;the good-quality professionals are pleased with that&#151;and it has got rid of many of the bandits.</p>

 I do not think that will be strong enough. The SIA is not a regulatory body; it is a recording and registration body. Bailiffs are not part of the security industry. Abuse is rife and there will be more cases&#151;for example, as the police issue on-the-spot fines&#151;that press further down the social scale, where difficulties are unique. People need a body to which they can appeal; the body needs to be able to investigate and hear appeals, and the SIA cannot do that.</p>

 I realise that my hon. Friend is not yet convinced that the SIA is the right body. I have already outlined step 1: nobody will be a bailiff unless they are certificated by the court, which should get rid of a large number of the bandits. As my hon. Friend says, there is not a large number of certificated bandits and many of the types of people to whom he referred are still in the business. Training will be part and parcel of the job of the SIA. I would have thought that my hon. Friend&#146;s constituency experience was similar to mine, in that the quality of doormen has infinitely improved since the SIA had a proper role in regulating them. Although there is a difference between a bailiff and a doorman, it seems to us that the SIA is the right body to take the regulatory role.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o730"><a name="70327-0032.htm_para14"><a name="07032835001300">The SIA has regulatory structures; it will have the right tools to encourage compliance and will work first to achieve it rather than using enforcement. However, it will set the competences required for individuals and accredit training, and ensure that all enforcement agents have achieved levels of competency. It will also licence the managers and supervisors of front-line operatives and provide a voluntary approved contractor scheme for business.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o731"><a name="70327-0032.htm_para15"><a name="07032835001301">The SIA&#146;s enforcement policy code sets out in detail that it will use oral and written warnings first if it finds that companies or individuals fail to comply, but there are also penalties in the Private Security Industry Act 2001&#151;a fine of up to &#163;5,000 maximum or six months&#146; imprisonment for various offences. In addition, we will  <br>

be looking at the possibility of using alternative dispute resolution for complaints. There will thus be an interim system of enhanced certification with the emphasis on training, but there will be full-scale regulation soon. I urge my hon. Friend to respond to the consultation with some of the stories he has told us tonight.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o732"><a name="70327-0032.htm_para16"><a name="07032835001302">On the actuality of the enforcement of road traffic debts, there is a set procedure which the Government believe gives motorists adequate opportunities to demonstrate that a penalty charge notice has been incorrectly issued. It is also intended to give them ample opportunity to pay. It is only when a motorist disregards the unpaid and unchallenged penalty charge notice that it becomes a debt and the matter will be sent to a bailiff. Only then will the motorist have a bailiff at their door. It is the motorist&#146;s responsibility to settle their debts and avoid enforcement.</p>

existing guidance to local authorities on their contracts with bailiffs, so we will approach the matter from that angle, too.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o734"><a name="70327-0032.htm_para18"><a name="07032835001304">Although my hon. Friend is clearly unhappy with the current position I hope he can see three things: first, that the Government are apprised of the problem; secondly, that we are legislating for simplification and certainty of bailiff powers, so that everyone will know what they are&#151;the information will be promoted through leaflets and websites; and thirdly, that we are intent on regulating strictly and strongly the bailiff industry, a small part of which has been responsible for the kind of depredations to which he has referred tonight.</p>
