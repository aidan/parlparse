 (Lab): How many disabled people the new deal for disabled people has helped back to work.  [196316]
</p>



<p><a name="st_0"><a name="41108-01_spmin0"><b>The Secretary of State for Work and Pensions  (Alan Johnson): </b> 
 Since the national launch of the programme in 2001, more than 45,000 people have gained a job through new deal for disabled people.
</p>








<p><a name="st_1"><a name="41108-01_spnew0"><b> Laura Moffatt: </b> 
 I am sure that everyone is delighted to hear that news, but it is important to say that when disabled people need access to the workplace they require extra help and support. This fantastic programme has provided that. Will my right hon. Friend tell the House exactly what extra training goes on with advisers to assist people with disabilities into the workplace?
</p>








<p><a name="st_2"><a name="41108-01_spnew1"><b> Alan Johnson: </b> 
 The important contribution is made by the disability employment advisers: their expertise, as well as the involvement of the employer through various groups, has given us those extraordinary access figures. It might be as well to point out that the 45,000 figure is the number of disabled people who have obtained work through the new deal for disabled people. As a result of all the new deal programmes taken together, however, 180,000 disabled people have found work, so we are talking about the expertise not only of the disability employment advisers in the new deal for disabled people, but of those who work in other programmes under the new deal.

<p><a name="st_4"><a name="41108-01_spnew3"><b> Alan Johnson: </b> 
 The reassurance we would give them is the reassurance that we have already given them; the Under-Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, my hon. Friend the Member for Liverpool, Garston (Maria Eagle), has made that clear on several occasions. We are looking very carefully at the needs of providers. This is a problem of success in the sense that the Shaw Trust, which does a marvellous job, as do the other providers, has been more successful than we thought in getting disabled people into work. We are constantly evaluating the programme, and we are having regular discussions. We think that as this is, uniquely, an outcome-funded arrangement, we can find a solution to the problem that the Shaw Trust has identified.

<p><a name="qn_1">2. <a name="41108-01_wqn1"><b> Mr. Alistair Carmichael  (Orkney and Shetland)</b> 
 (LD): What steps he is taking to tackle pensioner poverty.  [196317]
</p>



<p><a name="st_5"><a name="41108-01_spmin1"><b>The Secretary of State for Work and Pensions  (Alan Johnson): </b> 
 We have taken many steps to tackle pensioner poverty, including the introduction of pension credit and winter fuel payments. As a result of those and other measures, during 2004&#150;05 we will be spending nearly &#163;10 billion more on pensioners, including &#163;5 billion more on the poorest third. That means that the poorest pensioners are, on average, &#163;1,820 per annum, or &#163;35 a week, better off in real terms than they would have been under the 1997 system.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41108-01_para0">
<a name="stpa_0">I am today publishing in the Library the pension credit take-up figures to September 2004. They show that pension credit is playing a vital role in helping to give more money to the people who need it most: 2.62&nbsp;million pensioner households are benefiting, with 3.18 million individuals receiving an average award of about &#163;41 a week.
</p>








<p><a name="st_6"><a name="41108-01_spnew4"><b> Mr. Carmichael: </b> 
 I thank the Secretary of State for that very full answer. He will be aware that his Department&#039;s own figures showed that in 2002&#150;03 some 2.2 million pensioners were still living below the poverty line. Given his welcome recent statements in which he accepts there were problems with pension credit take-up and that it provides a disincentive to save and his acknowledgement that he is veering towards the idea of a citizen&#039;s pension based on residency, how much longer will he be veering and when might we eventually see flesh put on those interesting and laudable ideas?
</p>








<p><a name="st_7"><a name="41108-01_spnew5"><b> Alan Johnson: </b> 
 I can veer exhaustively; I shall be veering for a while longer. On the particular point about pension credit, in the hon. Gentleman&#039;s constituency 1,858 households and 2,153 individuals are benefiting. While the issue of take-up should be at the forefront of our minds, we are two thirds of the way towards our target in a third of the time available. Pension credit has just passed its first anniversary, and in Orkney and Shetland and elsewhere it is making a remarkable contribution.
</p>








<p><a name="st_8"><a name="41108-01_spnew6"><b> Mr. Stephen Hepburn  (Jarrow)</b> 
 (Lab): Why are we, on the one hand, quite laudably giving out those benefits to pensioners to reduce pensioner poverty yet, on the other, making it harder and harder for them to collect 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>8 Nov 2004 : Column 551</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>those benefits by allowing the closure of post offices? I know it will be said that that is a matter for the Post Office, but will he use his good offices through the Department of Trade and Industry, his own Department and, indeed, the head of the Post Office service to ensure that pensioners&#039; considerations are taken into account before any future closures?
</p>








<p><a name="st_9"><a name="41108-01_spnew7"><b> Alan Johnson: </b> 
 That takes me back to Department of Trade and Industry questions when I started off as a Minister. I understand the importance of my hon. Friend&#039;s point. We are the first Government to provide &#163;2 billion a year to protect the rural network and post offices in urban deprived areas. As for the rest of the network, sub-postmasters told us that they needed to ensure that they had the capability to make a proper living; otherwise they would go out of business. That is what the urban regeneration programme is about.
</p>








<p><a name="st_10"><a name="41108-01_spnew8"><b> Sir Peter Tapsell  (Louth and Horncastle)</b> 
 (Con): Will the Secretary of State publicly castigate a solvent foreign company that is threatening 400 of its former British employees with pension poverty? Has he seen the documents that I sent to his helpful Minister for Pensions from those pensioners, showing that Nikko Europe plc put its British pension scheme into wind-up in deficit on Christmas day 2001? Despite Nikko declaring profits last year of more than $400 million, it has so far declined to make good the deficit, as it could well afford to do, and is forcing those 400 deferred pensioners through a period of prolonged and acute anxiety.
</p>








<p><a name="st_11"><a name="41108-01_spnew9"><b> Alan Johnson: </b> 
 I understand that the employer, as the hon. Gentleman said, is solvent. The hon. Gentleman has been in correspondence with my hon. Friend the Minister for Pensions and now that he has raised the matter at Question Time, I will take a personal interest in it.
</p>








<p><a name="st_12"><a name="41108-01_spnew10"><b> Mr. Frank Field  (Birkenhead)</b> 
 (Lab): Does the Secretary of State realise that in his enthusiasm to counter pensioner poverty, the Liberal Democrats may have misread the answer that he gave at our last Question Time? Does he accept that while a citizenship pension might be a useful, additional tool to help the very oldest of our pensioners, it is not an avenue down which the Government are going, and that while our national insurance scheme has disadvantages, which need reform, reform will come in that direction and not via a citizenship pension?
</p>








<p><a name="st_13"><a name="41108-01_spnew11"><b> Alan Johnson: </b> 
 That answer was not given at the last Department for Work and Pensions questions but during the Opposition day debate on pensions two days later. Let me make this point: the problem that I am interested in tackling, which Members on both sides of the House should be interested in tackling, is pensioner poverty. Two thirds of those in abject poverty are women, for the very good reason that they have not built up enough national insurance contributions. Fifty per cent. of women do not have a full state pension, compared with only 10 per cent. of men, and some women retiring now are in the same position. I reassure my right hon. Friend that we are determined to resolve that problem. The citizen&#039;s pension is one way of doing 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>8 Nov 2004 : Column 552</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>so&#151;I have no wish, as I said recently to the Select Committee, to abrogate the contributory principle or to create more problems than we solve. I am concerned to overcome pensioner poverty, however, as we all should be, as it is a very real problem for millions of women in our society.
</p>








<p><a name="st_14"><a name="41108-01_spnew12"><b> Mr. David Willetts  (Havant)</b> 
 (Con): May I ask the Secretary of State about another aspect of pensioner poverty? Tackling pensioner poverty in the future means insuring company pensions with an effective pension protection fund. We agree with the Government on that, but it would be perverse if a flat-rate levy penalised well-funded schemes. Will he tell the House today what position he will take on the defeats that the Government suffered in the other place last week? Will the Government seek to reverse their decision to introduce rapidly a risk-related levy that is significantly bigger than the flat-rate levy?
</p>








<p><a name="st_15"><a name="41108-01_spnew13"><b> Alan Johnson: </b> 
 I have committed the Government, as has my hon. Friend the Minister for Pensions on many occasions, to introduce a risk-based levy as soon as possible. We had opted for a different route towards that levy because of the practical problems that we had identified. I have not yet taken full cognizance of the decisions reached in the other place, but there is no disagreement between us on the need to move to a risk-based levy as soon as possible. I will examine the practical difficulties and seek to resolve those in accordance with the decisions made in the other place.
</p>








<p><a name="st_16"><a name="41108-01_spnew14"><b> Vera Baird  (Redcar)</b> 
 (Lab): Irrespective of longer-term measures, perhaps such as a citizen&#039;s pension, will my right hon. Friend consider some quick changes now to help those women who will soon retire to have better basic state pensions: for instance, scrapping the 25 per cent. rule, under which any national insurance contributions of less than 10 years do not count towards a pension at all? Does he agree that that is unfair, that all contributions should count equally, and that that change could be brought about without primary legislation and without adding complexities to the pension system? That could help women who are about to retire to have a larger basic state pension of their own.
</p>








<p><a name="st_17"><a name="41108-01_spnew15"><b> Alan Johnson: </b> 
 I recognise the contribution that my hon. and learned Friend has made in this regard. I shall consider her suggestion, and other constructive suggestions made by Members. The report on women&#039;s pensions that we are pledged to publish next year will allow us to do that. The Turner commission included a separate chapter on women&#039;s pensions, which was a very good move on the part of the Pensions Commission.

<p><a name="st_18"><a name="41108-02_spmin0"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Work and Pensions  (Mr. Chris Pond): </b> 
 The agency is working with EDS, the IT supplier, to resolve the problems with the computer system. We will make a decision on the transfer of old scheme cases once we are satisfied that the new scheme is working well. Currently around 326,000 cases are being dealt with under the new arrangements, with just over 1 million still subject to the old scheme.

</p>








<p><a name="st_19"><a name="41108-02_spnew0"><b> Mr. Plaskitt: </b> 
 I thank my hon. Friend for his answer, but, as I am sure he is aware, it is broadly the same as the one that his Department has been giving since July 2003, when migration was supposed to start. It was supposed to be completed by April 2005.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41108-02_para1">
<a name="stpa_2">As more new cases come on stream and are assessed under the new formula, we are fast approaching a point at which we shall be running two CSAs in parallel. That is not sustainable. Whose fault is it, and when will it be put right?

<p><a name="st_20"><a name="41108-02_spnew1"><b> Mr. Pond: </b> 
 I acknowledge what my hon. Friend has said about the disappointment shared by all of us about the fact that we have not been able to make as much progress with the computer system as we wanted. That inevitably means that we cannot implement what all Members agree to be a much more effective system.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41108-02_para2">
<a name="stpa_3">I do not think that this is the place in which to allocate blame. My hon. Friend will know that we have had robust discussions with EDS. We are disappointed that the scheme is not in a fit state for us to be sure that it can work properly for parents with care and non-resident carers, but I assure my hon. Friend that we are doing all we can to make the system work effectively as soon as possible.
</p>








<p><a name="st_21"><a name="41108-02_spnew2"><b> Mr. Kidney: </b> 
 Will my hon. Friend take this opportunity to state publicly that the CSA&#039;s job would be easier if all parents, rather than just some, accepted their responsibility to maintain their children? Will he also acknowledge that running two systems side by side makes the agency&#039;s job difficult? Making one system out of the two would benefit not only parents and children, but CSA staff.
</p>








<p><a name="st_22"><a name="41108-02_spnew3"><b> Mr. Pond: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is right on both counts, but the most important point is that parents must take responsibility for the maintenance of their children. The CSA is there to ensure that that happens. If more non-resident parents took real responsibility, perhaps we would have less need for a CSA in any form. That could be described as a sad indictment.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41108-02_para3">
<a name="stpa_4">My hon. Friend is also right on the second count. Inevitably, running two systems at the same time makes the whole arrangement more complex. That is why we&#151;like my hon.

That means that every week in which the Minister fails to get a grip on the issue, some of the poorest children in the land lose &#163;10. As the new system was introduced 18&nbsp;months ago, some of those poor families have lost more than &#163;700 because of his failure to get a grip.

Friend the Secretary of State is looking afresh at this and a number of other issues to ensure that we can make that happen. There is a difficulty at the moment but the child maintenance premium is a feature of the new system. It cannot operate under the old system, the old system rules or the old system legislation. We are looking at the matter afresh to see whether there are any other mechanisms that we can use to ensure that the children who need the help get it.

I have said openly to the House that we share the disappointment of other hon. Members that we have not been able to make those moves as quickly as we expected. The Secretary of State said clearly to the Select Committee that he would like us to be moving ahead more quickly, but we have to be honest that we have not made the progress that we wanted to make.

If they are, why do we not get on and do the research, knock some heads together, talk to the Treasury and get this sorted, whatever we use the funds for? Personally, I would like it to go to the pensioners who have lost their pensions, and I do not consider that to be a party political matter. But whatever we use the money for, let us get on with it, rather than sitting and talking about it.

However, this is not a matter for my Department, and I suggest that he turn up at Treasury questions; indeed, as I understand it various opportunities are coming up to question Treasury Ministers on how far they have got. As Adrian Coles of the Building Societies Association pointed out, we are talking about other people&#039;s money, and for us to blunder in without giving the matter the most adroit and careful consideration would be a huge mistake.

 The hon.

The simple fact is that we believe that the orphan funds should be used for the good of society as a whole, and we will proceed very carefully in that direction. We believe that people who have lost money in pension schemes in the past should be given some level of assistance; however, we do not think it viable or sensible for us to promise the same level of assistance in future, through a pension protection fund that is set up to generate funds to ensure that it meets its liabilities. In looking at the past and offering assistance rather than compensation, we should be absolutely clear that the pension protection fund will not be able to offer 100 per cent. and 90 per cent. coverage in the same way.

 I accept that that is a problem, and similar difficulties have arisen with schemes in my own constituency. Of course, some changes have already been made and importantly, schemes that start to wind up after 10 May 2004 will benefit from a change in the priority order. The sector as a whole needs to look at this issue, and the pension protection fund needs to examine the issue of how much money is being spent and is being&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;taken away from pensioners, rather than being dedicated to them.

Can the Minister provide an assurance that despite the incidence of staff cuts, which the Government are working through, staffing levels for local pension services will be protected; otherwise, the erroneous payments will continue and get even worse?

Friend agree that the holistic approach that the programme represents is far more likely to achieve long-term success than the punitive approach of threatening people with the loss of benefits? It is far more likely to be successful in getting people on incapacity benefit back into the world of work, particularly those who have mental health problems.

<br>&nbsp;<br>possible. I know that she is chair of the all-party parliamentary group on mental health and understand her concern about the impact of compulsion, but I am a great supporter of compulsion in respect of the work-focused interview. There are safeguards to ensure that vulnerable people are not sanctioned if they do not turn up. It is absolutely crucial that people who have often been away from the jobs market and Jobcentre Plus for very many years get to see what kind of help can be offered. Many of them are surprised at the supportive way in which our staff can take them forward. Unless we get them in, we cannot help them get into work. So, the approach balances the rights of those individuals to be helped to get work with the responsibilities of having to turn up for the interviews.

 Pathways to work is a pilot programme. Until very recently, no one knew how to assist that group of people to get back into the labour market.

Therefore, despite the fact that the early indications are very encouraging&#151;we are very excited about them&#151;we do not yet know what the impact of the pilot schemes will be in respect of sustained job entries, for example. We need to ensure that we go forward on the basis of evidence. Only when we have that evidence&#151;it is appearing all the time&#151;will we be able to judge when and, indeed, if we can extend that approach elsewhere.

However, he knows, because I wrote to him on 3 November, that the existing jobcentre in Faversham is unfortunately not suitable for conversion to one of the new style offices, so we intend to provide our enhanced services from our Sittingbourne office, where many of our Faversham customers already go.

Jobcentre Plus is not about only new offices. He rightly asks whether we can ensure that the new way in which services will be delivered will be sufficient to address the requirements placed upon them. I will look into the matter that he raised today. We will offer services outside jobcentres in such places as local surgeries and shared sites with local authorities to meet the needs of our local customers.

 With permission, Mr. Speaker, I shall make a statement on the European Council that took place in Brussels on 4&nbsp;and 5 November.

</p>

<p>
<a name="41108-06_para1">
<a name="stpa_0">I should like to thank Prime Minister Balkenende and the Dutch Government for their arrangements for the summit, and for the way in which they have conducted their presidency to date. The Council was inevitably dominated by Iraq, given the presence of Dr. Allawi, the Iraqi Prime Minister.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41108-06_para2">
<a name="stpa_1">First, let me express what I know will be the sentiments of the entire House in sending our profound condolences to the families of the Black Watch soldiers killed by a terrorist bomb in Iraq last week and our sympathy to those soldiers injured yesterday in another&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;terrorist attack. We salute their dedication, professionalism and, above all, sheer and undaunted courage. They are an example to us all and we can and should be very proud of them.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41108-06_para3">
<a name="stpa_2">Let us also be very clear about the fundamental importance to Britain&#039;s security of what the Black Watch and, indeed, the British armed forces in the south of Iraq are doing. Defeat of terrorism in Iraq is defeat for this new and virulent form of global terrorism everywhere. A democratic Iraq is the last thing the terrorists want to see. It is precisely for that reason&#151;because victory for the terrorists would damage security around the world, including here in Britain&#151;that we have to hold firm, be resolute and see this through, including in Falluja.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41108-06_para4">
<a name="stpa_3">The action by allied and Iraqi forces under way in Falluja would cease now, immediately, if the terrorists and insurgents who are using Falluja as a base for terrorism laid down their weapons and agreed to participate in the elections. Over the past few months, as he explained today, Prime Minister Allawi has tried to persuade them to do so. They have refused, not because they are fighting a foreign occupation&#151;if the terrorism stopped, American, British and other troops would leave Iraq&#151;but because they are fighting democracy. They are fighting to stop democratic elections, supervised by the UN and due to take place in January. They know that while Falluja remains outside the control of the UN-endorsed Government, they can use it to wreck elections. Why do the terrorists fear elections? Because they know that given the chance to vote for their own Government, Iraqis would reject the extremism and fanaticism these terrorists represent.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41108-06_para5">
<a name="stpa_4">The powerful speech made by Dr. Allawi to the European Council made precisely those points. He appealed for Europe&#039;s help. Some promised support of a military nature; others promised only financial support. But all of the Council agreed that it was in the interests of global security for Iraqi elections to take place. The Council also agreed a comprehensive package of EU assistance for Iraq, including a further programme of financial and logistical support for the elections, and financing for the UN protection force. This is on top of &#8364;300 million of humanitarian and reconstruction support from the EU over the past two years.
</p>

<a name="stpa_5">Following the re-election of President Bush, the Council also agreed that a close transatlantic partnership was fundamental to building international

<br>&nbsp;<br>peace, security and prosperity, and that we now need to strengthen that alliance so that we can intensify our work together in addressing the main international threats and challenges of the moment, including regional conflicts, terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.

<p>
<a name="41108-06_para7">
<a name="stpa_6">The Council also heard a presentation from the former Prime Minister of the Netherlands, Wim Kok, on his mid-term review of the Lisbon strategy on European economic competitiveness. He rightly concluded that Europe has to do far more to improve its underlying economic performance if it is to respond to the challenges of Asia and the United States, and he sensibly highlighted the importance of completing the single market, developing flexible labour markets, and promoting sustainable growth. The Council adopted a new five-year work programme of measures in the area of justice and home affairs. There are great benefits for the UK in co-operation with our European partners on these issues.

 The opt-in protocol for Britain, negotiated in Amsterdam in 1997, remains. It is also enshrined in the new constitutional treaty. We have used it successfully over the past five years to opt in to new measures on asylum and combating illegal immigration, and to opt out of measures on legal migration, frontiers and visas. The protocol gives us the right to decide whether to participate in each item of the EU work programme and makes nonsense of claims that Britain has given up the right to control its own borders. If, of course, we opt in because we want a particular measure, it is in our interests that in a Europe of 25 and soon 27 or 28 countries the use of a veto by another country cannot block the measure.

<a name="stpa_7">Finally, the President-designate of the Commission, Jos&#233; Manuel Barroso, briefed us on his proposals for restructuring the new Commission. He has reacted decisively to resolve the dispute with the European Parliament, and I am confident that as a result the new Commission will be able to take office soon. In summary, the meeting once again underlined the importance to Britain of maintaining both a strong relationship with the United States of America and a strong place in the Councils of the European Union. Both partnerships are vital to the British national interest and it will remain the policy of this Government at least to nurture both.

If and when we take back control of Falluja so that it is in the control of the Iraqi Government, a process of reconstruction will follow, as happened in Samarra and Najaf, where literally hundreds of millions of dollars are being spent on reconstruction projects. The people can then participate fully in the elections. I do not minimise the difficulties but it is essential for the holding of democratic, free and fair elections that the power and grip of the terrorists and insurgents in some parts of Iraq be broken.

I agree that it is important that we do more but the right hon. and learned Gentleman&#039;s policy of being a semi-marginalised player in Europe will not help to get economic reform. As for the woeful things that he claims will happen if the EU constitution is passed, I merely point out that he used to make the same predictions when he was Secretary of State for Employment in the previous Government about the social chapter. I think I remember his saying that 500,000 jobs would desert Britain if we signed the social chapter. We signed it and 2 million extra jobs have been created since. His powers of prediction are not good.

 I thank the Prime Minister for his statement. May I join him, on behalf of my right hon. and hon. Friends, in extending our condolences to the families of the Black Watch personnel who have been killed or injured, as well as to those of the very brave civilians who are giving their support and assistance to the Black Watch in their extremely dangerous job? The families not only of serving Black Watch personnel but of the Scots Guards, who have reportedly been placed on replacement standby, would welcome some clarification of the Government&#039;s position on possible replacement forces, given that they are clearly adhering to their view that the Black Watch will be home by Christmas. The House and the families concerned would welcome any clarification that the Prime Minister can give them on that issue, not least because there were contradictory reports in the media this weekend on whether replacement forces would be deployed at the end of this period.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41108-08_para0">
<a name="stpa_36">Whatever the original principled disagreements over the basis for the war, and, indeed, the more recent divergences of view over what many of us regarded as a strategic political and military shift over the Black Watch deployment, there is obviously consensus on wanting to see the democratic timetable and an independent Iraq achieved, and on our having no truck with terrorism. I am sure that the Prime Minister will acknowledge, however, that the real concerns over this American-led assault on Falluja&#151;not least in terms of the civilian casualties involved&#151;give rise to fair and legitimate questions. These questions have been raised on the international stage by Kofi Annan, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, and they are also arising within the Iraqi interim Government, not least in the different viewpoints now being expressed by the Prime Minister and the President there.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41108-08_para1">
<a name="stpa_37">Does the Prime Minister agree that, whatever the events of the next few days and weeks in Falluja, it is essential that the Americans&#039; conduct does not squander

<br>&nbsp;<br>any moral capital or undermine the legitimacy of the democratic process, especially if that were to result in a Sunni boycott of any elections taking place in January? On a practical as well as moral level, will the Prime Minister address the question of what contingency plans have been put in place to deal with those insurgents who have already fled Falluja, or who will in due course be flushed out of the city and move to other parts of the country, perhaps to carry on their notorious activities there? Formal hostilities in Falluja are commencing as we speak, so I am sure that the Prime Minister will acknowledge that these are responsible questions to which the House will genuinely want to return in due course.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41108-08_para2">
<a name="stpa_38">On the allied issue of Iran, the Prime Minister has already responded to some of the discussions that have taken place. He has an important summit meeting coming up later this week with President Bush, which is surely welcome, given the agenda that will be in front of them. If, as he suggested a moment ago, further discussions among the three European powers&#151;the United Kingdom, France and Germany&#151;will be taking place over the next few days, is he hopeful that he will be in a position to ask the President to endorse the strategy of these three countries in regard to Iran later this week in Washington? On completion of that summit meeting, does he intend to return to the House with a further statement of this kind, perhaps this time next week, to enable further discussions to take place?

<a name="stpa_39">On the issue of the eventual composition of the European Commission, does the Prime Minister agree that the way in which the European Parliament, as the directly elected representative body of all the member states, was able to have an impact on the President of the Commission should encourage one and all of a Eurosceptic disposition or otherwise that it is the proper forum in which proper European parliamentary pressure can be exerted to achieve a healthier, more desirable outcome? Does he also agree that this recent crisis, so-called, in fact redoubles the argument for a smaller Commission&#151;ultimately&#151;of precisely the type that the constitution puts forward?
</p>

<p>
<a name="41108-08_para4">
<a name="stpa_40">Finally, on the issue of the constitution and the referendum pertaining to it, the Prime Minister has said that it is the Government&#039;s position that there should be a referendum in due course. Will he confirm that the Government, irrespective of what might happen in referendums that may precede one here, will proceed with a referendum, come what may, in this country? If the type of economic liberalism and greater economic flexibility, to which he alluded in his statement and which were discussed at the summit, are achieved, will he perhaps, on a future occasion, see scope for doubling up a referendum on the constitution with one on the single currency?
</p>








<p><a name="st_6"><a name="41108-08_spmin0"><b>The Prime Minister:</b> 
 First, in respect of Iraq, let me say that although we had a disagreement about the war, I accept entirely that the questions the right hon.

I have made it clear that the Black Watch deployment will be finished so that the Black Watch is back in time for Christmas. It is not anticipated that the Scots Guards will replace the Black Watch in the job that it is doing at the present time.

<a name="41108-08_para5">
<a name="stpa_41">I also entirely agree that the important thing is to ensure that the democratic elections in Iraq go ahead. As I think we saw with Afghanistan, what happens in the course of the movement towards democracy is that some of those people who were anti-democratic forces end up on the defensive because people can see that there is a democratic process they can take part in. The power of some warlords in Afghanistan was broken not in the two years after the invasion, but in the few months running up to the democratic elections.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41108-08_para6">
<a name="stpa_42">The decision in respect of Falluja was taken by the Iraqi Government. It is really important that people understand this. Prime Minister Allawi made it very clear when he was appointed by the United Nations&#151;endorsed by the United Nations&#151;back in June that decisions of this nature were for him. Anyone who heard his press conference today, including his description of exactly how those terrorists and insurgents are using hospitals, schools, mosques and other places to store explosives and to try to ensure that in removing them there is the maximum damage done, could hear from his statement how passionately he believes that this is important. I understand that the decision has also been endorsed by the National Assembly. The very fear that he and others have is that if these terrorists and insurgents are allowed to carry on effectively making no-go areas in Iraq for the Iraqi Government, the issue of elections will be made more difficult.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41108-08_para7">
<a name="stpa_43">That brings me to the UN and the Secretary-General&#039;s letter. He said in that letter that the Iraqi elections are what he called, I think, the keystone of progress in Iraq. That is true. It is true also that he went on to express reservations about the action in Falluja, but as Prime Minister Allawi says, without the action in Falluja the keystone of the democratic process may be at risk. That is the important reason for doing it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41108-08_para8">
<a name="stpa_44">I think the Secretary-General is right also in saying it is important that we retain the moral high ground in fighting for elections in Iraq, but I say this to him and to others: part of us doing that is to keep emphasising the whole time to people that if the terrorists and insurgents would stop, elections would go forward. There would be full participation by Sunnis and others in those elections. Everyone wants that to happen. If the terrorism and insurgency stopped, there would be no need for American and British and other countries&#039; troops to help the Iraqi forces before they are able to look after Iraq on their own.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41108-08_para9">
<a name="stpa_45">The truth of the matter is that it is the terrorism that keeps troops from America, Britain and elsewhere there. If it stopped, of course, the Iraqi Government would be able to assume control of those areas, the UN-sponsored elections would take place and we would have a democratically elected Government. That is why I say to people that the absolutely critical argument to understand is that these terrorists are not fighting foreign troops because of their presence&#151;they are fighting them because they are an obstacle to preventing democratic elections. They know that if democratic elections happen, people will never give up democracy.

<a name="stpa_46">In Afghanistan, turnout was highest among women, and highest in the areas where the Taliban used to hold sway.

They are trying to

<a name="stpa_49">However, the Prime Minister, in his statement, referred to our strong relationship with the United States and our strong place in the European Union&#039;s Councils. He said that that was Government policy and that it was in our national interest, but were there not siren voices in the Council indicating that competition between the European Union and the United States was a better policy than competition and collaboration? Will he not reiterate that that transatlantic co-operation and closeness to which he referred should also be the policy of the entire European Union?
</p>








<p><a name="st_10"><a name="41108-09_spmin0"><b>The Prime Minister:</b> 
 Obviously, I agree with my hon. Friend. In so far as there are any voices saying that Europe should try to set up a rival pole of power to the United States, I think that it is far better that we co-operate strongly together. Of course, that is another reason why it is important for Britain to stay part of the European Union and a key player in Europe. It cannot be stressed too often that many countries around the table in Europe&#151;let us remember that 12 out of the 25 have troops in Iraq&#151;are strong supporters of the transatlantic alliance and need Britain arguing that case with them.

 That is simply not the case. It is not the Sunni-held town of Falluja: the town is held hostage by terrorists and insurgents. If they stopped and laid down their weapons, that town would have its own municipal democratic elections, and the town as a whole could participate in the Iraqi elections. Surely what the hon. Gentleman and every democrat should say is, &quot;There is no need to fight; if you believe in what you are doing, stand in the elections.&quot; What Prime Minister Allawi would say to him is that the very purpose of the terrorists, many of whom are not Iraqi, never mind from Falluja, is to stop the democratic process. Surely all of us who are democrats, whatever we think about the war, should agree with the Iraqi Government.

 No one is talking about an invasion of Iran. No one has ever talked about it, to my knowledge. I think it is completely absurd of us to talk in this way. However, it is obviously important for Iran to face up to its obligations under the International Atomic Energy Agency. It should also be recognised that our reasons for taking action against Saddam Hussein&#151;going back over 12 or 13 years&#151;were his invasion of Kuwait, his defiance of United Nations resolutions, and the plain intent that he had to develop weapons that cause immense damage not just to the middle east but to the wider world.

<p><a name="st_18"><a name="41108-09_spmin4"><b>The Prime Minister:</b> 
 I will not put it exactly like that, but my hon. Friend makes an important point. For years we have been told, particularly by the Conservatives, that our ability to decide whether we want to join the single currency will somehow be taken away by Europe.

He will know that today the president of the CBI issued a similar indictment. He also knows that David Arculus, the head of his own Better Regulation Task Force, has said that this is costing &#163;100 billion a year in over-regulation, much of which emanates from the EU. Does he accept that in the past seven years he and his Government have agreed to a large number of those regulations? Does he also accept that he can therefore do something about it? He can use the powers of this legislative Chamber&#151;this House of Commons&#151;in the interests of British business, which is becoming increasingly angry, to repeal or amend any of the legislation that is having such an impact on British business.

<a name="stpa_50">Secondly, of course, regulation has been agreed by this Government in the European Union and indeed by the previous Government in the European Union, which I know was not much to the hon.

 My hon. Friend speaks with a particular authority, and I hope that people will listen to what he said. I am sure that, as someone who used to serve with the Black Watch, his words will command the attention and support of everyone.

<p><a name="st_35"><a name="41108-10_spnew5"><b> Mr. David Heathcoat-Amory  (Wells) (Con):</b> 
 On immigration and asylum, can the Prime Minister confirm the figure extracted from the Home Office in July showing that the United Kingdom has recently agreed to participate in 26 separate measures in that field, including measures defining unauthorised entry, transit and residence, visas, asylum, and the qualification and status of non-EU nationals in seeking entry to this country? Will he confirm that that figure is correct? If it is, does that not show a clear transfer of decision making and authority from this House to the EU, to be decided by majority voting, even if the Government disagree with the eventual decision by that procedure?
</p>








<p><a name="st_36"><a name="41108-10_spmin5"><b>The Prime Minister:</b> 
 We decide our own asylum policy here. The Opposition can make many criticisms of the asylum and immigration policy, but the one sure thing

<br>&nbsp;<br>is that it has been decided here. However, with some measures we will want to opt in&#151;for example, those to do with illegal immigration, for which it is important that we get European co-operation. Surely the best thing is for it to be the decision of the Government whether to take part. If we decide to take part, we do take part&#151;presumably because we think that that is in our interest. If we decide not to take part, we do not have to take part. It is beyond me why that does not command the support of the Conservative party.

 In the discussions with Dr. Allawi&#151;who, according to the last poll that I saw, represented about 3 per cent. of Iraqi public opinion&#151;was it maintained that the assault on Falluja was being done for the United Nations, as the Prime Minister maintained to my hon. Friend the Member for Halifax (Mrs. Mahon) last week? How can that be so, when the Secretary-General of the United Nations has urged that it should not be undertaken, and said that it would make legitimate elections in Iraq in January less possible?
</p>








<p><a name="st_38"><a name="41108-10_spmin6"><b>The Prime Minister:</b> 
 Surely, in the end, as for the decision whether Dr. Allawi commands support in Iraq&#151;all the polling evidence that I have seen shows that he enjoys considerable support there&#151;my hon. Friend may be right, or I may be right. Put it to the test. Let there be elections in Iraq in January, and let the terrorists and insurgents lay down their weapons so that those elections can take place. I would have thought that the best message&#151;even from people such as my hon. Friend, who, for reasons that I entirely respect, was against the war in Iraq&#151;would be to say, &quot;Whatever we thought about the conflict in Iraq, lay down your weapons, let the United Nations-sponsored elections take place, and then let&#039;s see who has the support in Iraq.&quot;

<p><a name="st_39"><a name="41108-10_spnew7"><b> Mr. John Bercow  (Buckingham) (Con):</b> 
 It seems that there was no summit discussion of the worsening crisis in Burma. Given that the military junta there is guilty of savage violations of human rights every day, including using rape as a weapon of war, forced labour, compulsory relocation, use of child soldiers, use of human minesweepers, bestial destruction of villages and the incarceration of 1,400 political prisoners, does the right hon. Gentleman agree that it is essential that the European Union should adopt not token measures in the form of action against the pineapple juice sector in that country but a robust programme of targeted sanctions against the oil, gas and telecommunications sector, so that we can bring the regime to heel and offer the people of Burma the prospect of the freedom and justice that we have long enjoyed, and they have too long been denied?
</p>








<p><a name="st_40"><a name="41108-10_spmin7"><b>The Prime Minister:</b> 
 The hon. Gentleman makes a very powerful case. It is important that the European Union adopt stronger action, but to be frank, at the moment it is not possible to get that agreement in Europe. I understand that the matter was discussed at the General Affairs Council, but there is another and bigger issue: how the United Nations changes its charter and its rules, so that the way in which a country treats its own people can be a proper and fitting subject of

 On the middle east, the Palestinian Cabinet Minister Saeb Erekat said to me that the most useful help being given to the Palestinian Authority by any European Government is the British Government&#039;s training of the security forces, and he asked me to pass on his thanks. He also said that the Prime Minister, who has the trust of the Palestinian Authority and of the Israeli Government, is in a unique position to take an initiative to revive the middle east peace process. Will he take up that challenge?

<p><a name="st_42"><a name="41108-11_spmin0"><b>The Prime Minister:</b> 
 I thank my right hon. Friend for his comments about those who are engaged in the training of the Palestinian Authority&#039;s security forces. Britain has undertaken this work over a significant period, as well as work on political reform and governance. Actually, a lot has been happening underneath the surface that is very important, although not much noticed. As I have said before, I will obviously do everything that I can to ensure that this peace process becomes reinvigorated; plainly, that will be a significant part of the discussions that I have later in the week.
</p>








<p><a name="st_43"><a name="41108-11_spnew0"><b> Michael Fabricant  (Lichfield) (Con):</b> 
 But further to that question, given the grave ill health of Yasser Arafat, was any consideration given to the possible succession in Palestine? Does the Prime Minister accept that in a way the whole peace process is on a cusp? If the Palestinian organisation falls into the wrong hands, there could be impasse between Israel and Palestine, whereas if the right people succeed Yasser Arafat, the peace process could have a very real future.
</p>








<p><a name="st_44"><a name="41108-11_spmin1"><b>The Prime Minister:</b> 
 I agree, which is why it is important to proceed with measures that would allow elections in the Palestinian Authority to take place and the drafting of a new constitution. What is important is that we have empowered Ministers who can take decisions on security issues, but I agree with the hon. Gentleman that the situation is very much in the balance. It is important that we ensure that there is a Palestinian leadership that wants to make progress in the middle east. It is then for the international community to give that moderate Palestinian leadership support.

 Is the Prime Minister aware that I utterly condemn, and wish to see countered, terrorism in Iraq not only against the Black Watch but against Iraqi citizens? Four railway workers, all of whom were members of the Iraqi Federation of Trade Unions, were murdered on 27 October between Mosul and Baghdad. What measures have been put in place in Falluja to ensure that such people&#151;innocent people who are held hostage, as the Prime Minister himself put it&#151;are not attacked?


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>8 Nov 2004 : Column 584</b>

<p><a name="st_46"><a name="41108-11_spmin2"><b>The Prime Minister:</b> 
 My hon. Friend&#151;he was an opponent of the war, but he has taken a very honourable position on these issues all the way through&#151;is right in saying what the dilemma is. The terrorists are trying to cause maximum difficulty, which is why they are taking over places such as hospitals, schools and mosques. That is the reason why the situation in Falluja has not happened before now. I know from my discussions with Prime Minister Allawi and his Government that over the past few months, they have been making every effort to get a peaceful settlement in Falluja. That included making it clear that, provided that Iraqi Government forces came in and took control in Falluja, there would be no need for multinational forces to be in there, and it included ensuring that it was realised that there would be municipal elections in Falluja. The problem that we now have, however, is that unless we take back control of Falluja, ultimately it will be very difficult for ordinary people there to make progress, but we are doing everything that we can to limit civilian casualties in the course of the action that we take, which is why this is being proceeded with in a very careful way. I entirely agree that the important thing is to ensure that the Iraqi people understand that in the end this is not directed at them, but at the people who are preventing them from getting a democratic outcome.
</p>








<p><a name="st_47"><a name="41108-11_spnew2"><b> Mr. Desmond Swayne  (New Forest, West) (Con):</b> 
 I found myself in profound agreement with what the Prime Minister had to say about Iraq and the transatlantic alliance, but the gloss on the summit coming from the Elys&#233;e palace is very different, prompting the question whether the Prime Minister and the President of France attended the same European summit.
</p>








<p><a name="st_48"><a name="41108-11_spmin3"><b>The Prime Minister:</b> 
 It is probably not the first time that that has been said. Of course there are people in Europe who take a different view of what our attitude should be to the transatlantic alliance, but my answer is that we should remain in there, fighting for the right view of how Europe should co-operate with America, not get out and leave the field to those we disagree with.
</p>








<p><a name="st_49"><a name="41108-11_spnew3"><b> Hugh Bayley  (City of York) (Lab):</b> 
 Does the Prime Minister agree that there would be security benefits as well as environmental advantages if the west, the European Union, the United States and other Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries reduced their dependence on, and consumption of, oil? What will the EU do over the coming months to try to persuade the second-term US Government to take the problem of global warming more seriously and to reduce US consumption of oil?
</p>








<p><a name="st_50"><a name="41108-11_spmin4"><b>The Prime Minister:</b> 
 The emissions trading agreement is obviously an important part of what Europe is trying to do to deal with the problem. Europe as a whole has signed up to the Kyoto protocol. I think that issues connected to security of supply are making people think again, even in the United States of America, albeit from a different perspective. I have made Africa and climate change the key priorities for the G8, so there will be an opportunity to take this agenda forward. It is possible to see how we can do that&#151;probably, when it comes to discussion with the Americans, through the route of 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>8 Nov 2004 : Column 585</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>science and technology. Long-term issues to do with energy supply, as well as climate change, make that imperative.

<p><a name="st_51"><a name="41108-11_spnew4"><b> Sir Robert Smith  (West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine) (LD):</b> 
 Further to that answer, one of the explanations for why our constituents, especially the fuel-poor and large energy-using industries, are threatened with extremely high energy bills this winter is that we have managed to liberalise our energy market quite successfully in the UK, while mainland Europe has dragged its heels. Did the Prime Minister find anything in the summit to encourage any optimism that mainland Europe will eventually address that agenda, open up its own energy markets and decouple the price of gas from oil?
</p>








<p><a name="st_52"><a name="41108-11_spmin5"><b>The Prime Minister:</b> 
 The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right. The Council did discuss the issue of energy liberalisation and why it is important to pursue it. A process of change is now under way, and it will reduce energy prices for our consumers. One of the problems is that we have a liberalised energy market, while other countries in Europe do not, but the movement is definitely towards liberalisation.
</p>








<p><a name="st_53"><a name="41108-11_spnew5"><b> Hugh Robertson  (Faversham and Mid-Kent) (Con):</b> 
 Did the Prime Minister have any discussions with other European Heads of State about the attitudes of countries bordering Iraq? Is there any evidence that any of those countries are providing men and equipment to the rebels in Falluja?
</p>








<p><a name="st_54"><a name="41108-11_spmin6"><b>The Prime Minister:</b> 
 A conference taking place in Egypt in the next couple of weeks will discuss that very issue. It is true to say that there are varying reports, but when Dr. Allawi visited Syria recently, he found a willingness to co-operate. I think that it is immensely 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>8 Nov 2004 : Column 586</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>important for both Syria and Iran in particular to ensure that their borders are not being used as a route for people to cross over and engage in terrorist activity. We are certainly making it very clear to those countries that any such support of terrorism in Iraq is unacceptable. I believe that the conference will play some part in flushing out people&#039;s positions and will send out a strong signal that those who support terrorists and insurgents are in breach of their moral obligations to the international community.

 The surrender of Britain&#039;s veto on asylum and immigration policy in favour of qualified majority voting forms part of the European constitution. That being the case, why is the Prime Minister taking the decision to give up the veto now? Can he not wait for the referendum, when the British people will be able to vote on the constitution?
</p>








<p><a name="st_56"><a name="41108-11_spmin7"><b>The Prime Minister:</b> 
 The hon. Gentleman said, &quot;That being the case&quot;, but it is not the case. We are not giving up the absolute right to decide whether to opt in to any asylum or immigration measure, and that is very sensible. There are certain issues&#151;for example, as I said a moment ago, people trafficking and illegal immigration&#151;on which we want to be part of European action. However, we can decide those issues one by one. As my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary rightly said, it is the best of both worlds.

<a name="41108-12_head0"><h3 align=center>Regional Referendums</h3>

<a name="time_1">
<a name="41108-12_time0"><h5>4.30 pm</h5>




<p><a name="st_57"><a name="41108-12_spmin0"><b>The Deputy Prime Minister  (Mr. John Prescott) </b> 
 <i>rose&#151;</i>[Hon. Members: &quot;Hooray!&quot;] Here today, gone tomorrow.

</p>

<p>
<a name="41108-12_para0">
<a name="stpa_54">With permission, Mr. Speaker, I should like to report to the House on the regional referendum in the north-east, held last Thursday. May I first congratulate Ged Fitzgerald, the chief counting officer, and his staff across the north-east, who ran such a well-organised poll and count? I also want to thank the police, the Post Office and the Electoral Commission for their co-operation during the referendum.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41108-12_para1">
<a name="stpa_55">Turnout, at nearly 48 per cent., was a great deal more than many people expected and has shown that all-postal voting can be extremely successful when the ground is well prepared. This ballot was conducted successfully, without witness statements, and the turnout has increased considerably. It was higher than the 42 per cent. turnout in the European elections in the north-east, higher than the 34 per cent. in the London referendum and similar to the 50 per cent. in the Welsh referendum. I am sure that the Electoral Commission will want to reflect on that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41108-12_para2">
<a name="stpa_56">Throughout the referendum, the Government have made it absolutely clear that the decision whether to have elected regional government rests with the people. It is their choice and their say. Our policy of devolution, set out in our manifesto, means giving power to people in our nations and regions so that they can set their own priorities and make more decisions that affect their lives. As a result, London now has city-wide government and a Mayor powerful enough to run a global city. The Scottish Parliament enables the people of Scotland to make key decisions without recourse to Westminster for the first time in hundreds of years. The Welsh Assembly has given the Welsh people a powerful new voice to create jobs, prosperity, and social justice. Each of these new bodies was voted for by the people and has since proved to be very popular.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41108-12_para3">
<a name="stpa_57">It is worth remembering that proposals for Scottish and Welsh devolution failed to win public support in the first referendum in 1979, only for the situation to be reversed 20 years later in a new referendum. On 4&nbsp;November, we offered the people of the north-east the chance to benefit from an elected regional assembly. Last Thursday, voters in the north-east decided by a margin of 78 per cent. to 22 per cent. that they did not want that, and of course we abide by their decision.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41108-12_para4">
<a name="stpa_58">I confirm to the House that the result of the referendum means that the Regional Assemblies Bill will not be introduced in the coming Session of Parliament; under existing legislation, there can be no further referendum on regional assemblies in the north-east for at least seven years; and&#151;let me make it clear&#151;despite press speculation, there will be no reorganisation of local government in County Durham or Northumberland arising out of this referendum result. Indeed, I hope that the two councils can now get on with delivering effective services for their people.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41108-12_para5">
<a name="stpa_59">The decision now raises the question as to whether to proceed, as we previously intended, with referendums in the north-west and in Yorkshire and the Humber. We 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>8 Nov 2004 : Column 588</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>have reflected on the outcome of the referendum in the north-east, as promised. We have also made it clear that referendums in the north-west and in Yorkshire and the Humber would have to wait until the Electoral Commission had completed its work on the &quot;new foundation model for voting.&quot; That is not due to be published until the end of March 2005.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41108-12_para6">
<a name="stpa_60">The Electoral Commission has also said that there should be no electoral pilots using the new model until at least September 2005, but in the meantime, under the legislation, our ability to hold referendums based on the current soundings exercise runs out in June 2005. We would, therefore, need to conduct a new soundings exercise and bring orders to call the referendums before both Houses of Parliament under the Regional Assemblies (Preparations) Act 2003. All that would result in a long period of uncertainty for local government in the two regions, and we do not think that is acceptable. I will not, therefore, be bringing forward orders for referendums in either the north-west or Yorkshire and the Humber. If and when, in the future, a region wants to move ahead with a referendum, the House will have plenty of notice of that event.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41108-12_para7">
<a name="stpa_61">I do not want to underplay the importance of last week&#039;s decision, but the House should remember that elected regional assemblies are just one part of the wider programme of devolution and decentralisation in England. For a decade or more, it has been recognised that there are issues that must be dealt with at regional, rather than national, level, but which need to be co-ordinated over an area larger than any single local authority&#151;[Hon. Members: &quot;Why?&quot;] Members should look at a map if they are in any doubt.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41108-12_para8">
<a name="stpa_62">That is why the Conservatives established the Government offices for the regions in 1994, and rightly so. We have since strengthened the Government offices to include more departments. We also created, in 1998, the regional development agencies as economic powerhouses for their regions; the Conservatives opposed them, but I believe that they have now changed their minds.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41108-12_para9">
<a name="stpa_63">In the last two years alone, the English RDAs have created or safeguarded more than 160,000 jobs and have played a major part in reshaping our regional economies. The House will be aware that in 1998 every English region was given the choice of having a voluntary regional assembly composed of representatives from local government, business, trade unions and the wider community. All eight regions&#151;all of them&#151;chose to have one of those voluntary regional assemblies. All parties are represented on them, and some are even chaired by Conservative councillors.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41108-12_para10">
<a name="stpa_64">Those voluntary assemblies have an important influence on housing, planning, transport, economic development and skills and training in their region. Those regional bodies play a co-ordinating, strategic role with the full involvement of local authorities and other representatives in the regions. The successful northern way initiative, launched in February this year, is a good example of the benefits of that co-operative approach.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41108-12_para11">
<a name="stpa_65">The RDAs and their partners in the three northern regions are working together to create more jobs, more prosperity and greater justice. The northern way has 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>8 Nov 2004 : Column 589</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>been warmly received, and has energised people in the three northern regions&#151;that includes representatives of all political parties. It is one example of how, across the country, regional structures and initiatives will continue to work for the benefit of the regions with the full support of the Government.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41108-12_para12">
<a name="stpa_66">Our continuing agenda of reform and devolution to local authorities is equally important. That was evident in July, when we launched our document, &quot;Local Vision&quot;, beginning an extensive consultation about the future of local government. It means allowing more decisions to be made in local communities. Along with the modernisation and reform of local government, we have taken several steps to devolve decision making to local authorities. We have removed the restrictive controls on local authority borrowing. We have given local authorities greater power to promote the well-being of their communities and the freedoms and flexibilities to deliver better services, and we are piloting local area agreements that will streamline funding from Whitehall so that spending can better reflect local priorities, determined locally. All those measures&#151;every one of them&#151;have been warmly welcomed by all local authorities.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41108-12_para13">
<a name="stpa_67">Our agenda for reform, change and modernisation means that we will continue to decentralise and devolve power wherever we can. We have already done a lot, and there is a lot more to do. We have already brought economic stability, lower unemployment and lower inflation; and our commitment to delivering the best possible future for all the regions remains as strong as ever.

I have been a Member of Parliament for over 30 years, although some people want me to go now, and have witnessed demands in the House and the Chamber to set up various regional committees. I have always supported those demands, but the House does not have a very good record of providing much influence or power to Members, and we are told that there is no time for debate. The last regional debate was on the northern way, when one Tory turned up. Despite demands for Parliament to deal with regional affairs, the evidence, I am afraid, is against such a role. I am supportive of my hon. Friend, but the pressure of time on this legislature is one reason why people in the regions should make their own decisions.

We went further than the White Paper on fire, planning arrangements and transport. Some might argue that the assembly should be a parliament with the powers that we have. That is fair enough.

 That is an important question, which I had to address during the debate. We produced a White Paper that reflected the judgment between Whitehall and us about the powers that could be redistributed. Some were already undergoing a form of reorganisation. The Learning and Skills Council was a classic example of something that was established both nationally and locally. As I said earlier, people found in the regions that regional directors had to be appointed to make regional decisions about training. I argued after the White Paper that people in the regions should make the decisions. Local bodies alone cannot do that; there needs to be regional decision making. That has been recognised by the Learning and Skills Council, and the fact that we approved the number of people to be appointed by the assembly to sit on the board responsible for training is an improvement. This is also a recognition that regional dimension decision making is going to be there all the time, whether it involves elected people or unelected people.

 I certainly agree with my hon. Friend&#039;s last comment. In regard to regional devolution, the thing that has always convinced me of the need to do more than simply leave things to central Government is the increasing differential between the north and the south. It has now been measured that if the three northern regions were to secure the same level of growth in gross domestic product that there is in the south, they would be &#163;30 billion better off and there would be 250,000 more jobs. That is the reality. While all the regions have now increased their prosperity under the Labour Government and reduced their unemployment by half, the differential still exists. That is why I feel strongly that we need to do something more.

I certainly recognise that that argument is also true for the north-west, but it will be up to the people of the north-west to make their views clear. We have kept the legislation relating to these measures, and if it is their declared opinion that they want one, the legislation remains for another exercise, but not within the next year or so.

 I am sure that my right hon. Friend will agree that, while this particular proposal might be dead, the principle of devolution most certainly is not. We on this side of the Chamber need take no lectures from the Conservatives on devolution, because when they last occupied the Government Benches, they were the most centralising Government this country had ever seen. When the dust has settled, will my right hon.

The councillors who sit on local authorities already sit in the regional assemblies so, although they are not directly elected to them, they are indirectly elected. That will give them some authority, as opposed to the quangos and civil servants in regional government who make the decisions at the moment.

 The decision not to proceed with the referendum in the north-west is very welcome and is, in part, a tribute to the North West Says No campaign, which was enthusiastically supported by many Labour MPs.

</p>








<p><a name="st_99"><a name="41108-16_spmin2"><b>The Deputy Prime Minister:</b> 
 The ruling out comes from the statutory obligation that the House imposed on us, but that does not apply to the north-west or to Yorkshire and Humberside, because they have not had referendums. Had they done so, and said no, it could apply. It is therefore possible that if a particular view was developed and assessments were made in the north-west and Yorkshire and Humberside, they could still have a referendum. The legislation is there for them to do so if they so wish.

Previously, when Hertfordshire had the opportunity to take such decisions, and a Lib-Lab county council tried to impose building on the green belt, we were able to defeat it at the ballot box and change the policy.

Even among elected members, there is a predominance of nimbyism&#151;we do not want it here. We are entitled to say that, if there is housing demand in an area from people who need it, we must meet that. It is a matter of negotiation between central and local government.

That sorry catalogue of events can only diminish the reputation of the immigration service and, importantly, damage the relationship between Patagonia, the Welsh people there and the UK, which this Government and the Administration in Cardiff have fostered. Despite all that, the Minister of State at the Home Office has refused to meet me. Can Mr. Speaker use his good offices to prevail on the Minister of State to meet me before tomorrow afternoon&#151;before it is too late?

 I have listened carefully to the hon. Gentleman, but this is not a matter for the Chair. There are channels laid down for such matters&#151;ministerial channels and others, and he must pursue those in the normal way.

 I beg to move, That this House disagrees with the Lords in the said amendment.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41108-19_para0">
<a name="stpa_104">This amendment would place an obligation on the Secretary of State to take reasonable steps to ensure an increase of at least 20 per cent. in residential energy efficiency by 2010. I assure the House that the Government have absolutely no difficulty with the idea that residential energy efficiency should be increased. In debates on this issue in the other place, the Government were accused of weakening their position on that commitment, but I hope to be able to demonstrate the fallacy of that argument. I will also show that the amendment is unnecessary because existing legislation already provides the basis for setting and&#151;just as important&#151;reviewing energy efficiency aims.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41108-19_para1">
<a name="stpa_105">The 2003 White Paper referred to savings of around 5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;megatonnes of carbon as an indication of what we thought we could achieve at that time. With the benefit of further analysis, we have been honest enough to publicise a slightly lower figure. The energy efficiency plan of action, published last April by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, details measures that will deliver savings of 4.2, rather than 5, megatonnes of carbon in the residential sector.

 Will my right hon. Friend give way?

 My hon. Friend knows that I am a big fan, but I would like to be allowed to develop my argument a little before I yield to him.

</p>

<p>
<a name="41108-19_para2">
<a name="stpa_106">That figure is based on detailed analysis carried out following publication of the White Paper and reflects changes in economic and technical assumptions that came to light as a result of further work undertaken by DEFRA. So the Government have not sought to pull the wool over people&#039;s eyes on this issue. Indeed, the beauty of the figure of 4.2 megatonnes is that, at about 19 per cent., it is very close to the 20 per cent. improvement that this amendment seeks. Achieving 4.2 million tonnes of savings is in fact roughly equivalent to doubling the historic 1990s rate of energy efficiency improvement.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41108-19_para3">

DEFRA will consult shortly on the climate change programme review and we will also review our energy efficiency aim in 2007, as well as setting the target for the next phase of the energy efficiency commitment beginning in 2008. In other words, this is a constantly developing scene.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41108-19_para4">
<a name="stpa_108">Savings of 4.2 megatonnes of carbon are not to be sniffed at, and they are not the whole story. The difference of 0.8 megatonnes between the White Paper and action plan figures will be more than compensated for by an increase in projected savings from the business and public sector. We estimate that the measures set out in the action plan will achieve carbon savings of around 12 million tonnes per annum by 2010 across all sectors. That is 20 per cent. greater than the original White Paper figure of 10 million tonnes and by 2010 is expected to save households and businesses more than &#163;3 billion a year on their energy bills.

 There is much in what my right hon. Friend says, but is he aware that any saving in energy not only saves carbon emissions, but potentially depresses the need for nuclear energy as part of our energy sources? I would be grateful if my right hon. Friend addressed that issue and not simply that of carbon emissions, important though it is.
</p>








<p><a name="st_146"><a name="41108-19_spnew3"><b> Keith Hill: </b> 
 I take my hon. Friend&#039;s thoughtful point, but I am the Minister for Housing and Planning and I am addressing the issue in the context of housing. Wider issues of energy policy are not for me. I guarantee, however, that his observation will be reported to the Department for Trade and Industry, which has responsibilities in that area.
</p>








<p><a name="st_147"><a name="41108-19_spnew4"><b> Mr. Simon Thomas  (Ceredigion) (PC):</b> 
 The Minister has tried to claim that savings on carbon emissions from the industrial sector will offset the 16 per cent. cut&#151;it is not a small cut&#151;in the Government&#039;s initial target. However, that does not address the issue of fuel poverty and the warm homes initiative. If a 5 megatonnes saving had been the target, it would have provided the opportunity to deliver energy efficiency in the domestic sector with corresponding savings for some of the most deprived in our communities. I would not like the Government to lose sight of that aim.
</p>








<p><a name="st_148"><a name="41108-19_spnew5"><b> Keith Hill: </b> 
 I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his observation. I assure him that there is no danger of the relationship between energy efficiency and fuel poverty being ignored in the course of our deliberations. In fact, it is my expectation that we will be able to discuss those issues at some length and in detail in consideration of the third group of amendments, which includes proposals on the decent homes programme. He will be aware that we have to make a distinction between issues of energy use and energy loss and issues of income. There is not necessarily a direct and obvious relationship between the two, as I will seek to argue later.

The Government&#039;s energy efficiency plan for action, however, claims that the decent homes programme will be responsible for 0.05 megatonnes. The position has shifted, but has it really shifted that much?

<p><a name="st_154"><a name="41108-19_spnew11"><b> Keith Hill: </b> 
 I am happy to give my hon. Friend that assurance, and I do not do so in a facile fashion. This is an aspect of genuine joined-up government&#151;to use that familiar and slightly cod phrase. Indeed, I recently met DEFRA Ministers precisely to discuss such issues. Other Ministers were present, as well as representatives from other Departments, so the issues are genuinely being addressed across the board, and I hope that my hon.

<p>
<a name="41108-19_para5">
<a name="stpa_109">I was setting out certain points about the progress that we have already made on the action plan and the objectives for energy and carbon savings, which go beyond those originally identified in the 2003 White Paper. It is important that those points are put on the record. They have certainly been raised in previous debates, but it does no harm to reiterate them. That is not all.

I highlight two key measures: we expect condensing boilers to be installed faster under the 2005 building regulations than anticipated in the energy White Paper, and we expect installations of cavity wall insulation to more than double under the next phase of the energy efficiency commitment, which puts obligations on energy suppliers to achieve energy efficiency gains.

<a name="stpa_111">Although I recognise the genuine interest in the issue shown by hon. Members on both sides of the House and have listened to debates in this place and read those that took place elsewhere, I have been struck by the approach of some Opposition Members. Their zeal for the amendment has not been matched by their approach to other provisions in the Bill that would in fact help their case. I am thinking particularly of the home condition reports that will form part of the home information packs under part 5. The EU directive on energy performance of buildings will make it compulsory for home sellers to provide energy efficiency information on their home to potential buyers. That is entirely reasonable. We know that most improvements to homes take place when keen new owners take over.

 We will have an opportunity to discuss those matters and, in due course, I want to go into a little more detail about the inter-relationship of the energy and home condition reports.

</p>

<p>
<a name="41108-20_para1">
<a name="stpa_113">Although the Opposition favour compulsory energy efficiency reports&#151;at least, the Liberal Democrats favour them&#151;they do not support the very means whereby they will be delivered cost-effectively: compulsory home condition reports as part of a compulsory home information pack. Those reports will contain information about the energy efficiency of homes when they are marketed. Compulsory home information packs, with data about the energy efficiency of a property and what a new owner can do to improve it, will capture that moment.

If we overshot it and did better, that would be fine, but is not it good to have the target, to fix the Government&#039;s mind and to ensure that we reach the minimum necessary to achieve our overall goals?

 But we are already almost at that 20 per cent. point&#151;achieved by mechanisms that may not have been anticipated even two years ago. When we are moving towards the target, with which my hon.

<a name="stpa_140">I have often quoted Bryan Carsberg saying that regulators think that if something is not in the statute, it does not exist. What is true for regulators is also true for officials. Such a proposal has been around for a long time. Indeed, it was part of my original Sustainable Energy Bill. When a ministerial reshuffle took place during the consideration of that Bill, officials said that they would oppose it, although it had been agreed before, and their words are etched on my brain:

<a name="stpa_142">That is the nub of the problem, and those words struck home. If officials do not see something in statute and do not agree with it, it will not happen. There must be a statutory requirement to allow officials to act. That is why the performance and innovation unit&#039;s report was so important and why the energy White Paper was so insistent on the 20 per cent. target.

 The Minister described the figures as a shifting, moving picture.

He says that that would result in a 19 per cent. target on carbon rather than a 20 per cent. one, and asks what everyone is getting so worked up about.

 Well, the reduction would be 16 per cent., but the Minister said that the overall effect would be equivalent to a 19 per cent. target. However, if the difference between the targets is so small, why will the Government not agree to the 20 per cent. target? Why is a target of 19 per cent. more achievable than one of 20&nbsp;per cent.? The Government must know something that the rest of us do not. There must be a reason why a 19 per cent. target can be achieved easily, but 20 per cent. is out of reach. I am struggling to understand what that is, so when the Minister winds up the debate, I hope that he will set out why the Government are confident that they will meet the 19 per cent. target, yet fail to meet 20 per cent. The projections that his officials are making must be really tight to enable him to reach that conclusion.

 We need to put the debate in the context of the best aspects of the Government&#039;s record. For the first time in history, the Labour Government gave a statutory undertaking to eradicate fuel poverty in this country by 2016. The Government and the Labour party should rightly be proud of that awesome commitment. Equally, the Prime Minister made it clear to the House that meeting Britain&#039;s Kyoto targets was a statutory and binding obligation. He has also said that addressing the challenge of climate change will be the centrepiece of the next Labour Government, so the amendment should be at the heart of what Labour has tried to stand for: taking people out of fuel poverty while meeting our broader global obligations to tackle climate change. It is thus bizarre and somewhat absurd that the Government refuse to endorse the targets in the amendment that successive Labour Ministers have affirmed as Government policy. We are having an &quot;Alice Through the Looking Glass&quot; debate that has been constructed by officials in the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, rather than Labour Ministers or the Labour party.

Our advisers, the Fuel Poverty Advisory Group, said that it was at a loss to understand why the Government wanted to introduce a lower target. I think that in this Bill, as in those that have preceded it, civil servants have been faced with the prospect of targets, but rather than asking how they can meet them, they have asked how they can lower the hurdle. They want to know how they can appear to be meeting Government targets without breaking a sweat. There is a conflict not between different parties in the House, but between the House&#151;it knows the policies that came from the Government&#151;and the civil servants who have the job of writing measures to deliver and implement Government policy. They should not rewrite such policies to give themselves an easier life while leaving everyone else with bigger problems.

That is perfectly fair. By the same token, however, he cannot try to shelter from reducing carbon savings as a result of improving household energy efficiency by saying that other savings would be met and exceeded in other parts of industry.

<b>8 Nov 2004 : Column 626</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>of what could be achieved. However, our record stands in its own right. The 4.2 million tonnes of carbon savings that have been mentioned in our debate represent a significant increase in activity on current levels, and will require a major increase in delivery by the industry. Our latest calculations indicate that that total corresponds to an increase in efficiency of about 19 per cent. compared with 2000 levels.

<p>
<a name="41108-23_para6">
<a name="stpa_181">We expect a significant increase in overall carbon savings from energy efficiency. The energy efficiency action plan details measures to make estimated carbon savings of 12 million tonnes of carbon&#151;a 20 per cent. increase compared with the rough figures in the energy White Paper, which predicted savings of 10 million tonnes of carbon to 2010. I repeat, therefore, that we are genuinely succeeding in meeting our energy efficiency targets, so the Lords amendment is simply unnecessary. There are no grounds for doubting the Government&#039;s commitment and we are getting there by making carbon savings across the board.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41108-23_para7">
<a name="stpa_182">My hon. Friend the Member for Hemel Hempstead (Mr. McWalter) raised the relationship between energy efficiency targets and fuel poverty. He will know that that relationship, about which colleagues and I share serious concern, is not unilateral. We will have an opportunity to debate it later this evening, but I remind him that measures in the energy efficiency action plan play an important part in combating fuel poverty. As he and the House will know, there has been a steady reduction in the number of households in fuel poverty, which we can discuss in more detail later. However, I remind the House that the fuel poverty action plan for England, which will be published later this year, will set out how the Government expect to meet the target of eradicating fuel poverty in vulnerable households by 2010. I therefore invite the House to disagree with the Lords amendment.

<p><a name="st_183"><a name="41108-24_spnew0"><b> Keith Hill: </b> 
 I beg to move, That this House disagrees with the Lords in the said amendment.

 With this we may discuss Lords amendments Nos. 130, 135, 137, 143 and 144 and the Government motions to disagree thereto.
</p>








<p><a name="st_185"><a name="41108-24_spnew1"><b> Keith Hill: </b> 
 It is a matter of great regret to me that the issue of home information packs has remained so contentious between the parties, especially when there has been such broad consensus about the Bill and we have been able to work so well together. That applies not least to work between the Government and the Liberal Democrats in improving the Bill, especially the provisions on empty homes and tenancy deposits.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41108-24_para0">
<a name="stpa_183">The amendments would replace a compulsory home information pack scheme with a voluntary one. The notion of voluntarism is seductive and there was much talk in the other place of the reforms being an unjustified restriction on people&#039;s right to buy and sell homes as they please in a market that functions perfectly well as it is. However, those of us who inhabit the real world know that that is not the case. The home buying and selling process does not function properly. Hundreds of thousands of people every year are put through the wringer because of the inadequacies of the current system. Hundreds of millions of pounds are wasted on transactions that get nowhere. That is money that ordinary, hard-working families can ill afford to lose.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41108-24_para1">
<a name="stpa_184">Three out of 10 sales fall through between offer acceptance and exchange of contracts and more than half of all sales experience some sort of problem during that period. It is no wonder that, whenever they are asked, people say that they are hugely dissatisfied with the current system. Nine out of 10 people said that in one independent survey last year. That is hardly a ringing endorsement for a system that is supposed to work well.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41108-24_para2">
<a name="stpa_185">I do not doubt that some people are doing very nicely out of the system. Every cloud has a silver lining and the abortive costs to consumers from all those failed transactions represent a nice little earner for others. Needless to say, they are not the people for whom the reforms are designed, although many in the industry welcome what we are doing and are keen to get on with it. For them, the reforms are overdue and liberating, enabling them to offer the sort of service that their customers want.

That is because a voluntary HIP system will not achieve the universal acceptance needed to make it work properly. The amendments are really about removing part 5 from the Bill, thus leaving the housing market unreformed and damaging not only to individual buyers and sellers, but to the national economy. Too many people are disadvantaged for us to ignore the problems and settle for the status quo. We are determined to offer consumers a genuine prospect of change. That cannot be done through relying on voluntarism and good will alone.

 The Minister is trying to reverse a Lords amendment and get the House&#039;s approval for that and I am grateful to him for allowing me to ask a question.

<a name="stpa_187">Of course, there are a few agents who have sought to progress on the basis that I have described. They report none of the dire consequences predicted by the Opposition, although they are frustrated that others can reap the benefit of their efforts without having to do very much.

The home information pack will deliver that for home buyers and sellers. We do not need a Bill just to have a voluntary system of home information packs. Sellers and estate agents are free to provide them now if that is what they want. However, despite the evidence that they can greatly reduce the chances of transaction failure, they have not gained a sizeable foothold in the home buying and selling process. There are very good reasons for that.

<a name="41108-24_para6">
<a name="stpa_189">The main problem with a voluntary scheme is chains. If any link in the chain is without a pack, the whole chain would suffer if that were to be the cause of problems. If packs are not made compulsory, one individual who decides to opt out can wreck the process for everyone else. We also know that estate agents in the high street are fiercely competitive, and without compulsion, most of them will be tempted to offer the easy option. Without the level playing field that a compulsory scheme will bring about, most estate agents, even those sympathetic to HIPs would look at what their competitors were

<a name="stpa_190">There have been accusations that the introduction of compulsory HIPs will mean a huge reduction in the number of properties going to the market and that that will result in massive house price inflation. That would be scary if it were true, but it is just the usual scaremongering. The introduction of similar changes in Denmark and New South Wales had no effect on the market. That view is also supported by research commissioned by the UK&#039;s largest estate agency group&#151;the Countrywide group&#151;which suggested that there would be little impact on the number of homes sold. The Countrywide study found that, even if sellers had to pay up front for the pack, 87 per cent. would still offer their home for sale. It concluded that the pack would take out of the market only the people who were not serious about selling anyway.

I do not know which authority the hon.

<a name="stpa_195">The provision of more and better information cannot help but improve the functioning of the housing market, although I do not pretend that it will solve every problem. We accept that our proposals are not a panacea. However, every examination of these problems by Governments over the past 30 years&#151;and there have been a number, in case anyone is labouring under the delusion that these are new problems&#151;has concluded that this would be the most helpful change. My noble Friend Lord Rooker listed some of those conclusions recently in another place. There was the Law Commission report on subject-to-contract agreements, which was laid before Parliament as long ago as January 1975. Then there was the first report of the Conveyancing committee in 1984, better known as the Farrand report. The previous Conservative Government&#039;s report, &quot;Survey of options for simplifying the house purchase process&quot;, published in 1993&#151;I presume under the auspices of the right hon. Member for Suffolk, Coastal (Mr. Gummer), who is in his place&#151;responded to concerns about inefficiencies in the market and concluded that sellers should provide property details at the outset and that conveyancers could reduce the uncertainties of chains by encouraging a greater disclosure of information.

While I am on the subject of interests, let me draw to the attention of the House a couple of interests that have recently come out in support of the Government&#039;s proposals. As a Labour man, I have been reading <i>The Guardian</i> devotedly for more than 40 years, although nowadays, opening my copy often feels like a somewhat masochistic exercise. To my delight, however, I saw that the editorial in the edition of Saturday 6 November contained a most enthusiastic expression of opinion in support of the Government&#039;s proposals on home information packs. And, lo and behold, in <i>The Times</i> of Friday 5 November, the excellent Susan Emmett, its deputy property editor also wrote enthusiastically about the ending of what she 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>8 Nov 2004 : Column 634</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>described as &quot;this tortuous process&quot; of home sale and purchase. If I had more time, I should certainly draw these serious observations to the attention of the House. I shall spare hon. Members that experience now, although I might get the opportunity to do it later. I will simply say that when the muesli and sandals brigade lines up with &quot;The Thunderer&quot; in joint support of the Government&#039;s proposals, those proposals must be taken very seriously.

<a name="41108-25_para2">
<a name="stpa_197">Unlike the Opposition, we have a coherent view of what is needed to create a sustainable housing market. Apart from making an effort to balance the supply and demand for housing responsibly, we want to ensure that the existing stock is maintained and kept in good repair for future generations.

Is there any evidence that the walls have been modified, possibly with cavity fill insulation or external insulating render? What is the floor construction? What types of window and glazing are installed? What is the roof construction? Is there a porch or a conservatory or a basement; if so, how big is it, and can it be closed off from the main part of the house and does it have a separate heating system?

<p>
<a name="41108-25_para6">
<a name="stpa_201">For each storey of the property, the inspector needs to measure the floor area, the room height and the length of wall through which heat can escape either to the outside world or into unheated spaces such as a garage, and the area of windows, doors and rooflights.

<p>
<a name="41108-25_para7">
<a name="stpa_202">I put it to the House that this is already starting to sound like a fairly sophisticated assessment, but the requirement goes much further because the following questions must also be addressed: what type and thickness of insulation is there in any loft space? Is there gas or electricity available in the property or in the street? What ventilation rate can be expected in normal circumstances? What space and water heating systems are installed? What controls are there on those systems?

<a name="stpa_203">This is not just a question of, &quot;Is it a gas central heating boiler or not?&quot; Instead, the requirement is to determine whether it is a standard boiler or a combination boiler, and whether it is a condensing boiler; how efficient it is; and whether there is a timer, a room thermostat or thermostatic radiator valves. That assumes that the system in question is a straightforward gas system, but it can get a lot more complicated if it is not and the means of heating is from other fuels or local heaters rather than central heating.

 The Minister is being very generous in giving way, but I am not sure that he fully understands what is likely to be involved in such a report. I speak as a chartered surveyor. To cite an example that occurs frequently, if a building has tile hanging on the exterior, there should be some insulation between it and the plaster walls on the inside&#151;an older property may have lath and plaster&#151;but it is not possible to tell without removing either some tiles from the exterior or some plaster work from the interior whether there is any suitable insulation material between them.

 It is perfectly clear that the work that has to be carried out for the energy report and inspection is very much akin to that which needs to be carried out for a home condition report. It is, effectively, a medium-level survey. Quite frankly, it is a sight better than the drive-by survey that is so often done by those who carry out surveys and valuations. I accept, of course, that more detailed work is required in some circumstances, but I make the point that we already have a compulsory system of energy assessment, which will require little by way of add-on&#151;in terms of what needs to be looked at or time&#151;to produce a home condition report.

<a name="stpa_206">How long would it take to finalise a stand-alone energy report? We think it would take three to five days&#151;the same time as we expect it to take to get a home condition report and, indeed, assemble the whole pack. So, frankly, the Opposition are offering no time savings. This would also scupper the possibility of first day marketing&#151;another Opposition shibboleth&#151;given that the energy survey has to be made available to enable potential buyers to make comparisons with similar properties.

<p><a name="st_206"><a name="41108-26_spnew1"><b> Mr. Edward Davey: </b> 
 The Minister has spoken in some detail about what would be in such an energy audit, but will he go to the key point? The directive requires that to be done by the time the property is sold, not at the point of marketing. That is the difference between the parties, I believe. We have no objection to energy audit being compulsory and having to be done before sale&#151;that is what the directive requires&#151;but producing a system under which all has to be done before the house is marketed is the genuine big problem here. It will cause so many difficulties in the housing market.
</p>








<p><a name="st_207"><a name="41108-26_spnew2"><b> Keith Hill: </b> 
 It seems to me that the hon. Gentleman really is splitting hairs. The fact of the matter is that the work on the energy report has to be done in any circumstances. It has to be done by the point of sale. Why not? What reason is there not to conduct that exercise at the beginning of the process? After all, presumably nobody knows exactly when the point of sale will be. There is absolutely no reason for that work not to be done.

An energy report is essential, but how much will that cost?

We regard that as a crucial part of our implementation strategy. With the industry, we will closely monitor the dry run and identify any problem areas.

The only people whom he could cite in support of his contentious&#151;I say that advisedly&#151;proposals were people in New South Wales, people in Denmark and Kate Barker, who was doing the Government&#039;s bidding anyway. She was hardly likely to come out and say that they were wrong, when she was commissioned by them to say that they were right. The evidence that the Minister has brought before us is not in any way convincing.

<p><a name="st_209"><a name="41108-26_spnew4"><b> Mr. Kidney: </b> 
 Perhaps my right hon. Friend the Minister was therefore remiss in not repeating, as he did in Committee, that the Consumers Association is a strong supporter of the proposal on the grounds of consumer protection. Is not this proposal necessary to ensure that everybody who buys a home gets the speediest possible service and all the information that they need before signing a cheque for a whacking great price for their house?

 I will address both those points, on speed and the quality of information that people receive, in my brief remarks. The hon. Gentleman&#039;s point on the Consumers Association is a fair one, and as ever, he 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>8 Nov 2004 : Column 639</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>makes a good argument. It is a great pity that the Minister, in the full half an hour for which he spoke, was not able to cite it himself, as it was considerably more persuasive than any that he made.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41108-27_para0">
<a name="stpa_219">The Minister said that the sellers packs are in response to popular demand, and that the market is not working. I am not convinced. The amendment goes to the heart of the contention over sellers packs. What is the position of the other place, and what is the Government&#039;s position? The Government say that everyone will be obliged, by law, despite the run-in period to which the Minister refers, to spend up to &#163;1,000 when selling a house, regardless of the value of that house. In return, they will gain a sellers pack. Let us imagine someone who puts a modest house worth, say, &#163;60,000 or &#163;70,000 on the market, and who must then withdraw it from the market and re-market it some time later. We have no assurance from the Minister that the sellers packs will last any great time. We are told, as the other place debated at some length, that they may be valid for as little as three months. In the scenario that I just described, the person would have to purchase two sellers packs costing up to &#163;2,000 for the sale of a &#163;60,000 house that they might not sell anyway.
</p>








<p><a name="st_211"><a name="41108-27_spnew1"><b> Mr. Gummer: </b> 
 Has not my hon. Friend noticed that the Minister prayed in aid the perfectly reasonable statement that an energy audit of a house is needed? He did not mention, of course, that that would last significantly longer than the pack, and that it had a rigour that meant that it was of use to the purchaser, whereas the sellers packs are so lacking in rigour that they will more often lead purchasers astray than be likely to give the kind of information that they would want?
</p>








<p><a name="st_212"><a name="41108-27_spnew2"><b> Mr. Hayes: </b> 
 As ever, my right hon. Friend makes an apposite point, with his usual skill and charm. The picture, however, is even worse than he paints it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41108-27_para1">
<a name="stpa_220">I suspect&#151;and the Minister has yet to convince us otherwise&#151;that people will commission additional surveys to supplement these inadequate reports. I invite hon. Members to imagine that they are buying a property and are presented with a sellers pack containing basic information, and to imagine their suspicion about the paucity of that information&#151;and their desire, in the case of an older property or one featuring particular difficulties, to obtain information that is as detailed as possible. I suspect that they would arrange their own survey. Not only will there be a sellers pack floating about; for the reasons my right hon. Friend has given, additional surveys may well be commissioned. Indeed, I suspect that the sellers packs will prompt additional surveys rather than replacing surveys.

<p><a name="st_213"><a name="41108-27_spnew3"><b> Mr. Edward Davey: </b> 
 Many lenders have not said that they will rely on home-commissioned reports. Many will have their own valuations carried out. Moreover, it should be noted that house sales fall through mainly because of valuations done by lenders, as opposed to surveys undertaken by buyers.

<p><a name="st_215"><a name="41108-27_spnew5"><b> Sir John Butterfill: </b> 
 Is there not a great danger that some large firms of estate agents that claim they will co-operate will do so because many poorer vendors cannot afford packs up front? The estate agents will say, &quot;We will supply you with a pack, and when we have sold your property, we will knock the cost off the proceeds of sale.&quot; The poor vendors will then be locked into the clutches of estate agents who, in some instances, are quite unscrupulous. They will not be able to change from an estate agent who does not perform properly, because they will have a debt to the agent who supplies the pack.

<p><a name="st_216"><a name="41108-27_spnew6"><b> Mr. Hayes: </b> 
 That is a good point. As was mentioned in Committee, in other countries there are strict regulations&#151;indeed, laws&#151;preventing such a possible conflict of interests. In this country, that does not apply, and the Minister has given no guarantee that it is likely to. I think that there may well be real issues of probity. Such issues were raised in the other place, and they were raised by Conservative and Liberal Democrat spokesmen in Committee. Once again, however, we hear nothing from the Minister, despite the length of his speech.

</p>

<p>
<a name="41108-27_para3">
<a name="stpa_222">Let us imagine another scenario. Someone may want to put his house on the market quickly. He has in mind a potential buyer, perhaps a person he knows in his locality. He will not even be able to begin the transaction until he has commissioned and put into effect a sellers pack. If neither party has demanded that, it is nonsensical to suggest that it is likely to speed up the market and make it more efficient.

We know that by the time they have become compulsory, things will have moved on. We know that there is no cap on the total price of the packs. The Minister&#039;s blithe statement that competition will drive the price down flies in the face of all our experience of buying and selling houses, and of commissioning reports of one sort or another concerning the condition of those houses.

Indeed, the Council of Mortgage Lenders has made clear that it is not prepared to give any such guarantee on behalf of its members. The Minister could not name a single lender that had given an equivalent guarantee. He said that they were all geared up to writing them and were starting businesses in order to roll them out, but

: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. It may have come to your attention that the timetabling of the debate on that group of amendments was such that not only did no Back Bencher on either side of the House have the opportunity to speak, but even the Opposition Front-Bench spokesmen were obliged to curtail their speeches on probably the most contentious clause&#151;indeed, possibly the only contentious clause&#151;in the Bill. Perhaps you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, could rule on that, and those in another place may wish to take it into account when the Bill goes back to them.

I do not propose to dwell on those amendments at great length, as there seems to be a high level of agreement about the proposals in them&#151;although I shall, of course, be happy to return to them if they are raised by other speakers.

<a name="stpa_237">Amendments (a) to (d) in lieu of Lords amendment No. 140 would ensure that adequate safeguards are placed on the register of home condition reports. If the House will forgive me, I shall say a few words about those, because this is new matter for this Chamber.

<a name="41108-29_para2">
<a name="stpa_238">It will be vital for the public to have confidence in the new home condition reports, and a register for home condition reports will help to ensure that. The register will prevent unscrupulous people from tampering with home condition reports once written, because paper copies can be compared with the register. The register will also ensure that the home condition report can be prepared only by a member of the certification scheme. Someone fraudulently passing himself off as a home inspector &#151;or, indeed, a former home inspector who has been expelled from the scheme&#151;will be unable to register a home condition report.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41108-29_para3">
<a name="stpa_239">To guard against the possibility of a seller &quot;shopping around&quot; and obtaining a number of home condition reports from different home inspectors, we propose that the home information pack include copies of all home condition reports obtained on the property within the previous 12 months. The register would ensure that that requirement could be enforced. It would be an important resource to help the certification schemes ensure the competence and probity of home inspectors, and that the inspectors were properly insured. Taken together with the checks and balances already in the Bill, this should enable buyers and sellers to rely with confidence on home condition reports.

<a name="stpa_240">Provision is already made for such a register in clause 145(5)(d). The purpose of the amendments is to ensure that that register is kept in a proper way. Amendments (a) and (b) to Lords amendment No. 140 strengthen the provisions for approved certification schemes for home inspectors producing home condition reports. The scheme is required to make provision for the registration of all home condition reports. That will greatly enhance the ability of consumers and others to use the home condition report and to trust it, for the reasons that I shall explain.

<a name="stpa_241">Certification schemes would be approved by the Secretary of State. They are likely to be run on a not-for-profit basis by private companies owned by stakeholders.

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="41108-29_para6">
<a name="stpa_242">Amendment (c) inserts after clause 145 a new clause that will ensure that the Secretary of State can make regulations allowing any private keeper of the register to restrict access to it to certain limited and prescribed circumstances and purposes. It requires that the onward use of information obtained from the register should respect privacy considerations, and that as far as possible, any conditions imposed by the seller on the use of information in a home information pack, in accordance with clause 139, be respected. It also makes the unauthorised disclosure of information a criminal offence in order to deal with someone who, for example, sells details to a double glazing salesman, or the selling of information on the home of a public figure to a newspaper. Finally, the amendment allows the Secretary of State to maintain the register if the private operator proves unsatisfactory.

: Can the Minister say in what form the register be kept? Will it be kept electronically and who will have access to those records? Will the Government have access to them? There is the suspicion that they could use home condition reports to do the next council tax revaluation for nothing. How will the Data Protection Act 1998 protect people&#039;s privacy, given that there will be a lot of very private information in the packs?

<p><a name="st_231"><a name="41108-29_spnew6"><b> Keith Hill: </b> 
 It is precisely because I anticipated that the hon. Gentleman&#151;whom I know well, and with whom I have jousted on many previous occasions&#151;would take an interest in these matters that my speech includes what I hope will prove persuasive answers to those issues.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41108-29_para7">
<a name="stpa_243">Dealing with these important issues administratively when approving a certification scheme involves doing so behind closed doors, but we feel that it is in everyone&#039;s interest that they be dealt with openly and on the record through regulations. The amendment should ensure that the register is kept in a proper way, while respecting privacy considerations. An electronic register of home inspectors and of home condition report data is essential to ensure authenticity and trust. I should emphasise that access to the register will not be a free-for-all and will be strictly controlled.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41108-29_para8">
<a name="stpa_244">We envisage that access will be available to the seller and potential buyers, and to their professional advisers and agents, so that they can, for example, check the integrity of copies of home condition reports supplied to them. We also intend to enable access to certification schemes in order to assist with their operation, and to ensure that proper standards are maintained. We envisage that certification schemes will use the register of home condition reports to monitor, or to undertake, spot checks on the work of home inspectors to ensure that they maintain the required standards.

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>8 Nov 2004 : Column 648</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>lenders can use the home condition report as a source of information from which a valuation can be derived, without the need for a separate valuation inspection.

</p>








<p><a name="st_232"><a name="41108-29_spnew7"><b> Matthew Green: </b> 
 Much of what the Minister is saying is welcome, but I am concerned about what happens when someone chooses to market their property without going through an estate agent, as they have the right to do. When they produce their pack, how will they check who has access to such information? Will a prospective buyer gain access to the register? If so, will they access such information only in respect of the property in question, or will they be able to peruse information on all properties online, simply because they have said that they are interested in buying a particular property? I am slightly confused as to how the process will work.
</p>








<p><a name="st_233"><a name="41108-29_spnew8"><b> Keith Hill: </b> 
 It will be for the seller or their agent to make the home condition report available to the potential purchaser. Provision will be made to ensure that access to the report is restricted to those potential buyers to whom the would-be seller wishes such information to be made available. If the hon. Gentleman will allow me, I shall spell the situation out in a little more detail in due course.

<a name="stpa_246">The expected content of the home condition report has already been discussed in detail with lenders to ensure that it incorporates the data that they will need to create valuations, using automatic valuation models or other innovative valuation methods.

<a name="41108-29_para11">
<a name="stpa_247">I should point out that no final decision has been taken as to whether one of the proscribed uses of information from the register will be as a source of statistics on the condition of the nation&#039;s housing stock and its energy efficiency. If such a use were permitted, it would be subject to data protection and privacy considerations. Amendment (c) provides for regulations that restrict access to prescribed circumstances or purposes, and to prescribed descriptions of persons. We intend that access will not be indiscriminately available. For example, a potential buyer would need to have the HCR reference number in order to access a home condition report on the register. That reference number would be available only from the seller or their agent, which will ensure that data on the register is not available to any person who cannot satisfy the seller or their agent that he is a bona fide potential buyer.

<p><a name="st_234"><a name="41108-30_spnew0"><b> Mr. Clifton-Brown: </b> 
 The Minister has virtually admitted that what I said to him a few minutes ago is true. He says that the Government will use this information for statistical purposes. Is it not true that that will enable them to use it to obtain a revaluation of the entire nation&#039;s housing stock at very little cost, and without involving valuers?
</p>








<p><a name="st_235"><a name="41108-30_spnew1"><b> Keith Hill: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman is getting over-excited about a possibility that the Government are not contemplating. We have made no final decisions on this matter, but we do take into account the possibility that 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>8 Nov 2004 : Column 649</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>the register could be of value in making broad assessments of the condition of the nation&#039;s housing stock. The hon. Gentleman takes a close interest in this issue, and he surely will not regard such an approach as disadvantageous, should we decide to pursue it. However, this is a matter for consultation and open discussion in due course.
</p>








<p><a name="st_236"><a name="41108-30_spnew2"><b> Mr. Kidney: </b> 
 I hope that my right hon. Friend finds my intervention helpful. Is it the Government&#039;s intention to make it a criminal offence for people to disclose information from the register that should not be disclosed, and is that the purport of subsection (7) of amendment (c)? Moreover, is there a typographical error in that subsection? It states:
</p>

<p>
<a name="41108-30_para0">
<a name="stpa_248">

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_41">&quot;A person who contravenes subsection (3) is guilty of an offence&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="41108-30_para1">
<a name="stpa_249">yet subsection (3) deals with the paying of a fee in order to include a report on the register. In fact, it is the contravening of subsection (4) that would constitute a criminal offence.
</p>








<p><a name="st_237"><a name="41108-30_spnew3"><b> Keith Hill: </b> 
 Can the House be surprised that I describe my hon. Friend as my guru in these matters? Not only has he anticipated exactly the point that I was about to make on disclosure, but he has also made a typically shrewd point about a typographical error in the amendment. I can confirm that there is indeed such an error, and it will of course be put right. I am most grateful to him for drawing the House&#039;s attention to it, and I am sure that he is grateful for my immediate and positive response. That certainly demonstrates the listening character of this Government and this Minister.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41108-30_para2">
<a name="stpa_250">I was about to say that any disclosure, except as provided for in regulations, would be taken very seriously and would amount to a criminal offence. My hon. Friend the Member for Stafford (Mr. Kidney) is absolutely right about that. Anyone committing such an offence, for instance, by passing on data from home condition reports to a building firm or to the proverbial double glazing salesman, would be liable on summary conviction to a fine of up to level 5 on the standard scale&#151;currently a maximum of &#163;5,000. That is equivalent to the penalty for offences relating to infringing the Data Protection Act 1998. The Home Office has confirmed that criminal offences for the unlawful disclosure of information are the norm in legislation and has approved this particular offence.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41108-30_para3">
<a name="stpa_251">Clause 153 provides that the Secretary of State may make grants towards expenditure incurred in connection with the development of proposals for the contents of home information packs or of potential home inspector certification schemes. Amendment (d) is consequential on the introduction of the new clause and provides that the Secretary of State may also make grants towards expenditure incurred in the development of a register of home condition reports.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41108-30_para4">
<a name="stpa_252">There are legitimate sensitivities surrounding disclosure of information&#151;I fully concede that to the hon. Member for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown)&#151;we will not know for some time which certification scheme will get approval. We will need to begin work on developing the technology for a secure register of home condition reports as soon as possible in order to address 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>8 Nov 2004 : Column 650</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>those issues, and that work will require a grant. We also need to ensure that the register is not specific to a particular certification scheme so that it is possible for the keeper of the register to be changed, if necessary, without resulting in practical difficulties.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41108-30_para5">
<a name="stpa_253">It is important that consumers and lenders can trust the home condition report and be able to rely on it with confidence. Together with the provisions for home inspectors&#039; certification schemes already in the Bill, these amendments should provide that confidence. In moving these Government amendments, I draw the House&#039;s attention to my support for amendments Nos. 142, 145, 147, 148 and 149.


</p>








<p><a name="st_238"><a name="41108-30_spnew4"><b> Mr. Syms: </b> 
 This is an important part of the Bill; it is just a pity that we are here at five minutes to midnight debating such important detail. I wish to put a number of questions to the Minister.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41108-30_para6">
<a name="stpa_254">The proposal to have a register of approved surveyors or inspectors is sensible because people can check the register to see whether the person is qualified. One of the major concerns in Committee was whether the supply of surveyors or inspectors would be sufficient, so having a register also seems reasonable on those grounds. My question is whether the register will be broken down into regions or counties. There could be a surplus of surveyors in the north-west, with other areas having a deficiency, which could affect the ability to produce home condition reports within a reasonable time frame. It would be helpful to have a breakdown of surveyors and inspectors, including where they live.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41108-30_para7">
<a name="stpa_255">The Minister made several points about the home condition report&#151;for example, whether it should have a reference number or be put on the internet and what the controls should be. My hon. Friends have raised a number of concerns about those issues. If the information is too restricted, there is a danger of missing some opportunities. Will the register of home condition reports be made available to those who are registered inspectors or surveyors? If a home has been sold four times and had four home condition reports, the logical starting point for a surveyor would be to look at the last four reports on the home to see whether there had been any problems in the past. It seems silly to start from a blank sheet of paper when, first, there is a shortage of surveyors and, secondly, the home to be inspected has already been inspected many times.
</p>








<p><a name="st_239"><a name="41108-30_spnew5"><b> Mr. Clifton-Brown: </b> 
 May I suggest a simple way around that problem? My hon. Friend might want to press the Minister on what I am saying. If the home condition report and home seller&#039;s pack become the property of the purchaser on completion of the purchase, the purchaser will then have full property rights and would be well advised if he wanted to sell the house subsequently to make the information available to his surveyor because it would reduce the cost of producing a new home condition report.
</p>








<p><a name="st_240"><a name="41108-30_spnew6"><b> Mr. Syms: </b> 
 I thank my hon. Friend for making that reasonable suggestion. I am sure that what he says will be heard. When a house is modern and has been sold a number of times, it would be illogical to deny information about it to registered surveyors or inspectors.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>8 Nov 2004 : Column 651</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="41108-30_para8">
<a name="stpa_256">The Minister also referred to lenders having the information. The standards of building on estates in certain parts of the country are not particularly good, so is it not a matter of concern that, if lenders have access to the register, they might blight certain estates? Accusations are already sometimes made about lenders, particularly when certain areas have a bad reputation. How free will access to lenders be? Will they be able to look at individual reports or at the register in its entirety? I suspect that many lenders will build up a picture, which could lead to decisions being taken on the basis of the postcode. That could be a problem for some people. How will the proposals operate in practice? It is important to get the balance right between having reasonable access so that we do not always have to reinvent the wheel and protecting the privacy of the homeowner or home seller. As the Minister said, we do not want the double glazing salesman or building company to have full access to the information.

<a name="stpa_257">If the Minister has enough time, will he say more about whether the insurance scheme for home condition reports is in place? I know that concerns have been raised about that. Insurers are also worried about problems of flooding, underground drainage and so forth. Has a final decision been taken about what type of report will be used for the register? We have only a few more minutes left, so I will end there to allow other hon. Members to ask a few questions.

 I will be brief. We broadly welcome the amendments in the group, including the Government amendments, which go a long way towards dealing with the concerns of the House of Lords, but I want to ask the Minister a couple of questions about the administration and security of the system.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41108-30_para10">
<a name="stpa_258">From what the Minister described, it would appear that, under the system, people producing the reports could post them on to a register via a remote server somewhere. The difficulty arises in controlling access to it. The Minister says that buyers will be given a unique number for a particular property, allowing them to look into that single property alone. Even with a good random generator of numbers, given the sheer number of properties available on the market at any one time, it would be possible for someone to guess the numbers and be able to look at other properties. That will be a problem if the register is accessed through a single number, however large. In reality, there are likely to be patterns in the numbers; they are not purely random. From what the Minister described, it would be possible for people to view other properties.

<a name="41108-30_para11">
<a name="stpa_259">The question of security raises another potential concern. As we saw last week, online banks can have problems with unauthorised access to some of their systems. Can the Minister be confident that no one could hack into the system holding the details on, say, the house that the Prime Minister has just purchased and sell the information or publish it on the internet? Can the system be secure at the same time as being flexible enough to allow access to all the users who need it? The Minister seems to have much more confidence in the ability to set up a foolproof system than I have.

 I shall take one minute to make a few key points and to enable the Minister to reply to the important points that have been made.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41108-31_para0">
<a name="stpa_261">First, access to information is critical. One of the key aspects is that, if it is possible for unauthorised people to access the information, the home information packs could become a burglars&#039; charter. I hope that the Minister will reassure us that hackers will not be able to access the information if it is stored electronically. Given the record of such systems, I do not know how he can do that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41108-31_para1">
<a name="stpa_262">Secondly and most importantly, many inspectors will be needed. Inevitably, some of those inspectors will be trained at very short notice and mistakes will therefore be made. It is important that an adequate insurance scheme is in place. People must also have the ability to sue on the reports if they prove to be incorrect. I hope that the Minister can tell us whether that will be the case, because otherwise the reports will have zero value.
</p>








<p><a name="st_243"><a name="41108-31_spnew1"><b> Keith Hill: </b> 
 I shall take the issues raised in reverse order. The hon. Member for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown) asked about insurance against error in the reports. I may say that an indemnity scheme has always been part and parcel of the proposition. The indemnity scheme will apply to home inspectors as it already does to conveyancers, and we think that it is a good idea to extend it to estate agents, through the estate agents redress scheme, which has been approved by the other place and has received a general welcome for both particular and general reasons. The monitoring of home condition reports will also allow judgments to be made about the performance of individual inspectors.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41108-31_para2">
<a name="stpa_263">The hon. Gentleman raised the hoary old issue of access to information and the burglars&#039; charter. We have gone over that matter on many occasions, but I shall reiterate&#151;given that the allegation always seems to creep into adverse media coverage&#151;that the home condition reports will contain no plans of the property, no information about security devices or alarms and no information about safes. We do not believe that the reports will remotely begin to add up to what he described as a burglars&#039; charter.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41108-31_para3">
<a name="stpa_264">The hon. Member for Ludlow (Matthew Green) raised several points and I am grateful for his qualified support. He asked about the operation of the electronic system and whether someone could hack into its numeration arrangements. That is a valid issue. We need to get the details right, and that is why we would do a great deal of work with all the relevant partners to ensure that that could not happen.
</p>

<a name="41108-31_para4">
<a name="stpa_265">The hon. Member for Poole (Mr. Syms) raised several issues. He asked whether lenders will be able to look at individual reports, and the answer is yes.

</p>

<p>
<a name="41108-31_para5">
<a name="stpa_266">Yes, it is me again. The new clause proposed by the amendment would require the Secretary of State to ensure that, by 2016, all existing social housing stock should, as far as is reasonably practicable, achieve a SAP rating&#151;an energy rating under the standard assessment procedure&#151;of no lower than 65, which would amount to a change in the decent homes standard. I refer to that point because material circulated among Members recognises that the decent homes standard is the Government&#039;s vehicle for the delivery of heating and thermal comfort.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41108-31_para6">
<a name="stpa_267">I remind Members that the decent homes standard aims to tackle the worst problems. It triggers action; it is not a standard to which work is done. I also remind Members, as I have on earlier occasions, that when the Govt took office in 1997 no fewer than 2.2 million social homes were non-decent and there was a &#163;19 billion backlog of work. The work we have done, and are continuing to do, tackles a range of problems that affect housing&#151;leaking roofs and mould and damp in kitchens and bathrooms that have not been touched since the homes were built, which in some cases was the 1930s. Our work is having a huge impact on the lives of some of the most vulnerable members of society who have lived, or who currently live, in non-decent homes. I said &quot;have lived&quot; because, since 1997, we have reduced by 1 million the number of homes below the decent homes standard&#151;a fact that we celebrate and rejoice in on the Labour Benches.

<a name="stpa_273">Amendment No. 190 picks up on one aspect of the decent homes programme&#151;improving the thermal efficiency of homes and, in doing so, contributing to reducing fuel poverty and thereby increasing energy efficiency. We take seriously our responsibilities for alleviating fuel poverty. However, I remind the House that the decent homes programme has four elements: meeting the current statutory minimum standard for housing; achieving a reasonable state of repair; ensuring reasonably modern facilities and services; and providing a reasonable degree of thermal comfort. The programme therefore aims to tackle a wide range of problems and to prioritise the worst homes, of which there remain 1.4 million; including a SAP rating of 65 would add a further 1.7 million households, of which, as I shall demonstrate, only 120,000 would be fuel-poor.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41108-31_para13">
<a name="stpa_274">We cannot seek a policy of perfection in regard to one of the four elements of the decent homes standard&#151;thermal comfort&#151;and disregard our obligations to tenants to make more basic improvements. For those people who live in non-decent homes, works such as mending a leaking roof, replacing rotten windows and tackling unsafe electrics matter more than focusing purely on energy efficiency.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41108-31_para14">
<a name="stpa_275">Before I continue, it would be useful to explain to the House what fuel poverty is and how many people it affects. Fuel poverty occurs where those in a household spend more than 10 per cent. of their income on heating their home to an adequate standard of warmth. That is generally defined as 21&#176; C in the living room and 18&#176; C in the other occupied rooms. Fuel poverty affects 350,000 social sector households in England. Of course, the Lords amendment applies to the social sector. About 120,000 of those households meet the decent homes standard and about 230,000 households are currently non-decent homes.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41108-31_para15">
<a name="stpa_276">We expect that the work done to those 230,000 social homes under the decent homes programme will bring most of those households out of fuel poverty. The work done by authorities is expected to raise the thermal efficiency of those homes well above the minimum that triggers action. The guidance that we have issued recommends that, when loft insulation is fitted, authorities should take the opportunity to improve energy efficiency and install it to a much greater depth than the 50 mm that triggers action and that, when new heating is installed or systems replaced, landlords should install energy efficient boilers where possible. Energy efficient boilers have a SEDBUK&#151;seasonal efficiency of domestic boilers in the UK&#151;A to C rating. We also recommend that landlords take advantage of DEFRA and DTI sponsored programmes that require suppliers of gas and electricity to achieve energy efficiency targets by helping landlords to take up energy efficiency measures.

<br>&nbsp;<br>that he says will be raised to the decent homes standard will necessarily reach the SAP 65 rating? Many of those homes may well have to be revisited in future to get them up to that level. In fact, we are talking about guidelines, so some councils&#151;perhaps those facing financial pressures&#151;will not go the whole hog; they will do just enough to meet the decent homes standard without hitting the higher rating.
</p>








<p><a name="st_252"><a name="41108-32_spnew3"><b> Keith Hill: </b> 
 Unusually for the hon. Gentleman, he is labouring under a misapprehension. He is usually very precise. In fact, very few of those 230,000 homes are likely to reach the SAP 65 level. That is exactly why I explained that the requirement for SAP 65 would not only embrace the 1.5 million so-called non-decent homes that we propose to tackle using the decent homes programme up to 2010, but entail a return to a further 1.7 million social sector homes that do not attain the SAP 65 level. The important thing to remember is that fuel poverty relates to the percentage of income that is necessarily expended to achieve a decent level of thermal comfort.

<a name="time_13">

</p>

<p>
<a name="41108-32_para0">
<a name="stpa_277">Many householders who live in homes that do not have a SAP rating of 65 are not in fuel poverty because they do not spend a sufficiently high proportion of their incomes on the issue. It is terribly important for all hon. Members to bear it in mind that fuel poverty is a factor of not the physical fabric of a property, but the relationship between thermal comfort, or the need to compensate for heating loss, and income. The truth is that only a small proportion of those in fuel poverty live in social homes that are below the decent homes standard&#151;about 120,000. Many people who live in fuel poverty might live in homes with a SAP 65 rating, which is why our fundamental argument is that it would be an immense over-reaction to insist on the SAP 65 standard across the board to lift households out of fuel poverty. It would be like using a JCB to smash a nut.
</p>








<p><a name="st_253"><a name="41108-32_spnew4"><b> Brian White: </b> 
 Tackling fuel poverty is a key objective for the Government. However, they have several other objectives, such as reducing CO <sub>2</sub>  emissions, which SAP 65 would help us to achieve. The Minister is missing the interaction between the objectives.
</p>








<p><a name="st_254"><a name="41108-32_spnew5"><b> Keith Hill: </b> 
 I disagree with my hon. Friend, although I do not often do that because we have a good relationship both inside and outside the Chamber. We have dealt with such matters already. I have demonstrated that the Government are clearly committed to, and on route towards, achieving their carbon saving and energy efficiency targets. We mislead ourselves if we confuse energy efficiency and fuel poverty because they are different issues that we must separate in our minds.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41108-32_para1">
<a name="stpa_278">The Government&#039;s argument is that the small numbers of households in fuel poverty should be dealt with individually. Interestingly, such households are characteristically not made up of senior citizens. They tend to be made up of people on low incomes living in three-bedroom houses. It is clearly possible to devise 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>8 Nov 2004 : Column 656</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>strategies to deal with such individuals. Indeed, the fuel poverty action plan has been designed to ensure that fuel poverty will be eliminated in such vulnerable households by the year 2010, and a report is due later this year. For all those reasons, although I take my hon. Friend&#039;s point about energy efficiency on board, we need to focus carefully on the precise sources of fuel poverty.
</p>








<p><a name="st_255"><a name="41108-32_spnew6"><b> David Taylor: </b> 
 My right hon. Friend is one of the more lucid, rational, thoughtful and, especially, numerate Ministers&#151;he is no doubt set for further promotion. Does he agree that if the only available options to address local authority tenants facing fuel poverty are stock transfer, the private finance initiative and arm&#039;s-length management organisations, all of which are more expensive than conventional local authority methods of raising houses to a decent standard, fewer houses will be tackled with the available pot of money than would have been the case if he had delivered option four, as he told the fringe meetings at the party conference that he would?

<a name="stpa_283">Amendment No. 190 wants us to tackle the problem of having around 120,000 households in fuel poverty in the social sector by increasing by 1.7 million the number of homes that would need work in accordance with the decent homes standard. Those homes are 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>8 Nov 2004 : Column 657</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>currently decent but below SAP 65, and they would more than double the number that we still have to tackle under the programme. The amendment would require the minimum standard that triggers action to be SAP 65. That would cost&#151;I say this in all earnestness&#151;&#163;28.5 billion to solve a problem in 120,000 homes. That is roughly equivalent to 8p on the basic rate of tax. This is more than a sledgehammer to crack a nut. The amendment is a JCB. Indeed, a JCB might be the only solution for many homes if all social housing is to achieve a SAP 65 rating. An estimated 400,000 homes could not be brought up to that level of energy efficiency. For those, demolition and rebuilding would be the only solution at a cost of more than &#163;20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;billion, excluding any costs of re-acquiring property.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41108-32_para7">
<a name="stpa_284">For the homes that could achieve SAP 65, some would require additional work over and above basic measures to improve their energy efficiency. For example, we would have to carry out insulation to the solid walls. That would cost &#163;6 billion. Then there are those homes that would not be in the decent homes programme since they already meet the current levels of thermal comfort required. Work in those homes would include replacing boilers that are still functioning, modifying electric immersion heaters and installing double-glazing, which would cost &#163;2.5 billion.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41108-32_para8">
<a name="stpa_285">The grand total comes to an astonishing &#163;28.5 billion. Demolition and rebuilding would cost more than &#163;20&nbsp;billion. Tackling hard-to-heat homes would cost &#163;6&nbsp;billion. To cover homes that do not currently come under the decent homes programme would cost &#163;2.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;billion. That extra expenditure would cripple the budgets of local authorities and many housing associations. It would mean that work on wider regeneration work, including security measures and environmental improvements, would go undone. Those things matter to tenants, and how would we explain to them that those priorities would no longer be addressed? The new target would amount to moving the goalposts for social landlords who have been working hard to achieve the decent homes standard. Planned programmes of works would need to be rescheduled, which would disrupt not only landlords but tenants.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41108-32_para9">
<a name="stpa_286">Even if it were possible to achieve SAP 65 for the social sector at a reasonable cost, it would still be unwise to fix that in statute. The standard assessment procedure measures energy efficiency on an index calculated by considering the annual space and water-heating costs for a standard heating regime. It is a constantly evolving mechanism that will change in response to new energy efficiency technology and changes in fuel prices. We have a huge range of social housing stock in this country, and a SAP target of 65 would be expensive, unachievable and inflexible. We prefer action on achievable targets to aspirations that, frankly, have not been properly thought through. We want to deliver on our decent homes programme by 2010, not see it jeopardised and perhaps put back to 2016. Above all, we cannot choose one part of our decent homes programme and promote it above everything else. We have a duty to tenants, and must provide them with the improvements in their living conditions that really matter to them. While energy efficiency may be the primary concern for some people, it is certainly not the primary concern for all social sector tenants. Our efforts in this area should 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>8 Nov 2004 : Column 658</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>remain focused on delivering the essential work needed to make all homes decent, and in doing so we must always maximise energy efficiency and promote the alleviation of fuel poverty. However, to put those two concerns above all else would be unrealistic.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41108-32_para10">
<a name="stpa_287">In conclusion, a target of SAP 65 for all social sector homes would cost the taxpayer about &#163;28.5 billion. The Government are committed to dealing with fuel poverty and to improving energy efficiency. However, we are not committed to doing that in an impractical and ludicrously expensive manner, as the amendment suggests. It is for those reasons that I invite the House to disagree with the amendment.

<a name="stpa_289">The amendment demands that all social housing should meet the standard assessment procedure rating of 65. That is the measure of energy efficiency in homes that is agreed by the Government and recognised elsewhere. There are two aspects to this debate: one concerns carbon emission targets, and the other fuel poverty. Both were well aired in the other place. Perhaps I may beg your indulgence for a second, Mr. Deputy Speaker, to pay tribute to Baroness Hanham and Lord Hanningfield, who did much good work there, together with noble colleagues from other parties. I single them out for particular praise because they did their very best to improve the worst aspects of the Bill. Lord Hanningfield pointed out that the Government had a manifesto commitment to decrease CO <sub>2</sub>  emissions by 20&nbsp;per cent. by 2010 based on 1990 levels; that from 1990 to 1997 carbon emissions decreased by 13.1 megatonnes of carbon; and that since this Government were elected in 1997 they have remained virtually static, while in three of the past four years they have increased. In August this year, the Environmental Audit Committee reported that the Government&#039;s latest forecasts indicate that carbon emissions by 2010 will be 8 megatonnes more than the target&#151;a 25 per cent. shortfall.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41108-33_para2">
<a name="stpa_290">The amendment calls for a 20 per cent. improvement in domestic energy efficiency by 2010, based on 2000 levels. That is equivalent to the saving of 5 megatonnes of carbon emissions from the domestic sector by 2010 that the Government originally stated as their intention and is the target that they assured the public no fewer than 15 times would be set as the energy efficiency aim under the Sustainable Energy Act 2003. A range of Ministers assured both Houses that that would be the case, until April this year when they reduced it to 16 per cent.&#151;a saving of 4.2 megatonnes.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41108-33_para3">
<a name="stpa_291">The original target is supported by the Energy Saving Trust, the Government&#039;s official adviser on energy efficiency; the Cabinet Office performance and innovation unit, the Government&#039;s advisers on energy policy; and the Sustainable Development Commission, the Government&#039;s advisers on sustainable development. It is also supported by a large number of Members on both sides of the House, particularly on the Labour Benches, who have taken fuel poverty, carbon emissions, the relationship between the two and the need for better energy conservation very seriously, campaigned on it, spoken on it and made their position patently clear, whereas the Government&#039;s position on this is not at all clear. There are fundamental contradictions between what they have said in the past and what they are saying now; but even more than that, there are&#151;heaven forbid&#151;contradictions between what different Ministers say about it.

Other Ministers have made it clear that the only way in which the Government will achieve their aim is by adopting a different policy&#151;that which is outlined in the amendment.

<a name="stpa_302">The latest figures suggest that more than 1.141 million homes fall below standards on the ground of thermal insulation. The current policy is to bring those homes up to a decent homes standard, which will not necessarily mean that they escape fuel poverty. It is not good enough for the Minister to say that the Government are committed to decent homes. Of course it is right to improve the stock of social housing in all sorts of ways but it is unacceptable not to tackle the fundamental issue of insulation and fuel poverty as part of that, in order to deliver the Government&#039;s stated aims.

<p>
<a name="41108-33_para16">
<a name="stpa_304">The gist of the Government&#039;s case is straightforward. They have effectively reneged on their original commitment. They have lowered the bar because they know that it will be difficult to reach the standard that the amendment demands of them. The excuse that the Minister gave initially in his contribution was that doing so would mean taking their eye off the ball for other aspects of the decent homes standard. However, he gave 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>8 Nov 2004 : Column 661</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>the game away at the end of his speech by saying that it was all about cost. He thus confirmed what was said in&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Lords. In answering the proponents of the amendment, Lord Bassam said that it would focus on one aspect of decent homes to the detriment of others. He said:

<a name="41108-33_para17">
<a name="stpa_305">

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_49">&quot;That is what the amendment would do, but at a potentially huge cost&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. bringing all social housing up to a standard of SAP 65 could add &#163;3 billion to &#163;5 billion to the cost of the decent homes programme.&quot;&#151;[<i>Official Report, House of Lords</i>, 3 November 2004; Vol. 666, c. 379.]</p>

</p>

<p>
<a name="41108-33_para18">
<a name="stpa_306">It is not as simple as that, however, because failing to support this amendment will waste vast sums of public money. The Government will ensure that works are undertaken on all social homes to bring them up to the decent homes standard, but they will still leave a large number of people in fuel poverty. The law will require them to address that issue at some stage in the future and to spend additional sums to take those people out of fuel poverty. The truth of the matter is that this is a false economy. If the Government were to get this right now, they could fulfil their legal responsibilities in one coherent and consistent programme. Instead, however, what Lord Hanningfield has described as the &quot;double visit&quot; to the project will cost more and be extremely wasteful. The Government&#039;s argument about money does not stack up, given that they have acknowledged their overriding legal duty in this regard.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41108-33_para19">
<a name="stpa_307">More than that, I disagree fundamentally with the Minister on this. This is a very important issue indeed, and not to address fuel poverty would be a dreadful shame that the Minister and the Government would have to carry.

However, fuel prices are rising, and they are likely to continue to do so. Many people in the House, myself included, do not think that that is&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;necessarily a bad thing, from an environmental viewpoint. However, by definition, it causes a problem, because if things stand still more people will be put into the fuel-poor categories. The figures that the Minister accounted for&#151;the 120,000, the 240,000 and the 1.1&nbsp;million people&#151;could all increase.

The Minister will be Minister for Housing and Planning when more people enter fuel poverty. Rather than taking an aggressive attitude against the amendment, which is well-meaning and has good practical thoughts behind it, and setting himself dogmatically against it, he should perhaps have moved some way towards meeting it, as it is clear that increasing the SAP rating of properties where it is relatively practical to do so does, as the Minister for the Environment and Agri-environment has made clear, bring people out of fuel poverty.

By and large, we have taken a twin-pronged approach to the eradication of fuel poverty: one through the warm front programme and the other through income support measures, involving the Chancellor and the Treasury. However, it is absolutely right to say, as the hon. Member for Ludlow (Matthew Green) did, that the viability of that intervention in income support will be put seriously to the test.

<a name="41108-34_para10">
<a name="stpa_318">We have seen the end of the era of low energy prices; we are knee-deep in an era of dramatically increasing energy prices. None of us should kid ourselves that it will come cheap to the Government to intervene to pay people to throw money out of poorly insulated properties for no gain at all. There will certainly be a negative consequence of massively undermining our commitments to carbon reduction targets. The best way to tackle this is to address the structural condition of Britain&#039;s housing. As other Members have mentioned, on 19 April this year my hon. Friend the Minister for the Environment and Agri-environment pointed out that the best way to do that would be to set a minimum SAP rating of 65 for all social housing.

But we see in subsequent clauses that we will not go down that path either. We could, as my hon. Friend the Member for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor) pointed out, give a fresh remit to local authorities for a new era of council house building, which is by far the cheapest and most effective way of intervening in the social sector. As yet, however, none of the promises of a level playing field in respect of local authority housing are in the framework for delivery by either the Minister for Housing and Planning or other Ministers.

 I had not intended to contribute to the debate today, and only the challenge from the hon.&nbsp;Member for South Holland and The Deepings (Mr. Hayes) made me feel that it was worth saying something in support of the Government&#039;s position and opposing that of the other place.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41108-34_para14">
<a name="stpa_322">It seems to me that the Conservative party has completely misrepresented some of the basis of tackling fuel poverty and of the intent of the decent homes strategy, for two reasons in particular. First, we needed a decent homes strategy because of the legacy of disrepair that we inherited when the Conservative party left government. I was a council leader in one of the areas with some of the worst social housing in the country, and I recall how those homes were starved of funds, the price paid in terms of the discomfort of people living there and the real hardship of thousands of families in social housing that was on the skids. We needed a decent homes strategy so that social housing could approach a reasonable level after all that disrepair.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41108-34_para15">
<a name="stpa_323">Like so many things that the Government have done, that strategy might not seem the most wonderfully heroic new socialist dawn. Given what we took over, however, it was a supremely ambitious programme, and extremely difficult to deliver. Once it is achieved, which I am sure it will be, the Government will have every right to be extremely proud of it. The only way to achieve our decent homes target is to balance the key measures that make homes unpleasant and unfit for people to live in. That is a question not just of technical standards but of what happens to the people who live in those properties and what they need.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41108-34_para16">
<a name="stpa_324">Secondly, when we came into power we were confronted by massive fuel poverty, particularly among the old. A key factor in fuel poverty, which the Minister addressed and the hon. Member for South Holland and The Deepings did not, was income. That is why we introduced the winter fuel allowance, which the Conservative party opposed bitterly. It ill behoves a party that so opposed the winter fuel allowance to preach to anyone about fuel poverty. The reason why it is residual groups such as single people on low incomes, households with families or people with disabilities who are in fuel poverty is that we dealt with fuel poverty among pensioners with the winter fuel allowance, which has been increased year on year.

 I want to make three brief points.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41108-35_para0">
<a name="stpa_327">I am concerned about fuel poverty. My right hon. Friend the Minister said that 120,000 people were in that position, but I believe that a 10 per cent. fuel price increase would return 500,000 people to fuel poverty. We are on a treadmill, and I remind my right hon. Friend that fuel companies are making obscene profits: I think they amount to &#163;8 billion. I hope that he will discuss with his friends on the Treasury team the possibility of a windfall tax so that we can really help those who are being subjected to fuel poverty by price increases. I have signed an early-day motion on the subject.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41108-35_para1">
<a name="stpa_328">I raised the second point in Committee. We are setting different decent home standards for the public and private sectors. I am grateful for what the Government are doing in the private sector. Improved building control procedures are beginning to deliver better decent home standards, along with better architectural design and other features, but we are not catching up with that in the public sector.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41108-35_para2">
<a name="stpa_329">The third point is this: we have wasted an awful lot of money trying to bring homes up to a decent standard in terms of fuel efficiency. We began with draught stripping, then dealt with cavity walls and UPVC double glazing. We improved central-heating systems in a thousand and one different ways. My plea to any Government, including this one, is that they take a holistic approach rather than persistently going back&#151;three or four times, in fact&#151;to trying to bring houses up to decent home standards.

Friend the Member for Nottingham, South (Alan Simpson), observed, that passion was clearly not shared by his Tory colleagues, for the Tory Benches were empty throughout his speech. In fact, his colleagues missed the wrong speech on the wrong subject. However, since despite his weasel words and disavowals he spoke in favour of the amendment and is likely to divide the House, I think we can assume that he has committed the&nbsp;official Opposition to expenditure of at least &#163;28.5&nbsp;billion to achieve SAP 65 rating. No doubt the shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer, the right hon. Member for West Dorset (Mr. Letwin), will be most interested to learn of that not insubstantial spending commitment. The hon. Gentleman may find himself out of a job rather sooner than he has a chance to succeed me in mine.

The amendment either indicates a serious attempt to attain a SAP rating of 65 or it does not. I have described the financial implications of taking it seriously, which are immensely costly. I have argued that it is a misplaced policy because, in the social sector&#151;the amendment refers to the social sector&#151;fuel poverty is a limited phenomenon that can be tackled by individual households.

<a name="stpa_335">The hon. Member for South Holland and The Deepings drew attention to observations by ministerial colleagues in the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. However, DEFRA has not said that a SAP rating of 65 is necessary in all stock. What it has said is that removing fuel poverty depends on the characteristics of the individual household, but that SAP 65 is the level at which there is a minimal risk of a household being in fuel poverty. The precise answer given by the Minister for the Environment and Agri-environment to the hon. Member for Guildford (Sue Doughty) was that removing fuel poverty depends on the characteristics of the individual household. I recognise that we may be in an era of rising energy prices, but we cannot base an expenditure commitment of that scale on a relatively unquantifiable guess.

<p>
<a name="41108-35_para9">
<a name="stpa_336">My hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham, South rightly talked about the warm front programme, but I remind him that that programme deals exclusively with&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the private sector and that that is where the problem of fuel poverty is immensely more extensive. My hon. Friend the Member for Northampton, North (Ms Keeble) was right when she identified that the kernel of the fuel poverty issue is in the private sector, but the amendment is about the social sector, not the private sector. My contention is that, because the standard is much higher in the social sector, the issue is much more manageable through interventions other than this blunderbus approach to SAP 65. I was grateful to my hon. Friend, a distinguished former housing Minister, for her support and for exposing the hypocrisy of the Conservative party.

<a name="41108-35_para10">
<a name="stpa_337">I say to my hon. Friend the Member for Bolton, South-East (Dr. Iddon) that I will certainly draw to the attention of colleagues in the Treasury his observations about fuel prices and a windfall tax. I thought that he was wrong when he said that we were not catching up with the private sector. For all the reasons that I have mentioned, I believe that we are doing and will do better in the social sector. However, as he demonstrated to me when I visited him in the Haulgh in Bolton, it is best to do it together. I accept his observations about a holistic approach.

Under clause 7, where a category 2 hazard exists, it may take one of the available courses of action.

 I am pleased that overcrowding will be dealt with separately, and I congratulate the Government on the consultation on that.

<a name="41108-36_para1">
<a name="stpa_340">In its eighth and 10th reports, the Joint Committee on Human Rights expressed concerns that the absence of a duty on local authorities to give reasons for deciding which form of enforcement action to pursue under clauses 5 or 7 failed to comply with article 6 of the human rights convention on the right to a fair hearing; could lead to breaches of article 8 on respect for private and family life; and could lead to breaches of article 1 of the first protocol on the protection of property. The amendment responds to those concerns by placing a duty on local authorities to prepare a statement of reasons for their decision to take the course of action on which they have settled. We believe that this new clause responds positively to the Joint Committee&#039;s concerns without placing local authorities under a significant additional burden.

<a name="stpa_341">Lords amendments Nos. 212 to 214, 216, 218, 219 and 221 amend clauses 199, 203 and 204. In part, they respond to concerns of the Joint Committee on Human Rights and in part they are clarificatory. Clause 199 allows a local housing authority to require the production of documentation that the authority might need to carry out its functions under parts 1 to 4 of the Bill and to investigate offences committed in relation to any residential premises. In its 10th report, the Committee expressed concern that the lack of procedural safeguards, and the lack of requirement for authorisation, could lead to a risk of unjustified or disproportionate use of the powers in clause 199. Lords amendments Nos. 212 and 213 require that a person exercising the power to require the production of documents has been authorised in writing.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41108-36_para3">
<a name="stpa_342">Clause 203 gives a local housing authority power of entry to properties in pursuance of its duties under parts 1 to 4 and part 7 of the Bill when certain conditions are met. Representatives of the authority must have written authorisation that sets out the purpose for which the entry is authorised and must give at least 24 hours notice to the owner or occupier of the premises they intend to enter. Permission under this clause does not include a power to use force to obtain entry. This power of entry includes entry for the purpose of taking samples. In its 10th report, the Committee expressed the view that the authorisation to express the power should be given at an appropriate level of seniority.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41108-36_para4">
<a name="stpa_343">Clause 204 enables a justice of the peace to issue a warrant for admission to premises. This includes power to enter by force if necessary. This power is applicable, however, only when either entry under clause 203 has been refused, or the property is empty and immediate access is necessary, or prior warning of entry is likely to negate the purpose of access. Lords amendments Nos.&nbsp;214, 216, 218 and 219 extend the power of entry in clauses 203 and 204 to include an express power for the purposes of inspections under clause 4. These amendments are clarificatory.

 I appreciate the opportunity to raise the issue of homeless people in London. I am grateful that the Under-Secretary of State, Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, the hon. Member for Corby (Phil Hope), is in the Chamber, and I wish the Under-Secretary of State, Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, the hon. Member for Pontefract and Castleford (Yvette Cooper), who would normally have been holding the fort, best wishes during her maternity leave.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41108-37_para5">
<a name="stpa_351">I do not intend to raise the matter in a confrontational way because it is hugely important not only to my constituency but to all London boroughs and constituencies. I hope that I can make constructive suggestions that might inform Government policy. I am conscious of the fact that the Select Committee on the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is conducting a review on homelessness, and I hope that my speech will be regarded as a contribution to that debate. I would be grateful for a later opportunity to pursue matters that I raise with Ministers bilaterally. I shall state what I believe to be the gravity of the situation before putting on record some telling and worrying statistics&#151;they are not mine, but generally agreed statistics from Government sources&#151;and making my proposals.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41108-37_para6">
<a name="stpa_352">Like most hon. Members, each year I review the balance of the work that comes my way as a constituency MP. I have just done that again as we approach the end of the Session. The largest single issue that arises, as it probably has been for each of my 21&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;years in this place, is housing and homelessness. People come to me because they have inadequate housing or cannot get decent housing. That problem consistently occurs in inner London and urban areas. My honest view is that homelessness is a ticking time bomb for more and more of London and for more Londoners. The statistics are serious. Homelessness is the most serious crisis facing many Londoners and London families. The Government and councils of all persuasions&#151;I am not making a party-political point&#151;are losing the battle against homelessness rather than winning it, despite the strenuous efforts made by previous Administrations, especially this one and the previous one.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41108-37_para7">
<a name="stpa_353">If we do not house people properly, their health becomes worse, their ability to learn or work is reduced and their personal and social problems escalate&#151;we all pay the price of that. In a capital city of increasing wealth, as London is, and in a country of increasing wealth, one in 100 households do not have a permanent home. Such a record has not existed for a considerable time. Although many people are doing well, more and more are being left behind. Irrespective of what may have been tried and tested, my fear is that unless there is a more urgent response, the Government will stoke up a set of huge social problems.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41108-37_para8">
<a name="stpa_354">There have been many debates on housing and homelessness&#151;indeed, we spent the past few hours discussing those very issues&#151;but this is the first specific debate on homeless people in London since the first year of this Parliament, and I am glad to return to it.

<b>8 Nov 2004 : Column 675</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="41108-37_para9">
<a name="stpa_355">I want to give some figures, which I understand are fully agreed. The number of households accepted as homeless by the 33 local authorities in London increased from 24,570 in the first year of the Labour Government in 1997&#150;98 to 31,530 in 2002&#150;03, the last year for which figures are available. There was an increase of 10 per cent. in that last year. In the same period in my borough, the figure went up from 893 to 1,671. Those are the people for whom the councils accept they have a duty to provide housing. The figures mean that 1 per cent. of households in London are not permanently housed.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41108-37_para10">
<a name="stpa_356">One of the most worrying trends is the number of young people, and the increase in the number of young people, who have been accepted as homeless. For that purpose, young people are 16 and 17-year-olds, who are all regarded as in priority need, and 18 to 20-year-olds who have been care. In 1997&#150;98, the number of homeless young people was 305, 66 of whom were in my borough. In the past full year, the figure was 2,038, 106 of whom were in my borough&#151;a phenomenal increase of more than 500 per cent. in young people who were accepted as vulnerable.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41108-37_para11">
<a name="stpa_357">There has been a relentless increase in young homeless people in almost every borough. In Lambeth, the figure was 36 in 2000 and 194 in 2003; in Tower Hamlets, it was six in 1999 and 99 in 2003; and in Camden it was nine in 2000 and 118 in 2003. As I said, the number also increased in my borough. The problem is not sectoral but Londonwide.
</p>








<p><a name="st_309"><a name="41108-37_spnew1"><b> Paul Flynn  (Newport, West) (Lab):</b> 
 Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the reason for the increase in the figures is not an increase in the number of people who suffer housing distress? The Government have a marvellous record, having reduced the number of rough sleepers to a third of what it was when we took office. The figures look so alarming because the definition of homelessness has been stretched. Had that definition applied when I was a young man, half the population would have been defined as homeless. The figures look so alarming because the definition of homelessness now includes people who are under-housed. The problem is not an increase in the number of homeless people, but a widening of the definition.
</p>








<p><a name="st_310"><a name="41108-37_spnew2"><b> Simon Hughes: </b> 
 I do not accept that. There have been redefinitions since 1997, but they were not significant. There is plenty of evidence to support my case, including my constituency experience. Shelter&#039;s evidence to the Select Committee inquiry sets out the factors that cause homelessness. Some 17 per cent. of parents and 12 per cent. of friends are no longer able to offer accommodation, and 18 per cent. of homelessness cases&#151;the biggest group&#151;are due to violent relationship breakdown. I hope that the hon. Gentleman accepts that those people are justifiably looking for new housing. Some 7 per cent. of cases are due to non-violent relationship breakdown; 7 per cent. to mortgage arrears; 2 per cent. to rent arrears; 12 per cent. have come to the end of their tenancies; 17 per cent. are caused by other reasons; and 9 per cent. are caused by the loss of other rented or tied accommodation.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>8 Nov 2004 : Column 676</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="41108-37_para12">
<a name="stpa_358">My constituency experience, and that of most of our colleagues, is that more people are becoming homeless. Why? It is because we are not building anything like enough property. If Members talk to the Mayor of London, the Greater London authority or any borough they will see that we are building less than half the property that we need. The most recent figures for London show that 5,209 additional homes were completed with Housing Corporation funding. In the same year, however, 7,823 homes were lost to the rented sector as a result of the right to buy. We are therefore losing homes rather than gaining them.
</p>








<p><a name="st_311"><a name="41108-37_spnew3"><b> Paul Flynn: </b> 
 They are not lost.
</p>








<p><a name="st_312"><a name="41108-37_spnew4"><b> Simon Hughes: </b> 
 They are lost to the rented sector as a result of the right to buy. If the hon. Gentleman looks at all the trends across London, he will see that the position is the same in my borough, where 185 homes were completed with Housing Corporation funding, but 974 were lost to the rented sector. The number of people who are deemed intentionally homeless has gone up, because the definition is interpreted more tightly, not in a more relaxed way. People coming to my surgeries are priority cases under any definition&#151;they are vulnerable, they cannot work, they are mentally ill or emotionally distressed, and they may be suicidal&#151;but they have been turned down, so we have to appeal. It is not always easy, however, to have them accepted as homeless. The reality is that those people are initially taken out of the figures.

</p>

<p>
<a name="41108-37_para13">
<a name="stpa_359">We are short of new housing and other accommodation in London, partly because people no longer live in extended households of grandparents, parents and children, and they need their own home. When relationships break down, for example, they want their own place. Work by the Mayor and studies of London show that that we have been building about 15,000 new homes a year, but we need at least 30,000, and have done so ever since the Government took office.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41108-37_para14">
<a name="stpa_360">I began by saying that I initiated this debate more in sorrow than in anger, but it is not the case that the position is getting better, as the problem is becoming significantly worse. I accept that there are fewer rough sleepers, but if the hon. Member for Newport, West (Paul Flynn) and other Members talk to people who know about homelessness in London they will discover that some rough sleepers are now staying with friends and family. They are sleeping on the floor and living in other people&#039;s accommodation, and are known as the hidden homeless. If the hon. Gentleman looks at the figures or the evidence given to the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, he will see that the numbers have gone up. I shall give a final set of figures. The number of households in temporary accommodation&#151;people housed in bed-and- breakfast hostels and hotels&#151;has gone up in London from 24,060 in 1997&#150;98 to 59,170 in 2002&#150;03. In London, the average time spent in temporary accommodation before someone who is accepted as homeless is given a permanent home has gone up from 91 days in 1997 to 391 days in 2003. A couple with a child, a couple who have been accepted as vulnerable or a family are now likely to spend more than a year in temporary accommodation, whereas six or seven years ago they would have spent a few months 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>8 Nov 2004 : Column 677</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>there. People from the street and others are among the figures, so there is a true crisis. If the hon. Gentleman does not accept that, I invite him to look at the cases that I deal with in my surgery. He can sit with me, and see the people who come through the door&#151;they are from all walks of life and backgrounds, and are of all classes, creeds, colours and ages. The problem, however, is getting substantially worse.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41108-37_para15">
<a name="stpa_361">I wish to make a final point about statistics before putting my proposals to the Minister. From a previous debate in which Ministers were generous to my colleagues I know that we still have a huge number of empty properties. The most recent figures show that there were 89,000 empty homes across the capital, and we must be more vigorous in getting those empty homes back into use. We could all come up with our own answers, but I want to put five proposals to the Minister.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41108-37_para16">
<a name="stpa_362">First, we need a new and more urgent drive to identify and fill empty properties. That is always a difficult challenge, but we must do much better. It is a scandal that such properties should be empty, and we could appropriate them for use without appropriating ownership.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41108-37_para17">
<a name="stpa_363">Secondly, I propose the use of quick-build homes, such as those pioneered by Urban Settings, to deal with the immediate crisis. A Polish company constructs buildings&#151;they are like Portakabins stacked on top of each other&#151;off-site and puts them on-site. It can provide warm, dry, safe, secure and respectable accommodation, and for many people that is far better than nothing. It is not a long-term solution for many, but it is a solution for some.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41108-37_para18">
<a name="stpa_364">Thirdly, there should be additional funding for councils. We could talk to any of the 33 local authorities in London and to the Housing Corporation about a massive programme of new build in London, particularly of three and four-bedroom homes. If those are built, all the overcrowded people in homes with one and two bedrooms could move to homes with the three and four bedrooms that they need, releasing one and two-bedroom properties for single people, couples, couples with one or two children, or smaller families.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41108-37_para19">
<a name="stpa_365">Fourthly, I commend to Ministers the example of New York, which I visited last December. I suggest the urgent acquisition and conversion of hotels, as in New York, or other buildings in the middle of London to house the homeless and the low-paid. Common Ground is a brilliant project that has been going for 10 years&#151;it was founded in New York and has spread across part of the eastern United States. It does not have the stigma of a homeless hostel, because although half the people there are homeless, the other half are low-paid workers. It has done a brilliant job. Crisis, Shelter and other organisations have been talking to Ministers about a similar project in London. That would make a huge difference.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41108-37_para20">
<a name="stpa_366">Lastly, in my constituency, in Blackfriars road, there is a place called Wedge house, which is the Department for Work and Pensions benefit office where homeless people in London go for their benefits. It cannot cope, and within a year or two the DWP wants to get rid of the site. I hope that Ministers will seriously consider the idea of two one-stop shops&#151;one south of the river, one north, and both quite near the centre&#151;where homeless people can go to have all their benefits, housing and 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>8 Nov 2004 : Column 678</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>health needs sorted out. That would offer a first point of reference instead of their being shuttled from one place to another, which is hardly satisfactory if one has nowhere to lay one&#039;s head.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41108-37_para21">
<a name="stpa_367">I conclude with a factual point. The other night I saw someone at my surgery&#151;a single person who was pretty inadequate. I spent two and a half hours&#151;this is not a criticism&#151;waiting for an answer from the Shelter hotline. At 9.30 at night, it said that there was absolutely nowhere in London available. That is the circumstance that many people now face.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41108-37_para22">
<a name="stpa_368">I believe that solutions to the growing crisis are possible, but they require the political will to implement them. London local councils cannot cope on their own. The fact that the number of rough sleepers has gone down does not mean that homelessness is not a growing issue in London for more and more people every day. I hope that there can be new, positive and truly effective initiatives.

<p><a name="st_313"><a name="41108-38_spmin0"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Office of the Deputy Prime Minister  (Phil Hope): </b> 
 I congratulate the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey (Simon Hughes) on securing this important debate. I shall endeavour to respond to the issues that he raised.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41108-38_para0">
<a name="stpa_369">We can agree that, as the hon. Gentleman said, more and more people are receiving assistance from local authorities under the homelessness legislation, and that homelessness is not a problem in his borough of Southwark alone. Indeed, it is a problem not only across London but nationally, because increases have been recorded in all regions in recent years. I am sure that despite his remarks to my hon. Friend the Member for Newport, West (Paul Flynn), he recognises that some of those increases are the result of strengthened legislation. More people are being helped who might not have been given priority in the past. However, I accept that that does not entirely account for the growth in numbers.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41108-38_para1">
<a name="stpa_370">We are clear about the extent of the problem&#151;it is growing and we are taking positive steps to tackle it. Ishall not repeat the hon. Gentleman&#039;s litany of statistics&#151;human misery expressed in numbers&#151;but I must correct him on one figure. He cited a 10 per cent. increase between 2001&#150;02 and 2002&#150;03, but that is wrong&#151;the real increase was 3.5 per cent. Rather than dealing with the detail now, I will write to him to explain that error, which has entered the public domain.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41108-38_para2">
<a name="stpa_371">I want to pick up on the second half of the hon. Gentleman&#039;s contribution. The important thing is what we do about the problem. The Government are not shying away from it&#151;we want to tackle it head on. I believe that we have a good track record to date. First, we have successfully reduced the number of people who sleep rough&#151;those who are literally roofless&#151;by no less than two thirds. In 1997, we inherited housing legislation&#151;the Housing Act 1996&#151;which reduced the rights of homeless people. We have strengthened the safety net for homeless people so that more people are eligible for local authority help, and widened the help that local authorities provide.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41108-38_para3">
<a name="stpa_372">In the short term, that has meant local authorities accepting more people as homeless and has therefore added to the numbers in temporary accommodation. 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>8 Nov 2004 : Column 679</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Many of those people would have been left to fend for themselves under the previous legislation. More vulnerable people than ever are being helped and that includes those who are mentally or physically disabled. The consequence of the increase in the number of people who are helped is a growth in households in temporary accommodation. Of course we are greatly concerned about that, and we have acted quickly to end the scandal of households having to raise children in bed and breakfast hotels.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41108-38_para4">
<a name="stpa_373">It is interesting to note that, on 31 December 2002, some 2,230 families were living in bed and breakfast. That means approximately 3,600 children living in bed and breakfast accommodation. By 31 March 2004, the figure was zero. We had eliminated the problem of children and families having to live in bed and breakfast hostels. As the hon. Gentleman said, those are statistics. However, they are important: the statistics express human misery and I am delighted that we are considering a figure of zero.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41108-38_para5">
<a name="stpa_374">We acknowledge that some local authorities&#039; services have been bogged down in the process of deciding whether a household asking for help is homeless under the legislation rather than concentrating on the help that could be offered to avoid homelessness. That means that households are being accepted as homeless and moved into temporary accommodation in circumstances where homelessness might have been prevented. The protection that the legislation offers, although greatly welcome, has become the only option, rather than the safety net that it should be.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41108-38_para6">
<a name="stpa_375">I am glad that proactive local authorities have changed their culture to develop a range of appropriate options for everyone who asks for advice. By helping someone to rebuild relationships with their family or friends, stay in education or work or deal with a drug or alcohol problem, homelessness can be prevented. We support those approaches and services that provide the right help at the right time, backed up by a robust safety net for vulnerable people. The hon. Gentleman described that as losing the battle, but I am pleased that every local authority now has a strategy in place for preventing homelessness, and that we are beginning to achieve reductions in homelessness acceptances, with London leading the way. Here, reductions in the past two quarters&#151;that is how recently the change began to bite&#151;were 9 per cent. compared with last year and 5 per cent. elsewhere. I believe that we are turning the corner. That is making a huge difference.
</p>








<p><a name="st_314"><a name="41108-38_spnew0"><b> Bob Russell  (Colchester) (LD):</b> 
 It has taken seven years.
</p>








<p><a name="st_315"><a name="41108-38_spnew1"><b> Phil Hope: </b> 
 As I said earlier, we have been widening the net in the past seven years to allow more people to be helped. More vulnerable people are being helped. It is crucial to deal with prevention to prevent people from becoming homeless in the first place as well as rightly tackling the provision of more accommodation to meet needs.
</p>








<p><a name="st_316"><a name="41108-38_spnew2"><b> Bob Russell: </b> 
 Will the Minister give way?
</p>








<p><a name="st_317"><a name="41108-38_spnew3"><b> Phil Hope: </b> 
 No, because I have only three minutes left to respond to the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>8 Nov 2004 : Column 680</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="41108-38_para7">
<a name="stpa_376">We have provided significant additional funding for local authorities and voluntary sector agencies to support delivery of their homelessness strategies, doubling previous spending plans. London has received more than half of the resources available nationally, because we recognise the unique problems that it faces. We have doubled the investment in affordable housing, and London is receiving more than 40 per cent. of the national allocation; that is some &#163;2 billion in the current spending review period. We have also increased the investment in new provision of housing, and these prevention initiatives will together turn around the problem of homelessness.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41108-38_para8">
<a name="stpa_377">The hon. Gentleman raised several points on this issue, and I should like to say a little more about funding. This year, the homelessness and housing support directorate allocated &#163;45 million to local authorities in support of their homelessness strategies. A further &#163;14 million has been allocated to voluntary organisations, and London received the lion&#039;s share. Indeed, Southwark&#039;s allocation was one of the highest in London, receiving more than &#163;1 million from the directorate in each of the past three years. Of course, money is not the only answer. This is about people working together, and the partnership work that has been done on rough sleeping has been hugely successful. Rough sleeping levels are now less than half their 1998 levels, and there have been notable successes.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41108-38_para9">
<a name="stpa_378">The hon. Gentleman mentioned empty homes. In London, the London Housing Board&#039;s discretionary funding pot for private sector renewal is funding an empty property website in the West London sub-region, and other sub-regional schemes to help to bring empty properties back into use. We have introduced a range of fiscal incentives, and in particular a VAT reduction, to encourage the renovation of long-term empty homes. We have also provided funding for the Empty Homes Agency, an independent housing charity, to work with local authorities to implement effective empty property strategies. We have published comprehensive guidance for local authorities and property owners on unlocking the potential of empty property. We will follow that up later this year with more specific guidance for Departments and the public sector. I hope that, through those measures, we have demonstrated our commitment to tackling the pernicious effects of empty homes.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41108-38_para10">
<a name="stpa_379">The hon. Gentleman also mentioned the question of benefits in relation to the homeless sector in London. He will know that the London homeless services team was set up specifically to address the needs of homeless people across London with regard to welfare benefits. I shall not take him through all the details, but the team works with 80 outreach organisations across London, often using a van, and it sees about 700 customers a month. The Southwark homelessness unit offers a direct access benefit-related service to a case load of more than 400 street homeless people and in excess of 100 hostel dwellers. These are good examples of joint working between the Department for Work and Pensions and local boroughs to tackle the relationship between homelessness and the benefit system.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41108-38_para11">
<a name="stpa_380">The hon. Gentleman mentioned the New York project. The Government are well aware of the excellent work of the Times Square project there, and have been very supportive of it. We have also encouraged 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>8 Nov 2004 : Column 681</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>innovative projects such as that in England. In particular, we are closely involved with the Crisis urban village project, and we await with interest the next stage of its development. I take his remarks on this issue very much to heart, and we are grateful for his involvement in some of these developments.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41108-38_para12">
<a name="stpa_381">The hon. Gentleman made a particular point about temporary accommodation. While there are more people in such accommodation now, it is important to remember that the people who have been helped have been rehoused as a result of the stronger homelessness legislation. The vast majority&#151;more than 80 per cent.&#151;are housed in self-contained homes in the private or social sector. We accept, however, that that number reflects a shortage of suitable housing, and we are determined to tackle that issue, too. That is why our priority for action over the next three years is to increase the number of new social rented homes.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41108-38_para13">
<a name="stpa_382">I have mentioned prevention, so I shall say no more about that at the moment. I want to talk about the importance of building more homes. The hon. Gentleman mentioned using a particular method of construction as a way of delivering new homes. He will remember that, at our conference in Brighton this year, the Deputy Prime Minister put out a challenge to the housing sector to try to build homes for &#163;60,000. We then heard about some imaginative schemes involving the use of surplus public land. That is the kind of innovative thinking that is going on right now on modern methods of construction, but of course we need more money to supply quality affordable housing. We are already investing &#163;1.4 billion in more affordable 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>8 Nov 2004 : Column 682</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>housing for London over the periods 2004&#150;05 and 2005&#150;06. Let me tell the House what that means: this year and next, 10,000 more homes for rent for homeless and poorly housed families; 4,000 homes for low-cost home ownership; and 8,000 homes for key workers. That is a total of 22,000, and we are not going to stop there.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41108-38_para14">
<a name="stpa_383">The recent spending review has announced significant additional funding, which will provide nationally an additional 75,000 social rented homes and 40,000 homes for essential public sector workers and low-cost home ownership over the three years to 2007&#150;08. We have also provided resources to reduce nationally the number of non-decent homes&#151;we had a debate about that earlier&#151;by 1 million. We are determined to continue that good progress.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41108-38_para15">
<a name="stpa_384">We have had a short but important debate, and I hope I have shown that investment is being made in additional homes. I hope I have also shown through the statistics not only how people&#039;s lives are being affected but that the Government are taking this action seriously and that we have had a lot of good success in tackling rough sleeping and children living in bed-and-breakfast accommodation. We have a prevention agenda that is beginning to show results. With our investment in new affordable housing, we are setting the right agenda for reducing homelessness in London and across the country.
