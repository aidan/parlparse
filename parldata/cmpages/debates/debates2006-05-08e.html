Pension credit in particular has been a huge success in tackling pensioner poverty. It was opposed, I am afraid, by the Liberal Democrats as well as the Conservatives, so there is no change there.

In relation to the concept of a citizen&#146;s pension, for which the eligibility rules relate to residency rather than contributions, I have made clear that my strong preference is for the continuation of the contributory principle. The principle of something for something has been at the heart of state pension policy in this country for nearly 100 years; it was started by the great David Lloyd George when he was Chancellor of the Exchequer and continued in subsequent years. The challenge now is how to make the contributory principle much fairer to women and carers. The White Paper will certainly take up that challenge.</p>

<p><a name="st_o107"><a name="0605082000160"><a name="60508-0003.htm_spmin6"><a name="0605082000447"><b>The Secretary of State for Defence (Mr. Des Browne):</b> With permission, Mr. Speaker, I would like to make a statement about the tragic crash of the Lynx helicopter in Iraq on Saturday and the immediate aftermath.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o11"><a name="60508-0003.htm_para1"><a name="0605082000161">As the House will be aware, on Saturday 6 May at 1350 hours local time, a Lynx mark 7 helicopter on a routine flight came down in Basra city, crash-landing on the roof of an empty building. Five UK personnel on board the aircraft are missing believed killed: Wing Commander John Coxen; Lieutenant Commander Darren Chapman; Flight Lieutenant Sarah-Jayne Mulvihill; Captain David Dobson, Army Air Corps; and Marine Paul Collins. Their next of kin have been informed. I am sure that the whole House will join me in sending my deepest condolences to their families and friends. I also express my sympathy to the families of all those killed in Iraq over the weekend, including those from coalition forces.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o12"><a name="60508-0003.htm_para2"><a name="0605082000162">I know that there is a natural tendency when such awful events occur to speculate about possible causes. I caution that such speculation is not only unhelpful but can be very distressing to the loved ones of those involved. As is routinely the case in such circumstances, a detailed technical and Royal Military Police investigation is under way. An air accident investigation team is in place, and a full board of inquiry is being conducted. I can, however, confirm at this stage that the helicopter was fitted with a defensive aids suite, as are all our helicopters in Iraq.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o13"><a name="60508-0003.htm_para3"><a name="0605082000163">British Army units in Basra deployed immediately to the scene of the crash and secured the area with the help of the Iraqi army and the Iraqi police service. A crowd swiftly formed on the streets surrounding the crash site, and the House will have seen television coverage of the volatile situation that developed over the next few hours. I am very grateful to the Iraqi authorities for the assistance provided by the Iraqi army and police to bring the situation under control, including the imposition of a curfew by the provincial governor.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o14"><a name="60508-0003.htm_para4"><a name="0605082000164">British troops and Iraqi security forces came under attack with a variety of weapons, including stones, gunfire, petrol and blast bombs, rocket-propelled grenades and mortars. It is entirely right that our troops take action to defend themselves in such circumstances. I can confirm that British personnel fired baton rounds and a limited amount of live ammunition. Seven UK personnel were injured as a result of the disturbance. According to the information that I have, none of those injuries was serious.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o15"><a name="60508-0003.htm_para5"><a name="0605082000165">Local reports and our own sources indicate that five Iraqis may have died, and approximately 28 were injured during the civil disorder that followed the crash. The full extent of UK military responsibility for any of those casualties will be clarified in due course, following completion of the post-incident review. In circumstances such as these, such a review is normal.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o16"><a name="60508-0004.htm_para0"><a name="0605082000166">I know that some commentators have concluded that the television footage that we saw on Saturday is evidence that southern Iraq is rising up against the British presence and that we should withdraw all troops immediately. I do not share that assessment, but,  <br>

more importantly, nor do the commanders on the ground, including Major-General John Cooper in Basra.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o17"><a name="60508-0004.htm_para1"><a name="0605082000167">To put that in its proper context, the disturbances on the ground involved a crowd of 200 to 300 people. Although magnified by the media images we saw, the incident was an isolated incident in a city of around 1.5 million people. Crucially, it was brought under control by the Iraqi security forces themselves in a few hours. Since then, the city has remained calm. That is testament to the commitment and bravery of the Iraqi personnel and to the work that we and other members of the coalition have been doing to train the Iraqis to prepare them for taking on responsibility for the security of their country, where more than 12 million Iraqis showed courage in voting for a new Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o18"><a name="60508-0004.htm_para2"><a name="0605082000168">The House will be aware that relations with the Basra provincial council have been difficult over the past eight months or so. Yesterday, the governor of Basra announced a return to full co-operation and dialogue between the council and British forces. Indeed, members of the council expressed their profound regret for the incident and extended their condolences to the families. That reinforces our belief that the majority of the people of Basra want to work with us to develop governance and security in the region.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o19"><a name="60508-0004.htm_para3"><a name="0605082000169">That is not to say we should be complacent&#151;far from it. The crowd on Saturday appears to have included elements that were armed with mortars and rocket-propelled grenades, and were prepared to use them against British forces. Major-General Cooper has confirmed that he is content with the numbers and capability of the troops at his disposal but I assure the House that we keep force levels under constant review.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o20"><a name="60508-0004.htm_para4"><a name="0605082000170">I am also aware that some have called for the Government to set out our exit strategy from Iraq. That strategy has been set out before the House many times, most recently on 13 March by my predecessor, now the Home Secretary. However, let me be clear. We are still committed to remaining in Iraq for as long as we are needed and the Iraqi Government want us to stay, and until the job is done. That job is to assist the Iraqi Government and their security forces to build their capabilities&#151;military and civilian&#151;so that they can take on full responsibility for the security of their country. Achieving that objective is the exit strategy&#151;nothing more, nothing less.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o21"><a name="60508-0004.htm_para5"><a name="0605082000171">Multinational forces continue to train and mentor the Iraqis to develop operating effectiveness. Currently, there are more than 250,000 Iraqis in their security forces, including 115,000 in the Iraqi army.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o22"><a name="60508-0004.htm_para6"><a name="0605082000172">The incident was serious, but, despite that, we can draw some encouragement from the fact that local forces worked with us to restore order on Saturday.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o23"><a name="60508-0004.htm_para7"><a name="0605082000173">I express again my deepest condolences for and sympathy to the families of those killed on Saturday and to the colleagues they leave behind in the Royal Navy and Royal Marines, the Army and the Royal Air Force, especially those who continue to serve with such bravery to help the people of Iraq build a secure and stable future for themselves.</p>

extend Conservative Members&#146; sympathy to the families and friends of those who were killed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o24"><a name="60508-0004.htm_para8"><a name="0605082000175">This tragedy has seen our most senior servicemen so far and our first servicewoman killed in action in Iraq. It is worth remembering that they are not there as an army of occupation but represent hope for the majority of the Iraqi people, who want to live in a democratic system, with a fair rule of law and under a constitution that they designed. In paying tribute to those who were killed, we should remember that they were there fulfilling a noble purpose.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o25"><a name="60508-0004.htm_para9"><a name="0605082000176">I welcome the Secretary of State to his new job but I am sorry that such a sombre occasion brings him to the House. I should like to ask him about four broad matters. Many of those who have been in Iraq recently say that the Army&#146;s footprint in Basra is so reduced that we seem more like visitors in the city than in control of it. The Secretary of State said that Major-General Cooper is happy with the number of troops at his disposal. Is he happy that sufficient reinforcements are available to deploy quickly to deal with the unexpected? Will the Secretary of State assure us that there will be no further troop withdrawals until he has satisfied himself on the point?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o26"><a name="60508-0004.htm_para10"><a name="0605082000177">There was speculation over the weekend that the helicopter may have been brought down by a rocket-propelled grenade or similar device. Like the Secretary of State, I do not see any point in speculating further on that. Will he, however, look into the operational capability of the Lynx helicopter, especially its speed and its ability to operate in hot weather, as those factors could contribute to its vulnerability? Will he also look into the early procurement of more Lynxes to ensure that we minimise the risk to our servicemen and women not only in Iraq but in the read-across to Afghanistan?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o27"><a name="60508-0004.htm_para11"><a name="0605082000178">The House will be pleased that the Secretary of State talked about the restoration of co-operation with the local authorities. Given that our servicemen are putting themselves at risk for the people of Iraq, however, most people in the United Kingdom would be horrified by the idea that they were not getting the full co-operation of those authorities. Will the right hon. Gentleman take the opportunity to ask the new Foreign Secretary to raise with the Iraqi Government the role of the governor of Basra, because maintaining security and safety on the ground is one of the ways of maximising the protection of those in the air?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o28"><a name="60508-0004.htm_para12"><a name="0605082000179">The Secretary of State mentioned a number of weapons that are available to insurgents and terrorists in Iraq. Does he have any information on the origins of those weapons? His predecessor&#151;now the Home Secretary&#151;told the House that there was evidence that weapons were coming in from Hezbollah. I want to know whether there is further evidence of any weapons coming directly from Iran, either from the Government there or via Hezbollah, because that also has a major read-across to what is happening in Afghanistan.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o29"><a name="60508-0004.htm_para13"><a name="0605082000180">Mistakes have been made in Iraq that have made our involvement there more difficult and probably longer than needed. However, I completely agree with the Secretary of State that early withdrawal is not a solution for the people of Iraq or for stability in the region. The Government have a duty to maximise the success of the mission in Iraq, and to minimise the risk to our servicemen and women. I hope that the  <br>

Secretary of State will take advantage of his new position to look into the issues that I have raised today, and to ensure that he is confident that he is fulfilling both those tasks.</p>

<p><a name="st_o109"><a name="0605082000181"><a name="60508-0004.htm_spnew1"><a name="0605082000449"><b>Mr. Browne:</b> I thank the hon. Gentleman for his expressions of condolence. I also thank him for his manifest support for our objectives in southern Iraq and for his often-articulated appreciation of the dedication and courage of our armed forces. He has raised a number of issues, and I shall endeavour, within the state of my current knowledge, to respond to them. Incidentally, I also thank him for welcoming me to my new position. We shall have the opportunity to share the challenges that we face together at some time in the future, and I look forward to working with him.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o30"><a name="60508-0004.htm_para14"><a name="0605082000182">The hon. Gentleman asked about the sufficiency of troops. He can be reassured that my first task on Saturday morning, as the tragic circumstances in Basra started to unfold on my television screen&#151;as they did on others across the country&#151;was to make inquiries about the sufficiency of our troops. Having spoken directly to those who command our troops in southern Iraq, and to the service chiefs, I have confirmed that none of them believes that our armed forces are insufficient for the operations with which we have tasked them in southern Iraq.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o31"><a name="60508-0004.htm_para15"><a name="0605082000183">The hon. Gentleman also asked about support, should it be necessary. I commented on that issue in the media over the weekend, and I can reassure him that there are dedicated reserves available for Iraq, should they need to be deployed. The deployment of troops to Iraq, or to any other theatre, will depend on the advice of those who know best, namely those who lead our armed forces.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o32"><a name="60508-0004.htm_para16"><a name="0605082000184">The hon. Gentleman mentioned the capabilities of our equipment, and in particular of the Lynx helicopter. As I said in my statement, a board of inquiry will ensue, and it will be informed by the investigation that is now taking place. I am not in a position to pre-judge that inquiry, and I would not seek to do so to any extent at the Dispatch Box. I will say to the hon. Gentleman, however, that we will respond to the recommendations of the board of inquiry in the same way that we have sought to respond to the recommendations of any such board in the past. I can also give him an assurance that we will implement the recommendations of any such board of inquiry. However, it would be speculation at this stage to suggest that anything relating to the capability of the equipment made a contribution to the circumstances of the incident. The hon. Gentleman asked about our relationships with the provincial authorities, and I am clearly able to say that they are improving. They were improving in any event, never mind the incident that took place on Saturday. It is of some reassurance to me that, despite the incident on Saturday, the meetings that were planned to progress those relationships took place in any event and had the outcome that I have described to the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o33"><a name="60508-0004.htm_para17"><a name="0605082000185">The hon. Gentleman asked, in particular, whether my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary will raise with the Iraqi Government the issue of the provincial governor in Basra. I assure the hon. Gentleman that the former Foreign Secretary raised this very issue on more than one occasion with the provisional  <br>

Government in Iraq, and I have absolutely no doubt that my right hon. Friend the current Foreign Secretary will do exactly the same thing should she have the opportunity to do so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o34"><a name="60508-0004.htm_para18"><a name="0605082000186">Finally, the hon. Gentleman asked about the provenance of the weaponry that may have been in the hands of the crowd. We are still in the early stage of the review of the circumstances and, as I understand it, the troops who were present have not been fully debriefed, so I am not in a position to speculate on that issue. However, when my right hon. Friend the former Secretary of State for Defence discovered the provenance of improvised explosive devices, he told the House and the public of the United Kingdom of their provenance. I would intend to do the same if such information became available to me.</p>

<p><a name="st_o110"><a name="0605082000187"><a name="60508-0004.htm_spnew2"><a name="0605082000450"><b>Nick Harvey (North Devon) (LD):</b> I echo most sincerely the words of condolence to the families of those who have lost their lives. This is certainly the news that all families of personnel on active service must dread.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o35"><a name="60508-0004.htm_para19"><a name="0605082000188">I entirely accept that it is unhelpful at this stage to speculate on the cause of the helicopter coming down. However, can the Secretary of State assure us that he will return to the House, when it has proved possible to find more information, so that we can have a greater discussion when we know the picture of what happened and the implications for our operations in southern Iraq? Can he tell us also whether it has been possible to secure the accident site satisfactorily in order to carry out the investigations necessary?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o36"><a name="60508-0004.htm_para20"><a name="0605082000189">Helicopter operations are intrinsically hazardous, and I suppose that such an incident could have occurred at any point in the past. Given that helicopters will play a vital part in our operations in Iraq and in Afghanistan, could the Secretary of State acquaint himself with the problem of the shortage of transport helicopters and trained personnel? Is he aware that the Minister responsible for defence procurement, acknowledged the 15 per cent. shortfall and said in answer to a question in another place that it might take 18 months for decisions to be made? Given the fact that the likely attrition rate of helicopters cannot be ignored, will the Secretary of State take steps to accelerate consideration of that issue?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o37"><a name="60508-0004.htm_para21"><a name="0605082000190">The Secretary of State referred to an exit strategy and he restated the objective. He said that the job is to assist the Iraqi Government and their security forces to build their capabilities so that they can take on responsibility for the security of their own country. I think that everyone shares and understands that objective. He said that achieving that objective is the strategy. With respect, a strategy needs to be rather more detailed and comprehensive than simply the desire to achieve the objective. If we do come back to discuss these matters again when a little more is known about them, will he undertake to bring a more detailed strategy so that Parliament can probe the progress that is being made, so that the British public can have an understanding of the progress that we think that we are making and so that the Iraqis understand it too?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o38"><a name="60508-0004.htm_para22"><a name="0605082000191">I welcome the Secretary of State to his new post and congratulate him on his appointment. It is regrettable  <br>

that his first duty in the House should be in such tragic circumstances but, when he has had a chance to assimilate more information about the issue, will he return to have a broader debate about the progress that we are making in Iraq?</p>

<p><a name="st_o111"><a name="0605082000192"><a name="60508-0004.htm_spnew3"><a name="0605082000451"><b>Mr. Browne:</b> I thank the hon.

<p><a name="stpa_o39"><a name="60508-0004.htm_para23"><a name="0605082000193">The hon. Gentleman asks specifically whether the results of the investigation into the cause of the incident will become known. A full board of inquiry is in progress. At this stage, an investigation is taking place by a highly qualified team of expert investigators, and the results will inform the board of inquiry. As I understand it, the process is that its results will be made public, to the extent that they can be without undermining the security of our personnel in theatre. He has my assurance that the board of inquiry will proceed in a way that is no different from any other in such circumstances.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o40"><a name="60508-0004.htm_para24"><a name="0605082000194">The hon. Gentleman can be reassured that thanks to the support of the Iraqi army and police force, which put themselves on the front line between those in the crowd who were intent on harming our forces and, indeed, did harm them, the accident site was secured. The information I have is that although it was a very difficult and complex site, the necessary investigations were able to take place. I am unable to inform the House whether investigation of the site has concluded, but in any event all that information will be brought together and inform the board of inquiry&#146;s determinations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o41"><a name="60508-0004.htm_para25"><a name="0605082000195">The hon. Gentleman raises a question on the sufficiency of equipment, in particular helicopters. I assure him that we keep the amount of equipment and the nature of equipment under review, and we will respond to requests from theatre. In the context of this statement and the circumstances that have brought me to the House, it is far too early to say what the implications of the incident are for equipment or indeed the operating procedures of that equipment. It would be pointless to speculate at this stage.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o42"><a name="60508-0004.htm_para26"><a name="0605082000196">On the exit strategy, having succeeded the former Secretary of State for Defence, I come to the House at least with the assurance that nobody can suggest there is a lack of clarity about the communication of the Government&#146;s position, which he explained and repeated on a number of occasions. The response of the Iraqi forces, particularly the army and the police, on Saturday, in very difficult circumstances, is an indication not only of the direction of travel towards that exit, but of the progress that we have made, some of which would have been unthinkable only a matter of months ago.</p>

My understanding is indeed that the rest of the city was going about its normal business on that day. The hon. Gentleman&#146;s point about media coverage is partly true. I was brought up to believe that the camera never lies, which is probably right; it is how one deploys what the camera produces that may well give&#151;sometimes inadvertently&#151;a distorted picture in its totality. But we live in an age of 24-hour news and visual news, and it is incumbent on us to accommodate that fact when communicating information ourselves. I take this opportunity to express my personal thanks to General Cooper and others, who, in very difficult circumstances, made themselves available to the media in order to give an authoritative voice from the theatre and to explain what was happening on the ground.

In an incident completed in four hours, rocket-propelled grenades, mortars and small arms were concentrated against our armed forces and the evidence suggests that the situation with regard to popular opinion towards our armed forces in southern Iraq has gone from relatively benign in 2003 to quite difficult. Will the Secretary of State bear that in mind, and apply the lessons to Afghanistan, where in Helmand province the situation is likely to be much more malign?</p>

Friend asked me to draw a comparison about the risk, and I do not feel able to do so&#151;but what I can say, of course, having spoken to those who on the ground, is that, in the parlance that they use, we appear to be going though a spike of violence. Their assessment of that, however, was reflected in the answer that I gave his hon. Friend, which was that it is an expression of the determination of those who want to stop Iraq becoming a democratic and free country, because they can see the direction of travel that is going on. I am afraid that I must disappoint the hon. Gentleman in response to the peroration of his question, because he invites me into a whole other theatre of conflict, and if the House does not mind, I will restrict myself to questions about the incident and Iraq at this stage and not be drawn into discussing Afghanistan at the moment.</p>

Unfortunately, on occasion, serious violent incidents arose from the behaviour of mobs and/or crowds. The one thing that I learned during that time was that it was very difficult to try to get to the bottom of the behaviour of a crowd of people. Sometimes crowds of people come together for perfectly innocent reasons, and then behave in mob ways that are difficult to fathom. That was my experience. I was reinforced in that analysis by comments that have come directly from officers in Basra in communications and interviews over the weekend. I have heard, I think, Brigadier Everard&#151;if I have identified the wrong officer, I apologise&#151;express exactly the same emotions in response to a question that he was asked in an interview&#151;on the BBC, I think.

The Government take a different view. The power to charge by reference to noise has been available to airports since 1982 and many of the larger airports already use it, such as Heathrow, Gatwick, Stansted, Aberdeen and Edinburgh. The provisions of the Bill have been brought forward to provide clear powers for airports to fix their charges by reference to aircraft emissions as well as aircraft noise. I am confident that airports will, again, make use of these provisions when appropriate, with no need for compulsion from the Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o56"><a name="60508-0006.htm_para4"><a name="0605082000256">The Government&#146;s policy for many years&#151;not solely under the current Administration&#151;has been that the local issue of the environmental impact of an airport should be resolved locally whenever possible. That policy reflects the diverse nature of airports and their operations. There are more than 140 licensed aerodromes in the United Kingdom to which the provisions of clause 1 will apply. They range from the busiest international airport in the world&#151;Heathrow&#151;to airports with only a handful of flights a day.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o57"><a name="60508-0006.htm_para5"><a name="0605082000257">Lords amendment No. 1, which would place an absolute duty upon airport operators to fix their charges with reference to the noise or emissions of aircraft, would run the risk of placing an undue regulatory burden on some airports, especially small airports. Not all airports are located or used in such a way that nuisance is caused to others. It will not always be appropriate to charge by reference to noise, for instance if the airport is used by only one class of aircraft causing comparable amounts of noise.</p>

Of course, we want airports to encourage the use of quieter aircraft. More modern aircraft are quieter than others.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o58"><a name="60508-0006.htm_para6"><a name="0605082000260">Clause 1, as it stands, allows the flexibility to account for the cases that I outlined, just as it will allow larger airports, such as Heathrow or Manchester, to reflect in their charging schemes the environmental impact of the aircraft that use them. However, I understand that hon. Members may be worried that some airport operators might not wish to take up the powers, even if local circumstances meant there was a strong case for doing so. Proposed new subsection (4) of section 38 of the Civil Aviation Act 1982, which is contained in clause 1, gives the Secretary of State the power to direct, by order subject to the negative procedure, specified aerodromes to make use of the powers in the clause. That provision might be used in cases when the voluntary measures prove ineffective.</p>

The noise or emissions requirements are thus concerned with aircraft taking off or landing at the aerodrome in question. Will the Minister tell me whether the expressions &#147;taking off&#148; and &#147;landing&#148; are defined anywhere in the Bill? For example, would they cover aeroplanes that were coming in to land, but some miles away from the airport&#151;I am thinking of aircraft flying over my constituents as they come into Nottingham East Midlands airport&#151;or aircraft that take off from Nottingham East Midlands airport and then climb into the skies above my constituents?</p>

Although the Government agree that it is reasonable that airport operators should be expected to set noise charges that are proportionate, we do not agree that that is something that needs to be provided for in the Bill. Airports have been making use of the power to set noise-related charges for more than 20 years and there has been no suggestion that they have not done so in an appropriate or proportionate way. However, if there is a problem with the charging scheme, the Secretary of State will have the power that I mentioned to direct an airport operator regarding the manner in which its charges are to be fixed. The airport should be subject to the control scheme that it sets up to address the effects of its operations on the locality. There areother considerations on airport charging, such as international guidance that noise-related charges  <br>

Again, we did not think it necessary to make those considerations statutory requirements. The existing provisions function well, and they do not need to be altered in any way.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o61"><a name="60508-0006.htm_para9"><a name="0605082000265">Lords amendment No. 3 is a minor technical amendment to clarify the provisions of clause 1, which inserts a new section 38 into the 1982 Act.

As the Minister explained, Lords amendment No. 2 makes those charges proportionate to the noise made. The remaining Lords amendments are relatively minor amendments on noise. There is all the difference in the world between the compulsion expressed in the word, &#147;shall&#148;, and the vague non-committal aspiration in &#147;may&#148;. This is an almost completely empty Bill, and in tabling those amendments the House of Lords sought to tweak the Government&#146;s tail so that they would do something about the problem. The amendments try to tease out an explanation from the Government as to whether the Bill will, in fact, do something or is just another eye-catching initiative.</p>

Aviation on its own explains why they have risen since the Government came to power. <i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ] </i>My right hon. Friend the Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood) has pointed to another possible source of rising emissions. The Bill, however, does not include any targets, sliding scales, rewards for airlines and airports for successfully tackling noise and emissions, or measures of success. Indeed, there is not even an obligation to measure, let alone report, progress or success. Above all, there is no compulsion at any point. In Committee, the hon.

The amendments were tabled out of sheer frustration in the Lords, where there were no more answers on what the Government will do about environmental problems than we have received in this House. They seek to introduce an element of compulsion into clause 1, and when the Minister winds up the debate, I hope that he will indicate what the Government are actually going to do on noise around our airports and on emissions of oxides of nitrogen and of CO2.</p>

What worries me about the Government&#146;s failure to accept the Lords amendment and the Minister&#146;s failure to elaborate how the Government&#146;s system would operate effectively is that nothing is being done on tackling noise emissions and NO2 emissions.</p>

It is often said that we have reached the stage with the aviation industry that we reached on the control of emissions from cars 30 years ago, when we had a long debate, which led us to incentivise research and development on improvements to engines and overall design and to control the usage of cars through either vehicle taxation levies or fuel duties.

clarification of how it will be exercised, lets them off the hook. That means that we will progress no further and that areas will still be blighted by emissions from the aviation industry. From my own perspective, this proves that yet again the aviation industry has dominated the policy-making network that surrounds the Department for Transport, while the voices of environmentalists and of constituents who are suffering as a result of these emissions have not been heard.</p>

What would be the forum in which they would make those representations? What would be the role of individual MPs representing their constituents? At what stage would the consultation take place? How will these matters be brought before the House?

Without compulsion, we will go on for decades without having a real and direct impact. As a representative of the constituency in which Heathrow is sited, I am aware that even with existing legislation and voluntary agreements, my constituents&#146; quality of life is directly affected by the noise and emissions that pollute the atmosphere. It was recently estimated that 5,000 of my constituents are being poisoned by air pollution from the airport.</p>

On the other hand, Coventry, which shares the same airspace, has no such noise monitoring in place. Consequently, the older, noisier, principally freight-based aircraft use Coventry airport because it is not subject to the same controls.

I am delighted that, at last, the so-called peripheral communities are getting their fair share of say in Government policy on the matter, but I do not believe that working out the charges for noise and emissions at Tiree airport would be especially onerous. It would take most people approximately five minutes.

To pick up on his argument, although Nottingham East Midlands airport&#151;Manchester Airport Group&#151;would be compelled under the Lords amendment to enter into arrangements that set up an effective charging regime, there is no template or scheme, designed by the Civil Aviation Authority, the Manchester Airport Group or, still less, the Secretary of State for Transport, to show an errant airport, lazy airport or uncaring airport, if one can have such a description of an inanimate object, how to treat its neighbours. The word &#147;shall&#148; could compel them to enter into a regime that creates a charging system, but which sets the charges at a ridiculously low level.

Were a factory emitting noxious fumes all night, somebody would do something about it, but the Government say that it is nothing to do with them, that they simply set the policy in the White Paper and that what happens next is down to local decision making.

I do not expect the Minister to spend much time on that issue, but I can inform him that the general aviation sector, which probably has not been organised or strategic enough in the past in developing links with his Department, is concerned that announcements intended to check noise and emissions from large jets actually punish the smaller aircraft that are not the problem. I hope that the Minister will also confirm that he is willing to continue to develop the relationships that his immediate predecessor was developing effectively, to ensure that general and business general aviation will be taken into consideration when legislation and amendments&#151;such as those we are discussing&#151;are proposed. I am happy to work with him on an informal cross-party basis to ensure strategic consideration of that important economic sector, which does not cause the environmental and noise disturbances that so vex many people living near large airports.</p>

It is implicit in the Bill that the Secretary of State has powers to direct airports to use the powers that they have if they are not doing so.

The current legislation&#151;section 78(3) of the 1982 Act&#151;requires that the operating restrictions set for that purpose include a numerical limit on aircraft movements. At present, therefore, the night-flying restrictions at the designated airports&#151;currently Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted&#151;are based on both a numerical movements limit and a noise quota set for each summer and winter season. The noise quota is designed to encourage the use of quieter aircraft. In the White Paper, &#147;The Future of Air Transport&#148;, the Government said that we would amend the current legislation, so that operating restrictions could be set on a different basis in future&#151;for example, one more directly related to the noise nuisance caused.

The restriction could, for example, take the form of noise quotas or a limiting noise contour area. The Secretary of State would not be prevented from continuing to set movement limits, but could consider alternatives&#151;for instance, if they provided a more effective incentive to use quieter aircraft.

However, a movements limit alone would be a pretty blunt instrument because it would not directly control the amount of noise permitted at night, and neither could it influence the types of aircraft used at night.

<p><a name="stpa_o129"><a name="60508-0009.htm_para8"><a name="06050848000005">The Government&#146;s announcement a few minutes ago about Heathrow to 2012 is welcome but prompts questions about other designated airports and Heathrow after 2012. As hon. Members know only too well, the issue is the balance between numbers and quotas as a means of controlling noise. The mitigation of noise and vibration from aircraft taking off and landing at designated airports&#151;Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted&#151;is achieved, as the Minister said, by restricting the number of movements and by the noise quota. Noise can be a considerable impediment to the quality of life of people who live near an airport or under a flight path, as Members on both sides have made clear. If the noise of an aircraft taking off wakes someone, it does not matter if it is only just loud enough to do so or is extremely loud. Furthermore, as has been made clear by Lord Hanningfield, our Front-Bench spokesman in another place, the quota system itself, which is all that will be left, is highly technical and often incomprehensible to the people it is meant to protect.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o130"><a name="60508-0009.htm_para9"><a name="06050848000006">Less noise does not always mean less disturbance, and that is emphatically the case if the system of measurement leaves something to be desired. While noise is measured in decibels, the level equivalent&#151;Leq&#151;is an index of aircraft noise exposure. It is a measure of the equivalent continuous sound level averaged over a 16-hour day from 0700 to 2300, and is taken during the peak summer months from mid-June to mid-September. The Heathrow Association for the Control of Aircraft Noise&#151;HACAN&#151;and Clear Skies, a voluntary organisation that campaigns on behalf of people affected by flight paths, have issued a joint paper that makes interesting reading. It argues that the level equivalent system underestimates aircraft noise in three key areas. First, it can be misleading to average out aircraft noise, for the obvious reason that if someone is woken by noise, it does not make much difference how loud it is. Secondly, low-frequency noise is ignored by the measure. Thirdly, and crucially, the Leq classifications often underestimate the minimum level of noise that annoys people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o131"><a name="60508-0009.htm_para10"><a name="06050848000007">The HACAN-Clear Skies report claims that low-frequency rumbling is a significant component of aircraft noise. Including it in the measurement can increase the noise of a plane passing overhead by about 8 decibels. More to the point, many improvements in aircraft noise are primarily concerned with mid to high-frequencies. Perhaps the best way to illustrate its shortcomings is to cite the example given by Lord Hanningfield, who said that</p>

Unfortunately, a vast proportion of that traffic still consists of cars and larger vehicles travelling through the areas surrounding Heathrow and through my constituency at night, disturbing the peace of residents.</p>

The combination of overall limits and limits on numbers had some effect. The removal of the numbers will have a deleterious effect on my constituents because it will blight their environment and, as some have said, their properties for a long time to come.

chance to speak against Government amendment (a), which is not only illogical, but sneaky, unworkable and underhand; it seeks to remove protections and open up the night skies to a flight bonanza.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o153"><a name="60508-0010.htm_para17"><a name="06050848000043">Let us be clear that the frequency of noisy flights ruins the sleep of residents. The economic benefit associated with the use of airports for business activity is certainly desirable, and if air traffic needs to expand, perhaps we can allow for it in the long term with quieter aircraft, provided that air quality is kept within tight limits and access to airports is available. However, it is a sobering thought that our tourists spend &#163;16 billion more abroad than incoming tourists spend visiting the UK, which is perhaps an issue for the Chancellor of the Exchequer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o154"><a name="60508-0010.htm_para18"><a name="06050848000044">The Civil Aviation Act 1982 empowered the Secretary of State to limit the number of flights at designated airports. A straightforward limit on the number of flights is easily understood by everyone; for example, 16 flights are currently allowed at Heathrow during the night period and, despite the disturbance, affected residents know what that limit means. If the noise associated with a particular flight is louder than 90 dB on the ground, people are likely to be rudely awakened. It is the noise created by individual aircraft combined with the number of flights during the night that disturbs residents&#146; sleep.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o155"><a name="60508-0010.htm_para19"><a name="06050848000045">Government amendment (a) is strange. It proposes that at some future point the noise made by individual aircraft and the number of flights during the course of the night will be ignored. Instead, the Government want to rely on a complicated scheme based on average noise levels during a night period. Average noise levels have never woken anyone, because it is the absolute noise and frequency of flights that disturbs people. We must ask ourselves why the Government propose to scupper Lords amendments Nos. 5 and 11, which are sensible.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o156"><a name="60508-0010.htm_para20"><a name="06050848000046">Let us take a quick look at how the Government&#146;s scheme will operate. The night noise quota scheme ranks aircraft types according to their noisiness on take-off and approach for landing. For example, if the noise is above 101.9 dB, the quota count for that aircraft is assigned as 16. If the noise is between 99 dB and 101.9 dB, the quota count for that aircraft is halved and becomes eight&#151;the scale is exponential. If the noise is between 96 dB and 98.9 dB, the quota count for that aircraft is halved again to four. The quota count continues until the noise level falls below 90 dB, when the aircraft is assigned a quota count of a half&#151;I hope that hon. Members are still with me. The Secretary of State then sets a limit on the total quota count points for the average across a season or a night period, which translates into a number of flights. If we were to use the pure quota count system that the Government are seeking to introduce today, twice as many flights would be allowed at night with planes rated at 95 dB than with planes rated at 96 dB. The system is complicated, and complicated systems are often designed to hide simple truths.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o157"><a name="60508-0010.htm_para21"><a name="06050848000047">Why have the Government introduced an amendment to remove the flight limit, after indicating in writing to many hon. Members that they would support the Lords amendment? There is only one  <br>

explanation, and I have heard no other so far: the Government want to allow an increase in the number of flights at night. As I have said, they have argued that the measure will not be introduced until 2012, but hon. Members should not be deceived. That is not a concession, because the arrangements until 2012 will be announced in the next week or so, and it is simply not possible for the Government to change that agreement before 2012. The Government are trying to appear reasonable by making a semi-concession, when they are in fact behaving completely unreasonably&#151;it is a phantom concession.</p>

I completely reject Government policy in this area, which is ridiculous, and is just a ruse to pretend that they are making a concession. There is no concession, so there is nothing to discuss. The White Paper said that the Government would bear down on noise, but in reality they are easing up on noise. Hon. Members must ask themselves whether they want to be responsible for easing up on noise and on night flights. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o158"><a name="60508-0010.htm_para22"><a name="06050848000050">There is a better way, although I do not have time to go into the detail. We should retain the limit on flights and accelerate the arrival of significantly quieter aircraft. In time, perhaps we can set a limit on the maximum noise generated by aircraft movements at night. Above all, we can reject the Government&#146;s sneaky amendment today, which will undermine the one sure route to secure a decent night&#146;s sleep for residents. I urge hon. Members to vote against Government amendment (a) and to maintain the flight limit, for the sake of the millions of people who will be affected.</p>

The Government came to power saying that they would be the servants of the people not the masters, but they have completely reversed that position by systematically ignoring millions of people in the south-east, particularly in London, and going ahead with their proposal to take away the cap on movements into and out of Heathrow, irrespective of what local people say.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o160"><a name="60508-0011.htm_para1"><a name="06050848000055">After the first stage of the night flights consultation, I asked the Government to tell me precisely how many people had asked for an increase in night flights, given that that was the proposal in stage 2. I received no answer of substance. As the Minister may be aware, I went down to the Department for Transport to look through the responses and correspondence that it had received after stage 1. I found a total of three people who wrote in suggesting more night flights. I saw responses from councils representing 2.3 million people who had expressed their concerns over the current level of night flights, with most wanting them eventually to be reduced to zero and many wanting that to happen immediately. I saw correspondence from more than 1,000 individual constituents and petitions from several hundred constituents all saying that they were concerned about the existing level of night flights and wanted a reduction.</p>

People in my constituency are expected to be pleased because the Government have not made the situation any worse. That is unacceptable. They have been systematically ignored, and that will not be sustainable in the long run. The Government talk about sustainable communities and sustainable development, but that seems to end when it comes to airport expansion. One has to ask why so many millions of constituents can be ignored over such a prolonged period. That suggests that any ongoing consultations are merely a sham that do not recognise the real consultations that are going on behind the scenes with aircraft and airline operators. Today I tabled parliamentary questions to elicit from the Government what meetings they have had with aircraft operators and other interested industry participants. If the Minister can answer tonight, I will be interested to hear the outcome.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o162"><a name="60508-0011.htm_para3"><a name="06050848000057">The Government cannot scratch their head and wonder why people do not turn out to vote in local and national elections when they ignore people so systematically on such a clear issue as the expansion of Heathrow, night flights and movement limits on all airports&#151;not only Heathrow but Stansted and Gatwick.

I take issue with the hon.

That is always difficult, and there will of course be differences of opinion among Members. I have an airport on my doorstep and planes flying over my house. I understand the issues that local residents will raise about disturbance, because I deal with that from my own constituents. It is a balancing act in terms of the problems that can be caused, and the economics. For example, large numbers of people are employed in the industry.</p>

Some stakeholders argue in favour of movement limits and against setting night restrictions by referring to overall noise, because each instance of an aircraft flying overhead disturbs someone. The hon. Member for Canterbury made that point earlier when we considered low frequency noise.

Sleep disturbance is no exception. Despite extensive research, views differ both among those who suffer from noise and among the scientific community about whether a single loud noise or event, or an accumulation of smaller noises and events, cause more disturbance. I accept that the matter is subjective, but there is discussion and argument about it.</p>

World Health Organisation&#146;s guideline values for night noise is consistent with its recommendations. The guideline values on aircraft noise were recommended as long-term targets for improving health.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o168"><a name="60508-0011.htm_para9"><a name="06050848000078">The values are low, and it would therefore be difficult, if not impossible, to achieve them in the short to medium term without draconian measures. I ask my hon. Friend to bear that in mind. However, the World Organisation did not propose that. It would not be feasible to reduce noise to such a level in urban or rural settings generally, and the World Health Organisation did not suggest that. We are committed to taking account of the guideline values, and we will do that over the 30-year time horizon of the air transport White Paper.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o169"><a name="60508-0011.htm_para10"><a name="06050848000079">We also support the World Health Organisation&#146;s conclusions about regular reviews and revisions to the guidelines as new scientific evidence emerges.</p>

The so-called average amount of noise generated through the night is difficult to measure&#151;indeed, given the lack of response by protesters to individual flights that appear to have deviated from their flight paths or perhaps should not have taken place, it seems to be impossible in some cases.</p>

We must remember how subjective people&#146;s judgments can be, and how important it is to address this issue while taking account of the economy and trying to strike the balance that I have been talking about.</p>

We also support the WHO conclusions for regular reviews and revisionsto the guidelines as new scientific evidence emerges. The guidelines also recommend that cost-effectivenessand cost-benefit analyses should be considered when making management decisions relating to their implementation. The Government are carrying out this process as part of the regulatory impact assessment of the restrictions, which my hon. Friend the Member for Hayes and Harlington might find interesting.</p>

It is worth emphasising that research has suggested that the incidence of sleep disturbance is especially associated with the loudest noise events, and in particular those that produce more than a 90 dB sound exposure level.

Friend is saying, but has not the point been made by Opposition Members that the frequency of aircraft movements is much more important? According to the way in which these things are calculated for regulation purposes, one very loud noise is the equivalent of several much smaller noises. Luton airport is three or four miles from where I live, but I can still hear flights taking off at night on rare occasions, even though they are not very loud. The frequency is much more important than the volume. Surely the Government should be more concerned about the number of flights than about the volume, as Opposition Members have pointed out.</p>

Flights come over my house, and I understand that this can be an issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o173"><a name="60508-0011.htm_para14"><a name="06050848000087">As I said a moment ago, research has suggested that the incidence of sleep disturbance is especially associated with the loudest noise events, and in particular those that produce more than a 90 dB sound exposure level. That measure expresses the level of a noise event as though all its energy were concentrated evenly in one second. It takes account of the duration of the sound and its intensity. A plot connecting points of equal sound exposure level from the departure or approach of a particular type of aircraft&#151;or an envelope of the two&#151;is known as a noise footprint. Hon. Members have already mentioned such footprints.</p>

We have undertaken a considerable amount of research into the effects of aircraft noise on sleep. The last major study commissioned by the Government, completed in 1992, concluded that high aircraft noise levels could awaken people, but that the likelihood of the average person having his or her sleep noticeably disturbed due to an individual aircraft noise event was relatively low. That research was carried out in 1992, and I am sure that hon. Members will have their own view about its relevance and accuracy today. However, when considering numbers of aircraft movements, it is important to bear in mind that modern aircraft are much quieter than their predecessors.</p>

We have had neither a specific study of sleep deprivation north of the airport nor a health study to examine the impact on the local community of emissions surrounding the airport.

Friend makes an important point about the disbenefits of air pollution. He may be aware that the Government published the air quality strategy for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland in January 2000 and that the strategy sets health-based objectives for the eight main air pollutants and deadlines for achieving them. It identifies the action required at national and international level and the contribution that the Government, industry, transport, local authorities, businesses and individuals can make to improving air quality.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o176"><a name="60508-0012.htm_para0"><a name="06050848000102">I know that this issue will concern you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, but the Environment Act 1995 places a duty on local authorities to review and assess the current and likely future air quality in their areas against the national objectives set out in the strategy and prescribed in the air quality regulations. The local authority role is important and if a local authority considers that one or more of the air quality objectives is unlikely to be met by the required date, it must declare an air quality management area covering the area in which the problems are expected. It must then draw up an action plan, setting out the measures that it intends to take in pursuit of air quality objectives.</p>

There are differing views among those who suffer from the problem as to whether a single loud noise or an accumulation of smaller noise events causes more disturbance. It is clear that disturbance is different from annoyance and from sleep deprivation, which relates to lengthy periods without sleep. It is also acknowledged that a small minority of people are much more sensitive to noise and sleep disturbance from aircraft noise than others. That is the important point.</p>

In contrast, a social survey conducted in parallel reported that a substantial percentage of those interviewed in higher noise areas reported being highly disturbed by aircraft at night.</p>

then commissioned a major new study to concentrate on subjective responses to annoyance from aircraft noise and examined, in a hypothetical way, the willingness to pay, in respect of the nuisance from aircraft noise.

We expect that the study, which has been guided by the steering group of a wide range of interests including environmental organisations who are represented, to be completed by about the middle of the year. The work is divided into two phases. Phase 1 has now been completed and has developed a stated preference methodology by carrying out a number of pilot surveys&#151;[Hon.

The schedule amends the Aviation Security Act 1982 in relation to the policing of airports that have been designated under section 25 of the Act&#151;Heathrow, Gatwick, Stansted, Birmingham, Manchester, Prestwick, Edinburgh, Glasgow and Aberdeen airports. Recently, it became clear that we needed to clarify the relationship between security and policing activities at designated airports. Increased clarity on that point should prevent future disputes between airport managers and the police. It has also become clear that we need to design a robust mechanism for resolving any disputes that arise.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o193"><a name="60508-0012.htm_para17"><a name="06050848000629">The amendments to section 26 of the Aviation Security Act 1982 will define and clarify the relationship between the activities of an airport manager and other directed parties at an airport, and policing activities. Our intention in doing so is to prevent disputes on that point and to ensure that the aerodrome manager and chief officer of police work closely together in protecting an airport. The amendments are in paragraph 3 of the schedule.</p>


<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060508/debtext/60508-0013.htm"/>



<p><a name="stpa_o194"><a name="60508-0013.htm_para0"><a name="06050848000630">Where an aerodrome has been designated under section 25 of the Aviation Security Act 1982, the manager of the aerodrome, the police authority and the chief officer of police will be required to enter into a police services agreement. The specific requirement is in new section 25B, which is inserted in the 1982 Act by paragraph 2 of the schedule. To remove any ambiguity over roles and responsibilities, the agreement should set out the level of policing services to be provided by the police, the amount to be paid for that policing by the airport manager and the facilities to be provided by him to the police. That is set out in section 25B(3).The specification of payments in the agreement may also include references to amounts paid to the police  <br>

authority towards policing at the airport from sources other than the airport manager. We are thinking, for example, of Home Office grants that might be made to fund a particular initiative.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o195"><a name="60508-0013.htm_para1"><a name="06050848000631">The agreement will need to recognise that circumstances might change during the year. Section 25A(6) requires an agreement to include provisions that will allow it to be varied where there is a material change in circumstances. Before concluding an agreement, and to determine the appropriate level of policing services, the aerodrome manager and chief officer of police will be required to consult with the relevant stakeholders: those in receipt of directions under part 2 of the Aviation SecurityAct 1982, Customs officers and immigration officers. New section 25A provides for that consultation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o196"><a name="60508-0013.htm_para2"><a name="06050848000632">Section 25A includes a delegated power for the Secretary of State to modify the consultation requirements, in subsection (4). Under new section 25A(5), the degree of parliamentary scrutiny prescribed is dependent on whether there is any controversy about such changes. I should note that new section 25A(6) was subsequently amended by the Lords on Report. That minor change for clarification, which does not alter the substance of the provisions, has been taken up in the version of the schedule that we are debating today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o197"><a name="60508-0013.htm_para3"><a name="06050848000633">Where the parties&#151;the aerodrome manager, police authority and chief officer of police&#151;cannot reach an agreement because they disagree on a particular aspect such as the level of policing to be provided, or are in dispute over the terms, construction or operation ofan agreement, the matter will be referred for determination by an independent expert or tribunal of experts. Paragraph 4 of the schedule therefore inserts new sections 29A to 29D into the Act. Under new section 29A(1), any of the three parties is entitled to ask the Secretary of State to set up the expert determination. The expert should be an independent person appointed by the Secretary of State for the particular dispute, and agreed by the aerodrome manager on one side and the police parties on the other. If the parties cannot agree, the Secretary of State will require each side to appoint an expert and those two experts to appoint a further panel member to act as chairman. New section 29B provides for those arrangements.</p>

We were also working in the aftermath of a failed deal somesix months earlier, and in the knowledge that there was a realistic prospect that if we did not secure a deal, it would hold up the development of the accession states and delay a budget agreement by up to two years. In the EU presidency, we were determined to agree a budget that would enable the European Union to deliver for its citizens in the areas where it adds real value, and to make good our commitments to the new accession states.</p>

Does he agree that&#151;as the European commissioner has just announced&#151;the actual amount is &#163;24 billion above the budget that the Prime Minister announced, which means that the British taxpayer will have to find an extra &#163;2 billion and we will now contribute &#163;44 billion to EU coffers over the next budget period?

I am confident that the co-operation that we have seen in recent times&#151;not least in agreeing this budget&#151;will lead in that direction, so, yes, I am hopeful, but at the moment, no, there is no realistic prospect hope of achieving the aim that the hon.

<p><a name="stpa_o217"><a name="60508-0014.htm_para0"><a name="06050858000033">The budget agreed in December has four key elements. First and crucially, it supports economic development in central and eastern Europe&#151;a cause that the United Kingdom has consistently championed, and for which we should rightly pay on the same basis as others. The agreement provides an unprecedented transfer of receipts to the poorest member states of central and eastern Europe. Such transfers will provide the basis for economic development in those member states, making them and the EU more prosperous. Secondly, the rebate remains  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="8 May 2006">

<notus-date day="8" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>8 May 2006 : Column 93</b><br>
on all expenditure except economic development in the new member states. Thirdly, the total rebate over the next financial perspective will actually be larger than in the current period.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o218"><a name="60508-0014.htm_para1"><a name="06050858000034">Fourthly, the December agreement is fair. For the first time in the history of our membership of the EU, we have rough parity with France and Italy in terms of net contributions. I repeat: at every stage of the negotiation, this Government made it clear, here and in Brussels, that the UK abatement remains fully justified because of our disproportionately low level of EU receipts. Without the abatement, the UK would have paid, net, 10 times as much as Italy and 13 times as much as France over the last decade. It is therefore absolutely right that under the agreement reached in December, the UK abatement remains and will in fact be worth more than in the current budgetary period.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o219"><a name="60508-0014.htm_para2"><a name="06050858000035">It is also important, however, that the UK pays its fair share of the costs of enlargement in return for the economic, political and social benefits that enlargement brings. That is why we agreed that spending on economic development in the new member states could gradually be disapplied from the abatement calculation from 2009. But we were also clear that the UK would not pay more than its fair share, which is why the UK abatement will be applied in full on all expenditure in the 15 original member states, and on CAP expenditure everywhere in the EU.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o220"><a name="60508-0014.htm_para3"><a name="06050858000037">Overall, under the December agreement, the UK will go from paying two and a half times more than France and Italy over the last decade to paying roughly the same, net, as those countries as a proportion of national income, for the first time since we joined the EU. That is a good and fair result for the UK and, indeed, for our EU partners. Agreement on the budget deal is only the beginning of a process to ensure that the EU has a more rational and logical budget that more effectively supports the EU&#146;s longer-term aims. This Government&#146;s arguments in favour of budget discipline have resulted in agreement to an effective and controlled budget that focuses on the EU&#146;s priorities. Overall, expenditure as a share of EU income willfall to some 1 per cent. by 2013&#151;the lowest level in20 years. Yet within this disciplined budget, sufficient funding is guaranteed across the range of theUnion&#146;s priorities, such as competitiveness, research and development, freedom, security and justice, and development assistance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o221"><a name="60508-0014.htm_para4"><a name="06050858000038">The package agreed under the UK presidency also contains a number of modernising elements. It offers member states the opportunity to shift money from CAP direct payments and market support to rural development, and creates a globalisation adjustment fund to help re-skill workers who lose out as a result of structural economic change. Furthermore, the agreement provides for a fundamental review of all aspects of the budget, on the basis of the Commission&#146;s 2008-09 report, on which the Council can take immediate decisions. That sets the path towards a modern budget fit for the 21st century that responds to the challenges of globalisation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o222"><a name="60508-0014.htm_para5"><a name="06050858000039">Since December, negotiations have continued between the European Parliament, the Commission and the Council on an inter-institutional agreement for the next financial perspective. This is a usual feature of the EU&#146;s multi-annual budget process, and it is necessary for the expenditure side of the December deal to come into  <br>

effect. That debate continues the parliamentary procedure to endorse the IIA. The Government&#146;s prime objective in the IIA negotiation has been to ensure that it retains the main elements, and therefore the main benefits, of the December deal. The EU institutions reached provisional agreement on a new package last month. Overall, that agreement meets the Government&#146;s objectives and, subject to the agreement of this House, should establish the spending priorities agreed in December. It is due to be formally approved by EU Ministers on 15 May.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o223"><a name="60508-0014.htm_para6"><a name="06050858000040">Under the provisional agreement, the basic structure of the expenditure side is maintained, with an additional &#8364;2 billion of expenditure within the financial perspective ceiling and a further &#8364;2 billion of expenditure outside the financial perspective. Such additional funding is broadly comparable with the level agreed in the context of the 1999 IIA negotiation, and it will be set aside for priority areas supported by this Government, such as competitiveness and external action. It will result in an overall expenditure ceiling of &#8364;864 billion over the seven-year period.</p>

For the reasons that I have mentioned, that agreement represents a good and fair result for the UK and underlines the concept of using net balances in assessing relative contributions to the EU budget. Crucially, the own resources decision must retain the balance of net positions achieved in December, and ensure that the measures introduced to make the EU financing system simpler and more disciplined are preserved.</p>

It provides a fair and effective budget, focused on priorities, with a broadly stable expenditure ceiling, and rightly provides a foundation for economic development in the new member states. It also sets the path to fundamental reform, which should equip the EU with a modern, effective budget that meets the needs of its citizens and represents a modern Europe. I commend the agreement to the House.</p>

If it were not for its recommendation, the House would not have this opportunity to debate a matter that is of real and pressing concern to the country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o230"><a name="60508-0014.htm_para13"><a name="06050858000053">It is however regrettable that we do not have a full day for this important business and our debate will necessarily be truncated, not something for which the Minister for Europe could normally be expected to take responsibility, but as he was responsible&#151;as Leader of the House&#151;for scheduling this week&#146;s business, it is entirely down to him on this occasion. Nonetheless, I am delighted to see the Minister in his place. There have been times since Friday when I was worried that he might not be joining us, but I am very pleased to welcome him to his new job, or should I say back to his old job. I hope that he stays in the brief for longer than the three months that he managed before, all of which fell during the summer recess of 1999.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o231"><a name="60508-0014.htm_para14"><a name="06050858000054">In the less than two years that I have been shadowing Europe, he is already the third holder of his portfolio. Indeed, there has been no more consistency in personnel than there has been in the Government&#146;s European policy, which has variously been: in favour of the euro and against it; certain that a constitution for Europe was unnecessary and passionate in its belief that an enlarged EU could not function without one; determined to secure fundamental reform of the common agricultural policy, but happy to let months of the British presidency slip away without even tabling a proposal for change; and steadfast in defence of the British rebate, and yet prepared to surrender it while gaining nothing in return.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o232"><a name="60508-0014.htm_para15"><a name="06050858000055">It will be interesting to see whether the new Minister follows the avowedly integrationist agenda of the current Prime Minister or the apparently more sceptical tone of the next one. His longevity in office may depend on him making the right decision. This debate is a welcome opportunity for the House to examine the shambolic events of the last 12 months as the Government have not only failed to achieve their targets, but&#151;having conceded an unnecessarily costly budget deal in December&#151;have flaccidly observed as the cost has escalated and the assurances they gave to British voters have proved worthless.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o233"><a name="60508-0014.htm_para16"><a name="06050858000056">The experience of the British EU presidency and of the budget negotiations has been sadly typical of the utter incompetence of this Labour Government. It all started so well, as so often, with the Prime Minister&#146;s speech to the European Parliament&#151;a speech about a &#147;crisis of political leadership&#148;. Well, he should know that when he sees it. He spoke stirringly of the need to reconnect Europe with its peoples, and he spoke of a &#147;moment of decision&#148;. He also set out Britain&#146;s bottom line for the budget negotiations, linking any reduction of the British rebate to fundamental reform of the CAP and saying in terms that</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o235"><a name="60508-0014.htm_para18"><a name="06050858000058">But like all the Prime Minister&#146;s promises, all that has come to nothing and the ambition of his rhetoric serves only to emphasise the scale of his failure and of the massive opportunity that he has missed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o236"><a name="60508-0014.htm_para19"><a name="06050858000059">The Minister spoke about the need to finance enlargement. As he said, the Opposition have always strongly supported enlargement, but the necessary funds for that process should have come from reductions in the bloated CAP budget, not from growth in the overall budget.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o237"><a name="60508-0014.htm_para20"><a name="06050858000060">At the beginning of their presidency, the Government set out to achieve three things&#151;to contain the overall size of the EU budget, to achieve fundamental reform of the common agricultural policy and to protect Britain&#146;s budget rebate, at least until such a fundamental revision of the CAP was agreed. None of those objectives was secured.</p>

<p><a name="st_o334"><a name="06050858000061"><a name="60508-0014.htm_spnew6"><a name="06050858000390"><b>Keith Vaz: </b>The hon.

Bearing in mind that there was no fundamental review of the CAP, will he not accept that the budget was the best deal in the circumstances to ensure that the new countries would be properly financed?</p>

<p><a name="st_o335"><a name="06050858000062"><a name="60508-0014.htm_spnew7"><a name="06050858000391"><b>Mr. Brady:</b> Absolutely not. I am delighted to welcome another former Minister for Europe to the debate, but the Prime Minister&#146;s speech to the European Parliament at the outset of the British presidency made it clear that a better deal could be obtained, and that was his objective. However, it was not secured.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o238"><a name="60508-0014.htm_para21"><a name="06050858000063">The EU budget is rising. The common agricultural policy has not only gone without fundamental reform, but is actually getting bigger. According to last December&#146;s joint report from the Treasury and the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs&#151;then under the leadership of the new Foreign Secretary&#151;the CAP will leave the EU economy some &#8364;100 billion poorer over the next financial perspective 2007-2013, with a further &#8364;100 billion cost to consumers every year, in a combination of taxes and inflated food prices. That amounts to an average cost for a family of four of around &#8364;950 a year, and that cost will be far higher for families in the UK, as a major net contributor.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o239"><a name="60508-0014.htm_para22"><a name="06050858000066">The Prime Minister told this House in July that he wanted to get rid of the CAP, but in fact it will increase from 40 per cent. of the EU budget now, to 44 per cent. under the new arrangements. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said last September:</p>
<a name="60508-0014.htm_brev2"><a name="06050858000321"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;If we are to make poverty history, let us seek to make the excesses of the CAP history&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o240"><a name="60508-0014.htm_para23"><a name="06050858000067">Far from ending the excesses of the CAP, the Prime Minister agreed to a deal that increased its costs considerably. Billions more euros will be spent on protecting and sheltering inefficient and counter-productive agricultural subsidies.</p>

<p><a name="st_o338"><a name="06050858000068"><a name="60508-0014.htm_spnew10"><a name="06050858000394"><b>Mr. Wayne David (Caerphilly) (Lab):</b> Does the hon. Gentleman acknowledge that the new financial perspective agreement is very good news for some regions of the United Kingdom? West Wales and the south Wales valleys will receive about &#163;1.2 billion in cohesion funding. Is that not good news?</p>

<p><a name="st_o339"><a name="06050858000069"><a name="60508-0014.htm_spnew11"><a name="06050858000395"><b>Mr. Brady:</b> I am delighted to hear that south Wales will do well from the funding, but the hon. Gentleman must be aware&#151;as we all should be&#151;that it is British taxpayers&#146; money; it is simply being recycled through EU institutions, losing administrative costs meanwhile. It would be far more efficient, as I think the Chancellor of the Exchequer believes too, to pay the money directly, and I do not see why we cannot look into doing that instead.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o241"><a name="60508-0014.htm_para24"><a name="06050858000070">Given all those issues, no wonder the Prime Minister identified the urgency of reform, but how shocking that reform has not been addressed. Not only did the Prime Minister fail to secure real reform of the CAP, but having linked the future of the British rebate to that reform he gave up &#163;7 billion of the rebate while getting nothing in return. That &#163;7 billion alone is equivalent to the total annual budget for policing in England and Wales.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o242"><a name="60508-0014.htm_para25"><a name="06050858000071">The surrender on the rebate is only a small part of the increased cost to British taxpayers, however; the net cost of our payments to the EU will increase by far more. At present, we pay in about &#163;2.8 billion a year more than we get out. Under the deal agreed in December, that net cost almost doubles to &#163;5.5 billion every year. Furthermore, as the hon. Member for Luton, North (Kelvin Hopkins) pointed out, those funds do not always go to the most deserving places. Under the new financial perspective, we will pay in a fifth more than the French, but we shall get back only half as much. Per capita EU spending in the UK will be a quarter of the figure in Ireland and will be lower than in any of the other, soon to be 27, member states. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o243"><a name="60508-0014.htm_para26"><a name="06050858000072">Remarkably, the expensive new Foreign Office booklet, &#147;Guide to the European Union&#148;, which cost taxpayers a further &#163;80,000 to produce, notes thatthe existing net cost is &#163;3 billion a year&#151;[<i> Interruption.</i>] The hon. Member for Leicester, East (Keith Vaz) is clutching his copy, so at least somebody was waiting for it to arrive on their doormat.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o244"><a name="60508-0014.htm_para27"><a name="06050858000073">The booklet makes no mention, however, of the fact that the cost is set to double from 2007.</p>

If the hon.

<p><a name="stpa_o245"><a name="60508-0015.htm_para0"><a name="06050858000078">No wonder the Chancellor was furious; no wonder he thinks he would have done a better job&#151;it would be hard to have achieved a worse deal for Britain and British taxpayers.

There has been considerable speculation that the Chancellor was kept in the dark throughout the process of agreeing the budget, even though he will have the task of trying to find the funds if the Prime Minister remains in office. Of course, if the Chancellor were to become Prime Minister, he would face a significant challenge.</p>

Member for Buckingham and the agricultural policy, which is in need of absolute reform&#151;no Labour Member pretends otherwise. The deal was important at that stage.

the Minister for Europe has an important job, so it is important that it is held by a senior Minister and, moreover, someone with a long and commendable pedigree on European affairs. To that extent, I welcome the Minister to his role.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o271"><a name="60508-0016.htm_para6"><a name="06050858000140">Speaking as a former member of the diplomatic service, however, there is one thing about the Minister&#146;s appointment that has saddened me. The diplomatic service is one of the few Government departments that is not seriously dysfunctional, yet it has suffered the fate, a bit like Caesar&#146;s Gaul, of being divided into three parts. Development was taken out, and now the department has been split into Europe and non-Europe. A perfectly efficient department has been split, while the Home Office and the Department for Work and Pensions continue on their merry way. That is a strange way of managing government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o272"><a name="60508-0016.htm_para7"><a name="06050858000141">I approach the European Union and its finances from a very different perspective from that of the hon. Member for Altrincham and Sale, West (Mr. Brady). I basically believe that the European Union is good for the UK, but I agree with his conclusions on the subject of our debate. The deal was very bad, and that came about because the Government utterly failed to secure their negotiating objectives. As I understood it, and as was clearly stated on many occasions, the objective was to make concessions on the budget rebate to secure fundamental reform of the way in which the European Union&#146;s funding was run, especially on agriculture. That was not achieved&#151;indeed, it was not even begun to be achieved. None the less, the objective was right.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o273"><a name="60508-0016.htm_para8"><a name="06050858000142">It was equally right for the Government to say that to support the process of enlargement, we needed to make concessions on the rebate. The enlargementhas so far been a success. It is now difficult to believe that 15 years ago, the enlargement countries were communist countries. Enlargement is a success story, with rapid growth and liberalisation in stable democracies. It has been successful in much the same way as the expansion of Europe to absorb the former fascist countries of southern Europe was successful. We need to reinforce that success, and we could have done so through the budget process. It would be utterly wrong to continue to defend an arrangement under which we were net recipients from eastern Europe. The Government were therefore right to set themselves the negotiating objective of trading off the rebate against fundamental reform.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o274"><a name="60508-0016.htm_para9"><a name="06050858000143">There were, however, two failures. Saying that the rebate was non-negotiable throughout most of last year was a presentational failure, as it was clearly negotiable and was, in fact, being negotiated. That position therefore did not make sense, and the Government made themselves look foolish. There was a substantive failure to achieve anything concrete or measurable in agricultural reform. The reason for that goes back three years to the agreement between France and Germany, which Britain apparently endorsed, to settle the European agricultural budget and agricultural policy until 2013.</p>

the common agricultural policy is utterly indefensible. It is economic nonsense, it is environmentally damaging, and it does enormous damage to world trade and to developing countries. However, in 2002 the British Government, for whatever reason&#151;perhaps they took their eye off the ball because they were preoccupied with Iraq&#151;accepted an arrangement that cemented the CAP in place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o280"><a name="60508-0017.htm_para1"><a name="06050858000165">There have been attempts to set up trade adjustment funds in different countries over the past 30 years. I conducted some work on that point in the late 1970s and early 1980s, with particular regard to the United States, where a similar fund was set up in the mid-1970s. That fund ran into all kinds of problems, not least because some workers asked, &#147;Why should people be compensated because of trade competition, whereas other workers who have suffered from technological change or a collapse in markets should not be compensated?&#148; The political problems and problems of equity that arose were serious. There was some extremely unhelpful gaming behaviour, whereby industrial pressure groups secured trade protection in order to negotiate it off against money from the trade adjustment fund, and it is possible to envisage that kind of behaviour creeping into the European Union. The globalisation fund needs to be watched careful, although on balance it should be given an opportunity to prove itself.</p>

I support that principle, but last week I participated in an Adjournment debate on science in British universities, and it is clear that British universities are at best sceptical about the concept, because although they have funding problems of their own, they are looking to collaborate across the world, in particular with the United States. They are also interested in securing a better funding formula in the UK, and see little advantage in having a specifically European project concerned with science.

Before doing so, I want to comment on my right hon. Friend the Minister for Europe, who is not in his place at the moment, but whom I have already welcomed. I hope that he is going to prove to be more of a pragmatist than a zealot in these matters. We will probably never agree on European matters, at least publicly, but I hope that he will look at the European Union in a practical way and will not be blinded by the dream of a European federal state, which some people say that they are against although they are really in favour, while some of us are genuinely opposed to it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o283"><a name="60508-0017.htm_para4"><a name="06050858000171">The budget remains a running sore in the EU. In December, we lost a serious opportunity to do something about it at a time when we had the leverage to stop a deal and get some fundamental change. It is nonsense to suggest that we are doing well on the common agricultural policy. I have been looking at the figures in the documents before us today. The table under &#147;Heading 2&#148; shows the billions that are spent on agriculture, direct aid and market support. Over the next seven years, that is going to reduce by just under 1 per cent. a year. That means that we will extinguish the CAP over the next 100 years, or slightly more. I suspect that even then the European Court of Auditors will still be failing to sign off the accounts, but I probably will not be there to see it. We are still in the mire as regards the European budget.</p>

I am afraid that that is wrong. In fact, what happened in December arose because of the splendid decision and success of the French people in defeating the proposal for a constitution. That did not please President Chirac, who, to deflect attention from his own apparent failure, lashed out at the British rebate in the European budget. I modestly suggested in a previous debate that if he wants to question our rebate, let us throw the CAP into the melting pot. If there is no CAP, there is no need for a rebate. Interestingly, the Prime Minister took precisely that case to Europe and debated it with colleagues. One would have hoped that we would say, &#147;You want to change our rebate&#151;fine, but only the basis of the abolition or very serious and fundamental reform of the CAP.&#148; That did not happen, we lost that opportunity, and now we are going to trundle on for 100 years, with perhaps a 1 per cent. cut a year. That is not acceptable, certainly not to the third world, which suffers terribly from the effects of heavy subsidies in the developed world, particularly in Europe.</p>

I was born on the day when Winston Churchill took over as Prime Minister and rejected the appeasement that had characterised the conduct of British foreign policy for a long time. He said, in line with the words of the hon. Member for Luton, North (Kelvin Hopkins), that we should be associated but not absorbed.</p>

<p><a name="st_o411"><a name="06050858000185"><a name="60508-0017.htm_spnew14"><a name="06050858000466"><b>Kelvin Hopkins:</b> Indeed. I would have thought that other member states felt that. In fact, they are becoming more aware of it. As enthusiasm for the EU declines, people want to assert their independent democratic rights without being nationalistic. The problem with the current arrangement is that it is likely to increase the unpleasant sort of nationalism because people feel that their democracy is somehow being weakened. To decide as free member states, confident in their democracy, to work voluntarily with other member states, is a recipe for genuine co-operation and internationalism. That would remove or at least reduce the amount of unpleasant nationalism that exists in member states, including Britain to some extent. There are dangers in such nationalism, as we know from European history.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o286"><a name="60508-0017.htm_para7"><a name="06050858000186">Let us consider what happened in December. Britain was guilt-tripped into doing a deal because, without it, the poorer, newer member states would be disadvantaged. They are disadvantaged because the budget is overwhelmingly dominated by agriculture spending in richer member states. We should simply have a budget arrangement without the CAP and the CFP.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o287"><a name="60508-0017.htm_para8"><a name="06050858000187">Aid policy, too, should be repatriated because it is inefficiently managed in Europe and goes to the wrong places. We do well on aid and have a good reputation and we could even operate on an agency basis forthe EU through the Department for International Development. That would be much better than operating through the EU. Nevertheless, we could have an agreement to spend a proportion of our gross domestic product on aid but to administer it ourselves or on an agency basis, without going through the European Commission, which is notoriously inefficient in administering it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o288"><a name="60508-0017.htm_para9"><a name="06050858000188">We were guilt-tripped into the decision about the newer member states. However, if all the other aspects of the budget were reduced or eliminated, we could have a budget that could be administered in an absolutely fair way. Contributions and receipts could be exactly proportional to the levels of prosperity in the different member states. The rich states could pay in according to their prosperity, and the poorer ones would derive benefit from the budget according to their relative poverty. That would be a fair and moral way of implementing a redistributive budget. The fiscal transfers would be precisely fair. I might even suggest that it would be a socialist approach, involving redistribution from the rich to the poor. I would be very happy indeed with such an arrangement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o289"><a name="60508-0017.htm_para10"><a name="06050858000191">The way in which the budget operates is said to be beneficial to Britain because we have a trading advantage, but in fact we do not have such an advantage with the European Union at the moment. The great majority of our exports go outside the European Union. We are very different from Germany in that regard, in that the proportion of trade that goes to the European Union from Germany is about seven times greater than the proportion that goes to the EU from Britain. Germany has a massive export surplus with the rest of the European Union; it is very much greater than the relatively small amount that we export to the EU. We import a lot from the EU, but we do not export a great deal to it.</p>

Gentleman is absolutely right to say that the preponderance of our exports goes outside the European Union. In reflecting on the EU budget, would he agree that it is unsatisfactory that, in presenting their arguments about trade, Ministers consistently get it wrong&#151;they must know that they are doing so&#151;through the ancient and discredited practice of double counting that which goes through Rotterdam? It really is not good enough.</p>

<p><a name="st_o415"><a name="06050858000193"><a name="60508-0017.htm_spnew18"><a name="06050858000470"><b>Kelvin Hopkins:</b> I thank the hon. Gentleman for his helpful intervention. Governments of both colours talk about exports rather than about the balance of trade. The concept of exports net of imports is very different from that of exports alone. Exports increasing by 1 or2 per cent. a year might sound splendid, but if imports are increasing by 5 per cent. a year at the same time, it would create a big deficit, which would not be particularly advantageous. We should look at trade balances, rather than simply at exports.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o290"><a name="60508-0017.htm_para11"><a name="06050858000194">That also says something about the level of a country&#146;s currency, relative to other currencies. One of the reasons why I believe that we should retain our own currency is that it enables us to have a sensible macro-economic policy and to adjust our currency to an appropriate level. That is necessary for trade.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o291"><a name="60508-0017.htm_para12"><a name="06050858000195">As I was saying, we were guilt-tripped into the decision to go for this budget. It was suggested that, without agreement on it, we would somehow deprive the less fortunate newer member states of the European Union, but in fact the people who went laughing all the way to the bank afterwards were the rich countries that benefit most from the common agricultural policy. The full CAP benefits do not accrue to the newer member states, because they are being tapered in over several years. So the CAP budget is still going to the richer member states that have larger agricultural sectors, such as Denmark, Ireland and France. Those countries arguably have higher living standards than ours; they are certainly very prosperous. And good luck to them&#151;I am very pleased that they are, but we should not subsidise them to the disbenefit of the poorer member states of the European Union.</p>

calculations from Global Britain, we will contribute net more than &#163;10 billion a year for the next seven years. If that money was simply going to the poorer nations of Europe, there might be an arguable case for providing it. However, it is not, and &#163;10 billion is a significant sum. It is roughly 12 times the deficit in the NHS this year and 10 times more than we would have to pay for free long-term care, in which I passionately believe. Such a sum would enable every pensioner in Britain to have a &#163;20 a week increase in the basic state pension. Although &#163;10 billion as a proportion of GDP may not be that much, it is a lot of money if one considers it in terms of what it could provide.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o293"><a name="60508-0017.htm_para14"><a name="06050858000197">If we reduced our net contribution to a level that was appropriate to help the poorer member states of Europe on a moral and socialist basis, that would be fine. However, our net contribution is too big and there are other things in our country that we should spend the money on, such as redistribution to the poor. We still have significant poverty in Britain, particularly among the elderly, and I would like to see an increase in the basic state pension that could be paid for by cutting our contribution. There are better things that we could do with our money.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o294"><a name="60508-0017.htm_para15"><a name="06050858000198">In short, we still have to campaign for the abandonment of the CAP and the common fisheries policy and for structural fund spending to be used to redistribute income to the poorer member states, and we should let them decide what to spend the money on rather than having that determined in Brussels. The aid budget should be repatriated and, in future, we should focus on redistributing simply according to the relative degrees of poverty and prosperity in the European Union. That is the way forward for a friendly, co-operative and truly internationalist Europe.</p>

He was a new Member of Parliament and the late John Smith gave him the job for the Labour party of dealing with the nuts and bolts of the treaty. I tabled about 150 amendments and, because in those days we did not have extravagant parliamentary devices, at least on the scale that we have now, we were able to force debates, and we did so resolutely. I pick out my hon. Friend the Member for Aldridge-Brownhills (Mr. Shepherd) as a veteran of those days, and many would say that we set out a series of arguments that have proved to be correct.</p>

far exceeds the amount that the Prime Minister said that the United Kingdom and other member states would contribute. The sum is so significant that one might say that it smacked of massive incompetence and that he did not want the Chancellor of the Exchequer to know the full details.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o297"><a name="60508-0018.htm_para1"><a name="06050858000202">Let us consider the appointment of the hon. Member for Normanton (Ed Balls)&#151;he was here at the beginning of the debate, and I am missing him now&#151;to the position of Economic Secretary. He is an alleged Eurosceptic who has continuously put arguments in various publications and given indications to suggest that he is dissatisfied with the way in which the European Union is functioning, but he has been given a job of great responsibility. I say with respect to the Paymaster General that it is a great pity that the Economic Secretary is not replying to the debate. Just as in those days of the Maastricht treaty when I found myself in a considerable alliance with the late Peter Shore, who performed a noble service tothe House over many decades, I wondered whether the disagreements between the Prime Minister and the Chancellor of the Exchequer may not, on close inquiry, turn out to be based on a difference of opinionwith regard to the European Union and its financial management. After all, it is the five economic tests imposed by the Chancellor, which reputedly came from some of the ideas of the new Economic Secretary, that laid down the basis on which we were not, to all intents and purposes, to go into the euro.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o298"><a name="60508-0018.htm_para2"><a name="06050858000203">I think that a deeper question lies at the heart of the debate: which way are the Government going to go in respect of the future financial management of the EU as seen through the eyes of the British Treasury? It has been badly burned and cannot afford to pay for the public services or to perform the functions that the EU has been given without massive taxation. There is, therefore, a deeper problem.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o299"><a name="60508-0018.htm_para3"><a name="06050858000204">It is a failed system&#151;an undemocratic and unaccountable system&#151;that we are debating. It is a system that has been rejected by some of the other countries. The financial management and economic management implicit in the Maastricht treaty is the basis on which the European constitution was defeated. Contrary to what was stated at the time, it was not simply because President Chirac had become unpopular; it was actually because the policies that were being pursued in respect of European Union treaties had made President Chirac so unpopular. That is why there were riots in the streets and why the French people turned on their own Government. They did so because of a sense of disillusionment. They were told that they were going to get a good deal and then discovered that they were getting an extremely bad one because of the massive unemployment that followed in the wake of the pursuit of European economic management and European directives, in particular with respect to the contract, which had to be abandoned. The Government wanted to make economic reforms and they could not. Angela Merkel is attempting to make economic reforms in Germany, but she cannot. The bottom line is that the whole of the EU is not merely creaking, but collapsing and imploding. The consequences are severe.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o300"><a name="60508-0018.htm_para4"><a name="06050858000205">The beneficiary of those policies is the far right. The Eurobarometer poll shows that the EU is even more unpopular in Austria than it is in the UK. There is a reason for that.</p>

I suspect that the Prime Minister knew that it was rubbish at the time, but he was in a very tricky political environment, and the Prime Minister always becomes trickier the trickier the situation becomes.</p>

<p><a name="st_o427"><a name="06050858000223"><a name="60508-0018.htm_spnew10"><a name="06050858000482"><b>Kelvin Hopkins:</b> If the Prime Minister had said &#147;unless and until the common agricultural policy is abolished&#148;, that would have worked.</p>

It would also have worked if he had said &#147;If we want to achieve economic competitiveness we will have to renegotiate the legislation, or else legislate unilaterally, on our own terms, here at Westminster.&#148; He is not going to do that either, although, as I shall explain shortly, this financial settlement includes a vast amount of money that is being poured down the throat of the European Union for the purpose&#151;allegedly&#151;of increasing competitiveness. As the hon. Member for Leicester, East (Keith Vaz) knows extremely well, the Kok report criticised the Lisbon agenda because it does not work. The vast amount&#151;billions of pounds&#151;being spent on that agenda is being completely wasted. It is being frittered away, and it is our taxpayers&#146; money.</p>

It said that the benchmarks set in Lisbon had not been met, and it set out a path to ensuring that the EU countries met them. It did not say that the Lisbon agenda was a waste of public money.</p>

Gentleman gave evidence to the European Reform Forum that we set up, and he has the advantage of being able to read the evidence that Will Hutton, the rapporteur to the Kok report, gave to the forum, which is on the transcript and in the public domain. It would be well worth the hon. Gentleman and others reading what Will Hutton had to say about the Lisbon agenda. Despite further such attempts being made since then to deal with this issue, there has been no improvement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o308"><a name="60508-0018.htm_para12"><a name="06050858000227">There is another issue about which I am deeply worried. The European Scrutiny Committee was obliged to say the following in its report:</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o309"><a name="60508-0018.htm_para13"><a name="06050858000228">At the heart of that comment lies the fact that this House is being treated with contempt. We are being invited to debate a matter that, to all intents and purposes, has already been sewn up. I regret to say that it has been sewn up with a degree of misrepresentation, in that the figures have been increased and we were not given the chance to debate the issue in sufficient time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o310"><a name="60508-0018.htm_para14"><a name="06050858000229">The own resources decision will have to be debated in the context of a forthcoming European finance Bill. I have asked Ministers when we will have that Bill on a number of occasions, including via a written question. Labour Members&#151;indeed, all straightforward, honest Members of this House&#151;have a decision to make: whether, in the light of the manner in which the House has been treated, they are prepared to vote against their own Government on that Bill. The opportunity to do so will certainly arise, and I strongly urge them to do so.</p>

As my hon. Friend the Member for Altrincham and Sale, West (Mr. Brady) said, the former Minister for Europe stated in his explanatory memorandum as recently as 21 February that the Government would strongly oppose any proposal to increase the overall expenditure ceiling agreed by the European Council. However, the honest truth is that the Government simply rolled over, and at considerable expense to our own taxpayers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o312"><a name="60508-0018.htm_para16"><a name="06050858000231">Our report also suggested that the debate should look at the reasons for any reallocation of spending between different expenditure headings.

It is quite disgusting to read how they tried to weasel their way out of explaining what is, in reality, a complete and total failure to subscribe to the principles set out by the Prime Minister during Prime Minister&#146;s Question Time on 5 June last year.</p>

was my privilege to serve with him in the European Parliament for five years, where he was a distinguished chair of the European Parliament United States delegation. I mention that because he is one of those Labour Members who realises that just because one is pro-European does not mean that one is anti-US. He recognises that one can be both, and the way forward is to match the two together, which I am sure he will do skilfully.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o322"><a name="60508-0018.htm_para26"><a name="06050858000242">My right hon. Friend is also one of those people who are against the whole concept of the European super state or federal state. He believes that Britain&#146;s role is in Europe but as a freestanding, independent, sovereign nation state. He believes that the European Union is about that kind of association, as does the Labour party as a whole.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o323"><a name="60508-0018.htm_para27"><a name="06050858000243">I wish to focus on one or two areas that have not been mentioned much so far. Much emphasis has been placed on the issue of fraud in the European Union and I am sure that we would be unanimous in condemning fraud in all shapes and forms. However, we should be clear that it has been consistently the case that most of the fraud in the EU has been the responsibility of independent, sovereign member states. It has been their fault for not putting their houses in order in relation to EU finance.</p>

<p><a name="st_o432"><a name="06050858000244"><a name="60508-0018.htm_spnew15"><a name="06050858000487"><b>Mr. Bone: </b>Will the hon. Gentleman name the countries that are guilty of that fraud and does he include the UK?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o324"><a name="60508-0018.htm_para28"><a name="06050858000246">My main point is that we have seen monumental change in the past few years in the shape of the EU, and there has been no greater change than the addition of 10 new member states, nine of them in central and eastern Europe. We should welcome that and be proud of the fact that our Government, more than any other, championed the enlargement process, which has been entirely successful.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o325"><a name="60508-0018.htm_para29"><a name="06050858000247">Enlargement is significant in a political sense, too. Most of the countries that have entered the EU tend to share the British perspective on EU development. They, too, do not want a centralised European superstate, run from Brussels. Having thrown off the yoke of the Soviet Union, they cherish their sense of identity and purpose and, like us, they will not easily give it up again.</p>

<p><a name="st_o434"><a name="06050858000248"><a name="60508-0018.htm_spnew17"><a name="06050858000489"><b>Mr. Davidson:</b> Notwithstanding the views of the new accession states about centralisation, does my hon. Friend accept that ever since those countries joined, there has been a constant pattern of more and more power being accreted to the centre? There has been no balancing delegation of powers from the centre to individual nation states, so irrespective of the views of the new accession states, they have actually gone along with the centralisation process. Their presence has made no difference whatever.</p>

In some areas, there has been an increased pooling of sovereignty by common consent, which is a positive development. However, over the last few months, not least due to pressure from the British Government, the European Commission has withdrawn a number of draft directives and said that they will not be enforced. In certain key sectors, such as immigration, justice and home affairs, where greater co-ordination is needed, it has taken place, but elsewhere there has been a reduction in the amount of EU red tape and bureaucracy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o326"><a name="60508-0019.htm_para0"><a name="06050858000252">In the context of this debate, my main point is that democracy is fragile and frail in the new countries that are joining the EU, so it must be properly supported by mature democracies such as ours. As a socialist who believes in the redistribution of wealth, I think that Labour Members should be proud of the fact that we are prepared to help countries entering the new European family by giving material support in terms of the budget agreement. We should not be ashamed of that.</p>

Such changes do not just happen, so it is laudable that the UK has led the way in the EU negotiations and has said that to make the market work as effectively in central and eastern Europe, as it does, largely, in western Europe, we should be prepared to ensure that there is assistance so that there can be full transition from Soviet-style command economies.</p>

But does he agree that the provision of European regional funding is also of great importance to some of the poorer parts of the UK and does he share the disappointment of people in the highlands and islands because the amount of funding that our area is receiving, as a transition area, is falling dramatically? Would not it have been better for the Government to have negotiated as strongly in favour of the highlands and islands as of the eastern European countries that he described?</p>

One of the things that I hope that we will see over the next few years is British business taking effective cognisance of the fact that we have developed new market economies in central and eastern Europe and exporting to and engaging with those economies in a way that has so far not happened.</p>

Yes, we can be effective Europeans and help to develop that economy to our own advantage, but that does not stop us trading with the rest of the world. It is not an either/or situation. Let us do both. Let us recognise that we are an international nation. What concerns me about Opposition Members is that, all too often, what they are saying, when we scrape away all the economic veneer is basically a very crude form of xenophobia. [Hon. Members: &#147;Oh, come on.] Yes, it is. When weget down to basics, what they are really saying isthat they do not like Europeans. The economic arguments objectively speaking are for Britain&#146;s positive engagement in the EU, and for an EU that embraces the free market and makes ever-deeper the single European market. We should be arguing for its completion, not for some kind of semi-detachment or even withdrawal, as some hon. Members would like. That is the real agenda that we must get to grips with in the future.</p>

Undoubtedly, some hon. Members who represent certain regions are not particularly happy with the budgetary settlement as negotiated, but let me say quite honestly, as a representative of Caerphilly in south Wales, that we were absolutely delighted that the Government negotiated an effective continuation of objective 1 status for cohesion funding, so that some &#163;1.2 billion will come into our region over the next financial perspective. The first tranche of that money has been put to very good use in tackling economic inactivity and developing economic infrastructure, training and so on, and there is no doubt in my mind that the good situation in south Wales, where more people are in work than ever before in history, will continue and we will be pleased&#151;indeed, we will be singing in the valleys&#151;when the new strand of funding comes through.</p>

Gentleman&#146;s comment on objective 1 being given to his constituency.

Is unemployment going up or down?</p>

They do not show effectively the tremendous improvement in the south Wales economy. I am pleased to say that we are having our cake and eating it. Our Government can be criticised for many things, but they cannot be criticised for not being adept at negotiations. That is a practical, material, down-to-earth example that highlights clearly how effective the Government have been in ensuring the continuing development of areas such as the south Wales valleys.</p>

If that is not turning the clock back, what on earth is? Let us be honest and frank. I am glad that the hon. Gentleman has been that frank. I hope that the hon. Member for Altrincham and Sale, West (Mr. Brady), who is smiling, will take up his lead and articulate that point as clearly and precisely. That goes back to my earlier point. The debate is about whether we turn the clock back and somehow pretend that we can disengage, have associate member status or withdraw&#151;Members can call it what they like. It is about whether we can somehow separate ourselves from mainland Europe and develop mythical new relations with the rest of Europe. That is not the real world and we all know it in our heart of hearts.</p>

How can we expand the European Union and deepen the economic integration that is to our advantage and in the interests of the people I represent. The hon. Member for Castle Point (Bob Spink) mentioned my constituency of Caerphilly. I speak regularly to industrialists and, unanimously, they say to me, &#147;For goodness sake, let&#146;s not go down this crazy road of separating ourselves from the European Union.&#148; Both the employers and the employees recognise fully that this country exports more to the European Union than to any other part of the world. To cut ourselves off from that and see the imposition, once again, of all the impediments to trade that used to exist, would be catastrophic to the economy of this country.</p>

Of course, if one looks at the Government&#146;s opening negotiating position, they did not achieve everything that they set out&#151;one never does in negotiations. The European Union is all about achieving a progressive consensus. When we look back at the British presidency of the European Union, I am proud that we can say that it was a great success. Two of the great things that stand out are: first, the fact that we have ensured a start date for negotiations with Turkey and that negotiations are continuing for Turkey eventually to join the European Union, and, secondly, that we have had a budget deal that is good for the people of this country and of the continent as a whole. We should be proud of that. It is something that we should be celebrating, and certainly not denigrating.</p>

Those of us who are members of the European Scrutiny Committee will remember a discussion that we had with the right hon. Gentleman several months ago in which he had innovative ideas about improving the scrutiny of European business in the House. I hope very much that his successor as Leader of the House will take those suggestions forward. I have no doubt that the Minister for Europe will bring his great experience to European matters, not least as a former Member of the European Parliament, and we in the Scottish National party and Plaid Cymru wish him well.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o331"><a name="60508-0019.htm_para5"><a name="06050858000276">Speaking as someone who represents a constituency that has benefited greatly from EU funding, I wish to make a point about EU finances that has been sadly lacking from much of tonight&#146;s debate. In Moray and the other areas of the highlands and islands, there is tremendous appreciation for the support of the European Union over the past decades. Many of us well remember the cash-starved situation in our communities in the dark 18 years in which the Conservatives were in government. It is ironic to think that throughout that time, Brussels was seen as much more benign whenit came to governance than was&#151;perhaps still is&#151;Westminster. It is with great regret that the highlands and islands has lost objective 1 funding.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o332"><a name="60508-0019.htm_para6"><a name="06050858000277">We have heard much about fraud, mismanagement and the inappropriate use of statistics, but the loss of objective 1 support for the highlands and islands was home-grown. It did not happen because of Brussels, or other dastardly EU member states. Scotland&#146;s national wealth was overstated by &#163;21 billion throughout the 1990s owing to a catalogue of flawed assumptions that were used to compile the UK&#146;s accounts. Newspaper coverage in <i> The Scotsman </i>at the time said that the UK</p>
<a name="60508-0019.htm_brev0"><a name="06050858000343"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Office of National Statistics has admitted to an Enron-scale error, which has been artificially inflating Scotland&#146;s national income by as much as &#163;3.3 billion a year since at least 1989.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o333"><a name="60508-0019.htm_para7"><a name="06050858000278">That blunder deprived the highlands and islands of &#163;200 million of EU grants. I hope that hon. Members who have driven through the highlands and islands and are aware how many infrastructure projects were completed only because of the support of the European Union will appreciate that the blunder with which we now have to live, as the recipients of only transitional funding, not objective 1 funding, was severe.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o334"><a name="60508-0019.htm_para8"><a name="06050858000279">It is important that we all accept that the loss of EU funding is not of itself a bad thing. As economies throughout the European Union grow and countries become wealthier, surely those of us in the wealthier parts of Europe have to bear part of the burden so that we can ensure that other parts of the EU catch upwith us. The argument that I will deploy is thus not motivated by a lack of appreciation for our paying our fair share. We should do that, but it is key that we consider the transitional arrangements betweenthe outgoing funding period and the funding period agreed recently.</p>

Some &#8364;308 billion has been allocated for EU funding. The Department of Trade and Industry estimates that the UK will receive&#8364;9.4 billion, of which &#8364;2.6 billion will be allocated to convergence funding for Cornwall, west Wales and the valleys, and the highlands and islands. Approximately &#8364;6.2 billion will be allocated to competitiveness funding for other regions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o336"><a name="60508-0019.htm_para10"><a name="06050858000281">In December 2004, the Scottish Executive&#151;the devolved Government comprising the Labour party and the Liberal Democrats&#151;estimated that the highlands and islands would get &#8364;460 million and the rest of Scotland&#8364;721 million. That is a significant amount, and it is important for planning the growth of our economy in the years ahead. Only two short years later, in January 2006, the Executive said that Scotland could receive up to 45 per cent. of the sum we will receive in the current programming period. The highlands and islands would receive &#163;105 million as a so-called statistical effect region under convergence, which is only 60 per cent. of the amount that they currently receive. Basically, the Scottish Executive&#146;s estimates have been chopped by two thirds, and the remaining sum is considerably less than they were expecting. Some hon. Members have asked what is being done, but I want to know what the Scottish Executive were doing. What did the Enterprise Minister, Nicol Stephen&#151;a Liberal Democrat&#151;do when he realised that the Scottish economy will lose hundreds of millions of pounds of funding? Why did the Liberal Democrat Transport Minister not bemoan publicly the loss of significant funds to improve road transport, not least throughout the highlands and islands?</p>

The Department of Trade and Industry is consulting on the UK national strategic reference framework, which sets out general principles for governing ESF spending in the UK as a whole. The Scottish Executive, including the Liberal Democrats, have drafted a Scottish chapter, but it does not specify priorities in future Scottish programmes and does not indicate the resources required for each priority or programme. That is not good enough, because we go on about disconnection and a lack of faith or belief in what the EU can offer, but if we are to re-engage with the public we need to talk more positively about the projects that have delivered on the ground. I very much hope that the Minister will not just defend the UK Government&#146;s negotiating position in December&#151;we will hear that anyway&#151;but explain what much of the funding can do on the ground. I hope that in the months ahead there is action from the Scottish Executive and Ministers from both parties, who should live up to their rhetoric about what is vital for communities the length and breadth of Scotland.</p>

In particular, he challenged Labour Members to vote against the Bill needed to put the new budget into effect. The hon.

Gentleman used. He made a dodgy start by using a briefing from the Open Europe group. The CAP will not, as he asserted, be between 40 and 44 per cent., but 34 per cent. of the total. He included the 9 to 10 per cent. of the budget that is spent on rural development and used for environmental and other benefits in rural areas, not farmers&#146; subsidies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o365"><a name="60508-0020.htm_para25"><a name="06050911000009">The hon. Gentleman is wrong to say that the Treasury has changed the way in which we calculate payments. In the Budget and the Treasury White Paper on EU finances, we calculate EU payments in exactly the same way as has always been done. He said that the budget was increasing&#151;but it is now for an EU of 25 not 15 countries. In the next financial perspective to 2013, the EU budget will fall to less than 1 per cent. of gross national income in the EU&#151;the lowest level for 20 years.</p>

Member for Chipping Barnet (Mrs. Villiers) spent most of her contribution conflating and inflating the popular myths about fraud in the EU. In 2004, fraud in the EU budget was &#8364;130 million. That is 0.1 per cent. Fraud accounts for 0.02 per cent. of the CAP budget and 0.4 per cent. of the budget for structural funds. The UK has been determined that EU funds should be properly and efficiently spent. The EU anti-fraud office has been heavily promoted and the UK was instrumental in setting it up. The UK strongly supported setting up the Commission&#146;s internal audit unit on an independent basis. The hon. Lady speaks with experience, so I am sure that she agrees that few countries in the EU have championed the cause of bearing down on fraud more strongly than the UK.</p>

He and the hon. Member for Chipping Barnet were critical of the CAP. However, let me stress to them both that the CAP is being reformed. Under the UK presidency, we were able to put in place the historic liberalising reform of the UK sugar regime. The total value of the CAP will decrease over the new financial perspective, falling to &#8364;51 billion a year by 2013. The fundamental review&#151;part of the December agreement and the inter-institutional agreement&#151;will give us the chance to press further towards long-term reform and a vision for the CAP, which sees European farming as capable of being competitive without the need for subsidy or protectionism.</p>

Furthermore, the regional development funding in the UK will largely continue to be sourced directly from the UK Government, not from the European Union.</p>

reported in 2004 there has been not one successful conviction of any major wrongdoer, and that no funds have been recovered in the seven years of OLAF&#146;s existence? Is that a success, in the Minister&#146;s terms?</p>

Surely he would not contest that we need such a body at the heart of the European Union. We also need the independent internal audit unit that the Commissioner has set up.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o373"><a name="60508-0021.htm_para0"><a name="06050911000023">The inter-institutional agreement and the own resources decisions are the final parts of what has been a long difficult negotiation on the financial perspective. As the first negotiation of a union of 25 member states, it was bound to be complex. It is, however, a unique opportunity to modernise the budget and set out a process that will lead to a budget more fit for purpose for the European Union of the 21st century.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o374"><a name="60508-0021.htm_para1"><a name="06050911000024">In the first place, the agreement ensures budget discipline. Rejecting the Commission&#146;s proposal for a budget of &#8364;1,025 billion, member states have instead agreed a budget of &#8364;864 billion, or 1.048 per cent. of EU gross national income. By 2013, the starting point for future negotiations, the budget will be about 1 per cent. of EU gross national income&#151;its lowest level for 20 years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o375"><a name="60508-0021.htm_para2"><a name="06050911000025">The budget also allows for an historic shift in spending from the old member states of the Union to the new central and eastern European member states. It supports our long-argued UK commitment to EU enlargement. Over the coming years, the funds forthe new member states will increase from less than&#8364;30 billion to more than &#8364;170 billion&#151;a sevenfold increase. These funds aid their economic development, and they will not only make them more prosperous and more stable, but bring significant benefits to the UK too. UK exports to the eight eastern European new member states totalled in 2004 &#163;5.3 billion&#151;up by around 230 per cent. over those of the previous decade. Access to these new and growing markets will benefit UK consumers and UK business.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o376"><a name="60508-0021.htm_para3"><a name="06050911000026">The historic enlargement of the EU, combined with the intensifying global challenges on the economy, poverty, the environment and security, meant that the financing of the EU could no longer be viewed in the manner that it had been prior to 2004. As the Prime Minister said, as the EU&#146;s strongest supporter of enlargement, it was fair and right that the UK contributed properly to the costs of enlargement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o377"><a name="60508-0021.htm_para4"><a name="06050911000027">We have consistently argued, however, and carried out the argument in the negotiations, that the UK abatement remains justified because of the inequalities and inefficiencies on the expenditure side of the budget.

abatement on spending that contributes to the growth and the prosperity of Europe&#146;s poorest countries.

<p><a name="stpa_o380"><a name="60508-0021.htm_para7"><a name="06050911000032">Finally, there will be the review of the budget. The review was agreed as part of the December package and confirmed in the inter-institutional agreement. The review will be led by the Commission and will report in 2008-09. It will allow the Council then to assess the value of all areas of EU expenditure, including the common agricultural policy. This is a process through which we can move to further reform of the CAP and further reform of the European budget as a whole to put it on a more rational and logical basis, so that it can concentrate on the things that are essential to Europe&#146;s future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o381"><a name="60508-0021.htm_para8"><a name="06050911000033">Throughout this process of negotiation, the UK&#146;s objectives have been consistent. We wanted tight budgetary discipline; we wanted more spending on policy reform, especially more reform to the CAP and the structural funds; we wanted successful enlargement; and we also wanted to protect the UK&#146;s financial position. We secured budget growth limited to 13 per cent., when the Commission had proposed 25 per cent. We secured an EU budget that will be less than 1 per cent. of gross national income by 2013&#151;its lowest level for 20 years. We secured a massive uplift in social and cohesion fund allocations for the new member states, and secured more flexibility to ensure that those countries can effectively absorb the structural funds and improve their growth and productivity. We secured a doubling in research and development spending, and secured and retained the UK abatement, which will increase in value during the next financial perspective. We secured the political commitment of all member states and the Commission to a fundamental review of all aspects of expenditure and revenue.</p>

Everyone is currently recalling the words of Enoch Powell, who said that all political careers end in failure. <i> [Interruption.]</i> Actually, mine is going quite well, judging by last Thursday&#146;s election results. I advise Labour Members to pipe down on that particular subject; otherwise I shall talk to them about how we ripped apart the corrupt Labour administration in Tower Hamlets, defeating the leader, deputy leader, housing convenor, mayor, deputy mayor&#151;I could go on, Mr. Speaker, but you would not allow me to do so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o386"><a name="60508-0021.htm_para13"><a name="06050911000487">I am thinking of another of Mr. Powell&#146;s remarks, however: that a politician complaining about the press is like a ship&#146;s captain complaining about the sea. In any case, I have my own access to the media, having worked for nearly nine years for Associated Newspapers and for the last 16 weeks as host of a radio talk show on Saturday and Sunday nights.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o387"><a name="60508-0021.htm_para14"><a name="06050911000488">It is not the grim and unremitting orthodoxy of the press about which I am concerned this evening, but the slip over the cusp of criminality into which some newspapers have lapsed. As long ago as 5 June 1999, I raised in this House the issue of the agent provocateur behaviour of Mazher Mahmood, otherwise known as the fake sheikh. I warned then that Mr. Murdoch&#146;s flagship reporter was not so much involved in unmasking wrongdoing as in dreaming up acts of wrongdoing and setting up individuals to commit them. I should have known that one day, he wouldtry this on me. The expensive though abstemious Dorchester dinner that he threw for me in March of this year was intended to entrap me in a foreign funding scam in advance of the local elections in which my party, Respect, as I have just had the opportunity to say, did rather well. When I rebuffed this crude attempt to suborn me, Mr. Murdoch&#146;s finest tried to entice me down the poisonous path of anti-Semitism and holocaust denial.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o388"><a name="60508-0021.htm_para15"><a name="06050911000489">Nearly as reprehensible were the arguments later adduced by counsel for Mahmood, paid for by Murdoch, in its vain attempt to prevent me from publishing pictures of the fake sheikh, which can now be found on the Respect coalition website and in other places. Its argument that this was an invasion of Mahmood&#146;s privacy, and that pictures of him taken for one purpose should not be used for another&#151;for publication in a national newspaper&#151;would of course put <i> The News of the World</i> out of business. In the words of Justice Mitting, who heard the case:</p>
<a name="60508-0021.htm_brev2"><a name="06050911000528"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;I&#146;m surprised that that argument is being advanced from your corner.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o389"><a name="60508-0021.htm_para16"><a name="06050911000490">The point is that Mahmood&#146;s behaviour toward me and many others whom he did manage to deceive is not only reprehensible but surely illegal, as ProfessorRoy Greenslade has argued in several recent articles. I should be interested to hear the Government&#146;s view on this, and to hear of any plans that they have to tackle this abuse of press freedom.</p>

<b>8 May 2006 : Column 144</b><br>

<p><a name="stpa_o390"><a name="60508-0022.htm_para0"><a name="06050911000491">The House will know that I have spent much of the past three years successfully dealing with false and defamatory allegations published about me in a variety of American and British newspapers. These newspapers have now had to pay out some &#163;2 million in damages and costs to me and my lawyers as a result of those libels. That a crime was committed against me in Baghdad by forgers constructing fake incriminating materials cannot be gainsaid. <i> The</i><i> Christian Science Monitor </i>published on its front page a story that I had received more than $10 million in regular payments from a son of Saddam Hussein whom I never met, beginning a year before I had ever visited Iraq, and ending some months after I left Iraq for the last time. Those documents, which contained forgeries of my signature and elaborate attempts at a chronology matching my actual visits to Iraq, were brought by <i> The</i><i> Christian Science Monitor</i> from an Iraqi general whom it named and photographed within days of the fall of Baghdad to the invading forces.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o391"><a name="60508-0022.htm_para1"><a name="06050911000492">After I began legal proceedings against <i> The</i><i> Christian Science Monitor</i>, and after <i> The</i><i> Mail on Sunday </i>had bought another set of documents from the same Iraqi general, purporting to show my receipt of a different $10 million from a different son of Saddam Hussein, <i> The</i><i> Christian Science Monitor</i> sent its documents to leading American universities for forensic examination. It was a precaution that it ought to have takenbefore publication, rather than afterward, because the documents were swiftly exposed as forgeries, as were the documents bought by <i> The</i><i> Mail on Sunday</i> from the same source in the same week.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o392"><a name="60508-0022.htm_para2"><a name="06050911000493">When both newspapers unmasked the forgeries they had bought, I called on our Government to cause our officials in Baghdad to visit that Iraqi general and ask him why he was circulating forged materials about a British Member of Parliament. There was only silence from the Government and the Iraqi general remains unvisited by any of our embassy personnel. You may wonder, Mr. Speaker, why the Government would not be keen to get to the bottom of such a conspiracy or perhaps, like me, you already know the reason why.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o393"><a name="60508-0022.htm_para3"><a name="06050911000494">When the Telegraph Group cornered the market over several weeks in April and May 2003 in documents apparently exhumed from a burning building in Baghdad, many smelled a similar species of rat. Documents incriminating Russia and France and, more importantly, documents appearing to link the former Iraqi regime with Osama bin Laden personally were all scoops missed by every other media outlet, but not by <i> The Daily Telegraph.</i> In that burning building were allegedly found, of course, the documents about me for which it was condemned in the libel courts and caned by Mr. Justice Eady, who said that the paper had rushed to publish the documents, and had adopted them and editorialised upon them with relish.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o394"><a name="60508-0022.htm_para4"><a name="06050911000495">I can reveal this evening for the first time that the <i> Telegraph</i> journalist, Mr. David Blair&#151;an unfortunate coincidence of name&#151;and at least one of his superiors in London lied in the High Court during my libel action. Their claim that Mr. Blair was not led to those documents but had merely chanced upon them while wandering around a looted and burning building, and that he had found all of the documents published by the <i> Telegraph </i>in the same place, at the same time and in the same box, is quite simply a lie.</p>
<br>


<meta name="Date" content="8 May 2006">

<notus-date day="8" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>8 May 2006 : Column 145</b><br>

<p><a name="stpa_o395"><a name="60508-0022.htm_para5"><a name="06050911000496">On 18 July 2003 a very senior British journalist, a foreign correspondent on a national daily, with impeccable credentials and with no conceivable reason to lie, visited me in the House of Commons in my office in Portcullis House. He had been seeking that meeting with me for several weeks. What he told me is perhaps best described by a paraphrasing of the email I sent my lawyer at exactly 13.41 that day, just minutes after that senior British journalist left my office. I told my lawyer that on the weekend David Blair found the documents he was supposed to travel with my contact to the south of Iraq, but pulled out at the hotel door at the last minute and without explanation. He had a conversation with my contact on the day the first <i> Telegraph</i> story was published. He insisted that he had found the documents, though he said that he was uneasy about their veracity. My contact says that Blair was very anxious and nervous about the scale of<i> </i>the treatment of the story by <i> The Daily Telegraph</i> and its clear assumption of guilt.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o396"><a name="60508-0022.htm_para6"><a name="06050911000497">On the day of the follow-up piece, Mr. Blair and my contact spoke again. This time, Mr. Blair confessed that the second set of documents, published by the <i> Telegraph </i>had in fact been given to him and that he had not, as he had claimed, found them. He said to my contact that he was not able to say who gave them to him. He said that he had been told by London to continue to insist that he found those documents, and that my contact must never divulge the true story.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o397"><a name="60508-0022.htm_para7"><a name="06050911000498">After they both left Iraq, David Blair telephoned my contact to ask if anyone else knew about the true provenance of the documents. Well now we all know.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o398"><a name="60508-0022.htm_para8"><a name="06050911000499">My contact told me further that Philip Sherwell of <i> The Sunday Telegraph</i> said that he had himself trawled the same room in the same building and that everything was fire or sprinkler-damaged beyond repair. On Sherwell&#146;s prior visit, the box Blair later claimed to have found was not there.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o399"><a name="60508-0022.htm_para9"><a name="06050911000500">Of course, the fact that the second set of <i> Telegraph</i> documents was not found, as the paper falsely claimed, but was given to Mr. Blair by somebody does not necessarily mean that the first set of documents was not found in the building. But the fact that the paper lied under oath about the provenance of the second set of documents must reasonably suggest either that both sets of documents were given to the <i> Telegraph&#146;s</i> reporter or, at the very least, that the <i> Telegraph</i> was led to the first by the person or persons who provided the second. I am not unmindful of the gravity of what I am saying, Mr. Speaker. If my foreign correspondent visitor is right, a criminal conspiracy was hatched and executed between Baghdad and London against me.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o400"><a name="60508-0022.htm_para10"><a name="06050911000501">The <i> Telegraph&#146;s</i> then proprietor was, of course, a foreign billionaire, Lord Conrad Black. The noble lord was nothing if not ideologically engaged. According to Philippe Sands QC in his recent book, &#147;Lawless World&#148;, the British Prime Minister told the American Government of George W. Bush that Black was very helpfully using the influence of his papers to make the case for the war. Mazher Mahmood&#146;s employer, too, is a foreign billionaire, although unlike Lord Black there is no evidence that he is also a thief, but that must pose the question of how content we are to allow that massive concentration of media ownership in the hands of foreign billionaires with an ideological crusade in their hearts and an axe to grind.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o401"><a name="60508-0022.htm_para11"><a name="06050911000502">The Government&#146;s attitude has been one of collusion with&#151;some would say obeisance to&#151;those foreign owners. The Government no doubt hoped that that would ensure them a different fate to that suffered by previous Labour Administrations at the hands of the newspaper barons. If so, they must know differently now.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o402"><a name="60508-0022.htm_para12"><a name="06050911000503">What is to be done? Should we allow 40 per cent. of newspaper circulation in Britain to be in Rupert Murdoch&#146;s grubby hands&#151;from the streetwalkers of the <i> News of the World</i> to the higher class of courtesan at <i> The Times</i>? Will we allow our local press to be subject, as it is through takeover, to increasing monopolisation?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o403"><a name="60508-0022.htm_para13"><a name="06050911000504">For almost 20 years in the House I have opposed state regulation of the press, and I oppose it still. I believe that freedom and democracy in this country would lose more than they would gain from such regulation, but part of the answer to those questions lies in the Government&#146;s hands: first, through modifying their relations with those media magnates and, secondly, through caps on media ownership, especially ownership by foreign billionaires whose loyalty is certainly not to this country.</p>

Member for Bethnal Green and Bow (Mr. Galloway) on securing the debate. He has risen to the usual expectations. This is not the first time that we have debated press regulation and I am sure that it will not be the last.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o404"><a name="60508-0022.htm_para14"><a name="06050911000506">I want to start by registering the fact that the Government strongly support self-regulation of the press. Indeed, I think that the hon. Gentleman acknowledged that, too. We believe that a press free from state intervention is fundamental to democracy. The history of a free press in this country dates back to 1695 when Parliament decided against renewing the Act that, earlier in the century, had suppressed all newspapers except official publications. These days, we cannot, and indeed do not, expect to like or agree with everything that is printed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o405"><a name="60508-0022.htm_para15"><a name="06050911000507">We in government would occasionally&#151;as the hon. Gentleman was saying&#151;like the media to appear to understand us and, indeed, sometimes even probably agree with us. However, we believe that the Government should not seek to intervene in any way in what a newspaper or magazine chooses to publish. We therefore support self-regulation, and the basis for the Government&#146;s relationship with the independent Press Complaints Commission is support for effective self-regulation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o406"><a name="60508-0022.htm_para16"><a name="06050911000508">Newspapers may not publish just what they like. Indeed, like all of us, they must abide by the law. That includes, for example, the laws on defamatory material. We acknowledge that with freedom comes responsibility, and in recognition of their responsibilities, newspapers choose to restrict their historic right to free speech&#151;now guaranteed by the Human Rights Act 1998&#151;by signing up to the voluntary code of practice overseen by the PCC. In fact, consequently, newspapers already work under tighter regulations than the rest of us.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o407"><a name="60508-0022.htm_para17"><a name="06050911000509">It is important to put in context what the hon. Gentleman has been saying and to note the context in which the debate takes place. There are 107 daily and 501 weekly newspapers and 8,330 magazines. Every week, as a nation, we get through more than 150 million  <br>

newspapers. Against that background, the PCC received 3,654 complaints in 2005&#151;very similar to the numbers received in the previous two years, which were 3,618 in 2004 and 3,649 the year before.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o408"><a name="60508-0022.htm_para18"><a name="06050911000510">The simple rehearsal of the total number of complaints inevitably conceals a more complex picture. The PCC receives many complaints that do not fall within its remit&#151; relating, for example, to advertising, legal matters or issues of taste and decency&#151;or that represent general concerns on the part of complainants that do not fall within the terms of the code. In those cases, the PCC seeks to assist complainants as best it can, by referring them to other relevant bodies, or passing on their views to the editor concerned.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o409"><a name="60508-0022.htm_para19"><a name="06050911000511">In all, the commission had to make 900 rulings under the code in 2004, which represented a drop of about 14 per cent. from 2003. The complaints that raised a possible breach of the code also fell by 7 per cent. Therefore, despite overall complaint levels remaining the same, there appears to have been a noticeable drop in substantive concerns about the newspaper and magazine industry.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o410"><a name="60508-0022.htm_para20"><a name="06050911000512">One area of particular concern to the hon. Gentleman is misrepresentation, which he outlined this evening. The code contains a clause on the use of clandestine devices and subterfuge, and it is worth rehearsing its contents:</p>
<a name="60508-0022.htm_brev0"><a name="06050911000529"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The press must not seek to obtain or publish material acquired by using hidden cameras or clandestine listening devices; or by intercepting private or mobile telephone calls, messages or emails; or by the unauthorised removal of documents or photographs. Engaging in misrepresentation or subterfuge can generally be justified only in the public interest and then only when the material cannot be obtained by other means.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o411"><a name="60508-0022.htm_para21"><a name="06050911000513">However, that clause has a public interest exemption, meaning that clandestine devices or subterfuge can be permissible if editors demonstrate that their use is in the public interest. The public interest is defined by the PCC as</p>
<a name="60508-0022.htm_brev1"><a name="06050911000530"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Detecting or exposing crime or serious impropriety; protecting public health and safety; preventing the public from being misled by an action or statement of an individual or organisation.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o412"><a name="60508-0022.htm_para22"><a name="06050911000514">We believe that the important point is that, if a journalist obtains a story or information by misrepresentation or subterfuge and an editor uses that story, he must satisfy himself that it is in the public interest, as he will be only too aware that he is likely to have to demonstrate that to the PCC or risk public censure.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o413"><a name="60508-0022.htm_para23"><a name="06050911000515">Investigative journalists have, in that way, uncovered a great deal of crime and impropriety, but I certainly understand the anger and concern of those who find themselves on the receiving end of that sort of behaviour and who committed no crime or impropriety. However, that is part of the price that we pay for our independent press. I should also point out that complaints about the use of clandestine devices and subterfuge made up only 0.6 per cent. of complaints to the PCC last year&#151;just over 20 cases. So, it is fair to say that the problem is not widespread. I do not know whether the hon. Gentleman referred his complaint to the PCC.</p>

people complain to the PCC is that it is not worth a pot of warm water. It has absolutely no effect on the gutter press of Rupert Murdoch and the <i> News of the World</i>. They laugh at it. That is why I did not take my complaint to the PCC. I preferred to bring it to my right hon. Friend&#146;s attention in the hope that he might do something more about it than he seems to be suggesting.</p>

<p><a name="st_o482"><a name="06050911000517"><a name="60508-0022.htm_spnew1"><a name="06050911000996"><b>Mr. Caborn:</b> As my hon. Friend said a little earlier to the House, he has been successful in his prosecutions, because he is now &#163;2 million better off. It looks as though the recourse that he has taken, either through the PCC or the courts, has been quite successful. By his own admission, he has been quite successful in bringing those concerned to book in one form or another, through the courts of the land or the PCC. He has informed the House that he and his lawyers have received about&#163;2 million in the recent past. By that token, there has been some success in addressing that complaint.</p>

<p><a name="st_o483"><a name="06050911000518"><a name="60508-0022.htm_spnew2"><a name="06050911000997"><b>Mr. Galloway:</b> I had to risk absolute and total ruinto do so. I would either have been &#163;2 million up or&#163;2 million down. Most people cannot risk doing that and do not have families that permit them to do that. That is why we need something a bit stronger than what my right hon. Friend has to say this evening.</p>

<p><a name="st_o484"><a name="06050911000519"><a name="60508-0022.htm_spnew3"><a name="06050911000998"><b>Mr. Caborn:</b> My hon. Friend is not what I would call &#147;the normal family&#148;. He is slightly different and slightly more of a personality. Just occasionally, he attracts a little interest from the press&#151;I do not know whether he goes out to do so, but he might from time to time. It is stretching the imagination just a little to say that he is one of the ordinary citizens of this country. By his own admission, at least he has been able to use the courts of this land to bring his case, which has been found in his favour.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o414"><a name="60508-0022.htm_para24"><a name="06050911000520">I do not wish to diminish the importance of such complaints, but it is important that we keep a sense of perspective. Considering the vast number of publications, the articles that they contain and the copies distributed, the number of complaints about any clause in the PCC&#146;s code is very small, and this area is one of the smallest. Complaints about accuracy continue to provide the commission with the bulk of its work&#151;more than50 per cent. of the letters that it receives are about accuracy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o415"><a name="60508-0022.htm_para25"><a name="06050911000521">The PCC continues to monitor customer satisfaction by asking all complainants for their views on whether they are satisfied with how their complaints were handled. In 2004, 305 complainants returned the anonymous feedback form. The results were as follows: 94 per cent. of people whose complaints were either upheld or resolved were satisfied or very satisfied with the way in which their case had been handled; 79 per cent. of respondents considered the time taken to deal with their complaint had been about right; 94 per cent. of the complainants found the commission&#146;s literature to be clear or very clear; 87 per cent. found the PCC staff to be helpful or very helpful; and 60 per cent. overall concluded that their complaints had been handled satisfactorily or very satisfactorily. That was in line with the previous years and included those cases where the commission found no breach of the code and one might expect some hostility to the PCC.</p>

I believe that what we have in place to protect the freedom of the press on the one hand&#151;I think that the hon. Gentleman agrees with that&#151;and to give recourse when there has been transgression from the code is about right.
