Following the meeting to which the hon. Gentleman refers, I asked NHS

confirmed that after other factors have been taken into account,
Lambeth and Southwark primary care trusts were asked to contribute less
to the London-wide risk reserves for this year than most other London

Lambeth and Southwark are among the two most deprived boroughs in the
country and have the most health service needs, that although we have

it was unfair, there has been no change&#151;there will be just the

the NHS in London and in other regions was asked to take into account
the impact of the technical adjustment that was made through what is
called the purchaser parity adjustment. It has done that, and it is
because of that that Southwark and Lambeth have been asked to
contribute less to the London-wide reserve than most other PCTs. Of
course this is difficult, particularly in Southwark and Lambeth, which
are very deprived communities, but the speed with which they will get
back the money that they have contributed this year will depend on the
speed with which other, overspending organisations in London get
themselves back on track and cease to rely on organisations that are in
balance to compensate for their
overspending.</p><p><a name="st_o14"><a name="06112888000044"><b><a name="61128-0001.htm_spnew14"><a name="06112888000400">Kate

Southwark and Bermondsey (Simon Hughes), because we left the meeting
thinking that there would be some changes. The new planning framework
shows a further 3.6 per cent. cut next year in Lambeth and Southwark.
These are the most deprived areas in London, and the cuts will affect
projects such as the healthy living centre in Stockwell, which will
have to close, and all sorts of provisions that affect ordinary people
in their daily lives. Why is the Secretary of State not considering the
poorer PCTs that have stayed in budget yet have to suffer because of
the overspending of
others?</p><p><a name="st_o15"><a name="06112888000045"><b><a name="61128-0001.htm_spnew15"><a name="06112888000401">Ms

insisting that overspending organisations, of which there are far too
many in London, get their finances back under control so that we do not
have to go on asking the communities in areas such as Lambeth and

decisions. As I explained in the letter that I sent to my hon. Friends

territory that is slightly dangerous for his party. His colleague the
hon. Member for Wellingborough (Mr. Bone) said that health
funding was inadequate because his PCT was under target, but the
formula balances a range of factors, including deprivation, age,
rurality and market forces, in producing notional target allocations
for all PCTs in the country. Recently, the Opposition have suggested
that health resources should be distributed according to what they
called the &#147;burden of disease&#148;. The result of such a
policy would be that the constituencies of every Minister on the Front
Bench today would get significant extra resources, at the expense of
the areas represented by the people who are pointing their fingers at

Overspending by any part of the NHS means that another part of the

having to help the NHS collectively and put money into the system to
help other areas where there are financial pressures. She is right to

Friend the Member for Charnwood (Mr. Dorrell), a former
Secretary of State for Health. The Government calculate the need for
health care according to the weighted capitation allocation derived
from deprivation indices, but the Minister must know that that need is
determined largely by morbidity, and hence age. Northamptonshire
Heartlands PCT has a projected deficit of &#163;4 million, and it is
being condemned to the regime of cash freeze and cuts experienced by
most PCTs that serve older populations. Non-existent public health
provision has failed socially deprived areas. Will the Minister concede
that his funding formula discriminates against elderly
people?</p><p><a name="st_o72"><a name="06112888000116"><b><a name="61128-0003.htm_spnew6"><a name="06112888000463">Andy

Dispatch Box, that funding should be distributed according to age.
However, less than two months ago the Opposition issued a policy
document that stated that funds should be distributed according to the
&#147;burden of disease&#148;. That is entirely different. The
burden of disease&#151;that is, the incidence of diseases such as
cancer or coronary heart disease per 100,000 of the
population&#151;is larger in my constituency of Leigh than it is in
his constituency of Eddisbury. If the Opposition want funding to be
distributed according to age, they need to change their

Minister for Local Government (Mr. Phil
Woolas):</b> With permission, I should like to make a
statement about local authority revenue finance for England in 2007-08.
Sensible planning for service delivery needs a stable and predictable
funding environment. The quality of councils&#146; forward budgets,
their relations with stakeholders whose budgets they support, and their
ability to set low and sustainable council taxes, will all be promoted
by predictable
funding.</p><p><a name="stpa_o13"><a name="61128-0004.htm_para0"><a name="06112888000155">As
I told the House last January, we were then setting out firm proposals
for forward financial allocations on a two-year basis&#151;including
the use of projected data for population and council tax base. As
2007-08 is the second year of a multi-year settlement, the policy is
not to change the settlement, including the data used in the grant
calculations, from that previously announced, other than in exceptional
circumstances.</p><p><a name="stpa_o14"><a name="61128-0004.htm_para1"><a name="06112888000156">This
year&#146;s announcement therefore contains no surprises for local
authorities. I make a virtue of that, because I am convinced of the
advantages of multi-year financial planning, and most of what I hear
from councils and their delivery partners, such as those in the third
sector, supports that view. Today&#146;s announcement launches a
period of statutory consultation, and I will fully consider any
representations made during the consultation period in the light of the
policy in relation to multi-year
settlements.</p><p><a name="stpa_o15"><a name="61128-0004.htm_para2"><a name="06112888000157">Within
the framework of stability, I am able to provide adjustments to grant
allocations for the voluntary merger of the fire services of Devon and
Somerset under a new single combined authority, should that go ahead
for 2007-08. Today, I am also updating details of individual specific
grant allocations to local authorities for
2007-08.</p><p><a name="stpa_o16"><a name="61128-0004.htm_para3"><a name="06112888000158">With the next
spending review period, we will move to give three years of grant
allocations to local government: for 2008-09, 2009-10 and 2010-11. The
stability provided by multi-year settlements will allow local
government to publish three-year council tax figures, and we would
expect it to take up that opportunity. More widely, such security on
funding will enable councils to move forward on providing more
flexible, efficient and responsive services to their communities, as
was set out in our October 2006 White Paper, &#147;Strong and
prosperous communities&#148;. It will facilitate the move towards
new, more inclusive local area agreements that are tailored to meet the
needs of individual areas and the drawing together of different
stakeholders to provide better, more cost-effective services that
seamlessly meet the needs of
clients.</p><p><a name="stpa_o17"><a name="61128-0004.htm_para4"><a name="06112888000159">Total revenue
grants to English local authorities will be &#163;65.7 billion in
2007-08, an increase over 2006-07 of &#163;3.1 billion, or 4.9 per
cent. Part of that increase is in specific grants, and it includes
dedicated funding for schools and a further &#163;525 million in
neighbourhood renewal fund, allocating extra help to the 86 most
deprived local authority areas in England. Within that total, formula
grant will total &#163;25.6 billion in 2007-08, an increase of 3.7
per cent. That means that by 2007-08, the increase in Government grant
for local services since taking office will be 39 per cent. in real

rates in 2007-08 will be 44.4p in the pound, and the small business
non-domestic rating multiplier will be 44.1p. That means that, once
again, businesses and other non-domestic users can look forward to
predictable and stable
rates.</p><p><a name="stpa_o18"><a name="61128-0004.htm_para5"><a name="06112888000160">Grant
floors&#151;minimum guaranteed increases from one year to the
next&#151;are a permanent part of the system. I need to strike a
balance between funding stability and the cost of the floor. This year,
I am able to improve floor protection for fire and rescue authorities,
while easing the impact of floors on upper-tier and shire district
authorities. I can thus today confirm my proposal that, for 2007-08,
the floors will be: for authorities with education and social services
responsibilities, 2.7 per cent.; for police authorities, 3.6 per cent.;
for fire and rescue authorities, 2.7 per cent.; and for shire district
authorities, 2.7 per cent. Within each group of authorities, those
above the floor will have their grant increase scaled back to pay for
that floor.</p><p><a name="stpa_o19"><a name="61128-0004.htm_para6"><a name="06112888000161">We have
provided a stable and predictable funding basis for local services. We
expect local government to respond positively as far as council tax is
concerned. We thus expect to see an average council tax increase in
England in 2007-08 of less than 5 per cent. We will not allow excessive
council tax increases. We have used our reserve capping powers in
previous years to deal with excessive increases and we will not
hesitate to do so again if that proves
necessary.</p><p><a name="stpa_o20"><a name="61128-0004.htm_para7"><a name="06112888000162">I am also
announcing consultation on alternative notional amounts for Devon and
Somerset fire and rescue authority and Somerset county council. That
will enable like-for-like comparisons to be made between 2006-07 and
2007-08 budget requirements for capping purposes. This is being issued
today for consultation to ensure that, should the proposed merger go
ahead for 2007-08, the relevant authorities will know, in advance of
setting their budgets, the budget requirement figure for 2006-07 that
the Government will use when considering using their capping
powers.</p><p><a name="stpa_o21"><a name="61128-0004.htm_para8"><a name="06112888000163">The supporting
people programme has proved to be a highly successful one that has
provided support to more than 1 million vulnerable people each year. In
July, I announced almost &#163;1.7 billion of investment in
supporting people and I am pleased now to confirm the grant allocations
for 2007-08. Additionally, I can announce a further &#163;40 million
of administration grant for authorities in 2007-08 to help them to
manage that important programme. I am pleased to announce that if
authorities generate savings under the programme through their careful
management, they will be able to roll forward those savings from
2006-07 to 2007-08, in order to reinvest in the
programme.</p><p><a name="stpa_o22"><a name="61128-0004.htm_para9"><a name="06112888000164">The
Government have provided another significant boost for local
authorities, setting out a financial package that is stable,
predictable and adequate to meet the pressures that local authorities
face, but keeping council tax increases down to acceptable levels. I
have placed copies of the tables showing grant allocations and copies
of the supporting documentation in the Vote Office and the Library, and
full details are being made available to local authorities on our
website. I look forward to receiving consultation responses, and I
commend the proposals to the House.</p><br>

rising by 84 per cent., and that takes the average bill for a band D
property to &#163;1,268 this year. A 5 per cent. rise this year will
mean an extra &#163;63 on the bill of a typical pensioner couple or a
family, and that is equivalent to paying &#163;111 every month of the
year. What is the Minister&#146;s estimate of the extra burden on the
vulnerable? I remember the deep shock felt by households when the
average band D bill breached &#163;1,000. It took seven years of this
Labour Government for us to reach that oppressive figure. From the
figures before us, we can calculate&#151;I suppose that that is the
advantage of multi-year financial planning&#151;what bills will be by

himself the embarrassment of capping authorities in cases in which the
savings are trivial? Will he confirm that his capping powers will not
be applied to the Olympic levy on council tax, and if costs continue to

the Minister give a clear undertaking that the Government will publish
Sir Michael&#146;s recommendations well in advance of the debate on

council tax is the failure of the Government to finance fully the
burdens that they impose on local councils from Whitehall. Will the
Minister confirm that, on top of the figures given today, the

seven out of 10 local authorities have been hit by cost-cutting
pressures from the NHS. Are there any measures in the settlement to

comments about my attitude to the House, but I can assure him that the
details of the statement were largely announced to the House last year,
so there has not been a breach of privilege in the House. If there had
been, I would take it very seriously. I thank the hon. Gentleman for
his opening remarks but, in response to the questions that he asked, I
specifically announced that the Government would not tolerate average
tax increases above 5 per cent.&#151;that is the same policy that I
pursued last year. Last year, he attempted to portray that as an actual
increase in everyone&#146;s council tax of 5 per cent. Of course,
that was not the case this year, and it will not be the case next year.
I accept his point that an advantage of multi-year statements is that
we can predict council tax increases in future, but a disadvantage of
that sensible policy from the Government&#146;s point of view is that
the propaganda and spin that he put on the figures is made worse. Such
a practice does nothing other than unnecessarily frighten particularly
vulnerable people, so I urge him not to indulge in it.

Prime Minister graciously said so. I accept that it is the job of Her
Majesty&#146;s Opposition to oppose, but sometimes I think Her

value for money. The hon. Gentleman&#146;s worry about the Olympics
is therefore not borne out. He asked an important question about the
Lyons review, which is due to report to the Chancellor and the
Secretary of State by the end of the year, and decisions will be made
at that time. The hon. Gentleman described the 3 per cent. efficiency
target as a cut&#151;I assume that he was referring to the Gershon

right&#151;and most of them take a responsible attitude towards the

partners is important. The hon. Gentleman therefore made a significant
point. As for his point about waste, my Department, the Department for
Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and the LGA have important work
streams on waste issues, which receive substantial attention in the

inevitable an increase in council tax of double the rate of inflation,

Instead, he should congratulate them on moving forward with the Gershon

introduce a local tax based on ability to pay, give local councils
control of business rates, allow fair votes for local elections and
scrap the hundreds of targets that are imposed on local authorities by

parties have identified that they face pressures, particularly in
social care. We work with councils and their representatives to
identify the causes of those pressures, and we work out with them,
often successfully, what we can do together to address them. The plain
fact of the matter is that the public&#151;I am sure that the hon.

increases in taxes and particularly in council tax. The Government do
not have a solution to the issue set out by the hon. Gentleman. We must
square the circle through efficiencies, the improvement of services and
better joint working with other public service agencies, which has

and the Chancellor have just put together a document about the
challenges facing the Government which highlights the problems that
arise in a society in which the numbers of elderly people and young
people are growing in proportion to the total population. Those are
precisely the groups that make the most demands on social services, and
where significantly higher statutory demands are laid upon local
authorities and the most pressure from budgetary provision is felt.

that the Government are proposing, through the White Paper, a
partnership approach whereby local authorities are freed up to work
more effectively with other partners, especially the health service.
Spending on social services has increased year on year above inflation.
That is not to say that there are not significant demographic and other
pressures on councils and on central Government; that is why it is

I think most people would welcome damping, or at least understand the
need for it; what we cannot understand is why there should be
additional damping before the final damping in the
formula.</p><p><a name="stpa_o40"><a name="61128-0005.htm_para1"><a name="06112888000220">Replying to
my right hon. Friend the Member for Birkenhead, my hon. Friend said
that he could not assess how much the amount would be. The Wigan
treasurer estimates that, for Wigan, it will be &#163;8
million, as against the extra &#163;4 million that we have. Will my

to resolve it, so that local authorities can address the needs of their

similar authorities that have presented the argument about double
damping in a responsible way. As I tried to explain to my right hon.
Friend the Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field)&#151;I am
grateful to my hon. Friend for acknowledging this&#151;the social
services budget for the elderly is not damped, whereas the budget for
children and young adults is. I have been able to make progress on the
overall damping. Wigan city council, owing partly to a success on which
I am happy to commend it, received a 3.9 per cent. increase this

the treatment of Bromley or any other authority until a comprehensive
list of all grant, including specific grant, is published for each

especially as Bromley council is part of the London Councils
association which argued for the floor in the first place. But
notwithstanding that, the point that the delegation made was on the
pockets of poverty, which a Member has raised. What I have done is to
make available all the specific grants that are within the remit of my
Department and portfolio today. The Department for Education and Skills
today also publishes the dedicated school budget for schools. Surety

balancing its books can be fairly described as making cuts; it is not
doing that. The hon. Gentleman does his campaign no good by pretending
otherwise. The public simply will not believe him when he says on the

weeks. I hope that we can demonstrate today to the outside world
that&#151;perhaps unusually for this place&#151;we have been able

this important issue: both inside this House with Opposition Members,

a bid by NASDAQ, the US stock market, for the LSE was still only a

for the LSE, so with a bid on the table, it is important that we move
swiftly. Our aim, with the co-operation of both Houses, is for the Bill
to gain Royal Assent as soon as possible, consistent with proper
parliamentary scrutiny. With support from all parts of the House, it
should be possible to achieve that before the NASDAQ bid reaches its

Bill&#146;s detail, I want to set out the wider context. London today
is widely seen as one of only two truly global financial centres in the
world. It is the location for 70 per cent. of the global secondary bond
market, for more than 40 per cent. of global derivatives, and for more
than 40 per cent. of cross-border equities trading. London today has
more foreign banks than any other financial centre, and it is the
location for the headquarters of six of the world&#146;s 10 largest
international law firms. Based on its global reach and its reputation
for free, fair and open global markets, London has in recent years been
attracting business and listings from around the world. We are
determined to keep it that
way.</p><p><a name="stpa_o50"><a name="61128-0006.htm_para8"><a name="06112888000242">I believe that
international businesses have located in the City because of four great
strengths: our commitment to the rule of law and the highest
professional standards; the skills and flexibility of the work force
and our ability to attract talent from around the world; our
long-standing tradition of openness and internationalism&#151;a
global approach to competition and ownership that has allowed the City
to innovate and to respond to new challenges; and the FSA&#146;s
highly respected principles-based and risk-based approach to
regulation, which has been put in place over the last decade. I know
that the whole House will join me today in paying tribute to the many
men and women from across our country and abroad who work hard in the
City and in our other UK financial services to build the City&#146;s
reputation and to contribute to its
strengths.</p><p><a name="stpa_o51"><a name="61128-0006.htm_para9"><a name="06112888000243">However, we
are not complacent. Back in May, when I first became the Minister
responsible for such matters, concerns were expressed to me about the
effects of a possible takeover of the London stock exchange by a
company based outside the UK, and the threat that that might pose to
London&#146;s attractiveness as a place for international listing and
wider business. Some Members will know that the UK has for some years
been open to overseas investment in UK exchanges. The London
international financial futures and options exchange, ICE Futures and
virt-x are all owned by overseas companies. Such overseas interest in
UK exchanges in part reflects our principles-based approach to
regulation, which has been flexible enough to accommodate the desire of
exchanges to innovate in recent years, but rigorous enough to ensure
the probity and integrity of our markets.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o52"><a name="61128-0007.htm_para0"><a name="06112888000244">However,
following NASDAQ&#146;s interest in acquiring the LSE, I have
discussed the implications of such a change in ownership widely in
recent months, including with all the interested parties themselves. I
have made two points absolutely clear. First, the Government are
neutral with respect to the nationality of the ownership of the LSE. It
has been put to me that the right approach is Government intervention
to protect the LSE from foreign ownership. I reject that argument. Such
intervention would fly in the face of the traditions that have
underpinned the City&#146;s success over the past 20 years. A policy
of protecting &#147;national champions&#148; would damage, not
bolster, the interests of London and the UK. So the Government do not
have and will not express any views about the commercial merits of the
proposed NASDAQ takeover. It is for the current owners of the shares to
decide whether to accept or reject the

should not affect the existing regulatory regime under which the
exchange and its members and issuers operate. We are determined to act
to protect our domestic regulatory environment, founded in both UK law
and EC directives, that has made the City a magnet for international
business. If a company operates in London, it should be regulated in
London.</p><p><a name="stpa_o53"><a name="61128-0007.htm_para1"><a name="06112888000245">Following
those discussions, in which a range of possible approaches were put to
the Government, we concluded that the only way to provide the assurance
to London and the UK was through primary legislation, by making changes
to part 18 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000, which
provides for the recognition of investment exchanges and clearing
houses.</p><p><a name="stpa_o54"><a name="61128-0007.htm_para2"><a name="06112888000246">Let me turn to
the detail of the Bill. The provisions will confer a new and specific
power on the Financial Services Authority to veto rule changes proposed
by UK- recognised investment exchanges and clearing houses that would
have an excessive regulatory impact. By excessive we mean that the
proposed rules would impose a regulatory burden on a user of the
exchange or clearing house, or the wider community, that could not be
justified by any regulatory benefits, or whose effect on those users or
the wider community would be disproportionate&#151;and obviously that
would not include anything already required by UK or EU
law.</p><p><a name="stpa_o55"><a name="61128-0007.htm_para3"><a name="06112888000247">The
new powers will not put the existing provisions for regulation of the
investment exchanges and clearing houses into question. They will apply
only to future changes. But they will apply to all UK-recognised
investment exchanges and clearing houses from the outset, not just
after there has been a change of control. They will apply to all
recognised exchanges and clearing houses, not just those that are in
foreign
hands.</p><p><a name="stpa_o56"><a name="61128-0007.htm_para4"><a name="06112888000248">The
Bill also provides for necessary processes and safeguards. The
exchanges and clearing houses will be required to notify proposed
changes to their rules and other regulatory provision&#151;by which I
mean any guidance, policy, practice or arrangement made by an exchange
or clearing house&#151;to the FSA. The FSA will have up to 30 days to
decide whether to call in a proposal for further examination. If it
calls in the proposal, the FSA will have to set a period in which it
will consult publicly about the proposed rule change. The FSA will then
have a further 30 days after that consultation period has ended to
decide whether to veto the proposed rule
change.</p><p><a name="st_o153"><a name="06112888000249"><b><a name="61128-0007.htm_spnew0"><a name="06112888000548">Mr.
Redwood:</b> What happens if the FSA decides that a proposed
change is not burdensome and therefore takes no action, but many other
people think that it is? Is there any right to take legal action
against the FSA to try to get it to take
action?</p><p><a name="st_o154"><a name="06112888000250"><b><a name="61128-0007.htm_spnew1"><a name="06112888000549">Ed
Balls:</b> Of course there is. In this area, as in others
under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000, the appropriate
course would be to apply for judicial review of the FSA&#146;s
decision. Given that that would probably be an exceptional event, an
application for judicial review would be the best
approach.</p><p><a name="st_o155"><a name="06112888000251"><b><a name="61128-0007.htm_spnew2"><a name="06112888000550">Mr.

include the protection of consumers, but do not include the
desirability of maintaining the competitive position of the
UK&#151;it merely has to have regard to that. The FSA could be
vulnerable to having its decision overturned on those
grounds.</p><p><a name="st_o156"><a name="06112888000252"><b><a name="61128-0007.htm_spnew3"><a name="06112888000551">Ed
Balls:</b> I am sure that we will deal with such matters in
detail in Committee. Clause 1 writes into the Financial Services and
Markets Act 2000 the power to block any regulatory decision by an
exchange judged to be excessive and disproportionate and going beyond
what is required for the proper functioning of that exchange. The Bill
gives the FSA the power to block changes that would damage both its
ability to regulate properly and proportionately and the
competitiveness of the City of London. We have looked at the matter in
detail, and we have judged that there is no need to include that clear
intention in the Bill. Any attempt to do so would have given the
impression that we were trying to narrow the FSA&#146;s powers
unnecessarily.</p><p><a name="stpa_o57"><a name="61128-0007.htm_para5"><a name="06112888000253">As I
have said, we believe that the problem that the hon. Member for
South-West Hertfordshire (Mr. Gauke) described will not
arise, but it is important that any decision by the FSA is open to
scrutiny. An exchange or clearing house will not be able to introduce
the proposed change in regulatory provision until the initial 30-day
period has expired without the FSA calling in the proposal, or until
the FSA has confirmed that it will not be calling the proposal in, or
until the FSA has stated that it will not be vetoing the proposal, or
until the further 30-day period has expired without the FSA issuing a
veto. If the FSA does then act, it will be open to the exchange to
appeal to judicial review, as I have just made
clear.</p><p><a name="stpa_o58"><a name="61128-0007.htm_para6"><a name="06112888000254">In
drawing up these clauses, we have been anxious to ensure that the
procedures are not burdensome and disruptive for the investment
exchanges and clearing houses. We have consulted all the main
exchanges, and the trade association. We are aware of the concern that
any unnecessary regulation could stifle innovation and impose extra
costs for both the exchanges and the FSA. The exchanges and clearing
houses have put to us their concerns that the procedures, if applied in
a heavy-handed way, could damage their competitive position by reducing
their flexibility to make and change their
rules.</p><p><a name="stpa_o59"><a name="61128-0007.htm_para7"><a name="06112888000255">We are
determined that the new processes will not impose an unnecessary
burden. The new power has always been intended to be a backstop; it was
never intended to be a day-to-day supervisory tool for the FSA. We
believe that the vast majority of changes to the exchanges&#146;
regulatory provisions and rules will not raise the sort of concern that
the new power is intended to address. The fact is that many rule
changes are routine and do not need to be subject to the type of
scrutiny and processes that I have just outlined. The FSA will not be
micro-managing the rule books of the exchanges and clearing
houses.</p><p><a name="stpa_o60"><a name="61128-0007.htm_para8"><a name="06112888000256">To
make that clear, and following detailed consultation with the exchanges
and the FSA, the Bill gives a power to the FSA to specify in its rules
which types of change to regulatory provision need to be notified and
which do not. That approach is consistent with the wider approach
adopted in the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000, where more
detailed working out is left to secondary legislation&#151;that is,
Treasury regulations or FSA rules.</p><br>

does not specify a long-stop period in which the FSA must act. It has
the initial 30-day period, and the 30 days at the end of the process,
but the Bill does not limit the length of time that the FSA can devote

Friend&#146;s particular point in detail. However, I am sure that
Mr. Deputy Speaker agrees that it will probably be more

exactly to make sure that we get such things clarified that the FSA
will consult on the rule book. That will take some months, so as we
need to act with some urgency, and because it will take considerably
more time for the FSA to hold those consultations on the detailed rules
than we hope will be available before Royal Assent, the Bill gives the
FSA the power in the meantime to grant waivers from the notification
obligation to exchanges and clearing houses for the first 12 months
after Royal Assent. That will enable the FSA to offer some comfort and
flexibility to exchanges while it gets the detail of the rules in
place&#151;to respond to the point made by my hon. Friend.</p><p><a name="stpa_o63"><a name="61128-0007.htm_para11"><a name="06112888000261">The
provisions of the Bill are intended to come into force on the day after

is to have effect, the policy intention of the Bill cannot be
undermined by precipitate rule changes between Royal Assent and

FSA has already started to work with exchanges and clearing houses on
the formulation of the waivers. Indeed, the FSA has written to me
today&#151;copies of the letter have been deposited in the Library
and passed to Opposition Members&#151;to confirm its intention to use
that power only if it is justified as proportionate and if the benefits
of doing so exceed the costs, and only after

Balls:</b> The hon. Gentleman makes an important observation.
The answer is no, not in our experience. I do not think that any other
financial centre has such an open and global market for ownership and
exchanges, as well as a regulatory regime that its authorities are so
keen to protect. There is something particular about not only our open
approach, but also our regulatory regime, which means that we are keen
simultaneously to allow ownership changes if shareholders desire them
and to retain that back-stop power.</p><p><a name="stpa_o64"><a name="61128-0007.htm_para12"><a name="06112888000264">As I said, in
the recent consultations, we considered the type of thing we could do;
for example, issues arise in the case of the proposed, or rumoured, New
York stock exchange takeover of Euronext, which would have implications
for London, owing to Euronext&#146;s ownership of LIFFE&#151;the
London International Financial Futures and Options
Exchange&#151;although regulatory issues do not arise in quite the
same way. We looked at the corporate governance changes that were being
proposed and discussed with authorities in other European capitals and
concluded that those arrangements would not give us sufficient comfort.
As we looked around the world, and at past experience, we concluded
that as no model would give us comfort, other than taking power
directly in law, that was the appropriate thing to do. However, it is
my understanding that there is no precedent for what we are
proposing.</p><p><a name="stpa_o65"><a name="61128-0007.htm_para13"><a name="06112888000265">After the
detailed scrutiny of the Bill on which we are about to embark, I hope
that Members will conclude that the guiding principles I set out
earlier are being fully respected in the legislation. First, the
principle that we should be blind to ownership of exchanges is being
protected; we are entrenching London&#146;s reputation as a global
financial centre determined to attract talent and ownership from around
the world. Nothing in the legislation has any consequence for the
nationality of the ownership of UK exchanges. It will make overseas
ownership neither easier nor more difficult and I am confident that any
potential foreign investor who wants to come to the UK will not be
deterred. We are also upholding the principle that it is right for the
Government to act to protect and enhance the UK&#146;s proportionate
and risk-based regulatory
regime.</p><p><a name="stpa_o66"><a name="61128-0007.htm_para14"><a name="06112888000266">I believe that
the Bill will deliver that objective and can do so without imposing
unnecessary regulatory burdens on the exchanges. Yes, we are
intervening. However, we are intervening and legislating not to impose
regulation, but to avoid excessive regulation being imported into the
UK. By outlawing the imposition of any rules that might endanger the
proportionate and risk-based regulatory regime that underpins the
City&#146;s success, I believe that we will help to ensure that
London continues to be a magnet for international business and new
listings from around the world. The Bill will therefore continue to
bring new investment and new jobs to the UK, so I commend it to the
House.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="ordayhd_2"><a name="61128-0007.htm_ordayhd0"><a name="06112888000383">4.45

stock exchange could lead to changes in its rule books that could
damage the competitiveness of UK capital markets. If a US exchange were
to acquire the London stock exchange, US regulations&#151;especially
Sarbanes-Oxley&#151;would be imposed on UK-listed
companies.</p><p><a name="st_o162"><a name="06112888000269"><b><a name="61128-0007.htm_spnew9"><a name="06112888000557">Mr.

made a number of speeches on the theme, so although the issue may not
yet have reached Congress, it is certainly important in the higher
ranks of the US Treasury. In some of my discussions with UK

financial services. In recent years, there have been other instances of
regulators seeking to impose their rules on businesses operating
outside their jurisdictions, thus eroding the competitive advantage
that one market has by doing things differently and countering any such
benefit. The consequence has been to impose additional costs on
businesses and try to erode the advantages of the light-touch,
principles-based, risk-driven approach, which has been the cornerstone
of the success of the UK financial services

recognised body might be concerned if they could not tighten their own
rules to protect the solvency of their organisation because such
tightening would fall foul of the legislation. The Bill might deem it
excessive, because it would not be required under UK or Community law.
Thus, if an organisation wanted to take action internally to protect
itself and its shareholders, it might not be allowed to do
so.</p><p><a name="st_o165"><a name="06112888000273"><b><a name="61128-0007.htm_spnew12"><a name="06112888000560">Mr.

such strength comes from getting the level of regulation right too.
There is a balance to be struck between over-regulation that imposes

Reflecting on the point made by the hon. Member for Edmonton

arbitrage will come under threat as the US wakes up to the consequences
of the Sarbanes-Oxley legislation. We cannot rely for ever on the
existence of such regulatory arbitrage to promote and allow UK

I hope that regulators and legislators learn those lessons. Effective
light-touch, risk-based and principles-based regulation is in the

ensure that the arguments in favour of the UK regulatory regime are put
and understood in Washington.</p><p><a name="stpa_o71"><a name="61128-0007.htm_para19"><a name="06112888000278">I
shall give some examples of how extraterritoriality imposes additional
burdens on businesses. Under the Sarbanes-Oxley legislation, the US
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board is required to report on
foreign auditors with US-listed clients. It has recently exercised
those powers by reviewing audits undertaken by Ernst and Young in the
UK. Of course, UK auditors are already subject to audit inspection
arrangements, so in a sense the additional review by the board imposes
an additional cost on UK auditors. In effect, those costs will be borne
by their clients in one form or another.</p><p><a name="stpa_o72"><a name="61128-0007.htm_para20"><a name="06112888000279">The regulatory overlap that
arises from extraterritoriality is a problem, but it is not the only
one: the situation has arisen with hedge funds when their management is
based in the UK. The Securities and Exchange Commission has sought to
regulate hedge funds by reference to the location of the hedge fund
investor. The SEC has gone to some lengths to try to draw UK-based
hedge fund managers into its remit.

firms with more than 13 clients to register with it, but it has looked
beyond simply the number of direct investors to the next layer down.

investors&#151;below the SEC limit&#151;but if they each had

and it would be drawn into the net. So there is a continuing push from
the SEC to draw more activities based outside the US into its remit,
with the consequence of imposing additional regulatory burdens on those
funds. Although the Bill tackles an aspect of extraterritoriality, we
should be under no illusion that it deals with the issue in its
entirety.</p><p><a name="st_o168"><a name="06112888000281"><b><a name="61128-0008.htm_spnew0"><a name="06112888000563">Mr.

interpreted, the Bill is a bit of a first? It provides some kind of
deregulatory ratchet, instead of a regulatory ratchet, which we have
had so often in so many areas. It cannot just target one possible
overseas buyer of the stock exchange and one possible overseas source
of extra regulation. It has to target all of that. So as exchanges
renew their regulations, there will be a gentle deregulatory pressure,
which seems admirable.</p><p><a name="st_o169"><a name="06112888000282"><b><a name="61128-0008.htm_spnew1"><a name="06112888000564">Mr.

be an inherent bias in the Bill to look at how exchanges reviewing

a benefit there. It is a slightly curious irony that the Bill makes a
small extension of regulation in order to protect the light-touch

further.</p><p><a name="st_o170"><a name="06112888000283"><b><a name="61128-0008.htm_spnew2"><a name="06112888000565">Ed

the current ownership regime of all exchanges has not created a problem

on a change of control. It is important that, in Committee, we flesh
that out still further.</p><p><a name="stpa_o74"><a name="61128-0008.htm_para1"><a name="06112888000285">Let me turn to the background
to the Bill and the importance of the measure. The global nature of
international capital markets means that businesses looking to raise
money can choose where they go to raise it. Historically, international
businesses have looked principally to New York to do so, but, following
the introduction of the Sarbanes-Oxley legislation in the aftermath of
the WorldCom and Enron scandals, international businesses have found
the regulatory burden in the US too onerous and sought to raise capital
in the UK. As a consequence, we have seen an increase in the number of
initial public offerings in London and the amount of capital raised. It
was announced earlier this month that &#163;22.3 billion of funds has
been raised on the London stock exchange so far this year, which
exceeds the amount raised on other exchanges.</p><br>

benefit to the UK from Sarbanes-Oxley and the impact of that
regulation, and not just in terms of fees for merchant banks and
issuers. There are also the accountancy and legal services. A whole
range of people have benefited from the fallout from excessive
regulation in the US. A recent study indicated why firms were coming to
raise money in the UK. It said that the cost of capital at both the
initial public offering stage and afterwards is lower in London than in
other major European or US financial centres. The report, commissioned
by the City of London corporation and the London stock exchange, found
that London markets are cheaper than both the New York stock exchange
and NASDAQ with respect to both underwriting fees and other direct IPO
costs. Other direct IPO costs, including legal and accounting costs,
are lower in London than in the US largely due to the fact that in the
US one needs to comply with Sarbanes-Oxley.</p><p><a name="stpa_o76"><a name="61128-0008.htm_para3"><a name="06112888000287">It is interesting that, despite
the additional costs associated with US listing, the report found no
evidence that Sarbanes-Oxley has delivered any significant regulatory
benefits not already available under the UK corporate governance
regime. That indicates an area where regulation has not improved the
protection available to consumers. In the US, those involved are
bearing the costs without seeing any great regulatory
benefit.</p><p><a name="stpa_o77"><a name="61128-0008.htm_para4"><a name="06112888000288">The
unpopularity of US markets and the increasing popularity of UK and
European markets has led to US exchanges looking abroad to strengthen
their business. It led to the New York stock exchange seeking to
acquire Euronext and to the NASDAQ bid for the stock exchange. The
commercial logic of that is that the US exchanges would like to benefit
from the success of effectively regulated markets in the UK and Europe.
Indeed, we should be clear in acknowledging that it is not in the
economic interest of potential acquirers of UK and European exchanges
for the Securities and Exchange Commission to be in a position to exert
pressure to enable US regulations to be imported into the UK and
Europe. If such regulations were brought in, there would be a risk that
IPOs would move from Europe to Asia and other markets, with money thus
flowing out of the UK and Europe. That explains why acquirers have an
interest in the legislation going ahead in the
UK.</p><p><a name="stpa_o78"><a name="61128-0008.htm_para5"><a name="06112888000289">In
meetings that my hon. Friends and I have had with institutions across
the City, it has become clear that businesses are worried that the
takeover of the London stock exchange could lead to the City losing its
competitive advantage over US capital markets. We need to be clear that
the Bill has nothing to do with economic nationalism or the protection
of national institutions. It would be wrong for any country to use the
Bill to defend its protectionist policies. We have thrived as an
economy because we have open markets and enable foreign companies to
buy UK assets. Indeed, that has been one of the factors behind the
strength of the UK financial services market. The Bill is really
answering the question of how we can best protect the regulatory
advantage that we have at the
moment.</p><p><a name="stpa_o79"><a name="61128-0008.htm_para6"><a name="06112888000290">In reply to an

Minister said, the Bill gives the Financial Services Authority the
power to veto changes to the rule book not just of the LSE, but of all
UK recognised investment exchanges and clearing houses. Those powers
are new. At the moment, exchanges in London have the freedom to set
their own rules, subject to meeting certain recognition criteria. My
hon. Friend the Member for Cities of London and Westminster
(Mr. Field) asked the Minister whether there is a parallel
with that elsewhere. I understand that many other regulators regulate
the detail of rule books to a greater extent than the FSA has hitherto
been able to do. Enabling the FSA to consider rule changes and the rule
books of new exchanges is a significant change for London. Although the
measure represents an extension of the FSA&#146;s regulatory power,
it is an attempt to entrench our present advantage and, as my right
hon. Friend the Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood) said, to
introduce a deregulatory
ratchet.</p><p><a name="stpa_o82"><a name="61128-0008.htm_para9"><a name="06112888000293">One of the
concerns about the Bill that has been expressed by several people is
the extent to which the FSA will seek to look at individual rules. The
FSA will need to minimise the additional compliance burden on exchanges
without creating the opportunity for exchanges to impose unchecked
rules that make UK markets less competitive. I welcome the letter that
the Economic Secretary received from John Tiner today about the
FSA&#146;s recognition of
that.</p><p><a name="stpa_o83"><a name="61128-0008.htm_para10"><a name="06112888000294">The
Bill&#146;s regulatory impact assessment reinforces the point about
looking at relatively few changes to rules. It gives an upbeat
assessment of the impact of the Bill, suggesting that of the estimated
1,000 rule changes a year, there would be only about 25 notifications,
of which only one would be called in. On that basis, the RIA suggested
that the measure would have a relatively low cost. I suggest that when
the FSA considers regulations during the 12-month grace period before
it must introduce detailed regulations, it should look at the type of
rule changes made in the past, so that it understands what it would
call in, because it is important for it to understand what is likely to
happen in practice. We should continue to monitor the detailed
regulations once they are applied to make sure that we are not calling
in too many regulations, and imposing too many costs on exchanges and
clearing houses in the UK.</p><p><a name="stpa_o84"><a name="61128-0008.htm_para11"><a name="06112888000295">The Bill sets

prevent the exchanges from ignoring excessive regulations that come
from Brussels. It sets out the four criteria that should be considered
in determining whether requirements are excessive. The first is the
effect of existing legal and other requirements. The second is the
global character of financial services and markets, and international
mobility of activity. The third is the desirability of facilitating
innovation, and the fourth is the impact of the proposed provision on

powers relating to consumer protection, which is one of its regulatory
objectives. The Bill deals with the regulations that apply to shares
traded on exchanges, so I do not think that issues of shareholder
protection come within its remit. There are measures in the UK listing
rules that cover shareholder protection, too. The Bill is narrowly
focused; it is more a rapier-like thrust than a clunking fist when it
comes to tackling regulation, and we should keep it like that, rather

conditions set out in proposed section 300A? People using the Bill must
have a clear understanding of its import, and the purpose of the
provision is to maintain the competitive advantage of the UK financial
services sector relative to other global markets. We must look
carefully in Committee at the language of proposed subsection (4)(b) to
make sure that that message is clearly conveyed to people who are
interested in regulation in the UK. The hon. Member for Wolverhampton,
South-West asked the Minister about the lack of a backstop date in
proposed section 300D. I am sure that, after consulting stakeholders,
the Financial Services Authority will suggest an appropriate date.
However, will the Minister or the Financial Secretary confirm that the
FSA believes that the 30-day period in which it may deliberate on the
changes is sufficient to consider fully the impact of any rule changes?
Returning to the collapse of Enron and WorldCom, how long would it have
taken people to discern the long-term damage that Sarbanes-Oxley would
have inflicted if it had been introduced in UK

conclusion, Sarbanes-Oxley has provided a great boost for the City, as
US markets recognise, which is why, from Hank Paulson downwards, there
has been pressure to water down the provision. It should be a warning
to the Government and to Governments across Europe that while one piece
of legislation can strengthen our competitive position, another can
seriously damage it. We must pay great attention to the conditions that
make the UK financial services sector a great success. It is not just
about regulation&#151;it is about the people and businesses based
here, the tax system, infrastructure and many other factors. If the UK
is to thrive, we must look at what we can do ourselves to ensure that
it remains globally competitive in the financial services sector,
rather than relying on others to make mistakes from which we can
benefit.</p><p><a name="stpa_o90"><a name="61128-0008.htm_para17"><a name="06112888000311">The Bill
gives the FSA the power to protect the competitive position of our
capital markets, but as the provisions indicate, it cannot protect
exchanges and clearing houses from excessive regulations imposed here
in Westminster or in Brussels. Although it protects UK capital markets
from one aspect of extra-territoriality, it does not protect them from
all aspects. We welcome the Bill and hope it will be effective, but we
do not see it as the end of the story when it comes to maintaining the
competitiveness of the UK financial services
sector.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="ordayhd_3"><a name="61128-0008.htm_ordayhd0"><a name="06112895000125">5.15

for the City&#146;s position as one of the world&#146;s two most
successful financial centres&#151;some would say the most successful.
Such factors include the English language, our geographical position
between the US and Asian time frames, our skilled work force, and the
attractions of London as a place in which to live and do business. But
the Bill encapsulates the two main reasons for London&#146;s success:
its internationalism, and its approach to
regulation.</p><p><a name="stpa_o94"><a name="61128-0008.htm_para21"><a name="06112895000005">Britain
has always been ahead of the pack as far as globalisation is concerned.
Its financial sector has for 300 years or more been internationally
focused and outward looking. Unlike other financial centres that
developed primarily to serve their own domestic markets, the
City&#146;s phenomenal growth has been due to its role in financing
world trade, rather than financing our indigenous industries. Indeed,
as Professor Anthony Hopkins said, the industrial revolution happened
independently of the City of London.</p><p><a name="stpa_o95"><a name="61128-0008.htm_para22"><a name="06112895000006">In the past three decades or
more, since the collapse of Bretton Woods, London has prospered as a
financial centre not just by capitalising on its traditional strengths,
but by embracing liberalisation and exploiting the advantage offered it
by protectionist or fiscally restrictive regimes in other financial
centres. We have spoken a great deal today about Sarbanes-Oxley, but in
the 1970s the London Eurobond market flourished because of decisions
taken in the USA.</p><p><a name="stpa_o96"><a name="61128-0008.htm_para23"><a name="06112895000007">In
1979, the scrapping of exchange controls by the Thatcher Government
freed up the flow of capital in and out of the country, removing a key
obstacle to globalisation and cementing the City&#146;s position as
an international hub. Big bang, 20 years ago last month, changed the
City for ever, by relaxing the rules preventing foreign ownership of
British financial institutions and leading to an influx of overseas
investment. Of course, there has always been a foreign element in the
City. The names of what we would regard as some of the most traditional
City institutions, such as Rothschild&#146;s, Warburg&#146;s, and
Kleinwort Benson, make it clear that they were established by
immigrants, and they have now been taken over by yet more foreigners
coming in.</p><p><a name="stpa_o97"><a name="61128-0008.htm_para24"><a name="06112895000008">With big
bang we saw what is commonly dubbed the
&#147;Wimbledonisation&#148; of the City&#151;that is, its
domination by foreign players. In particular, US banks, prohibited by
Glass-Steagall from owning US securities houses, took the opportunity
to move into London in force, and provided the City with capital for
almost unlimited
expansion.</p>

means that London is now a truly international financial centre,
handling foreign transactions worth &#163;560 billion a day. It is
the place where more international mergers and takeovers are arranged
than anywhere else, and more cross-border transactions take place than
anywhere else. It has the biggest foreign exchange, swaps and
international insurance and reinsurance markets in the world. The City
has more foreign banks than any other financial centre&#151;264 at
the last count. It has almost a third of the daily turnover in the
world foreign exchange market. It has over 40 per cent. of the
world&#146;s OTC derivatives trade, 70 per cent. of the Eurobond
market, 40 per cent. of the world&#146;s turnover in foreign-listed
equities trading, and the fastest-growing share,

nothing to do with Barings futures trading activities in Singapore. I
was called into the Barings head office in London on the Sunday when
Barings went under to help to sort out the mess with the Bank of
England and the chief executives of the top UK banks. I remember that
day well, because it was the day of my constituency Labour
party&#146;s annual general meeting. I was chair of constituency at
the time and had to give my apologies, which raised more than a few

old boy network comprehensively failed. It may be tempting fate to say
that I do not think that such a scenario could happen now. Of course we
should never be complacent, but the Financial Services Authority and

the bank was taking. I am a member of the Treasury Committee, which has

approach is widely seen as the best in the world, and it underpins
London&#146;s success as a modern international financial centre. It
is important that we preserve that approach, which is the essence of
the Bill. While we are debating how we regulate our financial markets
and City institutions, I want to restate why, while we should aim to
achieve a degree of harmonisation and a level playing field across the
European Union&#151;and, indeed, further afield&#151;it must never
be at the expense of our international competitiveness.</p><p><a name="stpa_o103"><a name="61128-0009.htm_para5"><a name="06112895000016">London has a
comparative advantage in financial services, and if other countries
want to compete with us they should do so by raising their game to our
level, not by seeking to hold us back with inflexible, over-burdensome,
gold-plated regulation. A one-size-fits-all approach in a new enlarged
European Union is unlikely to be to London&#146;s advantage, and we
should resist attempts to force us down that path. However, we should
do so not through withdrawal and seeking to isolate and disassociate
ourselves from our European partners, as I have heard the right hon.
Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood) suggest, but through
co-operation, negotiation, being at the table and making our voice
heard.</p><p><a name="stpa_o104"><a name="61128-0009.htm_para6"><a name="06112895000017">As the Minister
has said, we should welcome European co-operation on regulation, but
only where it is necessary, where it truly furthers the integration of
the internal market and where other non-legislative policy solutions
have been thoroughly considered. Any new regulation must be implemented
in a sensitive light-touch manner,
too.</p><p><a name="stpa_o105"><a name="61128-0009.htm_para7"><a name="06112895000018">The City is
stronger because of its position within the EU. We act as
Europe&#146;s wholesale financial services gateway to the world, and
the world&#146;s financial services&#146; gateway to Europe. It is
in Britain&#146;s best interests that we stay fully engaged, but we
must do it in the City&#146;s best interests, not at the
City&#146;s expense. That is increasingly true on a global scale as
developing markets open up, and countries such as China and India
develop their financial sectors. Regulatory co-operation is more
important than ever before, but we must continue to strike the right
balance between protecting investors and entrenching financial
stability, and encouraging innovation and foreign investment.</p><p><a name="stpa_o106"><a name="61128-0009.htm_para8"><a name="06112895000019">We should not be scared of
foreign investment or foreign ownership in the City. In the late 1990s,
more than 40 per cent. of City employees had an overseas employer, and
I am sure that that percentage has, if anything, grown since then. Some
of the recognised exchanges are subsidiaries of foreign companies.
However, we need to be watchful to ensure that foreign takeovers do not
lead to the imposition of burdensome foreign regulatory standards on UK
exchanges and issuers, and that, as the hon. Member for Fareham
(Mr. Hoban) said, the US&#146;s extra-territorial
ambitions are curbed. I say that as someone who has worked for an
American investment bank and has been on the receiving end of the
not-so-light regulatory touch of the Securities and Exchange

the UK&#146;s standards of regulation and corporate governance as the
most important factor in their decision to float in London, and of
those that had considered listing on a US exchange, 90 per cent. felt
that the demands of Sarbanes-Oxley made listing in London more
attractive. We were therefore right to choose not to go down that path.

place.</p><p><a name="stpa_o110"><a name="61128-0009.htm_para12"><a name="06112895000024">I think that
the characterisation of American financial regulation&#151;I am not

over a few areas of undoubted common ground. First, it is true, as the
Economic Secretary said, that the City is a crucially important part of
the British economy. Ten per cent. of gross domestic product is
generated from financial services, although not all of those are based
in the City&#151;some are provided by retail banking throughout the
country. It is particularly important for employment.</p><p><a name="stpa_o112"><a name="61128-0009.htm_para14"><a name="06112895000026">Secondly, we all agree that
financial services must be regulated flexibly&#151;but, as the hon.
Members for Edmonton (Mr. Love) and for Wolverhampton,
South-West (Rob Marris) said, flexibility must be balanced against
investor protection and protection against systemic failure. There is
more than one dimension to
consider.</p><p><a name="stpa_o113"><a name="61128-0009.htm_para15"><a name="06112895000027">Thirdly,
we all accept that we are dealing with global markets that move very
fast and that this is not an area where nationalism or national
ownership are appropriate concepts. Competition takes place not between
countries but between sets of rules. People in the City often employ
the imagery of Wimbledon to describe what they are trying to achieve,
saying that they are hosting an event and that it does not matter
whether British

However, there are problems with the Wimbledon comparison. Will Hutton
has observed that it is probably because we have Wimbledon that we
produce such dreadful tennis players, unlike smaller European
countries. He also argues that having an international financial centre
may be to the detriment of domestic companies&#146; growth and
innovation. I do not entirely buy that, but we have to look at both
sides of the argument.</p><p><a name="stpa_o114"><a name="61128-0009.htm_para16"><a name="06112895000028">I part company with the
proposals over two issues. First, we should be more honest about what
this legislation is for. It is presented as being completely innocuous,
but its proper title should be something like the &#147;Investment
Exchanges and Clearing Houses (Americans Keep Out)&#148; Bill. That
is essentially what we are talking about. The Minister and the
Conservative spokesman have said that there is no objection to
takeovers or to foreigners per se, but it is clear that a barrier is
being raised and that powers are being created to deal with takeovers
from two particular sources, which just happen to be the two biggest
exchanges in the world: the New York stock exchange and NASDAQ. Because
they are so big, they have the potential to launch a successful
takeover in London.</p><p><a name="st_o186"><a name="06112895000029"><b><a name="61128-0009.htm_spnew3"><a name="06112895000135">Ed

in London is disproved by the reality of today&#146;s City of

companies investing in London. The problem is with the American

the issue here.</p><p><a name="stpa_o115"><a name="61128-0009.htm_para17"><a name="06112895000031">There
are certain forms of regulation that are not covered by the Bill. The
right hon. Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood) might be able
to make this point more comfortably that I can. The Bill does not cover
European regulation, which may or may not be onerous. Let us envisage a
hypothetical situation&#151;after all, the Bill is all about
hypothetical possibilities&#151;in which, as a result of injecting
this poison pill into the regulatory system, the New York stock
exchange backs off from its interest in the Euronext company, and the
Deutsche Börse, a German company that is interested in acquiring
a Franco-Dutch operation, succeeds as a consequence of that. As a
pan-European exchange, it could then choose to apply European
regulation in a way that is unhelpful to London&#146;s interests.
That is purely hypothetical, but it could certainly happen.</p><p><a name="stpa_o116"><a name="61128-0009.htm_para18"><a name="06112895000032">There is
nothing in the Bill to prevent that from happening, because European

with the NYSE or NASDAQ owning a UK exchange. We do not encourage or
discourage it, but we have no problem with it at all. The issue is
whether they would own an exchange where listings are regulated in

different interpretation. They have given public assurances that there
is no way in which the SEC and other regulations in the United States

that might happen and whether it is a plausible hypothesis. The

public statement of opposition from either of those companies. As I
understand it, the opposite is the case: they are comfortable about us
taking the power, so that we can be reassured, as can they, that the
regulatory regime will not change as a result of a change in ownership.

of the London stock exchange, has said clearly that her exchange is not
for sale. That is her strategy. She does not want to sell. The price of
shares in the London stock exchange has been ramped up considerably,
creating barriers, and its management undoubtedly want to resist a
takeover. Why would the British Government want to create a mechanism
to make it easier to protect the insider interest in this case?
</p><p><a name="stpa_o118"><a name="61128-0009.htm_para20"><a name="06112895000045">Let
me move on to the argument about which the Economic Secretary is
exercised, which goes back to the principle and basic economics of
exchanges. My starting point would be that an exchange is a network or
utility that works best because everybody is a participant in it, as in
the case of the electricity grid or bank clearing system. The
productivity of exchanges, however, has risen rapidly&#151;in London,
by 6 per cent. in the past 20 years&#151;and their monopolistic
structure tends to lead to much higher profits and fees, which are
resisted by the users.</p><p><a name="stpa_o119"><a name="61128-0009.htm_para21"><a name="06112895000046">Two sets of
countervailing pressures are emerging, one of which is competition. In
the United States in particular, small exchanges are being launched
with low costs. In principle, the new European regulation encourages
competition, which, in the course of time, should bid down costs. The
Turquoise consortium of investment banks appears to have that
objective. The problem of obtaining gains through competition, however,
is that it breaks up the network, losing efficiency and potentially
raising costs.</p><p><a name="stpa_o120"><a name="61128-0009.htm_para22"><a name="06112895000047">That
raises the question of the other route to contestability in the market,
which is through takeovers. That is the reason for growing pressure
from the New York stock exchange, NASDAQ, Deutsche Börse,
Macquarie bank and others to enter the market. The question is whether
that is a problem. The problem posed is that one or other such
acquisition&#151;if we accept that the worry is not just about the
Americans&#151;might succeed in importing into the UK unhelpful forms
of regulation, particularly those prevailing in the United
States.</p><p><a name="stpa_o121"><a name="61128-0009.htm_para23"><a name="06112895000048">The
Conservative spokesman made a genuine attempt to explain the
transmission mechanism for that, and quoted one example, the
registration of hedge funds. As I understand it, however, that case was
introduced at the behest of the SEC and has subsequently been dropped,
although I am sure that he knows a lot more about that than I do. I
think that that is the only concrete case that we have of that type of
extra-territoriality being introduced through the exchange mechanism,
but there may be many others. The right hon. Member for Wokingham is
shaking his head. It is important to understand how this could happen,
why it is such a threat in practice, and why the Bill is necessary to
prevent
it.</p><p><a name="st_o199"><a name="06112895000049"><b><a name="61128-0009.htm_spnew16"><a name="06112895000148">Stewart

suggesting that when an exchange is taken over alien extra-territorial

lead to the creation of alternative structures? AIM&#151;alternative
investment market&#151;and subsequently Ofex were created because of
the cost of a full London stock exchange listing. Would this not offer
an opportunity for the creation of another exchange somewhere down the
line that avoided extra-territorial
regulation?</p><br>

the argument a step further. Let us suppose that we are talking about
the potential implications of NASDAQ&#146;s taking over the London
stock exchange. Why, in any circumstances, would it want to bring
American regulation with it? Presumably&#151;the Minister made this
point indirectly&#151;it is coming here to pick up listings that it
has been unable to attract in the United States, and would strongly
resist any attempt to import American regulation through the stock

made very well by the hon. Member for Fareham is that although
extra-territoriality is clearly a problem, this is not the most
appropriate way of dealing with it, or even directly relevant to most
aspects of it. An appalling example of extra-territoriality in recent
months is that of the NatWest Three. Taking British employees of a
British company to an American court for an offence that they committed
in the United Kingdom is real extra-territoriality. There is a problem
with British companies that happen to be listed in the United States
being pursued in Britain for things that they have done in the United
States, and the Bill will not protect against that. If
extra-territoriality is to be dealt with, it will have to be dealt with
through joint negotiation with the United States. Whatever the virtues
of the Bill, it does not deal with the extra-territoriality
problem.</p><p><a name="stpa_o124"><a name="61128-0010.htm_para2"><a name="06112895000053">It is being
suggested that there is something lethal about the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.
Certainly everyone with whom I have discussed it in the City is worried
about what might happen if those five pieces of American legislation
entered British law. The hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-West

the legislation so difficult and
iniquitous?</p><p><a name="stpa_o125"><a name="61128-0010.htm_para3"><a name="06112895000054">Let us
return to basics. The Sarbanes-Oxley law was introduced in the wake of
Enron and WorldCom. It dealt with a variety of issues, which included
investor protection but also accounting procedures. When it was
referred to the American Congress, which covers a wide
spectrum&#151;no one could accuse American Congressmen of being
isolated from business interests and opinions&#151;the Senate backed
it by 99 votes to nil, while the House of Representatives backed it by
423 votes to three. The overwhelming consensus, extending from the most
libertarian Republicans to the most diehard leftists of the Democratic
party, was that the legislation was sensible. Distinguished people such
as Alan Greenspan spoke up for it strongly&#151;although they have
subsequently acknowledged that aspects of it are a problem, notably
section 404. The vast majority of it is uncontentious, and perhaps
helpful.</p><p><a name="st_o201"><a name="06112895000055"><b><a name="61128-0010.htm_spnew1"><a name="06112895000150">Mr.

gallery?</p><br>

markets, but it is my understanding that the decline in listings in the
United States was taking place quite some time before the
Sarbanes-Oxley provisions were introduced. That decline was prompted
by, among other things, class actions and the fact that there are
multiple regulators with different agendas. The decline of the
IPO&#151;initial public offering&#151;market has been referred to;
that was in evidence well before the Sarbanes-Oxley provisions came

interpretation of recent financial history in which that villainous

good academic research that suggests that companies that have listed in

regulatory costs, but they also have higher levels of investor
protection, which is a positive factor in the market. So there is a
trade-off, and the situation is not as clear-cut as some Members seem

we might be crossing over too much from normal commercial activity. I
want us to focus on the Bill&#146;s objectives, which seem to be to
avoid burdensome regulation over and above that required for an
exchange or a clearing house. Is that not what we should be focusing

entirely explained, into the workings of the British exchanges. The

electricity is delivered by a French company that is an offshoot of the
French state. At no point has it been suggested that we need to
introduce defensive legislation to protect us from those imports. The
view has been that contested takeovers are desirable and might well be

point is: what is so different and special about the London exchange

examples that the hon. Gentleman cited&#151;such as the takeover of
BAA plc&#151;and the takeover of the stock exchange: BAA plc exists
in a regulatory environment that it does not control, whereas the stock
exchange determines its own rules. The Bill is about the rules that the
stock exchange and other exchanges use to regulate business conducted
on those exchanges. To refer to another of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
examples, water companies operate within the framework of Ofwat, but
the stock exchange makes its own rules. What we are trying to do in
this Bill is protect the rules of the stock exchange; it is not about
the ownership of the stock exchange, but about ensuring that its rules
work efficiently and effectively and achieve their regulatory
objectives. There is a difference between the takeovers that the hon.
Gentleman mentioned and the potential takeover of the stock exchange or
any other exchange in the

over a network with a set of rules and taking over individual

reasoning behind the Bill. I realise that there is a wish not to make
British regulatory practice more onerous than it already is, and that
there is a fear&#151;it has not yet been properly explained,
however&#151;that the American rules will be imported into the
British system as a result of the takeover. If the Minister can explain

the UK that the alternative investment market&#151;a lighter-touch
market with lighter-touch rules set by the London stock
exchange&#151;is too &#147;light-touch&#148;. One can imagine a
regulator in another part of the world saying to a company regulated in
that part of the world, &#147;If you are going to own a foreign
exchange like the LSE, which is listing through the AIM, you must make
sure that the AIM listings are equivalent to our rules in our
territoriality, in order to pass our domestic regulatory regime
test.&#148; That example shows exactly how an external regulator
could attempt to undermine our competitive strength by exporting rules

that a key factor in the success of the British financial services
sector has been the light-touch, risk-based regulatory regime. The
Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 replaced the old
self-regulatory regime with an approach based on principles, statutory
independence, transparency and a rigorous assessment of costs and
benefits for each individual regulation. My hon. Friend the Minister
has struck the right balance in the Bill between Government
intervention and a laissez-faire approach. He made it clear earlier
that the Government have no interest in, or concern about, the
nationality of the London stock exchange&#146;s ownership. Indeed,
the UK markets are already open to overseas investment; for example,
the London international financial futures and options exchange is
already owned by Euronext. I hope that that satisfies some of the
concerns raised earlier by the hon. Member for Twickenham.</p><p><a name="stpa_o132"><a name="61128-0010.htm_para10"><a name="06112895000074">There is a clear trend toward
globalisation in the exchanges, as well as in equity trading, which
spells the end of natural monopolies in this piece of financial
infrastructure and increased competitiveness in the arena of exchanges.
It is interesting to note that, despite the huge increase in turnover
volume, fee rates have been maintained and bid-offer spreads have not
changed, which means that exchange profitability has risen greatly.
That is why the banks are looking again at the ownership of the
exchanges. While NASDAQ has been looking at the London stock exchange,
the LSE is looking over its shoulder at Project Turquoise&#151;a
conglomeration of banks that is looking at the LSE.</p><p><a name="stpa_o133"><a name="61128-0010.htm_para11"><a name="06112895000075">So in this
very fluid situation, it is right that the Government take action to
safeguard our regulatory regime. It would be unacceptable if a takeover
of the London stock exchange by a US exchange such as NASDAQ led to US
regulatory requirements being imposed on UK issuers of securities

to prevent regulatory changes that would undermine our approach, and it
gives the power of veto not on day-to-day regulation, but on
significant changes that would bring about a disproportionate burden of
regulation.</p><p><a name="stpa_o134"><a name="61128-0010.htm_para12"><a name="06112895000076">There are

questions correctly. The first is on ownership and national champions.

<notus-date day="28" month="11" year="2006" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><b>28 Nov 2006 : Column 1014</b><br>Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable), I agree with the points made by the
Economic Secretary and my hon. Friend the Member for Fareham
(Mr. Hoban) that this is not an issue of economic
nationalism. The ownership of institutions in the City is not
important. Indeed, there are far more important issues at stake. At a
time of growing economic nationalism&#151;the chairman of the CBI,
Sir John Sunderland, in remarks reported this morning, was critical of
France, Spain, Italy and the US for their economic
nationalism&#151;it is pleasing that we have a consensus between the
major parties that focusing on ownership is a mistake. Indeed, the City
has done well out of Wimbledonisation, whereby we provide the venue and
the rest of the world provides the players, and that is to be
welcomed.</p><p><a name="stpa_o135"><a name="61128-0010.htm_para13"><a name="06112895000078">The second
question that arises from globalisation concerns the difficulty that
countries have in achieving the appropriate level of regulation. There
is often a race to the bottom, as the jurisdiction with the lowest
level of regulation is seen as the most attractive to businesses. That
argument is grossly overstated. Globalisation punishes inappropriate,
disproportionate and bad regulation, and Sarbanes-Oxley is an example.
As several hon. Members have pointed out, Sarbanes-Oxley has resulted
in some companies listing in the UK rather than in the US. However,
good regulation is necessary. If a country gets the balance
right&#151;and we can argue that this country has done so, especially
compared with the US in this area&#151;it does well. The race to the
bottom argument is therefore
weak.</p><p><a name="stpa_o136"><a name="61128-0010.htm_para14"><a name="06112895000079">Countries
should retain their own regulatory control, as the Bill suggests,
because otherwise the pressure is towards regulation. If globalisation
is about economic integration, it also pushes countries towards
regulatory integration. Co-operation between regulators is at times
appropriate, but too much regulatory integration would be dangerous.
One example is the extra-territorial approach adopted by the US on
occasion, which is a concern. To return to the points made by the hon.
Member for Twickenham, the concern is not that a US exchange will wish
to impose additional regulatory burdens on those companies listed on a
UK exchange that becomes a subsidiary of the US exchange. The concern
is that US legislators will attempt to impose additional regulatory
burdens on those companies listed on the LSE or AIM. Extraterritorial
legislation regulation is one way in which Governments have attempted
to deal with the supposed race to the
bottom.</p><p><a name="stpa_o137"><a name="61128-0010.htm_para15"><a name="06112895000080">Another
way&#151;and this was touched on by the hon. Member for Bristol, East
(Kerry McCarthy)&#151;is supranational regulation, and we see that
with the European Union. Some of the arguments that can be used for the
approach set out in the Bill&#151;that UK regulation should continue
to apply and that we should not be influenced by overseas
factors&#151;also apply to European legislation, as the hon. Lady
acknowledged. The issue is about getting the balance
right.</p><p><a name="stpa_o138"><a name="61128-0010.htm_para16"><a name="06112895000081">I have two
specific concerns about the wording of the Bill. The first is the point
that I made to the Economic Secretary during his speech earlier. For
argument&#146;s sake, let us suppose that NASDAQ buys the LSE. Then,
prompted by NASDAQ, presumably for reasons of US law, the LSE proposes
a rule change to implement Sarbanes-Oxley. The FSA considers that
change&#151;whether it is excessive or disproportionate&#151;and
blocks it. The next step would be a challenge and

the FSA come into play.</p><p><a name="stpa_o139"><a name="61128-0010.htm_para17"><a name="06112895000082">The FSA has the regulatory
objective of protecting consumers, and rightly so. However, it does not
have the regulatory objective of protecting or maintaining the
competitiveness of UK financial services. Does that make the FSA
vulnerable to judicial review in such circumstances? I assume that the
Treasury has sought advice on that point, but perhaps the Financial
Secretary could address the issue when he winds up.</p><p><a name="stpa_o140"><a name="61128-0010.htm_para18"><a name="06112895000083">The issue could have been
addressed in a couple of ways. First, section 5 of the Financial
Services and Markets Act 2000, which relates to the protection of
consumers, could be amended to add a carve-out that makes it clear that
any requirement that the FSA deems to be excessive under section 300A
is not an appropriate measure for the protection of consumers. The
other&#151;and perhaps preferable&#151;way to deal with the issue
would be to treat the desirability of maintaining the competitive
position of the UK as a regulatory objective, instead of an also-ran,
second-tier point. I assume that the Treasury has considered that
option and rejected it for various reasons, but I raise the point none
the
less.</p><p><a name="st_o215"><a name="06112895000084"><b><a name="61128-0010.htm_spnew15"><a name="06112895000164">Rob
Marris:</b> On the first of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s two
suggested approaches, is he seriously suggesting lessening or
undermining consumer protection? That is what it sounded
like.</p><p><a name="st_o216"><a name="06112895000085"><b><a name="61128-0010.htm_spnew16"><a name="06112895000165">Mr.
Gauke:</b> My point is that it could be a two-stage process.
Where the FSA concludes that the rule change is excessive and
disproportionate&#151;and bearing in mind its regulatory objectives
at that point&#151;it could be because the proposed rule is not
appropriate for the protection of consumers. However, the test of
whether a proposed rule is excessive under section 300A might be an
easier test to apply. Given that the rule change has overcome that
hurdle, the FSA would then need to consider its regulatory objectives
and other factors. To do so, it has almost to ignore the first step and
ask whether the rule change is appropriate and whether it would protect
consumers. If the rule change would protect consumers, does the FSA
have the flexibility to reject it as inappropriate? The second stage
may be harder for the FSA and, under judicial review, it may run into
difficulties. It is a technical point and might be better addressed at
a later stage, but it is an issue. The FSA is left to make a difficult
decision&#151;technical in nature but political in
implication&#151;as to whether a regulation is appropriate and
proportionate. That will have consequences for our relationship with
the
US.</p><p><a name="stpa_o141"><a name="61128-0010.htm_para19"><a name="06112895000086">The
Protection of Trading Interests Act 1980 deals with some of the same
matters as this Bill, and it gives the Secretary of State for Trade and
Industry the power to make judgments. Is it right to give the unelected
FSA the power to make difficult political decisions? The provision
could cut two ways. First, one could claim that the existence of a
second tier is more likely to lead to the Treasury being put under
political pressure and that it is therefore better to keep matters at
arm&#146;s length and subject to purely technical decisions. On the
other hand, concern could be expressed about whether a mere regulator
like the FSA could be brave enough to take on the might of, say, the
US.</p><br>

success as a financial centre, but why is it being brought in now? To
understand that, we must look at the backdrop to its introduction. All
speakers so far have commented on the increasing internationalisation
of the City and its institutions. Since the London stock exchange was
converted from being a membership organisation, there has been interest
from foreign buyers. First was the Deutsche Börse in 2004, then
the McQuarrie bank&#151;whose structure no one really
understands&#151;in 2005. This year, of course, NASDAQ has continued
to pursue its quarry, and we understand that a formal bid has been
made.</p><p><a name="stpa_o143"><a name="61128-0011.htm_para1"><a name="06112895000093">However,
it is not only the LSE that is subject to internationalisation. The

Indeed, Euronext may well be taken over in the near future by the New
York stock exchange. Other hon. Members have observed that there could

there have been significant difficulties in other jurisdictions,
especially in the US, with the result that New York has been very much
affected. No one so far has commented on the article in
yesterday&#146;s <i> Financial Times</i> entitled &#147;Big
Apple&#146;s Glory Days Passed&#148;, or on the report entitled
&#147;Down on the Street&#148; in last weekend&#146;s edition of

market.</p><p><a name="stpa_o145"><a name="61128-0011.htm_para3"><a name="06112895000095">There is no
doubt that there is an air of doom and gloom about New York&#146;s
ability to compete internationally. That was summed up in a recent
article by Mayor Bloomberg and Chuck Schumer, the Senator for New York
state, entitled &#147;Learn from London&#148;. However, we need to
look more carefully at the reasons for that decline in competitiveness,
and the American press is full of articles trying to describe what has
been happening in recent
years.</p><p><a name="stpa_o146"><a name="61128-0011.htm_para4"><a name="06112895000096">No mention has
been made in the debate about the tougher immigration controls that
exist in New York, which are affecting its ability to tap expertise
from around the world. They are also limiting that centre&#146;s
ability to bring people together on a short-term basis, and the result
is a real effect on the operation of the New York market. Some people
in the US think that New York has been slow to innovate, and anyone who
looks at the front page of the <i> Wall Street Journal </i>will know how
slow that innovation can sometimes be.</p><p><a name="stpa_o147"><a name="61128-0011.htm_para5"><a name="06112895000097">In addition, a culture of
litigation exists in the US that does not exist here. The SEC
undertakes very aggressive litigation, and indeed the newly elected
Governor of New York state built his reputation on aggressive
prosecutions in the market place. However, the major focus of concern
in America has been on the cost of regulation. In that regard, London
has a major advantage, in that it has a principles-and risk-based
regulatory structure with a light touch. That has played a significant
role in its success.</p><p><a name="stpa_o148"><a name="61128-0011.htm_para6"><a name="06112895000098">The success
of London is worth examining. Financial services make up 8 per cent. of
our economy&#151;12 per cent. if we include business services. As was
mentioned earlier, the sector has been growing at 10 per cent. a year,
with 300,000 people employed directly and an unknown number indirectly.
Moreover, it is not often appreciated that the sector employs 100,000
people in Scotland. Another 100,000 are employed in the Leeds area of
Yorkshire, although they work more in business services than in
financial
services.</p><p><a name="stpa_o149"><a name="61128-0011.htm_para7"><a name="06112895000099">London is
the only major challenger to New York as a global financial centre. The
debate has already touched on London&#146;s capacity in foreign
exchange dealing, with more than 40 per cent. of the global trade in
foreign-based equities. Interestingly, 75 per cent. of the top 500 US
companies have a base in London. That is an important consideration,
and mention has been made of the cluster effect, whereby expertise in
legal, business and finance services are brought together to achieve
the success that I have
outlined.</p><p><a name="stpa_o150"><a name="61128-0011.htm_para8"><a name="06112895000100">London

spoke about IPOs, but I think that he got it slightly wrong. There has
been a seismic shift in that market in a relatively short time. He was
right to suggest that the move predates the Sarbanes-Oxley rules, but
the IPO volume in New York used to be five times bigger than it was in
London. Even so, London overtook New York in that market last year, and
many people on the other side of the pond are very worried about
that.</p><p><a name="stpa_o152"><a name="61128-0011.htm_para10"><a name="06112895000102">The regulatory
framework is incredibly important, but other factors are at work in the
successes that I have described. We look for people with the highest
professional standards, and we work hard to attract the best talent
available. Europeans regularly come to London to learn how our
financial services operate. We are open and transparent in much of what
we do. As has already been said, more international banks are
registered in London than anywhere else and a similar internationalism
can be seen across the whole market.</p><p><a name="stpa_o153"><a name="61128-0011.htm_para11"><a name="06112895000103">We have to recognise the impact
of those principles on the success of the City and it would be
counter-productive to reverse them. We have to ensure that we do not
appear to be trying to frustrate or oppose foreign international
ownership of our institutions. That is a cardinal principle and I very
much support the Economic Secretary&#146;s clear statement of it
today. The Government have to remain neutral on ownership; there is
significantly more international ownership in London than in any other
marketplace, which has been of great benefit to
us.</p><p><a name="stpa_o154"><a name="61128-0011.htm_para12"><a name="06112895000104">We also have to
recognise that consolidation and integration in financial services
may&#151;only may&#151;threaten the light-touch regulation that has
been the hallmark of the City and of the FSA since it was set up. As I
have said before, evidence suggests that that light touch gives the
City a significant advantage over other marketplaces. Indeed, excessive
regulation threatens the possibility of a retreat offshore. We have
already discussed that point this afternoon, so I shall not go into it.
What is most important is that we ensure that the legislation will
protect the integrity of London as a global financial
centre.</p><p><a name="stpa_o155"><a name="61128-0011.htm_para13"><a name="06112895000105">The Bill also
responds to the concern, about which we have had quite a debate, that
the acquisition of City institutions may bring extra-territorial
application of regulations. We have talked in particular about
Sarbanes-Oxley. In my view, that would extinguish London&#146;s
present regulatory advantage, because it would provide additional
onerous regulatory requirements, and we have asked questions about
that. The internal control report, which is part of Sarbanes-Oxley,
seems to be the focus of greatest concern in terms of the legislative
changes introduced under that Act. It is clear that there has been a
considerable hike in compliance costs as a result of the
measure.</p><p><a name="stpa_o156"><a name="61128-0011.htm_para14"><a name="06112895000106">The

Lady.</p><p><a name="stpa_o163"><a name="61128-0011.htm_para21"><a name="06112895000118">In a nutshell,
the Bill ensures that the FSA will be able to prevent recognised
investment exchanges and clearing houses from adopting regulatory
changes that it regards as disproportionate to the regulatory
objectives proposed. The underlying concern is that otherwise the
internationally competitive position of the UK-based financial services
industry in globally competitive markets may be damaged. The protection
of the competitive position of London investment exchanges that may in
future be acquired by overseas shareholders is the main purpose of the
Bill.</p><p><a name="stpa_o164"><a name="61128-0011.htm_para22"><a name="06112895000119">Naturally,
that brings into the equation two other issues to which several Members
have referred. The first is the principle of overseas control. In fact,
the City of London is already internationally owned, staffed and
managed&#151;a process that accelerated rapidly after the 1986 big
bang. Legitimate concerns have been expressed on both sides of the
House about how sustainable that would be in a massive economic
downturn.</p><p><a name="stpa_o165"><a name="61128-0011.htm_para23"><a name="06112895000120">Clearly,
there was a recession in the early 1990s, which hit the City of London
as it hit many other parts of the British service industry. There was
also grave concern that by not joining the euro at the beginning of
this century, Britain could find its competitive advantage in London
undermined. That has not come to pass. Equally, however, we should not
be complacent about the longer term, while we should rejoice about the
fact that the City remains very strong in spite of the
fact&#151;perhaps even because of it&#151;that overseas ownership
allows flair and innovation from all corners of the globe to play an
important part in the London market.</p><p><a name="stpa_o166"><a name="61128-0011.htm_para24"><a name="06112895000121">Secondly, the issue of the
limits of protection in the Bill has also been drawn to my attention.
My reading&#151;perhaps it also takes us back to the thoughts of the
hon. Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable)&#151;is that in the event of
NASDAQ&#146;s bid for the stock exchange proving successful, we
cannot provide protection against actions potentially in the US or in
British courts by aggrieved US investors in LSE-quoted securities or,
indeed, by high-profile district attorneys wishing to make a name for
themselves. We have had a broad-ranging debate about the effect of
Sarbanes-Oxley and it is now clear that, given the concerns evident in
the US market, there has been a rowing back from it.</p><br>

opportunity provided by the Bill to make the case once again for the
pursuance of a minimum regulatory regime, especially in view of foreign
membership as a fact of City life. We need to remember that innovation,
flair and light-touch regulation have been the watchwords for many of
the great successes in the overseas and outward-looking global
financial markets in which London has played an important part over
recent centuries. We should ensure that the UK authorities are able to
regulate to the lightest possible degree and avoid the micro-management
of the financial markets, to which other hon. Members have referred,
irrespective of their ownership of the exchange in question.</p><p><a name="stpa_o168"><a name="61128-0011.htm_para26"><a name="06112895000123">I believe
that that is the intention of this small but important piece of
legislation. I welcome it as a positive step forward, which has
certainly been welcomed by the City of London corporation in my
constituency. It is wise to look carefully into all aspects of
regulation and the way in which the FSA operates. We cannot be
complacent. I detected from the Minister&#146;s earlier comments that
with the additional powers given to the FSA in 1997, we had somehow
been able to ward off all the problems that had arisen from Enron,
WorldCom or the litany of previous scandals in this country that were
outlined earlier by the hon. Member for Bristol, East. We should always
remember that there will be crooks in any market and we should not be
overly complacent that, in putting a new regulatory framework into
place, we have somehow made ourselves immune from any such nefarious
behaviour.</p><p><a name="stpa_o169"><a name="61128-0011.htm_para27"><a name="06112895000124">I welcome

<notus-date day="28" month="11" year="2006" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><b>28 Nov 2006 : Column 1022</b><br>Members. We heard what can fairly be described as two hymns to the City
as a powerhouse of capitalism from the hon. Members for Bishop Auckland
(Helen Goodman) and for Bristol, East (Kerry McCarthy). Conservative
Members enjoyed listening to both. This week, we have heard some
Conservative spokesmen defending the work of Polly Toynbee and now two
Labour Members defending the power of capitalism. It would
understandable if onlookers were somewhat confused, but I shall explain
in a few moments why such views might be held and why the Bill is
necessary. We also heard an expert speech from the hon. Member for
Edmonton (Mr. Love), who made some interesting points about
the present climate in the US, particularly with regard to litigation
culture, and the effect of immigration restrictions on financial
markets.</p><p><a name="stpa_o172"><a name="61128-0011.htm_para30"><a name="061128103000009">My hon.
Friend the Member for South-West Hertfordshire (Mr. Gauke)
took us, as those who served in Committee on the Finance Bill might
have expected, into legal territory, weighing up the balance between
necessary regulation and consumer protection on the one hand and a
light touch on the other. I do not know whether he has had the
opportunity to talk to someone whose name, for some reason, escapes me,
but who figured a great deal in proceedings on the Finance
Bill.</p><p><a name="stpa_o173"><a name="61128-0011.htm_para31"><a name="061128103000010">My hon. Friend
the Member for Cities of London and Westminster (Mr. Field),
who knows a great deal about these matters&#151;they are, so to
speak, on his doorstep&#151;made an expert speech. He rightly said
that we must preserve the innovation, flair and light-touch regulation
that is the hallmark of the City.</p><p><a name="stpa_o174"><a name="61128-0011.htm_para32"><a name="061128103000011">The House may be concerned
that proposals that command cross-Bench support do not always
necessarily stand the test of time. I received a note saying just that
before the hon. Member for Twickenham raised the interesting point that
Sarbanes-Oxley went through the US legislature almost unopposed. Given
the criticisms of aspects of Sarbanes-Oxley that we have heard in the
debate, it is right for us to pause for a moment and consider whether,
because the Bill commands all-party support, it should necessarily
glide through. I thus want to reiterate by coming straight to the main
point why we believe that the Bill is workable and durable.</p><p><a name="stpa_o175"><a name="61128-0011.htm_para33"><a name="061128103000012">The Bill is effectively built
on the paradox that the preservation of the present light-touch
regulation of financial services can be guaranteed only by extending
the powers of the regulator. That paradox is, like most paradoxes,
quite hard to accept at first, so it is necessary to show why it holds
good. The London stock exchange may be acquired by a US exchange, as
others may in due course. Once again, like the Government, we have no
objection to that whatever. The Bill has nothing to do with keeping the
stock exchange in British hands, in the sense of flying the Union flag
above the LSE, just as it has nothing to do with any particular
takeover possibility and it does not seek to prevent the LSE from being
bought by any foreign company or group.</p>

<notus-date day="28" month="11" year="2006" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><b>28 Nov 2006 : Column 1023</b><br>opening remarks. There is widespread concern that the acquisition of the
LSE could lead to changes in its rule book that would damage the
competitiveness of UK capital markets.</p><p><a name="stpa_o177"><a name="61128-0012.htm_para1"><a name="061128103000014">The source
of such concern is the Sarbanes-Oxley legislation, which was introduced
in the aftermath of Enron and WorldCom, and the general tendency of the
regulation of financial services to creep across national boundaries,
which my hon. Friend the Member for Fareham (Mr. Hoban)
described in some detail. He referred specifically to the present
double regulatory requirements not only on hedge funds, but on UK
auditors.</p><p><a name="stpa_o178"><a name="61128-0012.htm_para2"><a name="061128103000015">In
short, given the global nature of modern capital markets, businesses
that want to raise money can effectively choose where to do so, and the
effect of the Sarbanes-Oxley legislation has been to make US markets
less attractive and UK markets more attractive. Consequently, US
exchanges are looking abroad to strengthen their businesses. The risk
is that the takeover of the LSE by a US exchange would enable the SEC
to act extra-territorially and allow creeping regulation. The Bill thus
necessarily alters the present arrangement whereby the LSE and all UK
recognised investment exchanges and clearing houses have the freedom to
set their own rules, subject to meeting certain
criteria.</p><p><a name="stpa_o179"><a name="61128-0012.htm_para3"><a name="061128103000016">The
FSA will therefore have a vital responsibility in drawing up the rules
that flow from the Bill, and an interesting aspect of the debate was
the degree to which it has concentrated attention on the FSA&#146;s
responsibility to get them right, to ensure that the additional
compliance burdens on exchanges are minimised to preserve precisely the
competitive position of the UK markets to which I referred a moment
ago.</p><p><a name="stpa_o180"><a name="61128-0012.htm_para4"><a name="061128103000017">In
closing, I want to stand back from the Bill for a moment to consider a
general law of life and politics to which it points: our old friend the
law of unintended consequences. I doubt whether the movers of the
Sarbanes-Oxley legislation intended to improve the relative position of
UK and European capital markets. That seems to be a classic
illustration of the law of unintended consequences, and it helps to
explain why my hon. Friend the Member for Fareham warned the House
that, while one piece of legislation can strengthen our competitive
position, another can weaken
it.</p><p><a name="stpa_o181"><a name="61128-0012.htm_para5"><a name="061128103000018">Of course the
Bill will not protect the competitive position of our capital markets
from all aspects of creeping extra-territoriality. It will not protect
those markets from new laws proposed in Brussels&#151;that, of
course, is not its function and those are matters for another
day&#151;but it will protect our capital markets from a danger, and
that is why we believe that it deserves all-party
support.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="ordayhd_10"><a name="61128-0012.htm_ordayhd0"><a name="061128103000108">6.42

create a system in which the FSA, which is widely respected here and
abroad as one of the world&#146;s leading financial regulators, can
veto disproportionate regulatory changes proposed by exchanges or
clearing houses for the markets that they provide and support, while
putting in place mechanisms to enable the FSA to ensure that that will

its supervisory decisions independently, within the framework of the

hon. Friend the Member for Edmonton says that that is if my hon. Friend
the Member for Wolverhampton, South-West got to the explanatory notes.
In my experience, my hon. Friend goes first to the explanatory notes. I
have never been involved in a debate on a piece of legislation in which
he has not scrutinised the explanatory notes in extreme detail. He is
correct to say that the FSA will be able to set the period for
representations. The reason why is that it is important that there is
sufficient time for careful scrutiny in what we regard as the likely
rare event that the FSA decides to call in a regulatory provision.
However, as was set out in the letter from the chief executive of the
FSA, the FSA will use that power in a way that is consistent with its
principles-based approach to regulation. I should also explain to the

Gentleman&#146;s second question was: why is existing legislation not
sufficient? I assume that he had in mind EC regulations and the
Protection of Trading Interests Act 1980. The existing legislation
could be used only if an overseas authority sought to impose its
national requirements directly on a UK exchange or clearing house in
respect of its UK activities. In contrast, if an overseas owner were
subjected to pressure under its home state law or regulations to secure
that a UK investment exchange or clearing house was operated in
practice in accordance with that state&#146;s law, the existing
European regulation and the Protection of Trading Interests Act could
not prevent lawful instructions being given by the foreign owners. The

Hoban:</b> Let me be quite clear at the start that this group
of amendments, and subsequent amendments, are probing. They arise from
conversations that I have had over recent weeks with people in the
financial services sector who seek to use the opportunity of the
Committee stage to understand some of the thinking behind the Bill and
why it has been structured as it has. I think that we would all
acknowledge&#151;the tone of the debate on Second Reading indicates
this&#151;that the current system of regulation for investment
exchanges works well, and that the rules that it has come up with seem
to be proportionate and lead to efficient markets. In fact, we can see
the attractiveness of those rules being expressed in the amount of new
money that has been raised on the London stock exchange.</p><p><a name="stpa_o207"><a name="61128-0012.htm_para31"><a name="061128103000054">It is in the
context of existing markets that are seen to be well regulated and
which work effectively that we are considering the Bill today. The Bill
is before us because of the threat in relation to the change of control
of one of those investment exchanges. If the independent status of the
LSE had not been threatened, I suspect that the Bill would not have
come before us, or at least would not have been rushed through all its
stages in this House in a day. Clearly, the prospect of such a change
of control has triggered a thought process not only in the mind of the
Government, but in the minds of Her Majesty&#146;s Opposition and of
stakeholders in the financial services
sector.</p>

retain its independence, there would be no reason to believe that it
would wish to bring forward excessive regulation that would put at risk
the competitiveness of UK capital markets. As far as I am aware, it has
not tried to introduce such rules, so if it remains independent, there
is no reason to think that it will do so in the future. However, under
the Bill, even if the LSE retains its independence and there is no
change of ownership, it and other recognised investment exchanges will
be subject to regulation as has not hitherto been the case. On Second
Reading my hon. Friend the Member for Wycombe (Mr. Goodman)
highlighted the paradox that we are extending to exchanges regulations
that do not exist at
present.</p><p><a name="stpa_o209"><a name="61128-0013.htm_para1"><a name="061128103000056">The
purpose behind the amendments is to probe why the Government have
chosen to introduce a blanket change in regulation, rather than
awaiting a change of control before bringing regulations into effect.
As the Economic Secretary said on Second Reading, the provisions will
effectively come into force on the day after Royal Assent, so any
changes that take place from that day forward will be subject to the
process under the Bill. If the impact of the Bill were restricted to
circumstances in which a change of control had taken place, it would
mean that exchanges that had not been subject to a change of control
would continue to benefit from existing regulatory mechanisms and would
not have to incur additional costs through the call-in process, nor
would the FSA have to go through the process of reviewing the rules.
Amendments Nos. 1 to 6 give us the opportunity to ask the Economic
Secretary why the Government are saying that all future changes to
regulations by recognised investment exchanges and clearing houses
should be subject to such a process, and why the process is not
restricted to circumstances in which there has been a change of
control.</p><p><a name="st_o240"><a name="061128103000057"><b><a name="61128-0013.htm_spnew0"><a name="061128103000124">Ed
Balls:</b> Let me take the amendments in two groups.
Amendments Nos. 1, 3, 5 and 6 would introduce a trigger mechanism so
that the powers of the FSA to veto excessive regulatory provisions
would arise only when the trigger had been operated&#151;the trigger
being a change of governance or control of an investment exchange or
clearing house. Amendments Nos. 2 and 4 would insert the word
&#147;material&#148; before the phrase &#147;regulatory
provision&#148;.</p><p><a name="stpa_o210"><a name="61128-0013.htm_para2"><a name="061128103000058">It

out from the amendments whether the trigger would be brought about by a
change in control, or a change in control when it was also the case
that the person with control over the recognised body acted
unacceptably. The rule provision could not be triggered by both a
change in governance and someone behaving unacceptably. The latter
point is the important one. The trigger is not a change in governance,
but whether people behave unacceptably, as defined in the Bill. We are
setting up an important test. Rule changes judged by the FSA to be
disproportionate and excessive,

hon. Member for Fareham (Mr. Hoban) is absolutely right to
point out that if there were no change of ownership at the LSE or any
other exchange, the new powers would still come into operation.
However, if any UK or foreign-owned exchange were to act outside
&#147;corporate governance standards&#148;, as amendment No. 6
says, or, more generally, disproportionately and excessively, it would
be right for the FSA to trigger the power. It would be unacceptable if
we could trigger the power if there was a new owner of an exchange, but
could not do so if an existing owner of a UK or foreign exchange that
had not been subject to a change of governance acted unacceptably. We
are trying to apply the trigger power in a way that is consistent
across the
piece.</p><p><a name="stpa_o213"><a name="61128-0013.htm_para5"><a name="061128103000061">We
feared that if the mechanism was triggered by a change of governance,
the measure would be not only unworkable but discriminatory and unfair.
Such a measure would protect existing managements by allowing them to
do what they liked, while imposing new requirements only on exchanges
with changed ownership. That would create a deterrent to takeovers. It
would unnecessarily discriminate against both foreign and domestic
future owners, because they would have a greater regulatory burden than
existing foreign or domestic owners.</p><p><a name="stpa_o214"><a name="61128-0013.htm_para6"><a name="061128103000062">We also feared that
discriminating between two types of owners carrying out essentially the
same action would be incompatible with our obligations under EC
treaties and the World Trade Organisation&#146;s general agreement on
trade in services. In addition, the right hon. Member for Wokingham
(Mr. Redwood) has pointed out that irrespective of whether
owners are new or existing, or foreign or from the UK, if they act in a
way that is excessive, disproportionate and outwith the wider
objectives set out in the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 and
the FSA&#146;s rules and guidance, it is right that we should take
action to veto. The Bill will enable us to do that, but the amendments
would undermine the
process.</p><p><a name="stpa_o215"><a name="61128-0013.htm_para7"><a name="061128103000063">We have
discussed amendments Nos. 1 to 6 in detail with the exchanges, and I

understand the intention behind Amendments Nos. 2 and 4 and the desire
to strengthen barriers to the FSA acting disproportionately by
inserting the word &#147;material&#148; to the Bill. However, we
have concluded that the amendments would not give any extra protection
to exchanges. They would not make unnecessary notifications less
likely. Exchanges and clearing houses want legal certainty, but adding
the word &#147;material&#148; would not give them any extra
certainty, because there would be exactly the same room for doubt and
argument. The only effect of the amendments would be that exchanges and
clearing houses would have to take further legal advice on the meaning
of &#147;material&#148; in such
cases.</p><p><a name="stpa_o216"><a name="61128-0013.htm_para8"><a name="061128103000064">The conclusion

in his scepticism about amendment No. 1, which, as I understand it,
simply seeks to bring the clause into effect when there is a change of
governance. He is right that there should be consistent application of
the rules in all circumstances. The hon. Member for Wycombe
(Mr. Goodman), speaking for the Conservatives, got it right
when he said that the issue was not economic nationalism but the
national interest, which includes jobs.</p><p><a name="stpa_o218"><a name="61128-0013.htm_para10"><a name="061128103000067">Brief
reference was made to Scotland, where 127,000 people are employed in
banking, finance and insurance. Five of Scotland&#146;s top 10
businesses are in that sector. Back home, it is one of the industries

a global company with a genuine international reach. As has been said,
it is not only the City of London, but the Financial Services
Authority&#146;s light-touch regulatory approach to the sector, that
has been the success. We support the clause, and we support taking a
consistent approach, whether or not there is a change of governance. I
shall keep my contribution short, but I should just say that I agree
with the description given earlier: the paradox is that by giving more
power to the FSA, we ensure that a light touch remains. The global
reach of world-class companies, and 127,000 jobs in Scotland, can be
protected and enhanced by the

Nos. 2 and 4, the Minister is absolutely right, and the letter from
John Tiner, to which we referred earlier, should reassure investment
exchanges and clearing houses about the way in which the FSA will seek
to use the powers. Of course, the consultation process that will take
place over the next few months to determine the detail of the rules for
call-in will reinforce the message set out in that letter. That should
give exchanges and clearing houses further reassurance about the way in

the amendments about change of control. Perhaps there is a second
paradox on display: it took a potential change of control in an
investment exchange to flag up the issue of the freedom that exchanges
and clearing houses enjoy in determining their own rule books. Although
historically that has been seen as a strength, clearly, in future,
challenges could emerge that would change that strength into a problem.

precise wording of proposed new subsection (4)(b), financial markets
are global and activity is mobile, but that does not necessarily lead
to the conclusion that regulators should veto rules that would have an
impact on the competitiveness of UK capital markets. Indeed, some might
say that because of the mobility of activity there should be a single
set of global rules, not different sets of rules for different
jurisdictions. That is not my view, but the wording of subsection
(4)(b) is not sufficiently clear to inform readers about the precise
purpose of the Bill and what it seeks to protect. The wording is rather
bland and neutral, and my amendment would make it slightly crisper and
more focused, to get the point across.</p><p><a name="stpa_o223"><a name="61128-0013.htm_para15"><a name="061128103000074">That echoes

objectives of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000, in which
competitiveness is not one of the regulatory objectives. It is
relegated to as a factor to which the FSA should &#147;have
regard&#148;. By anchoring the Bill in the context of much clearer
and sharper wording, we will lose any ambiguity about what the Bill
seeks to achieve, and we will perhaps give practitioners and regulators
a much clearer sense of

regulatory provision is whether such provision extends beyond UK or
European Community law, and whether it fails to pursue a reasonable
regulatory objective or is disproportionate to such an objective. That
test cannot be levelled up just because a foreign jurisdiction applies
an excessive standard that it characterises as global. It is not for
the foreign regulator to make the judgment, and we will not level the

burden that it would impose is disproportionate to the end that it is

Services and Markets Act 2000, and therefore in UK law, the FSA is
required to have regard to four statutory objectives, which are market
confidence, public awareness, protection of consumers and reduction of
financial crime, so protection of consumers is one of the regulatory
objectives to which the FSA must have regard at all times. However,
that is one of four objectives, so the FSA must always balance consumer
protection against, for example, market confidence. When we speak of a
proportionate and risk-based approach to regulation, that allows the
FSA to take a lighter touch approach to regulation in those areas where
it believes market confidence can be maintained with a greater degree
of risk. Hence, the AIM market is a more risk-loving, less regulated
market, but the individual retail consumer going in needs to know that
there is less market
protection.</p><p><a name="stpa_o251"><a name="61128-0014.htm_para12"><a name="061128104000020">The FSA

the context of its four statutory objectives. Those four tests
therefore inform the FSA in striking the balance between its statutory
duties to protect consumers and to maintain market confidence, although
it would not have to strike such a balance with regard to that
particular example. In our judgment, so long as it has regard to those
four points and is conscious of its need to strike a balance between
market confidence and the protection of consumers, we think that it
will be proof against judicial review in making such
judgments.</p><br>

the four points in proposed new section 300A, which is helpful.
However, they are merely the first part of the test, which triggers the
right of the FSA to make a direction. My point concerns a direction
made under proposed new subsection (2), which cannot relate to proposed
new subsection (4). The question whether such a direction would be
subject to judicial review returns us to the regulatory objectives.
Whether the direction is reasonable or compliant with regulatory
objectives relates to section 2 of the Financial Services and Markets
Act 2000 and the four regulatory objectives mentioned by the Economic
Secretary. At that stage, proposed new subsection (4) would not be
relevant. Stage 1 concerns whether the excessive test has been
breached, and stage 2 is when a direction is made. Would such a
direction be
reasonable?</p><p><a name="st_o256"><a name="061128104000023"><b><a name="61128-0014.htm_spnew5"><a name="061128104000048">Ed

so long as the FSA makes its decision in line with the tests in

undermine, rather than to enhance, consumer protection. As I have said
to my hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, South-West, a light

Mr. Hank Paulson, who shared a platform two weeks ago with
the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, Mr.
Christopher Cox. I think that they both share my analysis of the
current dangers of the Sarbanes-Oxley regime, which is that the way in
which it has been implemented is both burdensome and insufficiently
risk-based and that therefore it does not achieve the initial
intention. That is why the FSA, with US Treasury support, is currently
consulting on how the implementation of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the
wider corporate governance regime could be enhanced, reformed and in
some way lightened in order that it can become more risk-based in the
future. I am happy to rely on the expertise of the US authorities

come across a flaw in the current regime, or at least that we have had
the benefit of realising the need to act, because a change of ownership
might allow us to take a power to block excessive or disproportionate
rule changes without any change of ownership. However, at no point has
the FSA put it to me that it has concerns about the current rule books
of the current exchanges or changes to those rule books. In the initial
discussions in May and June, no one suggested jumping in to impose a
new burden on existing exchanges. As I understand it, that fear did not
exist within the FSA. We have looked in detail at how to address that
concern, and the only fair way to do so that is legitimate and that
applies across the piece would be to cover all exchanges, which is the
approach that we are
taking.</p><p><a name="st_o261"><a name="061128104000030"><b><a name="61128-0014.htm_spnew10"><a name="061128104000053">Mr.

demonstrated their effectiveness. Looking at the topic in the context
of the potential change of ownership of the London stock exchange has
done us a service in pointing out an opportunity to fine tune the
regulatory environment for exchanges and clearing houses, and perhaps
we should be grateful for that.</p><br>

amendment concerns consultation, how the FSA will seek to use its new
powers, and whom it will look to when thinking about the consequences
of any rule change. People in City institutions have told me that the
Bill should ensure that the FSA takes account of the concerns of all
market users. There is a sense that historically when changes have been
proposed to the rules of exchanges, consultation was predominantly with
the sell side&#151;that is, market participants such as major
investment banks, who raise capital on behalf of their clients, acting
as sponsors of new issues of shares. It is clearly in their interests
for the market to be efficient.</p><p><a name="stpa_o258"><a name="61128-0014.htm_para19"><a name="061128118000011">However, no market is
one-sided. Investment banks need fund managers and other investors to
buy shares; they too have an interest in the operation of markets and
their views should be considered as well. For example, an exchange
might propose a rule change that would make the raising of capital
easier but lessen the protection afforded to investors. Unless the
consultation process included the buy side as well as the sell side,
there would be a risk that the voice of the buy side would go unheeded,
leading to loss of confidence in the market and an absence of buyers.
That goes back to the point raised by the hon. Member for
Wolverhampton, South-West (Rob Marris) in the previous debate. This is
not about low regulation but about getting the regulatory balance right
between the buy side and the sell side and ensuring that the regulation
not only makes it easy to raise capital but gives investors confidence
in the market. One way to do that would be to ensure that when rule
changes are consulted upon, all participants in the market are
consulted, not only the sell
side.</p><p><a name="st_o264"><a name="061128118000012"><b><a name="61128-0014.htm_spnew13"><a name="061128118000195">Stewart

instead of widening the process as much as
possible?</p><br>

important to ensure that everybody is properly consulted, and that is
what we have done with the Bill. I know from my experience of going
through the process involved in the markets in financial instruments
directive that it is important to listen to the buy side and the sell
side. The fact that the London Investment Banking Association, to give
one example of a trade organisation with buy and sell side
representatives, has endorsed the Bill suggests that both sides are
happy with our general intention. There have tended at times to be
differences of view between the exchanges and some of the wider City
participants as to whether the role of the FSA should be stronger or
weaker in this regard.</p><p><a name="stpa_o259"><a name="61128-0014.htm_para20"><a name="061128118000014">It is important to consult
widely in a way that makes it clear that all sides are being listened

not for me to set out in detail how it will go about planning those

particular aspect of the consultation process concerning which persons
are affected. That is just one of a wide range of issues that it will
need to consider as part of its consultative process. Today&#146;s
letter by John Tiner gives full assurance to the exchanges and to the
City more widely that the consultation process will be substantial. The

The Bill carves out from its scope overseas investment exchanges. The
following scenario has been suggested to me; I do not know whether it
is feasible. A UK exchange could be acquired by a company based outside
the EU, and the acquirer could then decide that it wanted to close down
the UK exchange and encourage members to transfer their listing to an
overseas exchange. As a consequence, the provisions in the Bill would
no longer apply and the additional regulatory burdens of, say,
Sarbanes-Oxley&#151;it could be any other regulation&#151;would
affect companies that hitherto had been listed under the UK investment
exchange. I am looking for reassurance that an acquirer of a UK
exchange cannot compel companies listed on it to move to a US or other

involved in business that deals with nothing more than placing a
trading scheme. They are regulated in the countries where they are
based, but because of the obligation on recognition requirements, they
have to provide their users with broadly equivalent protection to that
provided by UK recognised bodies. The FSA therefore does not have to
judge the regulatory provisions of those overseas recognised bodies. It
would not be consistent with our EU obligations to do
so.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="ordayhd_14"><a name="61128-0015.htm_ordayhd0"><a name="061128118000184">8

appreciate that different proposals will have different gravity, and
that the FSA might need longer for some than others, but proposed new
section 300D(3) already contains the provision to extend what I call

period, with an unspecified number of days, and the ability to extend
that period, again by an unspecified number of days. Yet in line 39 on
page 2 of the Bill, proposed new section 300C(2)(a) defines the initial
period as one of 30 days. So the Government are clearly not averse to
putting a numerical or diurnal value on that period, but that is not
the case for this middle bit, the representation period.</p><p><a name="stpa_o272"><a name="61128-0015.htm_para9"><a name="061128118000036">I would like reassurance from
the Minister either that a specified period will be put into the Bill
or that clear guidance will be given to the FSA on this matter.
Otherwise, the FSA could decide to take six months, and a change in
rules that a regulatory body deemed necessary&#151;it would not go
through all this rigmarole if it did not deem it necessary&#151;could
get held up for rather a long time. The FSA might say, &#147;We do
not have the resources to deal with this&#148;, or &#147;We do not
think it is that important, so we will set a long representation
period.&#148; Conversely, if the regulatory body wished to make an
extremely important change as a matter of urgency, the FSA might say,
&#147;This is a very important change, so we must have a long
representation period in the middle, because we need to consult so many

another look at that missing link in the middle, the representation
period, and I hope that amendments can be tabled in another place to
specify the number of days. Alternatively, I would like reassurance
that strong guidance will be issued to the FSA on that
point.</p><br>

period, which will apply from the notification by an authority that it
is making a rule change, which will allow the FSA to consider that rule
change. If the FSA made no judgment during the 30 days, the rule change
would go through by default. However, proposed new section 300D(2)(c)
deals with what we believe will be the unusual circumstances in which
the FSA calls in a regulation and considers disallowing it. We expect
such cases to be the exception rather than the norm. We mentioned
earlier, in reference to the Sarbanes Oxley case, the importance of not
repeating the same mistakes by rushing in too fast. My guess is that
the markets and the exchanges might consider it an advantage that the
FSA has the discretion to choose the period over which it consults, so
that it does not make a wrong decision.</p><p><a name="stpa_o274"><a name="61128-0015.htm_para11"><a name="061128118000039">If we feared that the FSA was
likely to take a disproportionate, heavy-handed or costly approach to
the implementation of this power, we might have reasons to be
concerned. But, as John Tiner&#146;s letter makes clear, the FSA will
use the power only if it is justified as being proportionate, if the
benefits exceed the costs, and only after consultation. The letter also
says:</p><a name="61128-0015.htm_brev3"><a name="061128118000175"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;As you

not believe that there is a need for the House to fetter the discretion
of the FSA in this matter by arbitrarily curtailing the length of
consultation that it might want to take, given that there might be
circumstances in which it would want to take more time. We know that it
would be motivated by a desire to be proportionate and to ensure that
no unnecessary costs would be incurred.</p><p><a name="st_o276"><a name="061128118000041"><b><a name="61128-0015.htm_spnew6"><a name="061128118000207">Rob
Marris:</b> My hon. Friend talks about fettering the
FSA&#146;s discretion, and I understand that point. However, its
discretion is fettered in the initial period, because the Bill
specifies a period of 30 days on two, if not three,
occasions.</p><p><a name="st_o277"><a name="061128118000042"><b><a name="61128-0015.htm_spnew7"><a name="061128118000208">Ed

become much clearer when the FSA consults on the rules that will apply
in this area, the provision for which is made in the Bill. We want to
make it clear to the exchanges that, in the majority of cases relating
to rule changes, even if a rule requires consultation under the
FSA&#146;s rules, that consultation will normally happen in a speedy
manner. There might, however, be exceptional circumstances in which the
FSA calls in a rule and wants to ensure that its judgment is right. In
those circumstances, it is not necessary to fetter its discretion.
There is a principled reason for specifying 30 days in one part of the
Bill but not to fetter its discretion on such a rare
occasion.</p><p><a name="stpa_o276"><a name="61128-0015.htm_para13"><a name="061128118000043">My advice

further clarification on clause 5(2), which relates to the coming into

come into force on the day after Royal Assent. As I said on Second
Reading, that means that the new obligations will apply to regulatory
provision proposed but not made before commencement, as well as to new
regulatory provisions proposed after commencement. By providing for
commencement and the powers coming into force in that way, we prevent
any problems about a rule change proposed in the gap between Royal
Assent and commencement. More generally, a waiver power is provided for
12 months. Through a discretionary act, the FSA can waive, where it
judges appropriate, the right to call in certain kinds of rule changes
while it goes through the more onerous statutory consultation processes
necessary to draw up its rule-making power under the Financial Services
and Markets Act 2000. That allows us to move speedily and to have a
proper consultative process for the rule book. I hope that I have made
the position clear.</p><p><a name="stpa_o281"><a name="61128-0015.htm_para18"><a name="061128118000050"><i> Question put and agreed

is to preserve the global and open approach to ownership in the City of
London, which has been the hallmark of the City not just for the past
10 years but since the big bang and before. We have all agreed that the
right position for Britain, from the point of view of investment, jobs
and the long-term future of the City, is to welcome foreign ownership
and investment from around the world, including into our exchanges, and
not to try to establish protectionist barriers.</p><p><a name="stpa_o287"><a name="61128-0015.htm_para24"><a name="061128118000057">Secondly, the principle has
been established that it is right and legitimate for Government to
intervene to protect our principles-based and proportionate regulatory
regime. We are intervening not to regulate but to ensure that we
prevent excessive regulation being imported into the UK, and not to

City can continue to prosper in future.</p><p><a name="st_o281"><a name="061128118000058"><b><a name="61128-0015.htm_spnew11"><a name="061128118000212">Mr.
Gauke:</b> On Second Reading, I raised the issue of democratic
accountability, which, as far as I have heard, has not been picked up.
An important and sensitive decision would be made by the FSA without
any accountability to the House or, indirectly, to a Minister, who
would be accountable to the House. Will the Economic Secretary give his
views on that point?</p><p><a name="st_o282"><a name="061128118000059"><b><a name="61128-0015.htm_spnew12"><a name="061128118000213">Ed
Balls:</b> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for that
intervention. This Bill amends the Financial Services and Markets Act
2000. It enshrines a principle-based and risk-based approach to
regulation. It gives the FSA considerable discretion and independence,
within an overall framework set in legislation and agreed by the House,
for which Ministers of the Treasury are responsible to the House. All
the protections and safeguards put into the Financial Services and
Markets Bill, when it was debated extensively in Committee and in the
House some years ago, apply equally to this set of what are essentially
additions to the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000. To the extent
that there was a concern, that would be about the wider financial
services and markets approach. The principles-based approach pursued by
the FSA has been not only successful but judged to be open and
transparent. In terms of proper scrutiny of its decisions, we got the
balance right in the original Financial Services and Markets
Bill.</p><p><a name="stpa_o288"><a name="61128-0015.htm_para25"><a name="061128118000060">One view of
the City of London&#146;s success is, I believe, rather pessimistic.
According to that pessimistic view, London is succeeding because of
others&#146; failures, and because some of our European partners have
taken too restrictive an approach to financial services in their
markets. Similarly, it is argued that London&#146;s recent success is
not because of our strengths but because of errors made in the US in
particular in relation to corporate governance standards and
Sarbanes-Oxley. That pessimistic view moves on to the conclusion that,
if the European single market gets completed because we win the
argument for reform in Europe, London&#146;s standing will somehow be
undermined, or that if the US acts to reform the Sarbanes-Oxley or
wider regime, that will take away our competitive edge.</p><br>

view is far too pessimistic. The City of London&#146;s reputation has
been built not over two decades but over 300 years. The tradition and
integrity of our markets, and of our accountancy and legal professions,
underpin the City of London. We have established a reputation for
talent and expertise as well as a depth to our markets that is
respected all around the world&#151;again, a reputation that has been
built over decades. The reforms of the big bang, which led to the
explosion of foreign firms and new talent coming to London, were
introduced well before any changes in the US corporate governance
regime. In my judgment, we should be confident about London&#146;s
success&#151;our skills, the cluster of London markets, our integrity
and our reputation. We should see reform in Europe as an opportunity
for us to expand into new markets in France, Germany and other European
countries. Similarly, if the United States does decide to reform the
Sarbanes-Oxley regime&#151;in terms of its implementation or more
generally&#151;we should see that as an opportunity. As we know, a
number of United Kingdom firms and auditors are currently burdened by
the regime to some extent, and it would be in the interests of not just
the United States but the global economy for some of the reforms to be
enacted.</p><p><a name="stpa_o290"><a name="61128-0015.htm_para27"><a name="061128118000062">We should

that a successful global New York market and a successful global London

new financial centres in Shanghai, Hong Kong and Dubai, and also in the
rest of Europe, gives London an opportunity to build new partnerships
and win new
business.</p><p><a name="stpa_o291"><a name="61128-0015.htm_para28"><a name="061128118000063">I am not

to protect our regulatory regime, but we must do so with the right kind
of risk-based, proportionate regulation and a continued focus on
investing in skills. We must bring the best talent from around the
world to London and to our other financial services in the United
Kingdom, and encourage others in Europe and the world to move in our
direction&#151;the direction of a more risk-based, proportionate
approach to regulation.</p><p><a name="stpa_o292"><a name="61128-0015.htm_para29"><a name="061128118000064">I do not believe that London

important to the future of the City. As the Economic Secretary pointed
out, it is not about tackling foreign ownership. Since the big bang the
City has thrived as a result of openness and our ability to allow what
were venerable British names to be bought by overseas companies. That
has enriched and strengthened the City. I am sure that when the
Economic Secretary meets those in City institutions he recognises, as I
do, the international diversity of both ownership and personnel. That
is one of the great assets of the financial services sector, and it is
what I think has made the sector so successful in a global economy. It
has also led to opportunities for the City in that global economy:

however, a legitimate reason for the Bill. There has been widespread
concern about the impact of United States regulation if a United States
exchange acquired the London stock exchange, and in recent months there
has been considerable debate on the subject in the City. That concern
is not based on prejudice or on some narrow interest; it reflects the
experience of people who work in the City every day, and who have a
creeping sense of extra-territoriality entering the regulatory regime.
It is a genuine concern that should be
addressed.</p><p><a name="stpa_o295"><a name="61128-0016.htm_para2"><a name="061128118000068">When
people first began to ask how we could protect the regulatory
environment from which the United Kingdom financial services sector
benefits, a host of mechanisms were proposed to ring-fence the regime,
including adjustments to the ownership structure post-acquisition in
the stock exchange. However, it was clear to most participants in the
market that none of those mechanisms would be particularly effective in
recognising and retaining the strength of the regulatory
regime that we have today. It was, I think, a recognition of
the failings of those alternative mechanisms that led to the Bill,
which provides a vital opportunity to safeguard the regime. It
sends the clear message that we are keen on foreign ownership of
UK-based businesses, but also keen to maintain the strength of the
regulatory
sector.</p><p><a name="stpa_o296"><a name="61128-0016.htm_para3"><a name="061128118000069">The
hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Rob Marris) asked whether we
were talking about low regulation. I do not think that we are, on
either side of the House. We are talking about the right level of
regulation&#151;proportionate regulation that responds to the level
of risk and is based on principles, not on detailed rules. That type of
regulatory regime has stood the UK in good stead in recent years,
benefiting both consumers and those who supply financial services
products.</p><p><a name="stpa_o297"><a name="61128-0016.htm_para4"><a name="061128118000070">I agreed
with the Economic Secretary&#146;s closing remarks. We should be
optimistic about the future of the financial services sector. I am
always impressed by the people whom I meet in that sector, who are full
of ideas about how to exploit markets, come up with new products and
take advantage of the changing world in which we live. However, in
recognising their skills, talents and innovations, we cannot
afford&#151;and the Economic Secretary cannot afford&#151;to
neglect the sector. We cannot say &#147;The job is done
tonight&#148;, because the job has not been done tonight. More work
must be done to maintain the competitiveness of the UK financial
services sector.</p><p><a name="stpa_o298"><a name="61128-0016.htm_para5"><a name="061128118000071">We
must think about skills, tax, infrastructure and regulation. We cannot
assume that one summit every 10 years is enough to tackle those issues.
We must continue to safeguard the future competitiveness of the sector,
and think hard about what it needs and how Government and politicians
can strengthen it. We must not neglect it, because unless we look after
it and are concerned about how it develops, it will not continue to
thrive on the basis of its talents alone. We must make a collective
effort to safeguard its future.</p><p><a name="stpa_o299"><a name="61128-0016.htm_para6"><a name="061128118000072">I believe that the Bill will
play an important role in safeguarding the sector&#146;s future, and
in taking the regulation of exchanges into a new dimension in a new
way. I hope that, as a result, more businesses will continue to come to
London to raise capital and use our capital markets here in the United
Kingdom.</p><br>

Financial Secretary rather kindly put it&#151;to add a bit of grit to
the debate while also educating myself in some of the issues, but what
others have said has taught me things about matters that were not
entirely clear to me at first. For example, the hon. Member for
South-West Hertfordshire (Mr. Gauke) explained how the
Sarbanes-Oxley legislation might be inadvertently introduced into
United Kingdom rules as a result of private litigation, and that helped
me to understand the process.</p><p><a name="stpa_o300"><a name="61128-0016.htm_para7"><a name="061128118000074">I think that one useful
contribution I made was to prompt, or provoke, the Economic Secretary
into a helpful intervention that cast new light on the whole subject.
Press comment on takeovers has been very controversial and the language
has often been protectionist, but the Economic Secretary told us on the
basis of his own conversations that the American exchanges were relaxed
about&#151;indeed, supportive of&#151;the Bill, which would not
inhibit a takeover bid from them on normal commercial principles. That
was a considerable
clarification.</p><p><a name="stpa_o301"><a name="61128-0016.htm_para8"><a name="061128118000075">The
Economic Secretary could, however, increase my satisfaction quotient
from 95 to 100 by dealing with one of my questions which has not yet
been answered. Although we debated at length the possibility that
American legislation would have a detrimental effect, intentionally or
otherwise, and how the Bill might deal with it, there remains the
problem of what might happen if a European, perhaps a German, exchange
acquired a British exchange and took action in relation to, for
instance, the LIFFE or the alternative investment market that proved
detrimental. Might not the companies involved argue that they were
protected by single-market legislation, and might the Bill therefore
not be effective in that

Government, but it remains a live issue, and some of the legislative
aspects have yet to be addressed. Having heard the debate and received

David Heathcoat-Amory (Wells) (Con):</b> Somerset is again a
target for local government reorganisation. The Liberal
Democrat-controlled Somerset county council voted to apply for unitary
status. That means that it wishes to abolish the five existing district
councils and consolidate all power, finance and services at county hall
in Taunton. That would create the biggest unitary authority in the
country, with a population of more than 500,000 people. I and my hon.
Friend the Member for Bridgwater (Mr.
Liddell-Grainger)&#151;who I am happy is present&#151;believe that
that would create a remote, unwieldy and undemocratic structure.
Furthermore, the costs of reorganisation would create another burden
for the long-suffering council tax payers of
Somerset.</p><p><a name="stpa_o310"><a name="61128-0016.htm_para17"><a name="061128118000088">Unfortunately,
it seems that the Government have been beckoning Somerset down that
path. Discussions at official level have been taking place for many
months between the relevant Department and officers of the county
council to prepare the way for that bid. Most elected councillors have
been excluded from those discussions. That is the opposite of open
government, and it is frequently a way that bad decisions or ideas take
root.</p><p><a name="stpa_o311"><a name="61128-0016.htm_para18"><a name="061128118000089">The trigger
for the bid was the publication in October of the Government White
Paper on the future of local government. It was rather a disappointing
document in many respects, but its aim was simplification. In the
foreword to the White Paper, the Prime Minister said that
it</p><a name="61128-0016.htm_brev4"><a name="061128118000180"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;commits the

Paper&#146;s proposals seem to me to be far from simple. There is
endless talk of community and partnership and so forth, as though the
simple repetition of those words somehow gives them meaning. There is
also a bewildering array of initiatives. Each area of the country is to
be encouraged to have a local strategic partnership&#151;an
LSP&#151;a local area agreement, a sustainable community strategy, a
local development framework and probably a multi-area agreement as
well, and on top of that a range of regional strategies. That is not
simplification; it is completely baffling to the public and shows what
happens when the official mind collides with the need for local
democracy.</p><p><a name="stpa_o313"><a name="61128-0016.htm_para20"><a name="061128118000091">From that
fog of strategies, partnerships and acronyms emerges a pattern of what
the Government are pursuing for local government. They are going for
big unitary authorities wherever possible, with huge regional
authorities above them. They are joined in support for that plan by the
Liberal Democrats, who of course like unitary authorities. That is why
Somerset Liberal Democrats have applied for it, and it has long been
Liberal Democrat policy to go for regional government. A rather
unhealthy Lib Dem-Labour coalition is developing to carve up the local
government map of England to suit such a structure. When the Minister
replies to the debate, I would like her to confirm that that is indeed
the strategic aim that is buried in the White Paper. That would be a
disaster for

talking shop that absorbs a great deal of time and effort but achieves
very little. The South West of England Development Agency has shown
complete insensitivity to the needs of local businesses in my
constituency. The Government should remember what happened to their
plan for an elected regional assembly for the north-east, which was
crushingly defeated by 78 per cent. in a referendum a few
years ago. These big units might look fine from Whitehall, but the
public do not like them. Whitehall loves these units because there are
fewer people to talk to, it can control them more easily and they look
good on a small map of England, but they are the death of local
democracy.</p><p><a name="stpa_o315"><a name="61128-0016.htm_para22"><a name="061128118000093">If we
want to promote the vitality of local government and to strengthen
local democracy, we should be doing the opposite&#151;devolving power
to smaller units. Very occasionally in the White Paper, the Government
seem to be saying the same thing. With their usual jargon, they talk
about &#147;empowering local communities&#148;. How can they
empower local communities when they are removing the tier of
local government&#151;district councils&#151;that is closest to
those local communities wanting to be empowered? It is understandable
that the Liberal Democrats want to destroy the district councils,
because they usually do not control them. In Somerset, they have only
one of the five councils. They do temporarily control Somerset county
council, which is why they want to concentrate power at county level,
but the county council has not earned the right to monopolise local
government in Somerset. In my area, I find that Mendip and Sedgemoor
district councils are more responsive to my constituency
cases.</p><p><a name="stpa_o316"><a name="61128-0016.htm_para23"><a name="061128118000094">Until quite
recently, the county council did not even know how many people it
employed. It took many years&#146; work by the opposition
Conservative group to find out how many people were on the payroll. The
number has been going up pretty steeply every year, which is another
problem, but the fact that the county council did not know how many
people it actually employed shows a degree of ineptitude.</p><p><a name="stpa_o317"><a name="61128-0016.htm_para24"><a name="061128118000095">There have also been a number
of fiascos, which we have lived with over the years. We remember the

was spent putting up a lot of unnecessary and ugly road signs, which
did very little for road safety and had to be taken down again at vast
cost. I could go on&#151;there have been many other problems over the
years. I am quite tolerant of local government making mistakes, but the
county council seems to be very slow in correcting them. Meanwhile, the
council tax has gone up every year way above the rate of inflation, and
the debt with it. There is a problem for the Government; if the unitary
bid succeeds, the county council will be exporting this financial
structure of high taxes and high debt to the rest of the county,
replacing many of the more prudent district councils.</p><p><a name="stpa_o318"><a name="61128-0016.htm_para25"><a name="061128118000096">Who is going to pay for this

the cost of preparing the bid itself, which is already diverting
officers&#146; and councillors&#146; time away from doing what they
are elected and paid to do&#151;to deliver good services to voters.
Instead, they are engaged in an expensive and time-consuming bid for
unitary status. I should be grateful if the Minister addressed the
question of what is going to happen when the costs escalate and the
council tax goes up even more, or other services get hit. Is that in
line with the ambitions of the White Paper? If not, the Government
should stop the bid dead in its tracks.</p><p><a name="stpa_o319"><a name="61128-0016.htm_para26"><a name="061128118000097">Of course, we have been here
before. Those of us with long memories remember the Banham commission
of the 1990s, which correctly recommended the abolition of Avon, but
when it moved on to the part of Somerset that I have been talking
about, it got into a most frightful muddle. It first recommended a
unitary county structure exactly the same as the one being bid for now.
On closer inspection, that was shown to be a mistake, so it changed its
mind and recommended a unitary structure based on three smaller units.
On yet closer inspection, that proved to be unworkable, as well, and
the whole thing was abandoned.</p><p><a name="stpa_o320"><a name="61128-0016.htm_para27"><a name="061128118000098">More recently&#151;the

tried a merger of the police forces in the south-west, which again
proved unworkable in practice. That, too, has been abandoned. A great
many politicians and officials have worked very hard to try to
reorganise the south-west, and Somerset in particular, as regards
government and the delivery of services, but it just does not work. So
I say to the Government: stop this bid now. It is unwelcome,
unnecessary and undemocratic. The districts&#151;certainly the ones
under Conservative control&#151;are willing to work more closely with
each other and the county council to improve services. There is nothing
static about local government and it can always be improved, but the
solution is not complete revolution in the familiar structure that is
recognised and appreciated by most local
people.</p><p><a name="stpa_o321"><a name="61128-0016.htm_para28"><a name="061128118000099">I would be

partisan view of the circumstances that obtain in the area. The

local government reorganisation. A further and very important factor,
in the context of Somerset, is that people do not want to be told that
they no longer live in their county. The great mistake that the then
Conservative Government made in abolishing part of Somerset and
creating the hybrid county of Avon&#151;I remember it well&#151;was
to tell people not that their dustbins would in future be collected by
a different local authority, but that they no longer lived in the
county in which they had grown up and which was part of their cultural

mistake.</p><p><a name="stpa_o327"><a name="61128-0016.htm_para34"><a name="061128118000106">I shall end

criticisms of the process in which the Government are engaged. First,
the reform is being introduced with reckless speed given that, if it

do not buy the argument that the consultation is with stakeholders. As

structure. We would have to go for an area committee
structure&#151;the sort of thing that Conservatives gaily abandon
when they take control of district councils&#151;but it would mean
much greater local decision making in the county structure, with
efficiencies of scale in service of delivery. That is a perfectly
respectable position, which should be argued and put before the people
of
Somerset.</p><p><a name="stpa_o337"><a name="61128-0017.htm_para8"><a name="061128118000118">A
third option is being canvassed among district councils in the
authority. The present administrative county of Somerset is a little
too big to be a single unitary council, owing to the remoteness of some
areas, so perhaps we should consider more than one unitary. That may
appeal to some people and was one of the partial outcomes of the Banham
inquiry. It would have the benefit of efficiencies of scale as well as
the local accountability that is so important. The difficulty is where
to draw lines on the map, but a roughly convenient line could be drawn
to link south Somerset to Mendip, and Taunton Deane to Sedgemoor and
west Somerset, thereby giving an approximate community of interests on
either side of the
M5.</p><p><a name="stpa_o338"><a name="61128-0017.htm_para9"><a name="061128118000119">There is a
further option, which I really want the Minister to consider in the
context of the consultation, if it goes ahead. I have no brief to speak
for areas outside the county of Somerset, but the historical county, as
I hope she knows, stretched not to the present northern boundary of the
administrative county but up to the river Avon, and comprised the
present unitary councils of North Somerset and Bath and North East
Somerset&#151;BANES, as it is known. Both those unitaries are
relatively small, with populations well below the number that the
Government now say is the optimum; in North Somerset, the population is
about 190,000 and in BANES, it is about 170,000. The councils have a
strong community of interest with some parts of the present
administrative county of Somerset. Frome, which I

towns and have a strong community of interest with the area represented
in BANES. I suspect&#151;though I am less of an expert on the
area&#151;that the same would apply to a coastal strip relating more
to Weston-super-Mare and the tourism industry in the west Mendip area
and Sedgemoor.</p><p><a name="stpa_o339"><a name="61128-0017.htm_para10"><a name="061128118000120">I
therefore think it is possible to put forward the perfectly sensible
proposition that we should be looking at perhaps four unitary
authorities within the historical county of Somerset that would have a
clear community of interest and clearly defined geographical
boundaries. They would all be within Somerset&#151;a point that I
emphasise time and again. As a Somerset man, I am proud of our
historical and cultural identity and I am not prepared to see it lost
simply to allow some invention of a name for which no one has any
affection. We live in Somerset, but our administration will be on a
scale that is consonant with the demands of modern local government,
while at the same time it will retain a degree of local
accountability.</p><p><a name="stpa_o340"><a name="61128-0017.htm_para11"><a name="061128118000121">The right
hon. Member for Wells asked me to draw the lines on the map and decide
what is best for Somerset. He may be able to do that, but I cannot,
because these are all perfectly respectable options and, as far as I am
concerned, it should be for the people of Somerset to decide what suits
them best. I have to say that, given that the debate has been opened by
the Government, whose intentions are clear, it is something with which
we should engage, even if our response at the end of the day is to say
no and opt for the status quo because it suits us best in our
circumstances. What I reject is the right hon. Gentleman&#146;s
contention that the debate should be closed down before it has even

Somerset, where we had county and district fighting like ferrets in a
bag about things that they should not have been fighting about, with
all sides maintaining a monopoly of truth. No one has that monopoly of
truth: there are different models&#151;some good, some bad. If we
treat them with respect, examine them dispassionately and put them
before the people of Somerset in an effective manner, I hope that we
will end up with the right

Taunton we go: Councillor Bakewell&#146;s barmy army, which is

Somerset knew about the scheme was when a load of muscular men from the
county council turned up and started hammering in new road signs
everywhere&#151;thousands of them. In one village in my constituency,
the signs said that drivers should go from 60 mph to 50, down to 20 and
back up again in under a mile&#151;remarkable. Even Michael
Schumacher would be proud of that. Our country roads were littered with
new metal signs. Even the national park glittered in the sunlight of
that glow. But, eventually, even the county council realised that it
might be a good idea to ask people what they thought. So people told
it, and the silly signs were removed. Unfortunately, &#163;2.5
million has been spent&#151;wasted. What a
fiasco!</p><p><a name="stpa_o350"><a name="61128-0017.htm_para21"><a name="061128118000132">Now we have
the small matter of windmills. Renewable energy is marvellous, so one
cannot complain. My party leader is sticking one on his roof, so they
must be all right. But Somerset county council believes that the divine
right is to save the planet: forward and upwards, onward Christian
soldiers. So Bakewell&#146;s blunderings now include building a
forest of those things over the county farms and across Glastonbury
tor. Every hon. Member knows the tor&#151;it is the home of Avalon
and allegedly the birthplace and burial place of Arthur&#151;and the
council wants to stick windmills on the top. Great&#151;that will go
down well at Glastonbury festival. The council also wants to put them
on the Quantocks, which is the first area of outstanding natural
beauty, and it is not going to work. To let the Minister know, the
council is talking about putting them near schools in my constituency
along the M5. What do people think? We have never been asked. We do not
know.</p><p><a name="stpa_o351"><a name="61128-0017.htm_para22"><a name="061128118000133">There are other
examples. There has been a massive change in special needs teaching in
Somerset, as my right hon. Friend and the hon. Gentleman know, and it
has not been for the better. In West Somerset&#151;the most rural
district in England, into which London would fit very
comfortably&#151;that role has been cut: &#163;80,000 has been
taken away. Children now have to travel for an hour to go Taunton or
Bridgwater to get special needs teaching. The county never asked anyone
about that. It said that it was going to happen. We are being offered a
team in two year&#146;s time&#151;I can hardly wait&#151;and I
wonder whether those involved know where West Somerset is. We wait with

even better. Just after I became the MP&#151;I took over from Lord
King&#151;the county council said, &#147;In line with Government
proposals, we are going to get rid of all the schools in Sedgemoor. We
are going to have three super-schools. So you go in as a kiddy and you
come out as an adult. We will do it all the way through.&#148; The
council did not ask anyone in Sedgemoor. It thought that that did not
matter; it thought, &#147;They will love it.&#148; Every school
rebelled, but that did not matter. &#147;Onward and upward,
utopia!&#148; was the cry. Luckily, the Minister&#146;s former
colleague Mr. Stephen Twigg, who is no longer in the House,
said, &#147;This is mad. It is ridiculous.&#148; He stopped the

to give them some responsibility for recycling, but they could not be

that, relationships need to change, including the relationship between
central and local government, and between local government, its local
partners and its citizens. Of course, in the case of two-tier local
government areas, that includes the relationship between county and
district. The status quo in two-tier areas is not an

country, people have told us that the arrangements in some two-tier
authorities simply do not deliver the governance needed for today. For
some time now, we have been engaged in an active, extensive public
dialogue with local government and others about governance and
restructuring. Ministerial discussions and round-table events were held
last spring in each of the eight regions, all of which cover a number
of counties, and we have been exploring the future of local government
with local politicians, officials, businesses and residents. In some
areas, there is real determination to make the current system work
better, but in several other areas there is a strong feeling that the
current system cannot be made to work.</p><p><a name="st_o297"><a name="061128118000155"><b><a name="61128-0018.htm_spnew0"><a name="061128118000228">Mr.

the debate.</p><p><a name="stpa_o368"><a name="61128-0018.htm_para6"><a name="061128118000157">As I was
saying, in some areas there is real determination to make the system
work, but people have also told us that they find the current system
confusing, inefficient and ineffective. To take a small example,
maintaining grass verges might be a matter for the parish council, but
keeping the pavement clean might be the responsibility of district
councils, and keeping the road clean might be up to the county council.
The Government&#146;s response to such difficulties is to allow
restructuring. There is no doubt but that there are risks and
challenges for two-tier structures. There is the risk of confusion,
duplication and inefficiency between the tiers, and there are
challenges for small districts with small budgets and restricted
boundaries that do not reflect social and economic patterns in the
area.</p><p><a name="stpa_o369"><a name="61128-0018.htm_para7"><a name="061128118000158">We
know that many councils are working hard to overcome those risks and
challenges, but it is important for councils in all two-tier areas to
consider new ways of working. In some areas, there is a widely held
view that moving to a unitary structure would be the best way of
dealing with the risks and challenges. That would improve
accountability and create stronger, more focused leadership. It would
improve efficiency and, most importantly of all, it would improve
outcomes for local people. In those areas, people have the opportunity,
until 25 January, to give us proposals for unitary local government,
and we expect to receive a small number of proposals that meet the
criteria. That will not be the best route for everyone, but we expect
the same outcomes, and the same level of efficiency gains, for areas
and their citizens, regardless of whether councils choose the unitary
route, or look to make improvements in the two-tier structure

areas continuing with two tiers, there will be significant change. We
are asking all principal councils in those counties committed to aiming
for an improved and innovative two-tier approach to act as pathfinders.
The aims of the two-tier model pioneered by the pathfinders should be
the same as the outcomes that can be achieved by a move to unitary
structures. They include unified service delivery, so that there is no
need for service users to understand whether the country, district or,
indeed, other service provider is responsible; stronger leadership;
effective accountability arrangements, so that people know who is
responsible for which decision; shared back-office functions; and
integrated service delivery. We are seeking new ways of working between
the tiers, and we are asking for outline proposals by 25 January, after
which we will designate pathfinders to develop the proposal.</p><p><a name="stpa_o371"><a name="61128-0018.htm_para9"><a name="061128118000160">The pathfinders will be
subject to evaluation at intervals&#151;perhaps after two, four or
six years. To achieve a proper comparison, we will make a similar
evaluation of new unitaries. Until that is complete and we have the
results, we do not intend to instigate change again. Proposals for
unitary structures must be in accordance with the terms of the
invitation. In submitting a proposal, councils must have regard to the
guidance in the invitation that states that proposals should be
presented in the form of a business case with a supporting financial
framework. Until we have received and considered the bids, I hope that
the right hon. Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory), and
the hon. Members for Bridgwater (Mr. Liddell-Grainger) and
for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath) appreciate that it is
inappropriate for me to comment on the merits or otherwise of any
particular proposal.</p><p><a name="stpa_o372"><a name="61128-0018.htm_para10"><a name="061128118000161">I can, however, say something
about the criteria that will be used to assess proposals. They must be
affordable. Change must represent value for money, and it must be met
from councils&#146; existing resources. Bids must be supported by a
broad cross-section of partners and stakeholders, service users and
citizens. We will consider whether proposals provide strong, effective
and accountable strategic leadership; and whether they deliver genuine
opportunities for neighbourhood flexibility and empowerment, as well as
value for money and equity in public
services.</p><p><a name="st_o299"><a name="061128118000162"><b><a name="61128-0018.htm_spnew2"><a name="061128118000230">Mr.

working between the district councils. However, it is difficult to
demonstrate, because councils assess it with internal systems. Such

said that councils do not always work in that way in Somerset. I can
assure her that, in my experience, that is not the case in any of the
district councils in Somerset.</p><p><a name="st_o302"><a name="061128118000166"><b><a name="61128-0018.htm_spnew5"><a name="061128118000233">Meg

we want to see what councils can demonstrate, particularly in that
relationship between the tiers. Wider co-operation across local
authorities is also to be welcomed. At the outset the right hon. Member
for Wells mentioned multi-area agreements. Those are mechanisms whereby
areas that go across more than one local authority can determine that
they have interests have common. They may represent natural
communities, so they may want to set out how they propose to work on
priorities together, with the benefit of being able to require other
agencies and organisations to co-operate with them in that, as set out
in the White Paper.</p><br>
