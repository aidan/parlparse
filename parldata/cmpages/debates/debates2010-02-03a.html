Secretary of State share the frustration and anger of the people of Northern Ireland about the lack of real progress in these talks? Could he explain to the House why the Government have abandoned the core agreement principle of inclusivity by excluding 44 per cent. of the electorate from meaningful inter-party dialogue at these talks, and explain the abandonment of proportionality in the allocation of Ministries?</p>

<p><a name="st_o3"><a name="10020368000031"><a name="100203-0001.htm_spnew2"><a name="10020368000516"><b>Mr. Woodward:</b>
 I certainly share the sense of frustration; after eight days and 110 or 120 hours of talks, sleep deprivation might be having its effect, as well.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o2"><a name="100203-0001.htm_para2"><a name="10020368000032">The Prime Minister and the Taoiseach wanted to ensure that it was possible for the political parties to reach a reasonable agreement. Let us remember that, ultimately, because of the St. Andrews arrangements, the completion of devolution will be decided by a cross-community vote. However, before that, the political parties have been engaging in the past week in talks in an inclusive way. I can only say that, from what I have seen so far of the product of these talks, many of the points that the political parties in Northern Ireland would have wanted to see in such a process are very much under consideration.</p>

 I am grateful to the Secretary of State for that answer and for clarifying the position for the House. I have been a little concerned in listening to at least one of the parties talking about whether any agreement that was reached among the parties to the talks would have in some way to be put out for public consultation or a vote-it is a bit unspecific. What is the Government's position on that? Do they think that that would be a helpful process or that it would hinder a solution that would be durable and remain for the foreseeable future?</p>

 Clearly, whatever agreement is reached by the parties must be durable. It is very important for us all to understand that what is at stake are not simply arrangements for a date for the transfer of policing and justice powers, for which the Government strongly believe that the time is now right: this is the end of a political process that began with the peace process itself. If we succeed with this, we will secure all the achievements of the peace process; if we fail, we will put many of them at risk.</p>

I also congratulate my right hon. Friend on the new unit that he opened this week in Maghaberry prison. On that particular aspect, if the devolution of policing does not go ahead, what might be the implications for the future of the prison-building programme in Northern Ireland?</p>

In the past two years, we have provided some 300 new prison places, with 120 more to come. The House may wish to note, however, that if no agreement is reached in the next few days, and if therefore we cannot complete devolution, the loss of the £800 million that my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister would make available would almost certainly mean that extra prison places would not happen, that the new women's prison would not happen, and that, indeed, the new Magilligan prison would be unlikely to proceed.</p>

 Does not the Secretary of State think that an essential ingredient of the current discussions must be a consensus that can command community confidence? Without that community confidence, no matter what pressure is placed upon me or my colleagues, the Democratic Unionist party will not be buying into any deal. Progress has been made, but more remains to be done, and we certainly agree with including all the other parties in these discussions.</p>

 Of course everyone must have confidence, but confidence does not belong to any one community. One of the principles is that an agreement must indeed command support from everyone in Northern Ireland, but we are speaking about something that was understood in the St. Andrews agreement and that people expected would be completed. All the political parties in the Assembly elections understood the importance of completing devolution. The Assembly has been up and running for nearly three years, and that business remains to be done. We believe that the confidence is there, and it is now time to summon leadership and courage and act.</p>

 Does the Secretary of State agree that it is very important that no party in Northern Ireland is seen to be blackmailing Her Majesty's Government? The actions of Sinn Fein, in threatening to pull down the Assembly if the Prime Minister and the Taoiseach did not go almost straight over to Northern Ireland and spend hours without sleep, would not seem to any reasonable person a sensible way forward. Of course we want the agreement to happen, but that is not necessarily the best way to move forward.</p>

 I thank my hon. Friend for those remarks. Let us be clear that the Prime Minister works extremely hard whether he is here in Downing street or in Northern Ireland, which is why I am sure we are all very grateful to him for what he has done. He went to Northern Ireland with the Taoiseach because he has been following the matter very closely over the past few months and judged that the time was right last Monday to go and help facilitate the talks and to build a pathway on which it would be possible to construct a reasonable agreement. That was the critical role that he played in those two days. If we reach agreement, the people of Northern Ireland from every community should be grateful to him and to the Taoiseach.</p>

He is absolutely right that patience is required, but equally we must be careful not to try people's patience to distraction. Unfair failure to make progress would not be rewarded-not by any particular process now, but by the people of Northern Ireland.

She is absolutely right to talk about the importance of tolerance and respect. It is essential that we also learn to put trust into the process. Every step of the way in the peace process has at times required us to make acts of faith.

None the less, the agreement must be forged initially between the DUP and Sinn Fein. Let me pay tribute to the leadership offered by both parties.

The IMC noted that there was some tactical co-operation between certain groupings, which of course the PSNI and the Security Service are aware of and are dealing with, but the key thing is that the completion of devolution of policing and justice provides a real opportunity to snuff out those who would oppose the political and peace processes and try to bring disruption.

 One can either take a unilateralist or a multilateralist attitude to defence. We take a multilateralist attitude that we are prepared to work with other countries for nuclear disarmament. We do so on the basis of being prepared to discuss the future of Trident as part of multilateral talks. We are prepared to look at and discuss the scientific evidence for reducing the number of submarines from four to three. The defence review paper will state all these things.

More helicopters have gone into Afghanistan over the last few months, as have more vehicles.

Like their policy on hereditary peers, it will give the richest people in our society the greatest amount of additional wealth. That could be at the expense of schools, it could be at the expense of the health service and it could also be at the expense of defence. I think people should know that the Conservative party's first priority, above all others, is to reduce inheritance tax for those who are perfectly able to take care of themselves. We are for the many, they are for the few.</p>

<h3 align="center">Strategic Defence Review (Green Paper)</h3>
<a name="ordayhd_0"><a name="100203-0004.htm_ordayhd0"><a name="10020368000503"><h5 align="left">12.32 pm</h5>

 Today I am publishing a defence Green Paper that paves the way for a strategic defence review, set in the context of the national security strategy, early in the next Parliament. At the present time, Afghanistan is the main effort for the Ministry of Defence. Where choices have to be made, Afghanistan will continue to be given priority. Our forces there are fighting hard, protecting our national security by preventing Afghanistan from once again becoming a safe haven for terrorists.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o20"><a name="100203-0004.htm_para0"><a name="10020368000167">Two hundred and fifty three British service personnel have been killed in Afghanistan since 2001. Many more have suffered life-changing injuries. Their bravery in the face of a ruthless enemy has been a stark reminder to us that all conflict is difficult and dangerous. We certainly cannot assume that the conflicts of tomorrow will replicate those of today, but we must anticipate a wide range of threats and plan for the requirements necessary to counter them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o21"><a name="100203-0004.htm_para1"><a name="10020368000168">We have come a long way since the last major defence review in 1998, which gave us the platform to modernise our armed forces. Looking forward, we will need to make decisions about the role that we want the United Kingdom to play in the world and about the capabilities that our armed forces need to support that role. We will need to balance those considerations against financial implications in what will inevitably be a resource-constrained environment. The Green Paper does not attempt to answer those fundamental questions. Instead, it is intended to set out our emerging thinking on the future security environment and on other key issues facing defence ahead of the review.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o22"><a name="100203-0004.htm_para2"><a name="10020368000169">Although there is no external direct threat to the territorial integrity of the UK, there are a wide range of emerging threats for which we must be prepared. We can work to diminish the threat of international terrorism and to counter the proliferation of chemical, biological and nuclear weapons; we can work to prevent emerging threats-for example, by improving our approach to cybersecurity-and to contain and resolve the threat from failing states; and we can work to ensure that the impacts of climate change and resource competition are managed peacefully, but my judgment is that conflict and instability in this new age will be an ever-present risk. In the face of those threats, no nation can hope to protect all aspects of national security by acting alone. We cannot simply defend from the goal line, and our defence posture must reflect that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o23"><a name="100203-0004.htm_para3"><a name="10020368000170">In the coming decades, our armed forces must be prepared, if called upon to do so, to protect our interests, often in distant places and, most likely, as part of a coalition of international forces. The Green Paper therefore reaches two key conclusions. First, that defence must accelerate the process of reform and be able to change swiftly to address new and unforeseen challenges as they emerge. We need to be more adaptable in how we structure, equip, train and generate our armed forces. We need a more agile defence organisation, and we need more responsive strategic planning. Today, I am proposing that we should legislate for regular defence reviews to ensure that the armed forces continue to adapt rapidly to changing trends and threats.</p>

<notus-date day="3" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><b>3 Feb 2010 : Column 304</b><br>

<p><a name="stpa_o24"><a name="100203-0004.htm_para4"><a name="10020368000171">The second conclusion is that defence must improve its ability to work in partnership with our key allies and security institutions to make the most of our combined resources. Our alliances and partnerships will become increasingly important and will define how successful we will be in meeting the challenges that we face. We will strengthen our alliance with the United States if we strengthen our position in Europe. We will continue to press our European allies to contribute more to our collective defence effort, but, make no mistake, this is not about Europe taking precedence over the US, or vice versa-the two are mutually reinforcing relationships.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o25"><a name="100203-0004.htm_para5"><a name="10020368000172">In the UK, we need to improve further our partnerships with key Whitehall Departments and others to ensure that the contribution of our armed forces is joined up with our diplomatic and development efforts. In addition to its conclusions on adaptability and partnership, the paper poses six key strategic questions that the review will need to address. They are as follows. Where should we set the balance between focusing on our territory and region and on engaging threats at distance? How far are future conflicts likely to share the characteristics of our engagement in Afghanistan, and what approach should we therefore take if we employ armed force to address threats at distance? What contribution should our armed forces make to ensuring security and contributing to resilience within the UK? How could we more effectively employ armed force in support of wider efforts to prevent conflict and to strengthen international stability? Do our current international defence and security relationships require rebalancing in the longer term? Should we further integrate our forces with those of our key allies and partners?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o26"><a name="100203-0004.htm_para6"><a name="10020368000173">Although the defence budget has grown by over 10 per cent. in real terms since 1998-and not a penny will be cut from next year's budget-the forward defence programme faces real financial pressure. We will need to rebalance what we do in order to meet our priorities. In December, I began that process. I made a series of decisions to ensure that we found extra resources for vital equipment for Afghanistan. This included 22 new Chinook helicopters, which will provide necessary strategic lift capability for Afghanistan and for other military operations in the years ahead. However, our commitment to reducing the deficit resulting from the global financial crisis means that future resources across government will be constrained.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o27"><a name="100203-0004.htm_para7"><a name="10020368000174">The report of Bernard Gray into defence acquisition set out clearly the pressures facing the defence budget. It also set out the importance of improving our procurement processes and addressing the shortfalls in our acquisition systems. The strategy for acquisition reform published alongside today's Green Paper sets out how we will tackle the challenges facing this major area of defence expenditure. The major reform that it proposes will deliver enduring change by introducing greater transparency. It will ensure that our equipment plans are efficient, strategically focused, affordable and achievable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o28"><a name="100203-0004.htm_para8"><a name="10020368000175">But it is not just in equipment acquisition that we will need to do better. We are aiming to deliver efficiency savings of more than £3 billion over the current spending review period. We have a strong programme of work to achieve this, including an independent review into the use of civilians in defence that is being led by Gerry Grimstone.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o29"><a name="100203-0004.htm_para9"><a name="10020368000176">Our biggest capability is our people. We rely on the ability of people, both military and civilian, to deliver defence. We need to attract the best people-people who are highly motivated and highly skilled. Our people have already shown their capacity to adapt to new challenges. We must continue to ensure that the structures and training that support them are fit for purpose, and that includes continuing to strengthen joint approaches across the services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o30"><a name="100203-0004.htm_para10"><a name="10020368000177">There has been a great deal of interest in, and speculation about, whether any major capabilities will be confirmed in the Green Paper, but that is to misunderstand the purpose. I can say that we do not plan to revisit the conclusions of the 2006 White Paper on the nuclear deterrent. We have committed to a wide range of major capability improvements over the past few years including, most recently, signing contracts for two new aircraft carriers. [Hon. Members: "Hear, hear!"] Only two.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o31"><a name="100203-0004.htm_para11"><a name="10020368000178">Recent operations in Iraq and Afghanistan have demonstrated the importance of being able to deploy and sustain significant numbers of highly trained and equipped troops in a variety of roles, including providing the aviation and air support that they need. Unless the defence review takes a very radical new direction, it is the Government's position that those capabilities are likely to remain critical elements of our force structure. However, we need to know first what roles and missions we will expect our forces to undertake in the future before we can take final decisions about the capabilities that they will need. These will be key issues for the defence review.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o32"><a name="100203-0004.htm_para12"><a name="10020368000179">Let us be clear-change is needed, and there will be some tough and important decisions ahead. In my view, we must, as far possible, put aside our special interests, in politics, industry and the services, to take rational decisions that benefit defence and the security of our nation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o33"><a name="100203-0004.htm_para13"><a name="10020368000180">In preparing the Green Paper, I consulted widely with academia, across government and with the main Opposition parties, and I am grateful for the help that I received. I would like to thank in this House the right hon. and learned Member for North-East Fife (Sir Menzies Campbell) and the hon. Member for Mid-Sussex (Mr. Soames), and Lord Robertson of Port Ellen in the other place, all of whom sat on my Defence Advisory Forum. Where the defence of the nation is concerned, we must seek as far as possible to reach consensus on the main issues.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o34"><a name="100203-0004.htm_para14"><a name="10020368000181">I hope that the Green Paper that I am publishing today helps that process and leads to a mature and well-informed debate about the future structure of our armed forces.</p>

balanced and open-minded Green Paper. I know that his experience in the Ministry of Defence was very much appreciated in the process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o36"><a name="100203-0004.htm_para16"><a name="10020368000184">The Green Paper indicates that the Ministry of Defence is coming out of denial, but that the Prime Minister is not. We are used to the Prime Minister briefing against his perceived enemies in the corridors of Westminster, but not normally undermining a Secretary of State on the front page of <i> The Times.</i> How far away from the No. 10 briefing this week is paragraph 9 on page 9 of the Green Paper, which states:</p>
<a name="100203-0004.htm_brev0"><a name="10020368000476"><ul><p class="tabletext">"We cannot proceed with all the activities and programmes we currently aspire to, while simultaneously supporting our current operations and investing in the new capabilities we need. We will need to make tough decisions"?</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o37"><a name="100203-0004.htm_para17"><a name="10020368000185">Of course, this week we have seen the truth of the current Prime Minister's approach to defence. The former Defence Secretary, the right hon. Member for Ashfield (Mr. Hoon) has said that there was a strong feeling that the last defence review was not fully funded. The former Chief of the Defence Staff, Lord Walker, told us that the defence chiefs threatened to resign as a result of the savage cuts that the then Chancellor tried to apply to defence in the middle of two wars. Today the former permanent secretary, Sir Kevin Tebbit, talked about having to operate a permanent crisis budget.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o38"><a name="100203-0004.htm_para18"><a name="10020368000186">The Defence Secretary introduced defence cuts in December, but the Prime Minister this week was talking about increasing the defence budget. In his statement the Secretary of State said, "There has been a great deal of interest in, and speculation about, whether any major capabilities will be confirmed in the Green Paper". We all know why. It is because No. 10 has been briefing all week that any project that has any job implications for the Prime Minister's constituency will be spared in any defence review. That is taking a core strategy way too far.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o39"><a name="100203-0004.htm_para19"><a name="10020368000187">There are some things on which we are clearly agreed. We know from bitter historical experience the difficulty of predicting future conflict-either its nature or its location. We cannot base our future security on the assumption that future wars will be like the current ones. That is why we must maintain generic capability and be able to adapt to any changing threats.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o40"><a name="100203-0004.htm_para20"><a name="10020368000188">There is no doubt that in Afghanistan we have been too slow to give the Army, in particular, the agility and flexibility that it needs to maximise its effectiveness. But we must also remember that we are a maritime nation dependent on the sea lanes for 92 per cent. of our trade. A time when the threat of disruption is increasing is no time for Britain to become sea blind.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o41"><a name="100203-0004.htm_para21"><a name="10020368000189">We agree that France and the United States are likely to be our main strategic partners. For us there are two tests: do they invest in defence, and do they fight? Sadly, too few European allies pass both these tests.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o42"><a name="100203-0004.htm_para22"><a name="10020368000190">The Secretary of State talked about a 10 per cent. increase in the defence budget in real terms. He also talks in the Green Paper about the higher level of defence inflation. Can he tell us how much of the increase in the defence budget has gone into pay, allowances and pensions, and what proportion of the increase has been available for equipment and other programmes over the period that he outlined? Can he confirm that the Department's budget for next year will be £36.89 billion,  <br>

<p><a name="stpa_o43"><a name="100203-0004.htm_para23"><a name="10020368000191">Unlike the Opposition and the House of Commons, the Government have access to all the costs of the contracts and all the penalty clauses for the major programmes. Why will the Government not give honest answers about the implications of the cost overruns in the years ahead? We know that there has been serial mismanagement at the MOD, with the equipment programme being somewhere between £6 billion and £35 billion above what can currently be afforded. How will it be reconciled?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o44"><a name="100203-0004.htm_para24"><a name="10020368000192">After 12 years of indecision, we finally get a Green Paper weeks before a general election, and, despite all its good words and all the good intentions of the Secretary of State, the future defence budget of the United Kingdom will have to be determined against the backdrop of Government debt of £799 billion, which is the equivalent of having borrowed £1.1 million every day since the birth of Christ. That our nation's security should be compromised in this way by Labour's historic economic incompetence is truly a national tragedy.</p>

<p><a name="st_o101"><a name="10020368000193"><a name="100203-0004.htm_spnew1"><a name="10020368000634"><b>Mr. Ainsworth:</b>
 I thank the hon. Gentleman for his kind comments- despite his motives in making them. Can I just point out one thing to him? He claimed that I made defence cuts in December, yet in the same response he said that we were a little late in providing the wherewithal for the Army in Afghanistan. We did not make defence cuts in December; we prioritised, over three years, £900 million of the core defence budget for equipment that was needed for the Afghan conflict. We are doing that, but he criticises us for not doing it, and then he claims that those measures were cuts when, in fact, they were reprioritisations. They were reprioritisations within a budget that never fell. I do not know whether the hon. Gentleman is prepared to admit or accept that. The budget never fell; I moved money within the budget. It was right to do so, and I make no apology for that, but one thing that I say in the Green Paper-and I think I say it with the genuine support of many people who know about these matters-is that our planning structures will have to be more adaptable. We cannot have planning assumptions that effectively prevent us from moving money within the budget when there are pressing needs; we have to have a structure that supports the adaptability of our armed forces. That must be the overwhelming priority.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o45"><a name="100203-0004.htm_para25"><a name="10020368000194">The hon. Gentleman talked about the problems with the equipment programme, but I remind him that it was this Government who commissioned the Gray report. We did so to get to the bottom of problems that do exist but, when judged against international comparators, are no worse than hardly any and, indeed, better than many. But, those problems need to be addressed, and there are inefficiencies. We commissioned the Gray report, and I hope that, when the hon. Gentleman has the time to study it properly, he will see that there is a real way-albeit an uncomfortable one for future Ministers-of ensuring that we have a defence procurement methodology that prevents the overruns that we have had. Transparency will be the main tool for doing that, but regular defence reviews, enshrined in legislation, will help as well.</p>

that the strategic defence review must answer. However, that agenda is unbalanced by the omission of one item: the replacement of Trident. A few minutes ago, the Prime Minister responded to a question about it by looking at the issue from a strategic security point of view, and I agree that that is the starting point, but surely the scale and the timing of any replacement of the Trident deterrent has profound opportunity cost implications for the entirety of the rest of the defence budget. A strategic defence review cannot be genuinely comprehensive if the biggest single strategic and spending decision is parked outwith its framework.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o46"><a name="100203-0004.htm_para26"><a name="10020368000196">The statement rightly identified that the strategic defence review needs first to ask, what role does Britain want to play in global security? I agree with the Defence Secretary that it would not be appropriate for us to "defend from the goal line", and that we should be prepared to go to distant places in our national interests, but are we going to learn from our mistakes? In particular, the 1998 assumption that we would be quick in and quick out of some engagements has not turned out to be correct. Should we not also learn the lesson that invading Iraq without the support of many of our usual allies and with dubious legal cover made the operation a great deal more difficult to prosecute thereafter?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o47"><a name="100203-0004.htm_para27"><a name="10020368000197">I strongly welcome the Defence Secretary's remarks about a greater importance for co-operation within Europe on defence matters. The Americans' strategic interests and financial resources mean that in the next few decades they will not be able to make the contribution to European defence that they have made in previous decades.

The Defence Secretary went on to talk about accelerating reform and the need to be more adaptable. I entirely agree, but I urge him to be bolder and to go further not only with reform, but with making ourselves agile enough to face emerging threats. We still have troops in Germany who seem to be prepared for the unlikely eventuality of the Soviets arriving with their tanks. There is a great deal more work to be done, but I welcome the direction that the Defence Secretary has pointed out.</p>

 When one looks for international comparators, one struggles to find anybody who does such things in a pristine manner. We are no worse than many, many others, but there is huge ground for improvement in my opinion. That is why my predecessor commissioned Bernard Gray to do that report in the first place, and why the Minister of State, Lord Paul Drayson, took a hold of it and produced the acquisition reform strategy, which I think will address the issues raised by the hon. Gentleman.</p>

 The Secretary of State will be aware of the developing world-class technology at BAE Warton in my constituency, which is seeing the production of unmanned and autonomous air vehicles. Will the debate he has triggered by the publication of the Green Paper enable a decision to be made as to whether that technology should be counted as a sovereign technology for the United Kingdom?</p>

 Yes, that is something that has got to be looked at. I would just remind the right hon. Gentleman that some of his hon. Friends suggested that I was paying for today at the expense of tomorrow when I moved some resources for the purchase of drones. I think such capability is exactly "tomorrow", whether that means in Afghanistan or anywhere else. The kind of thing the right hon. Gentleman mentioned is what we need to think about.</p>

 May I assure the Secretary of State that we in Northern Ireland and our friends in Scotland and Wales are not parochial when it comes to providing our best young people-men and women-to serve in the armed forces?

That impacts not only on welfare provision-soldiers are interested in that, but they are also interested in the kind of organisation that they are joining. They want to join capable armed forces. Planning properly for the future to ensure that they can fulfil a role is the biggest single contribution we can make to attracting the talent we need.</p>

 It is welcome that the Green Paper contains a number of references to reserve forces, following from the question asked by the right hon. Member for Lagan Valley (Mr. Donaldson). In their review, are the Government going to address the questions why we strike the balance between reserves and regulars so very differently from most of our English-speaking counterparts, and why they are able to make so much more imaginative use of reserves than us?</p>

 I hope so. That is why those passages are there. I think societal trends will push us, in the long term, in the direction of making more use, not less, of reserve forces. Therefore, the need to ensure that they are highly trained and capable people is going to take on increasing importance. Those issues are flagged up in the Green Paper and the questions that we have posed are out there for debate, and I hope that that matter will be addressed in the strategic defence review.</p>

 Does the Secretary of State note, seeing as he has made the statement, that there is not a single reference to NATO in it, which is simply stupendous and quite astonishing? Why is there also no reference to the European Union? Europe is one thing and allies are another. Can he remember what happened with the French off Djibouti? Can he remember what happened when the Belgians would not provide us with any ammunition? Can he remember what happened over the Iraq conflict?

 Was it not the Ministry's preoccupation with the European Union project for the future rapid effect system that prevented it having the ability to respond to the needs of our soldiers in both Iraq and Afghanistan, leading to a shortage of appropriate equipment in both protected vehicles and, indeed, helicopters?

 One of the big questions we must face is to what degree we are prepared to integrate with, and therefore become dependent upon, our allies, whether that is NATO or the EU, or the US, with which we have a close association in military affairs. That is something that we must think about, but there are people in the House-I do not know whether the hon. Gentleman is one of them-who have a view that we can be secure unilaterally. However, I do not think that even the US can be secure unilaterally in the modern world. Therefore, we must invest in our friends and alliances-we have no choice but to do so.</p>

 Until 1997, there was an annual defence White Paper, which was, to a significant degree, the public presentation of the product of the long-term costings exercise inside the Department, which reconciled the defence programme 10 years out. The absence of that process or of any replacement for it means that the forward defence programme is now bearing all the risk. That was enumerated by Mr. Bernard Gray, who said in his report that</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o62"><a name="100203-0006.htm_para4"><a name="10020368000264">Every Remembrance Sunday, war memorials up and down the country become the focal point for our national ceremony of remembrance. From the plainest monuments to the grand Cenotaph in Whitehall, people gather to remember the glorious dead. For the rest of the year, war memorials fade from the public consciousness into the background of our lives. But they are still there, exuding a quiet dignity tinged with sadness for those who have died for our country. They are more than rock and stone. In fact, the estimated 100,000 war memorials take the form of plaques, inscriptions on church pews, statues, arches and even bus shelters. But whatever the form, they symbolise the values of service and sacrifice for our liberty that our country holds dear.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o63"><a name="100203-0006.htm_para5"><a name="10020368000265">Conflicts such as that in Afghanistan have sadly made remembrance a continuous part of our national life. Today, the Prime Minister again read out the names of those soldiers who have died in Afghanistan in our name. Those names, like those that have gone before them, will not be forgotten. That is what we say, and we act-in one way-by inscribing those names on memorials.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o64"><a name="100203-0006.htm_para6"><a name="10020368000266">I wish to introduce this Bill to ensure that we reflect the importance of war memorials. If enacted, the Bill would properly punish those who show such disregard by desecrating a war memorial. With the death of Harry Patch, the last human thread connecting us to the great war generation may have been cut, but that makes it all the more incumbent on us to retain and protect the physical thread that connects us to Harry Patch's generation in the form of memorials.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o65"><a name="100203-0006.htm_para7"><a name="10020368000267">My interest in this issue was sadly first prompted by an appalling act of theft and criminal damage to the Southgate memorial in Broomfield park in my constituency last August. Two six-foot-by-four-foot bronze plaques and nine smaller plates bearing the names of soldiers who died in the two world wars, alongside civilians from Southgate who were killed in the blitz, were ripped out. We were outraged by this despicable act. In 1949, when opening the Southgate memorial, Alderman Wauthier said:</p>
<a name="100203-0006.htm_brev2"><a name="10020368000479"><ul><p class="tabletext">"The Garden of Remembrance is a hallowed place and should not be interfered with".</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o67"><a name="100203-0006.htm_para9"><a name="10020368000269">The national media asked how this could happen. One radio programme was even dedicated to the question of whether Enfield was the meanest borough in London. I set about finding out whether this desecration is unique to my constituency. I take no pleasure in reporting to the House that in fact there have been an alarming number of incidents-57 reports in regional and national press in the last year of desecration of war memorials involving vandalism, theft and even public urination and defecation. This averages out to at least one war  <br>

memorial being desecrated every week. In fact, the lack of any specific reporting of such offences means that the number of desecrations is probably much higher.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o68"><a name="100203-0006.htm_para10"><a name="10020368000270">What particularly troubled me about the desecration in my constituency was that the bronze plaques were practically irreplaceable. We did not have any records of the names that were inscribed, and so when these plaques were stolen there was a good chance that the names, and the memory, of those soldiers could have been lost forever. It sickens me-and, no doubt, the House-to think of those plates being melted down for scrap and those names being consigned to oblivion. Thankfully, a local man who had taken extensive photographs of the memorial a few years ago came forward. Together with the good work of the UK National Inventory of War Memorials, we are now able to replace the plaques. Other communities are not so lucky, with many memorials not properly registered and recorded.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o69"><a name="100203-0006.htm_para11"><a name="10020368000271">The War Memorials Trust together with the national inventory, based at the Imperial War museum, are doing a sterling job to encourage registration of memorials, but only 55,000 have so far been registered. I urge hon. Members to find out how many war memorials there are in their constituency by contacting the national inventory, and -as they pound the streets and visit community buildings in the coming weeks-to keep an eye out not only for floating voters, but for unregistered war memorials.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o70"><a name="100203-0006.htm_para12"><a name="10020368000272">The War Memorials Trust, which relies on voluntary support, deserves our membership and support for its commendable and tireless work to protect war memorials. The hon. Member for Cleethorpes (Shona McIsaac) has previously raised this important issue, and we need to be vigilant and take action to reverse the neglect that is the greatest threat to memorials.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o71"><a name="100203-0006.htm_para13"><a name="10020368000273">War memorials do not have any dedicated legal protection. When damage is caused through criminal acts or neglect, the common question is who is responsible for repair and restoration. In my constituency, thankfully, Enfield council quickly responded by temporarily replacing the plaques, and they will soon be fully restored. However, the law needs to reflect the impact of desecration. There is, of course, the physical damage and the financial cost to the community of cleaning away the graffiti, repairing damage or replacing any stolen items such as bronze plaques. Many memorials were erected in the aftermath of the first world war and have since become a part of our heritage and our community. They are our connection to the past. The desecrators not only cause damage and steal property, but break the crucial link with past generations who have provided the remembrance. Such a break can sometimes be irreparable. More fundamentally, war memorials represent the values of our country. An attack on a war memorial represents an attack on our deeply held values, our freedoms and our democracy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o72"><a name="100203-0006.htm_para14"><a name="10020368000274">Who are those people carrying out these acts of desecration?

Then there are the mindless acts of destruction where memorials are  <br>

smashed to bits and nothing taken. Finally, and most serious of all, are the deliberate attacks aimed at desecrating the symbolic value of war memorials. I have come across several incidents of Nazi swastikas being sprayed on to war memorials. One of these included a memorial built to remember the victims of the holocaust. I find this particularly abhorrent, given that many of those memorials commemorate men who died fighting to keep this country free of fascism. Whether the actions are as a result of disrespect or deliberate malice, we must have tough sanctions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o73"><a name="100203-0006.htm_para15"><a name="10020368000275">So what is the state of the law at the moment? Currently there is no specific provision for desecration of a war memorial. The problem with the law, as it stands, is that it primarily accounts for seriousness on the basis of financial value of the damage. Unless the damage caused costs more than £5,000 to repair and replace, the maximum sentence that the magistrates court can hand down is three months in prison. This simply does not accurately reflect the seriousness of the crime.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o74"><a name="100203-0006.htm_para16"><a name="10020368000276">The Bill would amend the Criminal Damage Act 1971 to recognise damage to war memorials. Crown Court judges would have the power to deal with these cases, with up to 10 years imprisonment at their disposal. Presently, there are no complete figures for attacks on war memorials. By recognising war memorials in statute, we would help the reporting of such incidents. Another benefit of this Bill would be the creation of a proper legal definition for war memorials. This has been the aim of the War Memorials Trust for some time. By clarifying this definition, we would not just be able to tackle desecration, but also the problem of neglect.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o75"><a name="100203-0006.htm_para17"><a name="10020368000277">I appreciate that my Bill has no chance of becoming law in this Parliament, but I hope that a future Parliament will consider the whole issue of protection of war memorials. In the meantime, I hope that sentencing guidelines can be revised. Also I am sure that a war memorials all-party parliamentary group will be shortly formed, with a challenge for 2014 on the centenary of the outbreak of the first world war to have all memorials properly registered.</p>

One thing that can be said about the Government, more than anything else, is that we have invested in police and policing numbers, not just through neighbourhood policing, protective services and collaboration programmes, but in relation to all aspects of the police service. I am delighted, therefore, that the British crime survey and figures last week showed a marked reduction in crime for 2008-09, compared with 2007-08.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o84"><a name="100203-0007.htm_para1"><a name="10020368000287">It is worth placing that on the record because the police do a magnificent job, as has been shown by the fact that over the past year total recorded crime fell by 5 per cent.; vehicle crime by 10 per cent.; violence against the person by 6 per cent; robbery by 5 per cent.; sexual offences by 4 per cent.; robbery with a knife by 2 per cent.; and firearm offences by 17 per cent.

Normally, under such circumstances, crime would rise, but actually, over the past 12 months, in what have been-by any stretch of the imagination-challenging financial circumstances, crime has fallen.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o85"><a name="100203-0007.htm_para2"><a name="10020368000288">That can be added to the overall drop in crime of 36 per cent. since 1997, which is a very positive thing. The House will also know that the British crime survey last week showed that confidence in policing is now at 50 per cent. and that the chance of being a victim of crime is the lowest since records began. That is the backdrop to today's settlement and discussion. Coupled with those falls in crime, last week I was able to announce historically high numbers of police officers and staff on the streets. Figures published last week show that police officer strength remains at 142,688, which is an increase of nearly 17,000 officers over the past 13 years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o86"><a name="100203-0007.htm_para3"><a name="10020368000289">Obviously there are variations, challenges and difficulties, which no doubt will come out in the debate, but the record numbers of police officers, and indeed police community support officers-more than 16,000-show that today's settlement is building on a history of strong settlements that have seen crime fall, policing numbers rise and the introduction of PCSOs. The levels of confidence in policing and the fact that a person's chance of being a victim of crime is the lowest ever show that the Government have done a good job to date.</p>

 My right hon. Friend will be aware that the Government improved the funding formula for West Yorkshire police. Nevertheless, it is still £18 million adrift of the figure it would get were it fully funded.

We are currently considering the matter, and will continue to do so in the future, but my hon.

 Why has the Home Office consistently failed, until recently-with the migration impact forum-properly to take into account the significant impact on crime and policing of large-scale migration since May 2004 from eastern European countries?

 As the hon. Gentleman will know, that is one of the issues on which we have received representations, including from the chief constable of his own force. However, I hope that when he reflects on Cambridgeshire police funding, he will be pleased that the Labour Government have delivered an extra 109 police officers to his force in the past 13 years, that 33 per cent. more resource is going in than did under the Tory Government, and that even this year, in these challenging times, his force has £2.5 million more than it did last year-and all that from a Labour Government!

 Funding statistics and formulae are important, although most people are more worried about outcomes than how we get there, but can the Minister assure us that the population figures, whether or not they include people on the electoral register, are up to date as the basis of the formula? That has been a recurrent issue for local government and other service funders in London. Will he also comment on the fact that there is still some doubt about the veracity of the crime figures, which-if he is to be believed-are falling? Although that is to be welcomed, to have public confidence the figures ought to be arrived at in an entirely neutral way and separate from the Government as far as possible.</p>

 The Minister will know that police numbers in Essex have increased, and he will probably have guessed that I will seek to claim credit for that. However, people out there know that the real reason is that the Government have increased funding to enable police numbers in Essex to increase, and I thank him for that. However, will he use innovative surveillance and high-tech equipment to improve policing-for instance, vehicle automatic number plate recognition systems? We need those to clamp down on burglaries, which are a particular problem on Canvey island, for instance.</p>

 I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his support. He recognises, as I do, that there has been a 30 per cent. real-terms increase in funding for Essex, that there will be a £5.2 million increase-2.9 per cent.-next year and that there has been an historical fall in crime over the past five years of nearly 6 per cent. I fully accept that there is always more that we can do, and the automatic number plate recognition is a valuable tool-I know from my constituency how it helps to identify potential vehicle crime and to reduce crime. However, it relates to issues not only of vehicle crime, but of mobile burglary and people who cross borders to commit crimes. I certainly, therefore, encourage and support its further use, for which we should all be grateful.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o87"><a name="100203-0007.htm_para4"><a name="10020368000302">Let me turn to the nub of today's debate. The police revenue support grant, which was laid on 20 January, confirmed the indicative figures, and we are implementing the 2010-11 funding settlement as announced in December 2007, which is good news for the police. Between 1997 and 2010-11, we have increased the police service grant by about £3.7 billion-a cash increase of 60 per cent. and a real-terms increase of almost 20 per cent. The figures that I gave to the hon. Member for Peterborough (Mr. Jackson) can be replicated across the board in every police authority in England and Wales and represent a substantial increase in funding. They show that this year total Government funding for the 2010-11 cycle in today's report will be more than £9.7 billion-an overall increase of 2.7 per cent. on 2009-10. Some £8.5 billion of that provision is for the police general formula grant, and there is also an additional £1.2 million in specific grant funding, to which I will return later.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o88"><a name="100203-0007.htm_para5"><a name="10020368000303">We gave those commitments several years ago. In fact, they were probably given by my right hon. Friend the Member for Harrow, East (Mr. McNulty), who is with us today, as part of the three-year cycle of this comprehensive review. We kept those commitments and delivered on them in 2008 and 2009, and now in 2010-11. We have also kept ring-fenced funding to a minimum, so that we can allow forces the maximum flexibility in deciding how to allocate and spend their resources. The police grant deals with Home Office general police grant for revenue expenditure. The amounts for individual police authorities are set out in the papers before the House today, and I hope that they will be generally welcomed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o89"><a name="100203-0007.htm_para6"><a name="10020368000304">We have set a minimum floor of 2.5 per cent. for the grant provision for 2010-11. My hon. Friend the Member for Pudsey (Mr. Truswell), who raised this issue, will  <br>

know that, whatever our views on the funding formula, the fact that we have set a minimum rise of 2.5 per cent. is helpful to many forces. It means that each police authority in England and Wales is guaranteed an increase of at least that level. In my view, that is a positive announcement. We are trying to strike what I would describe as a sensible balance on the issues in economically challenging times.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o90"><a name="100203-0007.htm_para7"><a name="10020368000305">Indeed, I would be interested to hear from the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds (Mr. Ruffley) about whether, in what I would obviously see as the unlikely event of a change of Government, he will commit himself to the 2.5 per cent. increase that we have put in place for next year, whether he will support that funding for police community support officers, and whether he will support the ring-fencing of that funding, because those are crucial matters that will form part of our debate between now and whenever my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister calls the general election. We want to look at the funding formula review, and we will do so shortly. I hope that we will be in a position to do that in the next 12 months.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o91"><a name="100203-0007.htm_para8"><a name="10020368000306">There has been no change to rule 2 grants since the start of the current spending review, in 2008-09. Police authorities have complete flexibility on how best to use that resource.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o92"><a name="100203-0007.htm_para9"><a name="10020368000307">Specifically on the settlement, we have also put in place absolutely committed funding for neighbourhood policing, as the foundation for local police in the 21st century. That is why, for 2010-11 we are maintaining and increasing the ring-fenced funding that helps to support those 16,000 police community support officers. I look forward to hearing the hon. Gentleman make a commitment to fund those 16,000 PCSOs next year, in the unlikely event of a change of Government, or at least supporting me from the Opposition Benches for the good that the Government are doing on that. PCSOs provide a valuable resource, delivering on the policing pledge commitments and raising public confidence. Neighbourhood policing is the key. That investment is making a difference and contributing to the crime falls that I mentioned. We will shortly produce a safe and confident neighbourhoods strategy, which will look at how we develop the policy still further. I look forward to giving the House details of that, I hope within the next month.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o93"><a name="100203-0007.htm_para10"><a name="10020368000308">As well as the policing of local communities, which is the bedrock of our activity, we also need to look at protective services and the collaboration programme, to ensure that we drive up and develop minimum standards across the board. We have made an additional £2.2 million available in the settlement today to help deliver regional capability in tackling regional crime, which is a serious issue and one that we need to address. We are keen to ensure that we aid the police in reducing crime and have designed programmes accordingly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o94"><a name="100203-0007.htm_para11"><a name="10020368000309">In today's announcement, we have also committed to the basic command unit fund and ensured that forces receive the same allocation in 2010-11-a total of £40 million-as previously. From my perspective, public confidence is at the heart of our agenda-public confidence on issues such as antisocial behaviour and crimes that matter locally, which are best dealt with by locally supported forces. That £40 million is extremely valuable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o95"><a name="100203-0007.htm_para12"><a name="10020368000310">In the document before the House, we have also confirmed the capital spending for supported capital expenditure for next year. Again, I say to the hon. Gentleman and others that we have committed a total of £220 million. That is money that we said we would allocate previously-we have committed to it and continued to support it. That has meant some difficult and challenging decisions, but, by making that commitment today, we have been able to support that capital expenditure firmly, which is good news for the police in dealing with the capital issues that they need to address.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o96"><a name="100203-0007.htm_para13"><a name="10020368000311">Almost finally, for Welsh police authorities, which are close to my heart as a Member of Parliament representing a Welsh constituency, we have set a minimum increase in the grant, in line with English authorities. We have again adjusted the Home Office police grant for Welsh police authorities, to maintain consistency with those in England. The additional support will total £16 million this year and will help to maintain police numbers and reduce crime.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o97"><a name="100203-0007.htm_para14"><a name="10020368000312">I should also like to report to the House that we asked for, and received, representations in our consultation on the settlement. However, I received only four sets of written representations about the settlement, from four police authority areas. That is fewer than in previous years and a little more than a quarter of the representations that were received last year. That indicates the level of support not just in the House, but in the community, for the proposals that I am putting before the House. Following those representations, we have laid the papers before the House, which in my view show a good settlement, which is something that we need to take into account.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o98"><a name="100203-0007.htm_para15"><a name="10020368000313">The pre-Budget report of December 2009 is also crucial to our consideration today. It has enhanced our immediate understanding of the future funding of the police, by announcing, through my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer, that sufficient funding will be made available to 2012-13 to enable police authorities to maintain the current numbers of warranted police officers, as well as police community support officers and other staff exercising police powers. Again, that is a commitment from this Government to real money, on the table, to fund real police officers out on the street, reducing crime still further.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o99"><a name="100203-0007.htm_para16"><a name="10020368000314">I do not wish to be too political-although we are in interesting times-but that is a commitment on the funding to date that was announced in the pre-Budget report. I hope that that commitment will be subject to debate, and I look forward to receiving the hon. Gentleman's support, because it sets the framework for the confidence that police authorities can have in knowing that the record numbers of police that we have provided will continue, should they wish them to.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o100"><a name="100203-0007.htm_para17"><a name="10020368000315">Next year we will also maximise the increase in the general grant, providing a further £2.5 million to ensure that all police authorities have received that minimum increase. Again, at a time of falling public spending and challenges, which normally increase in a recession, that is a good indicator of the extra resources that are being supplied, and that at a time of falling crime.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o101"><a name="100203-0007.htm_para18"><a name="10020368000316">My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government will speak later on the implications for local government spending of  <br>

police funding. However, there will also be debates and consideration about the capping action, decided in 2008-09, on Cheshire, Leicestershire and Warwickshire, in advance of the 2010-11 settlement, as a result of previous excessive increases set by those authorities. Cheshire and Leicestershire have accepted their caps, whereas Warwickshire will be debated as part of our discussions later today. However, despite those difficulties and challenges locally, there are genuine funding increases today that we should welcome.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o102"><a name="100203-0007.htm_para19"><a name="10020368000317">In summary, we have positive falls in crime, record numbers of police and a commitment next year to a minimum of 2.5 per cent. for each force. That is good news at a time of recession. We are seeking greater value for money from police authorities generally, and there will be a drive next year to look at issues that we raised in the White Paper and commented on yesterday, in producing our high-level group report on value for money. We need to drive better efficiency and value in the system. We need to ensure that we reduce police overtime and look at better procurement and the better deployment of officers. However, the resource is there, and this House can commit to it today. I hope that Members in all parts of the House will commit to it, because this Government have a proud record on policing and police numbers. I want that to continue next year, and I commend the motion to the House.</p>

 The one thing that we can agree on in this debate is that the police of this country do a difficult and usually very dangerous job. On behalf of the Opposition, I would like to pay tribute to their service. They need the resources to discharge their duties to the public in upholding law and order, which is why this debate is so important. This year's settlement is the final part of the three-year comprehensive spending review. Excluding additional grants for counter-terrorism and other specific grants, the police settlement will increase by 2.7 per cent. this year. Including specific grants, total revenue funding will also increase by 2.7 per cent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o103"><a name="100203-0007.htm_para20"><a name="10020368000319">It is worth flagging up a few issues that many outside this House, and not just police authorities, have with the distribution of the police grant. It is a complicated calculation, based, as we know, on five separate components, including the needs-based formula, or the "principal formula"; additional rule 1, which reduces grant provision for the South Wales police authority and redistributes it to other police authorities in Wales; and additional rule 2. In the past, the Home Secretary distributed specific grants such as the rural policing grant, the forensic grant and the initial police learning and development programme grant. The Home Office decision to amalgamate those grants into a single pot, so that police authorities could have more control over how those funds were used, was welcome. The Home Office also distributes specific grants for police authorities. Finally, the police grant floors are applied. I will return to that issue of scaling later.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o104"><a name="100203-0007.htm_para21"><a name="10020368000320">What we do know is that this year there are 20 police authorities in total receiving the lowest increase of 2.5 per cent., including Cheshire, Gloucestershire, Lincolnshire, Suffolk, Surrey and the Met. The biggest increase in the police grant is received by the West Midlands at 3.9 per cent.</p>

 Derbyshire police have far more police officers and PCSOs than when I was elected in 1997, but we have continually argued that we should move more quickly towards where Derbyshire police should be compared with other authorities.

 He may not have the chance for it to become part of his policy in a few weeks' time, so that might be why he is so confident in making that assertion. Unfortunately, the Government's decision not to hold a comprehensive spending review that would detail proposed expenditure over a three-year period underscores that fact that they have no confidence in their rather woolly guarantees made in the pre-Budget report and repeated by the Minister today.</p>

It would be fair to say that the figures on the amount of time police spend on the beat have fallen under this Administration. According to the Government's own latest figures, the amount of time a patrol officer spends on patrol has fallen from 19.1 per cent. in 2004-05 to an even lower 17.8 per cent. in 2007-08. Jan Berry, the Government's police bureaucracy tsar, when asked whether officers were spending more time on patrol now than two years ago said:</p>

 I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman. We had a discussion about one bit of good practice-the four pilots for lighter and more nimble recording practice. I remember that when we discussed it in July, I asked the right hon. Gentleman how many forces had adopted this pilot of slimline recording, which was happening in the west midlands, Staffordshire, Surrey and Leicestershire, but he did not know. He said that I had asked a good question, but I thought it notable that he, the Chairman of the Home Affairs Committee, was unaware of how far this practice had been rolled out and adopted. I am sure that the Minister would agree that there is a need for some direction from the centre on certain issues. This provides one tangible example of bureaucracy reduction that has not been driven forward and has not delivered the gains that it could have.

Why, however, has the Minister not used the powers in the Policing and Crime Act 2009, which gave the Home Secretary powers to mandate collaboration on areas of procurement-both information technology and non-IT procurement-that could yield efficiency savings? Powers to mandate have been available for a few months now, so can the Minister tell us whether he is contemplating use of any of these mandated powers to squeeze more efficiencies out of the system? If not, why not?

As I think I said from the Dispatch Box when I was a Minister, it cannot be right for the amount offered locally to the overall resource base of police forces to range from-I hope the House will forgive me for using old figures-some 18 per cent. in Northumbria to well over 55 per cent. in Surrey when the two areas are providing essentially the same service. It cannot be right that the precept at that time-again, I hope the House will forgive me for not using up-to-date figures-ranged from about £80 to the best part of £250 or £260 per head, or even more. Of course policing in Surrey is different from policing in Northumbria-if it were not, there would be a national police force-but such local vagaries should not obstruct the provision of a more universal and fairer system that is much more locally based in terms of contribution. I mean that in an entirely non-partisan sense.</p>

 My right hon. Friend is making an adult speech on a difficult subject. Will he bring within his compass the issues of how the precept is determined and the role of capping? One worry is that when a local community is consulted widely on what would seem an appropriate precept which has gained a good deal of assent, as has happened in Derbyshire, the Government nevertheless intervene and impose an artificial cap on the precept that may be levied. Would it not be reasonable to recognise some freedom in that respect as well?</p>

 I am sorry that I did not make myself clear to my hon. Friend. As I may have said more gently when I was Police Minister but will say more vocally now, I do not consider that capping figures at all, or should figure, in my little purview or compass. We are talking about a unique relationship: a potentially transactional relationship. To say "The police authority will do x with y increase in, for instance, capital or police numbers, and it will cost you, the public, y" is pure transactionalism, and need not involve capping.</p>

 I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman-who, if I may say so, was a very good Minister-for mentioning Surrey. As he will know, Surrey taxpayers contribute up to 50 per cent. of policing costs. That is a terribly high percentage, and capping caused those taxpayers a great deal of difficulty. Unless I misunderstood the right hon. Gentleman, he seemed to be showing some sympathy for Surrey.

 Of course the hon. Gentleman may say what he said about what I was like as a Minister.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o136"><a name="100203-0009.htm_para2"><a name="10020368000381">I am talking about where we need to go, rather than about the existing circumstances. To be fair to myself-if that is possible-I think that I said much of this from the Dispatch Box during the debate that was mentioned earlier. I believe that there needs to be a collective will and consensus.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o137"><a name="100203-0009.htm_para3"><a name="10020368000382">As I said earlier, there needs to be some seriousness in the debate about police grant and resources, and all the issues that surround that subject, if we are to do right by the public. Let me give an example that is relevant to resources. Back in 2005 we decided, rightly, that there were serious problems with the data relating to violent crime. We consulted widely on that, and a cross-party panel looked at the detail and arrived at some conclusions. The upshot was, in essence, that it was thought that the way in which violent crime data are assessed and collected should be changed so that, instead of having just the standard police definitions, the victim's own thoughts on the level of the violence of the crime were at least taken into account. We therefore changed those definitions, which I think was rather brave, although we could perhaps have gone further.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o138"><a name="100203-0009.htm_para4"><a name="10020368000383">As a result, all subsequent data on violent crime are substantively different, and that, of course, has implications for the measurement of the performance of police forces. It is, therefore, frankly not on for the boss of the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds-the hon. Member for Epsom and Ewell (Chris Grayling)-to compare the new violent crime figures with the old ones, and to do so in such a distorted and disingenuous fashion. I was going to say "mendacious", but I suspect that that word is on the list of non-parliamentary language. This airbrushing of statistics does the hon. Gentleman and his party no credit, and, more importantly, it serves to distract from the reality the Government were trying to get through to by changing the statistics in the first place.</p>

 Is my right hon. Friend aware that our chief constable in Derbyshire has in the past had to disavow newsletters put out by the Conservative party, because they included misleading crime statistics? Does my right hon. Friend also share my concern that the police feel that they are forced into such a position? They should not be put in such positions, because nobody should play around with crime statistics. Indeed, our chief constable has begged for games not be played with statistics.</p>

If the upshot of the changes was that we had somehow, through sleight of hand, hidden the extent of violent crime, I could understand the hon. Gentleman's point, but violent crime rose by 35 per cent. because of the adjustments, as-it is to be hoped-we were now measuring it in a far more accurate and victim-centred way.

 I was just beginning to warm to the right hon. Gentleman in his role as bipartisan statesman speaking for all of us when, in the past few minutes, he started to become over-partisan. To revert to the bipartisan tone, does he agree that the floors and ceilings mechanism is a very blunt instrument that fails to take into account-I am sure he will concede that it failed to do so when he was Police Minister, as well as now-specific issues such as population change, the recording of population numbers and, particularly in Cambridgeshire, tourism? We need to go back to square one in reviewing the funding formula, because not all of the 40-odd force areas can possibly be the same in key aspects such as urban population and rurality. I invite him to conclude that this Government have not looked at that pressing issue with the appropriate alacrity.</p>

 On the first part of that intervention, the hon. Gentleman misses the point entirely. I am not trying to be partisan. As I have said, the criteria for the figures were determined by a cross-party panel, and we deliberately changed the entire definition of violent crime. Given that there was broad agreement on that, it is incumbent upon all of us to use the new figures appropriately and not to compare them with the previous figures-and nor, frankly, to shroud-wave and scaremonger to the public in the disgraceful way that the hon.

When I was Police Minister, I clearly did not succeed in everything I did. If I had, the formula would not be quite as it currently is and more of the contribution would be local. Although, of course, we will never reach the stage when the entire police budget comes from local sources, because of the transactional nature of policing and police authorities, we have to move to a system beyond the current formula.</p>

Gentleman is also wrong on another point; the needs-based formula we have is far more responsive to the factors he mentioned than the system prior to 1997. I agree, however, with his broader point about the Government in general not responding to changes on the ground as quickly as they might-and that will not change if, heaven forbid, the colour of the Government changes-and about how that links in with various formulae allocations not being as they should be. That is in part because the creaky old Whitehall machinery is not responsive enough to the massive and almost instant changes that are happening in Peterborough and elsewhere; changes that used to take five or 10 years to happen fully now happen in three or six months.</p>

It is too tough. I cannot be bothered being chair of the Metropolitan Police Authority." He said in his manifesto, no less-<i> [Interruption.] </i>I would like Members to listen to this, and I apologise for being metro-centric, but that is just the way I am. <i> [Interruption.]</i> I said "metro-centric", not "metro" something else.

He can afford the time to do that, therefore. In the same week that he gave up the chairmanship of the MPA, he also said, "Think green, vote blue" and "I can't be bothered with the London waste authority either."

Mr. Johnson came into office? What is the difference between his quota of press officers and Ken Livingstone's? None; the number has not changed at all. Someone who does the counting right might be able to say that Mr. Johnson has saved 0.5 of a press officer post and that is it. We were told in fluid style during the campaign that he would cut the number of press officers and that that would fund four new rape crisis centres, which, as the police and everybody fully accept, are needed. Have they happened? No. We have one such centre-some might say that we have one and a half, but barely so-and by the end of his term two will be completed. Promises that were made barely two years ago have not been delivered, to the consequence of London. In this context, the only new money-additional money-that London will get this year is the 2.7 per cent. for the next two years that the Minister announced among other things today.</p>

 We could look and shed as much light as we want, but we would find that the answer is nothing, even if we throw in the Mayor's fund and all sorts of things. The crucial thing given London's unique structures-the unique structures that the police authority introduced in London and that Mr. Johnson took over two years ago-is that we were told that London was the crucible. Someone who wanted to see how a future Conservative Government would work in this country was told to look to London. People in London are doing so, which is why, irrespective of whether the count is done on Thursday night or Friday night, Conservative Members might wish to look with interest at how some of the London results go.</p>

He promised that he would spend more on the police, but for the first time since the inception of the Greater London authority, this year and next year the police budget will decrease. It would decrease by significantly more if it were not for the generosity of the Minister. The only two times that there have been cuts in the level of council tax for police services since the beginning of the GLA are the two years of Boris Johnson, and that is not good enough. He also said, as part of his anti-bureaucratic sway, that the Metropolitan Police Service was fat on reserves and that he would strip out the reserves to the bare minimum and spend the money on front-line policing or in other ways-I believe he cited 26,000 hand-held scanners in his manifesto. However, the MPS reserves, which are preciously needed given the way he is starving them, have increased, rather than otherwise. Again, that is to his shame. Why does that matter? It matters because in each of London's 32 boroughs policing is central to the welfare and security of each of our local communities.

 Because Boris Johnson is not; because crucially, Ken clearly said to the electorate during his four years, "I am increasing the police precept for London by x and here is what you are going to get for it in terms of safer neighbourhood teams." Boris has said to people-again this is typical flim-flam-that he is going to freeze the GLA precept, but he has told them nothing about the consequences of that, especially for the Metropolitan police. My right hon. Friend rightly points out that the only moneys that Harrow and elsewhere in London are getting that are new in any way, shape or form are coming from central Government and the settlement that we are discussing today, which the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds so blithely dismisses in the same way as he done for the past three and a half years-it could have been the same speech.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o148"><a name="100203-0009.htm_para14"><a name="10020368000403">This matters, especially in respect of capital, because my right hon. Friend is announcing significant millions more in capital for London. Boris intimated, at least when he was in campaign mode, that the new police station that Harrow needs, as opposed to what it has in south Harrow, will be built. That proposal has been scrapped. Any notion of significant growth in the capital spend for London has been scrapped, and that matters throughout London, because if the custody suites are not in the right place, more policemen and women are driving around London looking for somewhere to put the people that they have in the back of their cars. It matters, in terms of rolling out safer neighbourhood teams properly, that they have a base out in the communities, rather than in Fort Apache style police stations.</p>

This matters because when someone plays politics with police resources and policing policy, they play politics with people's lives in a way that is unforgivable. It is easy to get on a soap box and scare people. I say very clearly that Harrow is one of the safest boroughs in London, not least because of the investment that has been made during the past 10 to 13 years and because of what Ken Livingstone did as Mayor on rolling out safer neighbourhood teams.

In the 1980s and 1990s, the Conservatives in government slashed police numbers, and one of their defences was that beat police were old-fashioned and out of date, that they did not work, that they were ineffective, that they did not stop crime and that they did not catch criminals-so it did not matter that police numbers were being hit so drastically.</p>

They quickly came round to accept, however, that neighbourhood policing is one of the most effective forms of policing. Of course, we have the headline policing issues, such as terrorism, serious crime, bank robberies and so on, but, as the chief constable of Derbyshire-the one who has retired, not the one who is in office now-said some years ago, when he looked at the figures every year, of all the issues and complaints that people in Derbyshire raised, serious crime accounted for only a tiny percentage of them. In their day-to-day lives, people were complaining about, fearful and being bothered by the issues that are relatively low level-vandalism, antisocial behaviour, car theft, burglaries and local drug dealing-when compared with issues such as terrorism.</p>

 The Liberal Democrats have clearly said that we would divert money by abandoning particular Government programmes-identity cards have been a long-standing option.

The expansion of neighbourhood policing beat teams has been very effective. We should remember, however, that some of the glowing headlines that Ministers often tell us about are not the same all over the country.

force along with the receipt of money from the Government-this is a situation that we often hear boasted about-every local authority ward will have a neighbourhood team of six, made up of a combination of officers and police community support officers. That is very effective-I see it, living in London as I do for three or three and a half days a week when Parliament is in Session. However, that is not true in the bulk of the country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o160"><a name="100203-0010.htm_para8"><a name="10020368000418">Many hon. Members would make that point. For example, my hon. Friend the Member for Cheadle (Mark Hunter) has long campaigned on the fact that his area, Stockport, and Greater Manchester in general cannot remotely approach the levels of neighbourhood policing that we see in the London wards. My hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, West (Stephen Williams) has long campaigned on the fact that Bristol, compared with other comparable cities, has one of the lowest ratios of police officers for neighbourhood policing and for all kinds of policing. There are huge disparities. Exactly the same is true of Chesterfield and Derbyshire-those aspirations of six officers dedicated to a team for each local government ward are a pipe dream in many parts of the country. If that is the situation that we have reached at the peak of success and investment, what is going to happen as things start to get worse?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o161"><a name="100203-0010.htm_para9"><a name="10020368000419">Only two weeks ago, I was talking to the beat team in an area called Loundsley Green in my constituency. One of the police officers had been assigned to such things as the police response cars for 17 years and had now switched to beat policing and neighbourhood policing. He said that it was by far the most successful and rewarding part of police work in which he had ever taken part. Instead of rushing to one emergency and spending as little time as possible there before rushing off in the car to the next and then to the next, he was able to get to grips with local issues and to follow up local miscreants. He was able to get to know them, their parents and the people involved and to follow their cases up effectively over a period of time. He could really feel that he was making a huge difference to policing, community safety and community consciousness in that area.

That is the case for PCSOs, in general, but it also applies to all sorts of policing.</p>

the neighbourhood police fund-the fund that supports the 14,000 PCSOs-or whether they would un-ring-fence it? I meant to try to ask the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds (Mr. Ruffley) that-I believe that the Conservative line is that they will un-ring-fence that money, with all that means for neighbourhood policing.

 We would have to ask our gurus, such as my hon. Friend the Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable), about that specific point. In the long-term, following exactly the theme that the right hon. Member for Harrow, East (Mr. McNulty) was talking about earlier, we would look to transfer most of the control and funding of and fundraising through local precepts for policing to local communities. It would be their decision, along with duly elected police authorities, what to do with that, how to do that and what the priorities were. As was correctly pointed out by the right hon. Gentleman earlier, the policing requirements in an area of inner London can be very different from those in a rural area, a shire area, a small town such as Chesterfield and so on.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o164"><a name="100203-0010.htm_para12"><a name="10020368000424">If the special grant funded allocations were to be withdrawn in years to come, we would see a dramatic drop in police numbers, even though core funding was, on the face of it, being maintained. As the chief constable of Manchester has pointed out, one cannot rely, as people sometimes suggest, on special constables. They do a fantastic job-I have been out many times with special constables in Chesterfield-but, as the chief constable of Manchester pointed out, they are volunteers. Special constables cannot be ordered to be on duty on a certain day or evening at a certain time. They can be asked or persuaded and both they and their goodwill can be relied on, but they cannot be ordered. We cannot guarantee policing on that basis. They are a fantastic supplement to what the police do and what they provide, but they are no alternative and they are certainly not a free, cheap and easy alternative. We must consider how we will maintain numbers in the future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o165"><a name="100203-0010.htm_para13"><a name="10020368000425">One of the alarming factors underneath what looks like a relatively rosy picture is the fact that police numbers in forces around the country have been maintained through the use of dwindling reserves. That has certainly been true in Derbyshire. Derbyshire has features of its own that have been mentioned and to which I shall return, but over the past few years it has considerably run down its reserves in order to maintain and expand police numbers because of the lack of appropriate funding from central Government and because of the threat of council tax capping, which has stopped it using that option to fund police numbers. However, reserves can only be used for so long before they have gone. Quite a number of police forces tell us that they are approaching the point at which they will no longer be able to dip into reserves to plug those manning gaps. Again, we could be approaching the edge of a precipice if special grants disappear and reserves are running out. If we do not have the alternative that the right hon. Member for Harrow, East rightly discussed in considerable detail, and if we maintain the capping regime whereby the Government tell local authorities and, as in this case, police authorities, that they can increase their precept only by a specified amount, or not at all-there are suggestions that council tax might be entirely frozen  <br>

for a while in the future, which means that there will be cuts-where will the police and local communities turn to? Will police numbers and the services that the police provide simply drop dramatically?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o166"><a name="100203-0010.htm_para14"><a name="10020368000426">As a few hon. Members have already pointed out, surveys by MORI and other organisations have all come up with the same message-local people would be willing to pay 10 to 30 per cent more on their police precept if they could see a direct link between that money and local policing. A lengthy, in-depth consultation by Derbyshire police authority over two or three years reached a similar conclusion. People do not want that money to go to someone in London who will then hand it back out in grants that may or may not come back to Derbyshire, for example. They want it to go to their police authority to spend on policing the streets in their towns and villages, but the Government say that they will not allow that to happen and they have capped authorities. We heard about capping earlier. In Derbyshire, last year, there was not an outright cap but what happened was effectively the same. The Government said, "We are not going to cap you and make you re-bill, but we will reduce your grant by the amount that you raised by increasing the precept by more than we thought that you should." So, this year that police authority is faced with an effective cap, even though it has been given a different name.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o167"><a name="100203-0010.htm_para15"><a name="10020368000427">We are told that efficiency savings are the new solution. Back in the 1980s and 1990s, the Conservative Government used "efficiency savings" as a euphemism for the massive cuts that they imposed in most sectors, including policing and education, in which I worked. We must conclude that this Government's use of the same term will amount to much the same thing. Several points need to be made about that. First, if one says that there are large efficiency savings to be made in the way that our police authorities should be run in the next year or two, it implies that there is a lot of waste-a lot of fat or flab-in the system that could be removed, so that that money could be spent on proper policing. I cannot speak for other police forces, but I know that that is not true of the Derbyshire police, who have had to make as many efficiency savings as possible in the past few years because of Government underfunding. There are few efficiency gains left to be made in that force, so the idea that there is a lot of flab to be cut so that money can be recycled is a dangerous one, especially given that police authorities cumulatively have made £2 billion-worth of efficiency savings in the past 10 years. How much more can they do?</p>

 I take those points in part, but does the hon.

The efficiency savings that they are making are real, and that money is being transferred to the front line.</p>

 Yes, the authorities have made great steps forward in that regard. Some criticisms have been levelled about police forces not collaborating, but the Derbyshire police authority always says that that is not true of the east midlands forces, and points to what successful collaboration there has been. It is also looking at further collaboration, so there are things that can be done. However, if £2 billion-worth of cumulative efficiency savings have already been made across police authorities-  <br>

percentage-wise, the saving in Derbyshire will have been higher than in other areas because it has had to make savings as a result of being underfunded by £5 million a year-how much more flab can be cut? How many more resources can be redirected into front-line policing? Given that 88 per cent. of police budgets are staffing costs, a demand for more and more efficiency savings must mean much more civilianisation, which has already gone on apace. How much further can authorities go without taking real police off the streets? Alternatively, efficiency savings will mean a loss of uniformed officer numbers, so the phrase "efficiency savings" is a euphemism for cuts.</p>

 Will the hon. Gentleman take into account that it is estimated that in the east midlands we have lost £60 million in the past three years as a result of the damping arrangements and other such measures? That is the equivalent of 600 police officers.</p>

 Absolutely. In Derbyshire alone, the loss is equivalent to 160 police officers. If we add the losses across the east midlands, we arrive at the figure that the hon. Gentleman has just given. I will return to my slightly more parochial take on Derbyshire and the east midlands shortly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o168"><a name="100203-0010.htm_para16"><a name="10020368000432">I am interested in hearing the Minister's comments on a different issue that has partly been touched on today, which was also raised last year and the year before. Some police authorities are very badly hit by rapid population movements such as migration and changes due to migrant labour. For example, 1 million Poles-10 times the estimated number-came over, as did many people from other groups. Such movements can hit certain areas particularly badly in all sorts of ways, such as the requirement to fund the cost of using translators in courts and police stations. The Government have just had to admit, in the past few days, that those costs are much higher than they had previously stated in their answers to parliamentary questions. When this issue was raised in 2008, the then Minister with responsibility for policing, the hon. Member for Harrow, East-</p>

 Sorry. The right hon. Member for Harrow, East said that it was a very good point and that we should look into it. When the same issue was raised last year, the then Policing Minister-now the Minister for Schools and Learners, the hon. Member for Gedling (Mr. Coaker)-said exactly the same thing. I wonder whether the current Minister for Policing, Crime and Counter-Terrorism, the right hon. Member for Delyn (Mr. Hanson), will now, three years on, not only say that that is a good point and that we should look at it, but exactly what concrete action is being taken to address the matter. Police authorities cannot wait for five or 10 years for Government statistics to catch up. Education and health authorities have the same problem when there are rapid influxes and sometimes egresses of population, particularly of migrant workers, as with the large number of Poles.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o170"><a name="100203-0010.htm_para18"><a name="10020368000436">It talks about calculating the projected population for 2010 by using figures from the Registrar General that were published on 27 September 2007, whereas for Welsh authority areas, the projected total resident population has been estimated using Welsh figures. A big argument regarding local authorities and funding is the fact that projections are often based on figures from the previous census, the last of which was nine years ago in 2001. Is appendix A suggesting that the calculations for police grants are made using more up-to-date estimates, calculations or projections? How exactly are those figures arrived at, and are they more up to date than the projections used generally for local authority formulae calculations? If they are better and more up to date, that would be of great interest to old colleagues of mine who get involved in local government funding issues, which tend to be based on census figures.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o171"><a name="100203-0010.htm_para19"><a name="10020368000437">Let me discuss what is a slightly more parochial issue for me as a Derbyshire MP. We have already had one example about the east midlands receiving, because of formula funding, caps, floors and ceilings, the fourth-lowest level of Government funding for policing out of nine English regions. That is happened because of relatively low Government grants and the below-average base of council tax in relation to income. For example, there is a greater proportion of properties in the lower council tax band in the east midlands, so any council tax precept increase brings in much less than a similar increase in more affluent areas. In 2006, the Government said yes to the full implementation of the police grant formula in the east midlands. The figures were wrong and the F40 campaign was right after all those years. The formula was reworked, and the new formula, from 2006, said that the east midlands should have had an extra £19 million. Given that the east midlands police authorities collectively say that to meet the policing needs that they and the Government assess are required now, this year, they need an extra £22 million, that £19 million virtually closes the gap. There is a huge gap between what the police authorities say is required to meet policing needs in relation to risk, what the Government say that they should have in funding and what the Government will give them. In that regard, the Derbyshire force is losing £5 million a year, so, for the Government to say, "Yes, you need this money, but, no, you can't have it," seems outrageous. We have heard some eloquent comments on that issue from a former policing Minister, the right hon. Member for Harrow, East, but it is a shame that he could not implement those ideas two years ago, when he was in office. Derbyshire's underfunding of £5 million a year is equivalent to 160 officers and more than 200 PCSOs. Derbyshire has the lowest level of PCSO funding per head of population of all forces in the country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o172"><a name="100203-0010.htm_para20"><a name="10020368000438">Earlier, the hon. Member for Amber Valley (Judy Mallaber), who is not in her place any more, said that Derbyshire's police numbers had risen considerably in the time that she had been a Member of Parliament. However, in the five years between September 2004 and September 2009, in an area with one of the lowest numbers of police officers per head of population in the country, the rise in police numbers was exactly 29. That is not a great tribute to the Government's actions in redressing the unfair funding given to Derbyshire compared to similar police authorities.</p>

 I am happy to support a fellow east midlands Member of Parliament in asking for more. One of the features of debates like this is that right hon. and hon. Members on both sides of the House press the Police Minister for more resources for their area. In the end, we will all be judged, when we face the electorate, by whether we take the issue of crime seriously and whether we have used the resources that we have been given to deal with the causes of crime, and crime itself, in the five years since the last election.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o177"><a name="100203-0011.htm_para3"><a name="10020368000446">The Minister is probably fed up with my voice, as he was with the Select Committee on Home Affairs this morning as we concluded our inquiry into crime prevention. The former Prime Minister Tony Blair talked about the Government being tough on crime and tough on the causes of crime. The Minister came with the very good news that crime has fallen since he has been in his post, and that is obviously something to celebrate. The police budget has increased, as hon. Members on both sides of the House must accept. However, it is important to look at the causes of crime, and we hope to conclude our report on that subject before the general election is called.</p>

every police officer, meant that I was kept informed of everything that he said. I was waiting to see the Prime Minister to discuss the important issue of Yemen, and the Prime Minister's diary and commitments on Northern Ireland meant that the meeting kept getting put back. That is why I missed the start of the debate, for which I am sorry, although I was present to hear the Opposition spokesman, the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds (Mr. Ruffley), talk about the Conservative party's policy in this area.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o179"><a name="100203-0011.htm_para5"><a name="10020368000448">I thought that we could reach a consensus on police numbers, certainly after the Select Committee decided to conclude its unanimous report on police service strength. I see that two other members of the Committee-my hon. Friend the Member for Walsall, North (Mr. Winnick) and the hon. Member for South-West Devon (Mr. Streeter)-are in their places. We were being lobbied hard by police authorities and others: some said that they would have to cut numbers, while others said that they were happy with what they had been given. Some authorities said that they had not had enough funding over the past 12 years. The hon. Member for Chesterfield (Paul Holmes) reminded us that the east midlands had done worse than any other region, and asked us to look at that. We therefore decided to have a dispassionate look at numbers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o180"><a name="100203-0011.htm_para6"><a name="10020368000449">We published our report a couple of weeks ago, and the key facts are in it. We found that the Government were right to say that there had been a real-terms increase of 19 per cent. in central funding for the police since 1997-98, and that there had been an increase of 4.8 per cent. in the number of officers, and a rise of 15.5 per cent. in police support staff. However, we found that was a decline in the number of visible police officers in 13 of the 43 police authorities. Although we can agree that the amount of money being made available has gone up, the worry on both sides of the House has to do with what is going to happen in the future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o181"><a name="100203-0011.htm_para7"><a name="10020368000450">I obviously hope that the Labour party will take office after the general election, but it could be the Liberal Democrats or the Conservatives. Whichever party it is, though, it will face the difficulty that a declining amount of resources will be dedicated to the police service. One can wait for ages for a Police Minister to come along, but we have heard from two already today. It is possible that there are two future Police Ministers on the Opposition Benches. Because 88 per cent. of the police budget is to do with the work force, I and my Committee believe that every Police Minister will have to face the prospect of financial restraint.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o182"><a name="100203-0011.htm_para8"><a name="10020368000451">I hope that all hon. Members will read our report, because it suggests alternatives to cutting the budget. We looked at the involvement of the private sector, and we talked about how the public sector could be more efficient. We also raised the issue of voluntary mergers: although we do not say that they should be compulsory, we in the east midlands have already seen collaboration between the forces of Northamptonshire, Leicestershire, Lincolnshire, Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire. That is an option and a scenario that could be pursued.</p>

 My right hon. Friend is talking about other ways for police forces and authorities to raise revenue. Did his Committee look at the possibility of giving police authorities greater powers to raise the full cost of policing major events such as music festivals and large sporting fixtures?</p>

 Yes, we did. Although we did not specify music festivals in particular, that is one of the last recommendations in the report. We said that police authorities, with the assistance of local stakeholders, should be able to raise the money that they need if local people agree that that should happen.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o183"><a name="100203-0011.htm_para9"><a name="10020368000454">Of course we were worried about the cap, as Leicestershire is one the authorities that is to be capped. I was one of the all-party group of the county's MPs that went to ask Ministers not to cap Leicestershire, on the grounds that the county's police need the resources to deal with the work that has been put before them. We accept that funding has increased, because that is a fact, but Ministers have also posed new challenges to local police forces. The amount of legislation that has emerged from this House and the challenges facing local police officers mean that they have to spend more time doing what the Government ask.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o184"><a name="100203-0011.htm_para10"><a name="10020368000455">The current Police Minister was not in post when the Labour Government came to power. In fact, I cannot remember who the first one was, but the Government have been elected three times now and there will be things that the police were asked to do in 1997 that they are now being asked not to do any more. That is why we welcome the appointment of Jan Berry. We welcomed her report, but we want it to be implemented. What she says is not that much different from what Sir Ronnie Flanagan said in his report, or from what we said in our report "Policing in the 21st Century"-that is, that there should be less bureaucracy and more technology. We should cut red tape and make sure that police officers are on the front line and that they are visible.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o185"><a name="100203-0011.htm_para11"><a name="10020368000456">I raised with the Minister the case of Staffordshire, as I always do. I saw very good practice in Staffordshire- 24 pieces of paper reduced to one. I asked the previous Home Secretary whether that could be done all over the country. She said that the Government would look into it. I asked the current Home Secretary and the Police Minister. They said that the Staffordshire experience is being rolled out all over the country. It is a while since I was in government, so I am not quite sure what "rolled out" means. Does it mean that rolling out will take several weeks, months and years, or does it mean a Home Secretary telling police forces, "You will do this. We think this is a good idea because it saves money in Staffordshire, so you will save money in Lincolnshire or in Northamptonshire"?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o186"><a name="100203-0011.htm_para12"><a name="10020368000457">I know that the last time I raised the matter when the Minister was on the Front Bench he nodded and said that it was being rolled out in Staffordshire, so let us see when he replies how many police authorities have done what Staffordshire has done, rather than waiting for the great roll-out process, which I am sure is happening. It would be helpful for the House to have some facts.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o187"><a name="100203-0011.htm_para13"><a name="10020368000458">What I say to the Minister is yes, we need to look at innovative ideas. The hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds has, of course, had many debates and discussions with me and with the Committee on these matters, and the shadow Home Secretary gave evidence to the Committee this morning about what the Conservative party would do to try to cut crime in the future. What we say is that it is important that we do not get into a debate about the statistics, but that we look into the effect.</p>

changes in backroom staff, so long as a police officer turns up when they ring and ask for an officer to be present. They will forgive us a great deal if we continue to provide that basic service. If we do, they will understand that there must be changes in the way that the police do their business.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o189"><a name="100203-0011.htm_para15"><a name="10020368000460">I was as surprised as most when we read in the papers and heard on the radio that the overtime rates have shot up to such an extent that some police officers may be paid-I do not know whether this was mentioned before I came into the Chamber-£100 for answering one phone call on overtime. That is an enormous sum of public money. We do not know how many calls are answered. When I put that to the Minister this morning, he said that the Government needed to be robust in dealing with it. I said that we should have attached strings to the increase in police funding. We should have required police authorities to do more so that such stories did not emerge and so that we did not see a ballooning of overtime payments for the police.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o190"><a name="100203-0011.htm_para16"><a name="10020368000461">The Government are responsible for making sure that that happens. We cannot wait for local forces to achieve efficiency. There must be some direction from central Government because it is central Government funding. I hope that that will happen in the long run, under whichever Administration take office after the next election. We should be much clearer about how public money should be spent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o191"><a name="100203-0011.htm_para17"><a name="10020368000462">We suggested in our last report that we should spend money on new technology. All officers should be given a hand-held device so that they can take statements at the time of an incident. That would save time. They could use that instrument to find out whether a car had been stolen. That would save the time of witnesses and of the police. Perhaps the Minister will tell us whether that scheme has been rolled out. It is a no-brainer to make sure that our police are provided with sufficient equipment to enable them to do their job as efficiently as possible.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o192"><a name="100203-0011.htm_para18"><a name="10020368000463">My final point relates to accountability. The Select Committee has not considered the question of elected commissioners or police chiefs at a local level, as opposed to the current system. The Government wanted to ensure that members of the police committee were elected. They then withdrew that proposal. My concern is the way in which the current system is run. We may know, as elected representatives, but the public do not know, precisely who sits on police committees.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o193"><a name="100203-0011.htm_para19"><a name="10020368000464">In addition to local police forces acquiring greater visibility, police committees need to ensure that they are more visible, so that if people had complaints about policing, they would not necessarily have to make a complaint against the police. They could go to their local police authority member and ask them to take up their complaint. Police authority meetings would not then be seen as private meetings that are held in police headquarters. More information would be provided to the public. Perhaps by means of modern technology, such meetings could be televised by the police and put online so that people had access to what was being decided on their behalf.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o194"><a name="100203-0011.htm_para20"><a name="10020368000465">I am not sure that that would mean that we do not have elected police chiefs. That is a debate that we need to have.

public needs to be much more involved in the process than they can be by attending one or two local neighbourhood meetings. In any popularity contest, the local beat officer is infinitely more important and more popular than any other local official, apart from the local doctor. Of course, we are way down the list because we are elected officials and nobody likes Members of Parliament, do they? Local councillors are probably one rung ahead of us.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o195"><a name="100203-0011.htm_para21"><a name="10020368000466">That local popularity must be translated into an understanding of how the local police force works. I hope very much that we will engage in a discussion that will allow more information to go to local people, so that they feel better informed and know that their money is well spent. We will never have the opportunity again, in my view, when people will not require value for money from local police forces.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o196"><a name="100203-0011.htm_para22"><a name="10020368000467">It is a terrible state of affairs that special measures may be introduced for forces such as the Nottinghamshire force. We have had to wait so long for action to be taken. I know that the Minister told us today that these were matters for the inspectorate, but the inspectorate should have acted sooner. Why was it allowed to reach a stage where a police authority with a multimillion pound budget and chief officers who are paid hundreds of thousands of pounds are assisted to do their job? That cannot be right.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o197"><a name="100203-0011.htm_para23"><a name="10020368000468">There must be a better system of monitoring our local police forces at a local and national level, through the inspectorate. Whether it is through the National Policing Improvement Agency or by Denis O'Connor, someone must do their work better so that council tax payers and citizens, like those of Nottinghamshire, do not have to see their local police force being taken over because it has not been properly run. We want to make sure that that is the only case of its kind, and that we act before we get to that stage.</p>

 I hope to say a few words about the county of Surrey, and I very much hope that the Policing Minister will at the end of the debate acknowledge not only that Surrey has a very good police force, but that our county has particular problems. I am quite certain that my hon. Friend the Member for Bury St. Edmunds (Mr. Ruffley), who will be the next Policing Minister, will take a similar line.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o198"><a name="100203-0011.htm_para24"><a name="10020374000003">We have a very good police force in Surrey. It is well led by chief constable Mark Rowley, and the British crime survey assessed that it was the absolute top force in the country in terms of public confidence in the police and local councils' joint work to deal with antisocial behaviour. In Surrey, not least because of financial constraints, we are focusing very hard on local expectations rather than on national targets.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o199"><a name="100203-0011.htm_para25"><a name="10020374000004">We perform well with a low level of funding. So far, so good, but funding has always been a problem for Surrey. I do not expect any Government Front Bencher to talk as positively as I shall about extra funding for Surrey police, but we are in a bad way. A lot of funding comes from a central Government grant, and some comes from the county council precept, but Surrey has historically received one of the lowest per capita levels of central Government funding of any police force in the country. For example, Government funding for  <br>

Surrey police in 1996 was £96 per head of population. By 2009-10, it had dropped to £93, which is £57 below the national level. That is not a happy state of affairs, and the formula that the Government use to allocate funding to forces does not reflect the real cost of policing our county.</p>

<p><a name="st_o223"><a name="10020374000005"><a name="100203-0011.htm_spnew4"><a name="10020374000189"><b>Mr. Hanson:</b>
 I am grateful for those figures from the hon. Gentleman, but they do not equate with my understanding, which is that Government grants to Surrey increased by £48.4 million, or 23 per cent. in real terms, between 1997 and 2009-10.</p>

 That drags us into the issue of the formula, which is mind-bogglingly complicated. I shall address that in a minute. If we work out our population and the application of the formula over those many years, we are left with the figure that I gave the House a moment ago.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o200"><a name="100203-0011.htm_para26"><a name="10020374000007">Surrey has rather different problems from those of any other county. We are the best away-day county for criminals. I do not say that all criminals come from somewhere other than Surrey, but the M25 has certainly helped them. When my house in Surrey was burgled seven years ago, I was sure that an hour and a half later the burglars were somewhere north of London. I do not know why I think that all burglars come from north, as opposed to south, London. What a bias I show! I do not mean that at all; I withdraw it. However, the reality is that the motorway has helped considerably. Being serious, I think that 50 per cent. of crimes in our county are committed by cross-border criminals from neighbouring areas. That aspect of life in Surrey is not accounted for in the funding formula. We have extra, different problems and responsibilities in Surrey, and they are not reflected in the formula, although I hope that they might be in the future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o201"><a name="100203-0011.htm_para27"><a name="10020374000008">At this point, I address my remarks particularly to my hon. Friend on the Opposition Front Bench. The M25, for example, has extra policing requirements, and we also have to help with Gatwick and Heathrow, which are both massive airports. Then there is the odd, one-off case, of which Surrey seems to have rather too many. They are the one-off cases in which there is an extra bill for Surrey council tax payers, who fund the police precept. A typical example was the General Pinochet situation, when we had to look after him in Surrey for years and years but got no extra money for doing so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o202"><a name="100203-0011.htm_para28"><a name="10020374000009">There is another little issue, which I discussed with the chief constable not long ago: terrorism. One thinks of Surrey as a county with leafy lanes; one would not somehow associate it with terrorism. But in Surrey there are potential cells-put it that way-of people who do not mean well, and I know that the burden of expense on the police force has been increasing. Trying to explain that Surrey faced extra burdens in that connection, I raised that issue, and some time ago so did my noble Friend Lord Trefgarne. He did so in the other place with the noble Lord West, who answered on behalf of the Government. As I have said, Surrey does very well with a low grant.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o203"><a name="100203-0011.htm_para29"><a name="10020374000010">It was sad when our policing grant was capped, however. It was a terrible business when the decision was announced.

cost of £1.2 million. It is ludicrous to spend £1.2 million to send back £1.6 million, and it was an indefensible decision. When we set that against the chronic shortfall in central Government funding, in particular, we find that it was a sad state of affairs.</p>

Wait for it, Madam Deputy Speaker-it is incomprehensible.

Well, there are some very interesting new ideas as regards what is happening in Surrey. There are to be cuts in the number of senior officers, and cuts in bureaucracy. The chief constable, Mark Rowley, is exploring, with local councils, opportunities to locate local policing teams within borough and district council offices to provide a better service to the public in tackling local problems. That approach has been piloted in my own constituency of Woking. I wondered about it to start with, but then I thought after a while that it is not a bad idea. People can pop into the council offices, and the police are there. They sometimes want to have a chat about various issues, and they do not have to go miles from one place to another. Then I thought of one or two clapped-out police stations in Surrey, and realised that it is no bad thing if the police can move around a bit and, in the meantime, save a bit of money that they can use for front-line policing.

There may come a time when I send a note to my colleagues saying what it really means, but I think that the Minister is absolutely right-it means "We need more money, please." One day, surely, the formula must be revisited a little bit; we should recognise that it can operate somewhat unfairly against an extremely good county such as Surrey.</p>

 It is a great pleasure and privilege to follow my hon. Friend the Member for Woking (Mr. Malins). The House will miss his witty interventions when he retires-ridiculously early, if I may say so-at the next general election.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o209"><a name="100203-0012.htm_para3"><a name="10020374000019">In this short debate, we are considering the police support grant for 2010-11. However, the elephant in the room is what happens in April 2011 for 2011-12 and onwards.</p>

Member for Leicester, East (Keith Vaz), the Chairman of the Home Affairs Committee, has come back into the Chamber. I know that he is going to stay throughout the entirety of my speech, so he may wish to take his place. I agree with him that much of the evidence that we have heard over recent weeks and months suggests that from April 2011 onwards, there will certainly be a tightening of the position. Many chief constables and police authorities around the country are concerned about that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o211"><a name="100203-0012.htm_para5"><a name="10020374000021">It seems to me that whoever wins the election, from April 2011 there will be a tightening of budgets. The key challenge is protecting front-line policing when budgets will be under constant pressure, probably for three to five years. Obviously, that will partly depend on individual police officers being able to improve how they deliver services, through some of the ideas that have come forward this afternoon, and it will partly be about saving costs elsewhere in the system in a way that does not have an impact on front-line policing. I wish to suggest one possible way of doing that, using my own police authority-Devon and Cornwall-as an example.</p>

Day in, day out, they do an excellent job, and all credit to them. I obviously welcome the uplift in the amount of money that Devon and Cornwall will receive over the next 12 months-an additional £5.746 million, making a total grant from the Government of £117 million, which is very welcome. The police authority's total spend in the 12 months to March 2009 was £295 million, which shows that a lot of its income is received apart from Government, but we welcome any increases in Government funding.</p>

through the Devon and Cornwall police accounts for the year to 31 March 2009. I was interested to note that it cost £1.4 million to run the police authority-not the police force but the bureaucracy and administration necessary to support it. If we are successful in winning the next election-let us face it, it is by no means in the bag and it will be a very close contest-our innovative and radical plan of electing police commissioners will cut most of that cost at a stroke. As a country we are short of radical ideas for police forces, but that would mean that we would not need so much bureaucracy, so that £1.4 million could mainly be diverted towards police officers.</p>

 Indeed, and that is much the same as the Prime Minister. I do not know what other Members think, but I find it hard to understand how people in the public sector doing lesser jobs than the Prime Minister can justify salaries of that magnitude. When the Prime Minister goes to bed at night he is concerned about Northern Ireland, the situation in the middle east, Afghanistan and all the pressures that he is under. It is not quite the same to grapple with crime on Union street in Plymouth, serious and important though that is. I am not saying that the chief constable's salary is too much, but I wonder whether many people in my constituency are aware of how much he earns. Perhaps they will be from tomorrow onwards.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o215"><a name="100203-0012.htm_para9"><a name="10020374000027">There are five police officers in Devon and Cornwall who earn more than £100,000. I did not know that until last night, and I do not think many of my constituents do. In the great wider debate about public sector salaries at senior level, it is important that our constituents have the information on which to make their judgment. I certainly agree with those who say that no one in the public sector should earn more than the Prime Minister in the years ahead.</p>

When that was being discussed five or six years ago by the then Home Secretary, the right hon. Member for Norwich, South (Mr. Clarke), whose views we now agree with daily-he has some great insights into the workings of this Government-I completely opposed the suggestion that Devon and Cornwall police should merge with other authorities. However, as I have said in the Home Affairs Committee and to wider audiences, I was completely wrong on that. The Government were wrong to force such mergers from a top-down position, and we have probably arrived at a much more balanced situation today.

Answering a question from me about the possibility of her force merging with the Hertfordshire police force, she gave me this information:</p>
<a name="100203-0012.htm_brev2"><a name="10020374000169"><ul><p class="tabletext">"Since 2006 the Chief Constable of Hertfordshire and myself have been working with our authorities on a collaboration programme. We have collaborated to the extent that we have joint units of more than 500 police officers and staff and that has saved us £2.2 million year-on-year. Our estimates-in fact they are more than estimates because we have worked very hard on the business case-are-first of all, the bad news-that it will cost us £20 million to make the merger happen, but within three years we would be gaining savings of £14.6 million per annum."</p>

If Devon and Cornwall police merged with Dorset police, the new force would need only one chief constable-thereby saving a very significant salary-fewer senior officers and only one headquarters. I imagine that one force could get away with far fewer accountants in the police authority and, presumably, one force would need the same number of press and marketing people as two-they would just need to cover a slightly wider territory. Money would be saved on back-office costs, administration, and human resources and personnel. Such savings could add up to many millions of pounds. The Devon and Somerset fire services recently merged. There were quite a few wobbles and concerns about that to begin with, but things settled down extremely well, and it has been able to save significant sums in back-office functions. Police forces could do the same.</p>

I must confess-this is shocking admission-that I did not know the name of the chair of Devon and Cornwall police authority until I looked it up this morning on the internet. The chair recently changed, so that was not completely hopeless on my part, but I did not know the name and I am supposed to be an informed elected representative of that area. If I asked my constituents how many of them could name the chair of the Devon and Cornwall police authority, I suspect the answer would be three or four. That is the reality: there is no connection between the authority and the people of Devon and Cornwall.</p>

Members of Parliament and councillors have regular meetings with him and he is a very impressive officer-and a tremendous relationship at ward level, with inspectors, sergeants and constables on the beat. That is how most communities relate to their police. They relate to their beat constable, and they might go to meetings to which an inspector or sergeant might go. The relationship is not with the police authority or with the headquarters at Middlemoor in Exeter; it is much closer. Therefore, adding Dorset to Devon and Cornwall police, or even going a step further to incorporate Avon and Somerset within the same police area, would not diminish accountability on the ground, because accountability happens in a very different way. It is wrong, of course, to do things just for financial reasons, but I see little or no downside to a bottom-up rationalisation of police forces-not top-down pressure from the Government in which they would define the values of mergers-that could save millions of pounds. Such a rationalisation would help whoever wins the next election to bridge the gap and keep police officers on the front line. I encourage chief constables to speed up discussions with neighbouring authorities and consider voluntary mergers.</p>

We have an increasing number of intrusions into my constituency, and one reason why they are so expensive to police is the system for dealing with them. In almost every case, the local authority must serve a notice, which means consulting lawyers and putting legal papers in order, and that is expensive. Then the authority must wait for the notice to expire, during which time the police are in attendance in most cases-costing money-but they are not free to act. The legislation needs to be looked at again-</p>

 I agree strongly with my hon. Friend, and the House needs to look at this issue again. We need to modernise and streamline the law, because it is an expensive problem that causes great irritation in the local community. At the very least, the police should have the power to move Travellers on without waiting for the local authority process to take place. I do not quite understand why that is not the law, although I am sure that it is for good reasons. The Minister may not want to touch on this when he winds up, as it is slightly outside the scope of this order, but it is a costly business and very frustrating for local councils and our constituents.</p>

We do not see policing in Peterborough through his rose-tinted glasses, and it ill-behoves him to lecture and challenge us on our fiscal policies given that his Government have presided over an appalling deterioration of public finances and have been unwilling, or unable, to come forward with a comprehensive spending review for the next period. All the Government's prognostications, pledges and promises are therefore worthless. They certainly care, but they cannot possibly know what situation will prevail beyond 2011.</p>

The floors and ceilings system must be looked at again, because although we received a slightly more than average increase this year, cumulatively under the damping mechanism we have lost £2.7 million.

Close on 20,000 EU migrants-mainly Lithuanians, but also Latvians and Poles-have come to Peterborough in the past six years, and inevitably that has demonstrably put a strain not only on primary education, primary care and housing, but on crime and policing.

The issue is the large numbers. The right hon.

Indeed, the projected cost of translation and interpretation in this financial year is £865,000. The cost of using the interpretation service offered by Language Line Services Ltd runs at approximately £7,300 a month, while 22 per cent. of those using it are Lithuanian, 19 per cent. are Polish and 12 per cent. are Russian, with a significant number-two dozen-of various other languages used.</p>

Indeed, some in my constituency have said that over the past year we have witnessed, on the latest figures, an epidemic of acquisitive crime. Burglaries are up by 20 per cent. and robberies are up by 37.5 per cent. since 2008, notwithstanding the excellent work of Cambridgeshire constabulary, in particular through Operation Alert.

We need to look again at sentencing policies, the role of the judiciary and the message that they send out to victims and criminals and those who would be tempted to commit crime. I mentioned in passing last week one of many examples, I am afraid, from Peterborough Crown court: the case of Lee and Carl Edwards, two brothers in my constituency, who were convicted on 135 counts of burglary between them. The judge at the trial, deputy circuit judge John Farnworth, considered it appropriate to jail them for 30 months and 51 weeks. The message that sends to my constituents-decent, hard-working people who get up in the morning, take their children to school, look smart, take pride in themselves, go to work and earn a decent wage-is that the judicial system does not care about them; it looks after people with so-called chaotic lives, at the so-called fringes of society, and it is more interested in them than hard-working people. That has to be a factor not just in the number of police, but in the way in which the judicial system works. The feeling that some people have is that the system works to the advantage of the criminals, not the victims.</p>

 Order. I must rule the hon. Lady out of order because we are talking not about sentencing policy, but about the grant that police authorities have.</p>

 I am grateful for your guidance, Madam Deputy Speaker, but I concur heartily with my hon. Friend.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o240"><a name="100203-0013.htm_para4"><a name="10020374000060">May I finish on some of the points made by my hon. Friends? I totally agree with the views expressed by my hon. Friend the Member for South-West Devon. The problem with the mooted 2006 mergers was that they were top-down and forced; there was little public consultation and little opportunity to debate properly the issues surrounding the specific challenges and problems of each force. The then Home Secretary understood that. There is ample evidence that, on payroll, human resources, procurement and premises, local police forces can and will work together. My hon. Friend is right about Devon and Somerset fire service, which is accruing significant savings as a result of that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o241"><a name="100203-0013.htm_para5"><a name="10020374000061">There is a huge deficit in accountability because many senior police officers are accountable to no one but the Home Secretary in practice. They must be accountable within strict parameters and a framework that we all buy into and understand and that has legitimacy in the House and beyond to local people, with their local priorities. We should never be in a situation where the operational decisions of the police are in the hands of politicians, who may use them for electoral advantage. I do not agree with that, and that is not the case in most places in the world. However, we need that golden thread between ordinary people on the street and their experience of crime and policing, and the people who make the decisions in central Government and at local level in the constabulary. For that reason, I heartily support the call by hon. Members and hon. Friends for elected police commissioners. That will restore people's faith and trust in the criminal justice system. It will mean that people have a real input into the decisions that are made about their local communities and tackling crime. Most people are law-abiding and decent, but they want fairness, accountability and transparency.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o242"><a name="100203-0013.htm_para6"><a name="10020374000062">With that, I hope that the Minister specifically addresses the issues that I have raised about the Cambridgeshire constabulary. I pay tribute to all the people who work in the police service in Cambridgeshire, and I hope that we get a better settlement when we have a Conservative Government in the next few weeks.</p>

from my hon. Friend the Member for Woking (Mr. Malins), who is no longer in his place, about the total lack of ability to understand formula funding and its detail. I hope that the Minister will be able to promise us a total review of funding to ensure that when the new funding formula is introduced, it will be understandable at least to those who have to read these documents and try to make sense of them, but who, as my hon. Friend said, so far fail to do so on every occasion. I do not want to test the Minister on his knowledge of understanding of the formula. [Hon. Members: "Go on."] It would be cruel to do so. There is a real need, however, to create a greater understanding for all of us.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o244"><a name="100203-0013.htm_para8"><a name="10020374000065">There is also a real need to create fairer formulae. I know that my own county constabulary-as I shall explain in a little more detail later, it has missed out badly as a result of formula funding and experienced considerable difficulties with financing-has worked tremendously hard and wants to communicate that fact to the people it serves. A police survey is currently under way, which simply asks, "I would be prepared to pay more council tax for a higher level of service. Yes or No?" I do not know what the result will be, but it shows that there is real concern about police funding. I know that my county constabulary is most concerned about formula funding.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o245"><a name="100203-0013.htm_para9"><a name="10020374000066">I welcomed the remarks of the former police Minister, the right hon. Member for Harrow, East (Mr. McNulty), who is no longer in his place. He spoke thoughtfully on the basis of his long experience, but he made the same point that I am making to the Minister at this very moment-the formulae used for funding are so open to total incomprehension that they must be reformed. That from an ex-Minister. I know that the present Minister has a number of very clever civil servants supporting him-they are sitting in this Chamber at this moment-and I hope that they will understand the depth of feeling among us on this issue, because we need everybody to get behind this. If we manage to make the changes we want, it is they who will have to do the work, and I wish them very well.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o246"><a name="100203-0013.htm_para10"><a name="10020374000067">I have had a number of discussions with my own constabulary, the last this morning, about the particular issues affecting it. The damping arrangements are a particular problem. Damping is supposed to subsidise forces with the least relative need by taking grants from those forces with the greatest relative need in order to ensure that they receive a minimum year-on-year increase rather than a cut. That is my basic understanding of damping as a formula.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o247"><a name="100203-0013.htm_para11"><a name="10020374000068">Tragically, damping is not working-certainly not in Northamptonshire. My police authority and county constabulary believe that they suffer from a particularly unfair example of formula funding. Northamptonshire police estimate that they will lose £853,000 of formula grant next year as a result of damping. Indeed, they tell me that they have lost £1,844,000 of formula grant over the last three years because of this particular process. As the Minister will know, that is a great deal of money to Northamptonshire police. In fact, it equates to 20 extra officers in the county each year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o248"><a name="100203-0013.htm_para12"><a name="10020374000069">I have already observed that the east midlands region seems to be particularly damaged by this element of formula funding. It is estimated that over the last three years the region has lost £60 million of formula grant  <br>

that it believes should have come its way. As I pointed out in an intervention, that equates to an additional 600 officers each year. I was pleased to hear the hon. Member for Chesterfield (Paul Holmes) make the same point earlier.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o249"><a name="100203-0013.htm_para13"><a name="10020374000070">Northamptonshire county constabulary are particularly bewildered by the results of damping as it affects Northumbria police, who are the biggest gainers in this respect. They receive £36 million of subsidy per annum, which allows the local authority to freeze the council tax. How my own police authority would like to be in the same position, but it is not. It is especially unfair that, owing to the cumulative effect of damping over a number of years, Northamptonshire police are consistently being denied the level of grant that they require according to the needs formula itself. That seems to me like Alice in Wonderland.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o250"><a name="100203-0013.htm_para14"><a name="10020374000071">If there was ever a need for change, this is it. I should like someone to look in the mirror, decide that change is needed, and tell us that it is going to happen. I hope that the Minister, who has been fair and courteous throughout the debate, will be able to promise to review the formula funding process.</p>

If the Minister makes that promise today, I shall be able to go back to Northamptonshire and tell the county constabulary, who will be immensely happy. The Minister can see how easy it is to make our policemen happy, and I hope he will try to do that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o251"><a name="100203-0013.htm_para15"><a name="10020374000074">There are other reasons why I believe that the funding formula should be changed. As my hon. Friend the Member for Woking pointed out in his amusing speech, we need only look at the book to see how complicated it is, but no formula is any good if the basic input figures are wrong. This formula uses national statistics, and, unbelievably, the Office for National Statistics concluded that Northampton would experience no population growth between 2000 and 2008.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o252"><a name="100203-0013.htm_para16"><a name="10020374000075">I am sorry, but Northampton represents part of the Government's major expansion plan. I am sure that the Minister has been to my town and has seen the thousands upon thousands of new houses. I do not know who lives in them. I know some of my constituents but not the whole lot, and many are relative newcomers. Unless people in Northamptonshire are dying at an incredible rate there must have been an increase in population, but those are the figures that were used for the funding formula. No wonder we consider them to be totally discredited.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o253"><a name="100203-0013.htm_para17"><a name="10020374000076">My good and hon. Friend the Member for Peterborough (Mr. Jackson) mentioned immigration. As in Peterborough, so in Northampton. We have seen a massive influx of mostly very good people-mainly from eastern Europe-but some of them are not so good, and they place put a sizeable additional strain on our police force. The formula is not nimble and quick-footed enough to be able to take that increase into account. Therefore, Northamptonshire misses out again, especially bearing in mind that the county town accounts for about a third of our population.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o254"><a name="100203-0013.htm_para18"><a name="10020374000077">All specific grants, excluding the neighbourhood policing fund, have been frozen for six years. That means there will be a real-terms cut for Northamptonshire police. Indeed, Northamptonshire's capital grant from Government is frozen at £1.379 million. Specific grants are used to fund activities such as rural policing, and rural policing is especially expensive. I know from all my correspondence and conversations with people from the rural area that I myself live in, which is just outside Northampton, how strongly the local rural population feels that it is not getting a good deal from the police service. The people there rarely see a policeman. It is true that Northamptonshire police have tried very hard to lift the profile of policing in rural areas, but the fact of the matter is that the local population still feels it is being hard done by, and I would put money on that also being the case in constituencies across the land with rural areas.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o255"><a name="100203-0013.htm_para19"><a name="10020374000078">I ask the Minister to look at this issue as a matter of urgency.

I simply ask that when he rises to his feet, he looks at me and smiles sweetly, and says how much he agrees with the hon. Member for Northampton, South and that he will ensure that the change to the formula funding is undertaken and that that will create an easier to understand and fairer situation for constituencies such as mine and counties such as Northamptonshire-and I hope my Front-Bench spokesman, the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds (Mr. Ruffley) does the same thing.</p>

 With the leave of the House, I would like to respond to the debate. It has been very interesting, and there have been some common themes-and there has also been occasion to smile, just for the hon. Member for Northampton, South (Mr. Binley). The main common theme is a point I mentioned at the beginning of the debate: every Member who has spoken represents an area whose police force has more officers now than 12 years ago. The local force of the hon. Member for Peterborough (Mr. Jackson) in Cambridgeshire, for instance, has 109 more officers than 13 years ago. The police forces covering the constituencies of every Member who has spoken today also have more resources than in 1997 in real terms, including, dare I say it, my own force in north Wales, which has £45 million more than in 1997 in real terms. Every force of every Member who has spoken today has lower crime rates than in 1997, too. Overall, the rate is 36 per cent. lower than in 1997. Therefore, whatever points Members have made in this debate, the background to it is that we are still working from a very strong base in terms of the resources, crime figures and police numbers in their constituencies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o256"><a name="100203-0013.htm_para20"><a name="10020374000080">Under the police settlement for 2010-11, next year there will be about £259 million more for policing across England and Wales than this year. That means that every force of every Member who has spoken in the debate will get a minimum increase of 2.5 per cent. The average increase across the board will be 2.7 per cent., with a high of 3.5 per cent. in the case of Avon and Somerset. That is extra resources at a time of recession with a commitment from Government to meet those resources, and along with that there is falling crime, higher police numbers and more resources in general.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o257"><a name="100203-0013.htm_para21"><a name="10020374000081">I accept that there are some issues, however. The hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds (Mr. Ruffley), my right  <br>

hon. Friends the Members for Harrow, East (Mr. McNulty) and for Leicester, East (Keith Vaz), and the hon. Members for Woking (Mr. Malins), for Peterborough (Mr. Jackson) and for Chesterfield (Paul Holmes) all said that they have concerns about the funding formula. I can also, at last, smile sweetly at the hon. Member for Northampton, South, because he has raised that issue in a way that can only charm me into responding to him in a positive way. I must tell all those Members that we keep the funding formula under review. I recognise that, as the hon. Members for Woking and for Peterborough mentioned said, there are pressures from population factors, tourism and a range of other issues; in Wales-in my part of the world-Cardiff city council and the South Wales police force are raising issues relating to sporting events.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o258"><a name="100203-0013.htm_para22"><a name="10020374000082">We are undertaking a review of the funding formula. It was started in September 2008 and is due to conclude shortly. I would like to announce a public consultation period over the summer of 2010, after-I hope-I have been re-elected to this office in the general election. The points that colleagues have made should be passed on to me and my officials, because we need to examine the issues as part of the public consultation. We have given a commitment to examine the funding formula for the next comprehensive spending review. We did not want to carry out that examination in the middle of the current three-year cycle, because there will be winners and losers in any potential change.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o259"><a name="100203-0013.htm_para23"><a name="10020374000083">There is a genuine wish-the hon.

As hon. Members will know, we have removed the ceilings-floors still exist and we intend to remove those. The time frame has not yet been determined, but we will seek to remove them when we can. We need to ensure financial stability.</p>

The formula does still use the most up-to-date population data possible as part of our assessment for the future. When I see the evidence before me, I can do no other than accept that there are disparities in the funding agreements because of the formula; the range is from 36 per cent. in Northumbria to minus 4 per cent. in Essex, and we are examining those wide variations. But I still contend that the formula  <br>

<p><a name="stpa_o261"><a name="100203-0013.htm_para25"><a name="10020374000087">The hon. Members for South-West Devon (Mr. Streeter) and for Bury St. Edmunds raised the valid point about funding post-April 2011. They will both know that I cannot commit on the broadest Home Office funding issues at the moment, because we do not have a CSR. In answer to the point made by the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds, I should say that the Chancellor has made a commitment to ensure that forces can maintain their officers numbers, be they police community support officers or full warranted officers. The forces will receive sufficient funding to maintain whatever officer numbers they wish to maintain, based on the current levels for April 2011. The priorities for this Government have been education, health and police numbers. All Departments will face challenges as a result of the funding settlement, but those commitments have been given to date.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o262"><a name="100203-0013.htm_para26"><a name="10020374000088">It is important-these are my final two points in response to those that were raised-that we get better efficiency from the system. We talked about that this morning in the Home Affairs Select Committee and we have mentioned it in the debate today-it was mentioned by the hon. Member for Chesterfield and my right hon. Friend the Member for Leicester, East. I refer hon. Members to the high-level working group report that we published yesterday, which aims to get £540 million of efficiencies out of the system within the next three years-I have made a commitment that the police can keep those efficiency savings to put into front-line services. Those efficiencies are being sought through better procurement, for example. I think that it is madness that we have 43 individual forces buying body armour. It is madness that we have 43 forces buying vehicles, having air support, looking at forensics or getting IT. It is not a cut to combine those elements into one contract to get the best value out of the buying power-it is an efficiency that releases money that we can put into other services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o263"><a name="100203-0013.htm_para27"><a name="10020374000089">Similarly, the hon. Member for South-West Devon mentioned back-office services. There are co-operations and collaborations that we can do and we have considered mandating some of them to get value out of the system. We can, particularly in smaller forces, get better use of personnel, HR and a range of other matters by having that back-office support without having formal mergers.</p>

money on overtime and with better deployment, use of special constables and some scrutiny of overtime we can save money and can, I hope, save £70 million.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o265"><a name="100203-0014.htm_para1"><a name="10020374000091">I am conscious of the time, so my final two points relate to voluntary mergers. We have made it very clear that, following the difficulties of the merger debate several years ago, the White Paper published before Christmas set a framework for voluntary mergers. The people involved can merge if they want to and they will have the support to do so, but they will need the support of the chief constable, the authority and, ultimately, the public who they serve. To help that process, we have put in place a £500,000 fund up front to help with some of the costs of preparing for mergers. That is available to be drawn down and applied for now and will be until April of this year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o266"><a name="100203-0014.htm_para2"><a name="10020374000092">We have also said that we will consider one of the blockages to mergers, which is council tax precept equalisation. We are happy to consider how we can work through that now and in the longer term with my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government. There is a wish to move the mergers forward. They can save resources, but they have to be voluntary and locally driven.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o267"><a name="100203-0014.htm_para3"><a name="10020374000093">Finally, may I refer briefly to the roll-out of the four force pilot, even though my right hon. Friend the Member for Leicester, East is unfortunately not here? It is, dare I say it, rolling out. Forces are at different stages of implementation and are being strongly supported by ACPO in taking up that four force pilot. My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary is writing to police chiefs and chairs to encourage them to adopt the four force pilot in their local areas.</p>

Let me simply say that I hope that Members will approve the grant today for £259 million extra for next year. I hope that-dare I say it-that the Opposition will support us in that commitment and will not renege on it, whatever happens in any potential election.

 Before I come to the main body of my remarks, may I say that it was and is the intention that the Under-Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, my hon. Friend the Member for Stevenage (Barbara Follett), should reply to the debate? Timings in the House are uncertain and she will be dealing with an Adjournment debate in Westminster Hall for half an hour. I hope that it will be acceptable to you, Madam Deputy Speaker, and to the House if she replies to the debate-she has undertaken much of the individual correspondence and meetings with local authorities and she might be in a good position to respond to particular cases that are raised.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o271"><a name="100203-0014.htm_para7"><a name="10020374000100">Before I discuss the good financial settlement that is on offer for councils again this year, I want to draw the House's attention to the 2010-11 "Housing Revenue Account Subsidy Determination" that the Government have issued today. It confirms that next year's local authority average guideline rent increase will be set at 3.1 per cent., not 6.1 per cent. as was previously agreed, because the Government believe that the previous increase would not be fair or affordable for tenants. Those considerations have always been our priority, and that will not change. What we have put in place this year will not mean steep rent increases for council tenants in the next few years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o272"><a name="100203-0014.htm_para8"><a name="10020374000101">The same concern about affordability has informed the decision that was announced by my hon. Friend in November, that the Government were capping the police authorities of Cheshire, Leicestershire and Warwickshire because of previous excessive increases. Cheshire and Leicestershire have accepted the budget caps that we have proposed, whereas Warwickshire exercised its right to challenge. After careful consideration, I have laid an order for the House's approval to set Warwickshire a maximum budget requirement of £90,395,000 for 2010-11. The intention is to limit all three authorities to the equivalent of a 3 per cent. increase in council tax over 2009-10 and 2010-11. No other capping decisions have been taken for 2010-11, but we will not hesitate to cap excessive increases that have been set by individual authorities, if necessary.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o273"><a name="100203-0014.htm_para9"><a name="10020374000102">Let me address the main subject of the debate-the financial settlement for local government. This is the final year of the first ever three-year settlement, which involves an £8.6 billion increase over three years, with an average increase of 4 per cent. over each of the three years and of 4 per cent. again for the coming year. The increase for this year is made up of a 2.6 per cent. increase of formula grant, bringing the total to £29 billion; a £5 billion area-based grant, which includes funding  <br>

for the supporting people programme, the working neighbourhoods fund and the rural bus subsidy; and specific revenue grants of £42.2 billion, which includes, for example, the dedicated schools grant. Every council will receive an increase in funding.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o274"><a name="100203-0014.htm_para10"><a name="10020374000103">This year's settlement comes on the back of a 39 per cent. increase in real-terms funding in the decade up to 2007-08. In that decade, power and responsibility were transferred to councils, giving them greater stability, freedoms and flexibilities. Almost £6 billion has been moved into such budgets with no strings attached. The performance framework has been slimmed down from 1,200 targets to fewer than 200. Next year, councils will also gain responsibility for commissioning education and training, which will be worth a further £7 billion.</p>

<p><a name="st_o247"><a name="10020374000104"><a name="100203-0014.htm_spnew2"><a name="10020374000213"><b>Ms Gisela Stuart (Birmingham, Edgbaston) (Lab):</b>
 My right hon. Friend mentions that councils are free to spend their money with fewer strings attached, but does he expect councils to take more responsibility? Does he have a view on Birmingham city council's inability to submit its accounts in such a way that the Audit Commission is able to sign them off? The council has had to waste £60,000 just to have the books re-audited to satisfy the Audit Commission.</p>

 My hon. Friend raises an important point. We had occasion, before Christmas, to raise concerns with Birmingham city council, which, on its own say so, had failed to use the working neighbourhoods fund money in a timely manner. It is the right direction of travel to give freedoms to local authorities, but we have to make it clear that with those freedoms and flexibilities comes the responsibility to use public money well and wisely for local people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o275"><a name="100203-0014.htm_para11"><a name="10020374000106">The Government's record on funding is one of real achievement and real confidence in local government. There has been real change on the ground, backed by real investment. I suspect that this debate might not attract huge public attention across all the media, but it will be followed closely in council chambers across England. In this week, next week and the week after, councillors will meet in town halls and civic centres to set council tax. They will be considering the coming year and the years ahead. They will follow our debates with interest, not least because of the looming election and the possible consequences for local councils and council tax payers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o276"><a name="100203-0014.htm_para12"><a name="10020374000107">This Government's support for local government is not in doubt. The settlement comes on top of a 39 per cent. increase in real-terms funding that compares with the 7 per cent. real cut in the final four years of the previous Conservative Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o277"><a name="100203-0014.htm_para13"><a name="10020374000108">I reject the claim in yesterday's edition of <i> The Daily Telegraph</i> from 35 Conservative council leaders that low council tax increases this year have nothing to do with the Government. They said that they had</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o278"><a name="100203-0014.htm_para14"><a name="10020374000109">Those councillors should be grateful. In January last year, the Leader of the Opposition proposed cutting my Department's budget by £1 billion, of which it is certain that £240 million would have come from council budgets. So those 35 local authority leaders should at least be grateful that I protected them from the policies of their own political party.</p>

 The Minister is vaunting the significant amounts of additional money that his Government have made available, but is he aware that some councils are outliers, whose increases in cash per head can be counted in pennies? Richmond is a good example, with an increase of 87p per head. Many councils, like Richmond or Kingston, have had to go deep into their pockets to fund primary school places because Government help has been so limited. The number of children affected is very significant.</p>

<p><a name="st_o250"><a name="10020374000111"><a name="100203-0014.htm_spnew5"><a name="10020374000216"><b>Mr. Denham:</b>
 I do not agree that Government help has been limited. It is possible that when my hon. Friend the Minister winds up, she will be able set out how much Richmond has received over the years. However, I acknowledge that there is an underlying point, and that it is an inescapable part of the settlement. Almost inevitably, the funding formula that we have will reveal that some authorities are further from the formula target than others. Each year, the grant settlement is designed to make progress towards that target, but we must have a floor system that regulates the rate of change that takes place each year. Some authorities are affected by that, but it is very difficult to design a system that does not have some element of that sort.</p>

 I realise that we are moving towards target according to formula funding, but is it right that my authority should lose another £5 million this year because it is below target? That comes on top of the millions that we have lost already. Wandsworth is to receive an additional £51.653 million next year, and Kensington and Chelsea £10.061 million. I put it to my hon. Friend that my constituents are some of the poorest in the country.</p>

 The increase in Bolton is something like £13 million in the coming year. That is a significant amount of money, as my hon. Friend will recognise. The application of the funding formula requires a floor mechanism to regulate the pace of change towards the target that the formula produces. It has been widely discussed, and he is perfectly right to produce anomalies or examples that he thinks are unfair to his constituency. However, I do not accept that they are anomalies, as the system for regulating the pace at which we move towards target is broadly agreed across the House. I am pleased that his authority has been able to benefit this year from a significant amount of money.</p>

 My hon. Friend may be aware that her local authority has received an extra £18 million this year. She makes a very valid point, but the reaction that she describes is perhaps an inevitable part of human nature. There will always be more complaints from those who believe that they should have got more than there will be praise from those who have been protected by the system. She is absolutely right to make that observation. My firm belief is that not only in this year, but in previous years, the Government have worked hard to get the balance right between the ceiling and the floor, to ensure that the pace of change is reasonably predictable and understandable by local authorities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o279"><a name="100203-0014.htm_para15"><a name="10020374000119">I was speaking about how I resisted the call of the Opposition last year to cut my Department's grants to local authorities by several hundred million pounds. The councillors who wrote to <i> The Daily Telegraph</i> may have been embarrassed by the truth, which is that the councils that have loaded most burden on to council tax payers have been Conservative. Of the 50 councils with the highest increases in council tax over the first 10 years of this Government, around 30 are Conservative-controlled. Labour controls just five.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o280"><a name="100203-0014.htm_para16"><a name="10020374000120">The current settlement means that we can expect the average band D council tax increase to fall to a 16-year low. Many councils have already indicated that they plan for modest council tax increases or none at all, including all eight London Labour councils, which have committed to a council tax freeze while protecting front-line services. Our expectation this year follows last year's average increase of just 3 per cent., the lowest since 1994-95.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o281"><a name="100203-0014.htm_para17"><a name="10020374000121">That is good news for council tax payers from the Labour Government. What would they get from the Opposition? An apparently attractive but empty and unfunded promise. On 30 September 2008 the right hon. Member for Witney (Mr. Cameron) told the BBC that council tax would be frozen for two years under a Conservative Government. The Conservative party press release of 29 September 2008 said that the cost would be £500 million in the first year and £1 billion in "subsequent years". It said that that would be funded from cuts in advertising and consultancy budgets.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o282"><a name="100203-0014.htm_para18"><a name="10020374000122">Latest costings show that the Opposition have seriously underestimated the cost. A two-year freeze starting this year would cost £1.970 billion-£650 million in the first year, and £1.320 billion in the second year and every year after that. Even on the Opposition's own figures there is a £470 million gap, so I wonder whether that is likely to happen.</p>

 The Secretary of State is clearly hitting the target as regards the Conservative party's rather soft position on those issues, but, nevertheless, are not his comments a real comment themselves on the relationship between central and local government?

 The Secretary of State will realise that for many local authorities one of the biggest clouds on the horizon is the census in 2011. Many of us, particularly those of us in inner-city boroughs, recognise that there are great concerns about the rigour with which the census is being put in place, and that that will have a major impact on the grants that are made not just this year but for some years to come. The issue applies to hon. Members from all parts of the House.

 The hon. Gentleman makes a perfectly fair point. Usually in this annual debate, the concern is that population figures are out of date, as opposed to about to be updated. The census is therefore enormously important, as is the ongoing work, on which the Office for National Statistics is consulting, about better ways of capturing more rapid short-term changes in population of the sort that we saw in the middle of the last decade. His point is well taken and well made, but I assure him that everybody concerned with the census is working enormously hard to ensure that it produces the accurate basis on which future local government projections can be carried out.</p>

the powers that they need to act decisively on behalf of local residents, including the powers to scrutinise, influence and shape other services. In future, this means that local government will not just be overseeing its own services; in addition, councillors will be able to challenge how all local services are delivered, regardless of the provider. As the pre-Budget report confirmed, Total Place is not just a direction of travel but the future of local government and local public services under a Labour Government. The Opposition may make a rhetorical commitment to Total Place, but we have shown in past debates where their polices will lead: a postcode lottery as entitlements and inspection are abandoned, and two-tier "Ryanair" councils providing a most basic service and leaving only those who can afford to pay able to access a decent service.

 I am trying to respond to the Minister. We have some real concerns about business rates and we are worried that if Ministers go ahead with the revaluation they have planned it will destabilise one of the key revenues for councils-</p>

 Can the hon. Lady be clear that she is suggesting, as she did in questions last week, that the revaluation should not go ahead, knowing as she does that 60 per cent. of businesses would see an average of a £770 rate increase from April?</p>

 The Secretary of State fails to recognise that the decrease for those companies is funded by increases for other companies. If the Government had looked at the impact assessment of whether those companies could afford the increase, he would be on stronger ground. The reality is that those getting the biggest rises far outweigh the number getting the biggest decreases. In eight out of nine English regions, more companies will see a 20 per cent.-plus rise than will see a 20 per cent. fall. The Secretary of State cannot claim that the Government are pursuing a strong policy when they have not even bothered to look at how the 40 per cent. of companies that face a rise will manage to pay it. If the Government's calculations are wrong-not that they particularly have any-business rate income could be destabilised.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o307"><a name="100203-0016.htm_para0"><a name="10020376000037">It would be better to allow all companies to enjoy the minor reduction that they would all get from the inflationary decrease that would have resulted from the multiplier, had the revaluation not gone ahead. Instead of playing party politics, the Secretary of State should get out to the regions that will see the biggest losers and talk to companies about how they will afford to pay. Those increases alone could stifle the recovery before it gets going.</p>

Under the Government, they have faced extra burdens, not just from top-down diktat, but because they have been able to spend less of their money as they would have wanted. That is one of the reasons for the pressures on council tax. In 1996-97, 22 per cent. of local government revenue expenditure was financed through council tax, but by 2006-07, that had risen to 26 per cent.</p>

to the end of its ability to take additional taxation increases? Given that she is a Member of Parliament for a south London constituency, does she sympathise with some businesses that feel that it is a little unfair that the supplementary business rate that they are paying goes into Crossrail? There might be important things to do in south London communities using some of that supplementary business rate.</p>

<p><a name="st_o325"><a name="10020376000056"><a name="100203-0016.htm_spnew20"><a name="10020376000136"><b>Justine Greening:</b>
 The hon. Gentleman raises some interesting points. The first was about council tax and the pressures to increase it further. It should be up to local residents to decide whether council tax rises are affordable. That is one of the reasons Conservative Members have talked about providing the ability for local residents to hold a referendum if they believe that council tax rises are unaffordable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o310"><a name="100203-0016.htm_para3"><a name="10020376000057">The hon. Gentleman also raised a point about Crossrail and supplementary business rates. The Government recently brought through the Business Rate Supplements Act 2009, about which we expressed the concern, when it passed through the House, that it could lead to extra burdens on companies. So I share his concerns about the concept of supplementary business rates-in fact, we have said that we want councils to be able to go in a different direction. We want to give them the power to levy a business rate discount, rather than a supplement. We need to give councils the ability locally to help regenerate their local economies, and I will come later to some of the incentives that we would like to see.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o311"><a name="100203-0016.htm_para4"><a name="10020376000058">As I am sure that the hon. Gentleman recognises from his own local council in Croydon, councils currently spend far too much time micro-managing Government initiatives and not enough time being able to tailor what they are doing locally to local community priorities. In fact, 36 out of 52 revenue grants for local authorities are ring-fenced, so it is simply not correct to say that local authorities are being given the freedom that they need to deliver for their local communities as well as they can. We would very much like the Government to move away from ring-fencing grants and towards giving councils more freedom to deliver on local priorities as they see fit.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o312"><a name="100203-0016.htm_para5"><a name="10020376000059">Only today we heard the Prime Minister talking a good game, but the reality for local councils is that they do not see that change happening on the ground. As I mentioned to the hon. Gentleman, there is very little incentive in the funding formula for councils to deliver for their local authorities. Total Place has started to provide some of the fact base, as it were, for councils to be able to do so, but we should not kid ourselves. We are at the beginning of a long road towards councils being able to get out there and not just work with other local providers, such as the NHS and the police, and with the Department for Work and Pensions, but, more broadly, deliver value for money for their residents.</p>

Gentleman's point, but it shows the difference between our approach, which is to trust local communities and local authorities to get on with running their own lives, and that of the Government, who take a top-down approach the whole time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o313"><a name="100203-0016.htm_para6"><a name="10020376000064">The issue is not just about giving local people more authority to hold their local councils to account on council tax rises. We also need to put in place incentives, so that local authorities can benefit when they take good decisions on providing more homes for local people. Many local councils across England and Wales would say that they are concerned at the lack of house building that has taken place, but they have had to work within a framework of top-down targets that local communities have rejected.</p>

 Thank you very much, Madam Deputy Speaker. I was making the point that part of the funding settlement that we are talking about should reward local councils when they develop their local communities by providing new homes. We would also like local councils to have incentives, so that they are rewarded for doing a good job in developing their local economies and generating local jobs. That is why we have talked about allowing them to keep the gain from business rates that they make when they do a good job of bringing new companies and new industry into their local areas.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o314"><a name="100203-0016.htm_para7"><a name="10020376000069">Finally, it is time to say that local authorities with local responsibilities need to be more accountable. Authorities such as Windsor are already being far more transparent, as is the Mayor of London, putting all spend over £1,000 out for public scrutiny. We would like other councils to follow that measure. Indeed, I am sure that when the Minister wraps up, she will say that she, too, would like that-I am guessing that she would not want to go against increased transparency. We certainly want local councils to have increased transparency for their residents, because it is the best way to create an environment in which councils can not only have more power to deliver on local priorities, but be better held accountable by their local residents in doing so.</p>

 We are very supportive of moves to ensure that transparency is developed and improved in councils. We think that that is the best way to enable local residents to hold their local authorities to account.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o315"><a name="100203-0016.htm_para8"><a name="10020376000072">In place of the local government finance settlement approach that we heard about from the Secretary of State, we want local communities and local authorities to be given more power to deliver their priorities on the ground. We want local residents to be able to cap their council tax if they think that that is their priority, rather than having Ministers do it whether it is or not. In the earlier debate, which you were here for, Madam Deputy Speaker, a variety of hon. Members complained about the fact that their police authorities had been capped, as local people were perfectly happy to pay more-their priority was to see more police on their streets. We think that that is the right way to go: to give local people the choice, rather than have it taken away.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o316"><a name="100203-0016.htm_para9"><a name="10020376000073">Whatever the Prime Minister says this week, councils have nothing new to look forward to from the Secretary of State or from the Minister. It is more of the same when we look through this local government finance settlement. There is continued top-down ring-fencing of money that should be spent on residents' priorities, rather than Whitehall priorities. There is a continued lack of incentives for councils to develop their local communities and economies. There is continued pressure on council tax to rise, when family finances are stretched to the limit, because councils are asked to take up, on behalf of Whitehall, so many unfunded initiatives. There is continued micro-management and inspection from above, which costs money that could otherwise go into front-line services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o317"><a name="100203-0016.htm_para10"><a name="10020376000074">The bottom line is that we need to give councils the freedom that they crave to deliver better services and better value, and to deliver on the priorities that matter most to their local communities. However, as we have heard today, for that to happen, we will need a change of Government-it will not happen under this one.</p>

 I want to make a few observations and I will try to be brief because I know that many hon. Friends wish to speak. Like other hon. Members, before I was a Member of Parliament, I was the Labour leader of a council under a Conservative Government. I can attest that the experience under this Government, with their attitude to local government, although there are some things that I criticise them for, is light years away from the experience of council leaders under the previous Conservative regime. It attempted to set the budget of every council in this country, a Stalinist exercise that has never been exceeded and that, I hope, will never be emulated by any Government, and that is not to mention the gerrymandering of the grant system. That needs to be said. I know I am of an age that means that I perhaps have a longer memory than the hon.

Friends-apart from the hon. Member for Mole Valley (Sir Paul Beresford), my fellow member of the Select Committee on Communities and Local Government-deserted the Chamber and left her in an acre of empty Green Benches is distressing. I guess that they have done that because, like me, they were somewhat distressed by the innumeracy that she demonstrated, and her lack of understanding of local government finance. That is incredibly distressing in someone who wishes to become one of the Ministers in charge of it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o319"><a name="100203-0016.htm_para12"><a name="10020376000077">First, we are not talking about the national non-domestic rate, which is not relevant, but about the system of local government finance as it relates to the council tax. The hon. Lady must know that revaluation, unless each individual council chooses to use it as an excuse for increasing the total council tax take in their area, does not mean that everybody's bill goes up; it means that some people's bills go up and some people's go down. It is absolutely indefensible for her to continue in this way: either she does not understand it, or she is continuing to state something that she knows is not accurate.</p>

 We have already had a revaluation in Wales, which did raise more council tax, so the hon. Lady should look at that example to see why we should be concerned about revaluation.</p>

<p><a name="st_o338"><a name="10020376000079"><a name="100203-0016.htm_spnew33"><a name="10020376000149"><b>Dr. Starkey:</b>
 The hon. Lady should look at the data she cites. The Welsh Assembly-it believe it was my party, but I am not making an excuse for it-took advantage of the revaluation hugely to increase the total take. The bills went up, because it decided to increase the amount of money raised. I am distressed to have to explain this to the hon. Lady, but that is how the system works. As a former chair of finance, I know the way the system works. A council decides how much money it needs to raise from council tax in order to fill the gap between grant income, charge income and what it takes from the reserves. It decides on the total amount it wishes to raise and then it turns to the city treasurer and says, "Looking at our local tax base, given the people we have in each band and so on, how much do we have to increase band D council tax to raise the requisite amount of money?" It follows that if there is a revaluation, unless the council decides it wants to increase the amount raised, some people's bills will go up and others' will go down. The Welsh Assembly example, cited all the time by Conservative Members, is not an example of revaluation leading to bills going up; it is an example of an elected council or assembly choosing to increase the total take and, of course, everybody's bills going up. It has nothing to do with revaluation.</p>

 I share the hon. Lady's experience of being a council leader under the Conservatives, so I can certainly corroborate what she said about that.

We have waited 20 years, so values are  <br>

20 years out of date. Are we going to wait for them to become 100 years out of date before somebody dares to carry out a revaluation or are we going to do the sensible thing, which is completely to change the basis of local government taxation?</p>

 As I am the Chair of a Select Committee and not a Minister, I can say what I feel on this matter. If we continue to have a property tax-I believe that we should-we need to revalue relatively frequently; otherwise, it becomes distorted. Then, as the hon. Gentleman says, if we make the changes, those who gain will gain a great deal and those who lose will lose a great deal. I am personally in favour of such revaluation.</p>

 Will my hon. Friend reflect on the consequences for balancing of having a freeze on council tax? What, for example, might be the consequence in year 3 of the freeze, if it were imposed without replacing the money cumulatively lost through council tax, for central Government funding, especially if the figures were not entirely right? Unless central funding took over, would not the likely outcome be a huge avalanche of council tax rises in year 3, thereby decreasing still further the ability of local authorities to raise their own finance?</p>

<p><a name="st_o342"><a name="10020376000083"><a name="100203-0017.htm_spnew3"><a name="10020376000153"><b>Dr. Starkey:</b>
 Absolutely. My hon. Friend is a great expert on local government finance and I entirely agree with him. What he said suggests that any Opposition proposing such a policy do not really think that they are ever going to come to power, since they would still be in power when such an enormous hike occurred, thereby becoming incredibly unpopular.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o320"><a name="100203-0017.htm_para0"><a name="10020376000084">There are other reasons why I believe the Opposition should reconsider their policy. I say this simply because I would not want my hon. Friend the Minister in any way to be tempted to take over such a policy from the Opposition. First, the whole basis of the hon. Lady's arguments rests on the supposition that the council tax is itself a problem. The hon. Member for Falmouth and Camborne (Julia Goldsworthy) made the point that I was intending to make myself, namely that the council tax was introduced by the Conservative Government after their disastrous introduction of the poll tax. They could not go back to the rates, which in my view is what they should have done, so they opted for a poor relative of the rates.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o321"><a name="100203-0017.htm_para1"><a name="10020376000085">At least the rates had the advantage of being relatively progressive. It is not a hard and fast rule, but on the whole the bigger the property in which people live, the better off they are, and the bigger the property in which they live, the more they will pay in rates. It is also true that the bigger the property in which they live, the more they will pay in council tax, but because council tax is banded rather than being a continuous system like the rating system, the difference between what is paid by someone living in a small house and what is paid by someone living in a big house is nowhere near as great under the rating system as under the council tax system. The council tax is a much less progressive tax; indeed, it verges on the regressive.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o322"><a name="100203-0017.htm_para2"><a name="10020376000086">If the hon. Lady and her party are truly worried about the burden that the council tax places on low and middle-income households, there is a simple way of dealing with that. Increasing the number of bands  <br>

would increase the burden on those in big houses and on big incomes, and-since the total amount to be raised would remain the same-it would reduce the burden on low and middle-income households. I suggest that she consider that simple method, which, once introduced, would perpetuate the improvement in progressivity from year to year without the need for further changes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o323"><a name="100203-0017.htm_para3"><a name="10020376000087">Secondly, I want to deal with the proposal that some authorities' council tax should be frozen. The Opposition appear to be suggesting that a council that proposed to increase its council tax next year by 2.5 per cent. or less would receive a lump sum of 2.5 per cent. from the Conservative Government, in the ghastly event of their being elected. That is essentially adding to the Government grant system, but in a way that is not transparent and is in no way related to need. Effectively, it means giving money to councils if they are able to keep their council tax at 2.5 per cent. or below.</p>

 My hon. Friend is right: that is an odd paradox. One would have thought that any incoming council would have been focused on meeting the needs of the people who had elected it, rather than on cutting services to them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o325"><a name="100203-0017.htm_para5"><a name="10020382000005">Let me speak a little more widely about some of the challenges councils have faced over the past three years, which is the period the settlement has covered. Councils have been feeling the pinch. The credit crunch has had an impact not only in terms of putting pressure on the services that they have to deliver-if there are more vulnerable people, councils face increased pressures in trying to meet their needs-but in terms of the fees and charges they collect. They have already been feeling the squeeze, therefore, as the Minister for Housing acknowledged last year when he said this was a tight settlement. It would therefore be unfair to say that councils are in a luxurious position, given everything else that has been going on in the wider economy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o326"><a name="100203-0017.htm_para6"><a name="10020382000006">The Secretary of State rightly highlighted in his speech his concern about the impact rent increases might have on council tenants, and the impact of council tax rises on council tax payers, but we must also remember that there are huge pressures on councils, which in turn has an impact on the services they provide to vulnerable people. A number of terrible stories have been reported in the media recently, not least the case in Edlington. The knock-on effect of that case and the baby P case has created a massive pressure on authorities' services. I know from talking to people delivering children's services in my own local authority in Cornwall that they have resulted in a massive increase in referrals, which they have to deal with, and they have also had a very negative impact on staff morale and turnover. Therefore, a lot of councils have fewer staff trying to deal with an increased burden. It looks as though those pressures will increase in the future, because the Government's proposals to give councils the responsibility for delivering free personal care to people with high levels of need living at home is a cause for concern to a lot of councils. They believe that they are being asked to part-fund that by savings that have already been accounted for, or that they may not be able to deliver that care. This is part of a long history of the Government giving councils responsibilities for something that the Government then fail to deliver on properly, such as concessionary bus fares and free swimming. The delivery of personal care will be another example of councils finding that their resources will be stretched further to cover more responsibilities, while they are not necessarily given the resources to deal with that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o327"><a name="100203-0017.htm_para7"><a name="10020382000007">I want to emphasise, too, that we face uncertainty. The Secretary of State made great play of the certainty that his Government had given to local councils through the three-year funding settlement, but he said absolutely nothing about what will happen in the next financial year-not the one that has been dealt with by the settlement, but the subsequent one. Basically, councils are completely in the dark about what kind of situation they will be operating in. The spending review was due last summer, and we do not now know when it will appear, but it certainly does not look as though it will do so until after the election. The closest we got to having any information about that was in the pre-Budget report, when the Chancellor said that public spending as a whole would be frozen between 2011-12 and 2014-15.</p>

We are talking about 3 per cent. real-terms cuts every year. By not coming clean and giving us an indication about this in a spending report, the Government are taking away from councils time to plan what they need to do and what services they need to prioritise. If councils had more time-if they had had from last summer or even from last October-they would be able to plan their services more effectively and smooth out some of the impact that such cuts will inevitably have on their services. If information is not provided urgently, councils will be preparing their budgets from October and probably having to carry out a slashing exercise on current services of which Freddy Krueger would be proud. All councils will be facing a nightmare on Elm street because they are not being told what to expect.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o336"><a name="100203-0017.htm_para16"><a name="10020382000016">What does that mean for council tax payers? It raises a big question as to what will happen to council tax. In the past, there have been above-inflation increases every year since the council tax was introduced, but what impact would the introduction of capping have on services? It would certainly not help to sort out the public debt, because it would provide the Government with only a marginal gain from what happens to council tax benefits, so they would not obtain any advantage. What is most likely to happen is that there will be massive pressures on the council tax system, because if councils want to do anything to prioritise an important service, the only way that they will be able to find any discretion is through terrifying increases in council tax.</p>

 I will come to that, but the point I am trying to make is that this situation is urgent. Council tax payers will end up with council tax bill increases every year even though services are being reduced-that already occurs, but the extent of it will be more extreme. On the kind of extrapolations that the IFS has produced, there will be massive increases in council tax in return for massive cuts in local services.

 I congratulate the hon. Lady on her relatively numerate presentation, in comparison with what was said by certain people sitting elsewhere in the Chamber.

 I shall be coming to that point later, but basically the Conservative proposals would have the effect of disproportionately benefiting the people in the best position.

 I am very worried about one of the two district councils in my constituency, Mendip district council. South Somerset is happily well-run and has shown that it is very good at running its resources. Mendip district council has, over the years, massively cut its services and then massively increased both council tax and charges. It is now considered by the Audit Commission to be one of the worst-run councils in the country. I am not sure that it could survive that sort of impact. The problem is, of course, that the one-time leader of Mendip district council, Councillor Ken Maddock, is now leader of Somerset county council, which has hitherto been a top-rated authority. I am worried not only that Mendip will go down the pan but that Somerset county council will deteriorate.</p>

 As I was saying, one of the weaknesses in the current system is the fact that 75 per cent. of what local councils spend is not raised locally. A number of things can be done-some more quickly than others-to try to reverse that ratio. Another weakness in the system is the fact that taxpayers and business rate payers see no correlation between what they pay to their local council and what they end up getting from their local council. Again, when we end up with significant cuts and very difficult decisions, it makes matters even more painful. I know that in the period leading up to my election, I was told increasingly on the doorstep that the current system was unsustainable and that council tax was hated. I think that that problem will be magnified as we go through this process.</p>

We need only look at the successful application rates for council tax benefit, for example, and at how many people are entitled to it who do not receive it. What will happen in a situation where there might be potentially significant increases in council tax? On top of all that, a range of public services are delivered locally outside local government that might well be subject to similar pressures for which there is no accountability. There is a fundamental question about the other services that are delivered locally outside the local authority. This will lead to the unsuitable state of affairs that we have seen for a long time becoming completely unsustainable. The kind of changes that we need do not simply involve providing longer funding horizons for local authorities, although of course that is helpful. It is not just about getting the funding formula or equalisation measures right or about fully funding any additional responsibilities that central Government pass on to local government. It is about a much bigger issue, for which this situation might provide a catalyst.</p>

If one sets that idea in the context of what I said about the IFS "Green Budget", we are again talking about massive financial pressures on councils to approve huge developments because that is the only way in which they will get additional income. In my view, housing policy should be based on what the local population needs, not on centrally driven targets or what are basically financial bribes. The priority should be local need, and policy should not be driven by financial incentives or central targets.</p>

There has been a bureaucratic response, but what really needs to be addressed is how people are consulted, how decisions are taken about the delivery of public services and how money is raised. A classic example of the situation is provided in a document published by the Cabinet Office, rather than the Department for Communities and Local Government, which exemplifies the kind of approach that the Government take. I shall be interested to hear from the Minister how effectively she thinks the "Smarter Government" document and its implementation will help to engage communities on what will be difficult issues. There is a chapter on dealing with local priorities, and page 38 talks about how the Government will improve such relationships. One section states:</p>
<a name="100203-0018.htm_brev0"><a name="10020382000054"><ul><p class="tabletext">"We will align the different sector-specific performance management frameworks across key local agencies-the NHS, police, schools and local government-thereby increasing the focus on indicators relating to joint outcomes. We will set out in Budget 2010 the key areas where frameworks for specific frontline sectors can be further aligned."</p>

Sue Doughty, the former MP for Guildford. A key strand of the Act involves the provision of easily digestible local spending reports that contain details of all public spending at local level. The idea behind the reports was that once that information was in the public domain, members of the public would want to have a say in how it could be better spent. It was part of a process to turn decision making around and make it work on a bottom-up, rather than a top-down, basis. The Government have decided, perhaps because that idea did not come from the DCLG, that they do not want to implement it as quickly as the tens of thousands of people who supported that campaign wanted it implemented. However, Total Place provides a way in which that information can be made available in a better way than is being achieved in the local spending reports under the 2007 Act.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o345"><a name="100203-0018.htm_para6"><a name="10020382000035">Again, the Government have missed the point. They are making localism a worthy way of having local area agreements with knobs on, but they are not thinking about how to use it as a tool for engaging people, and are not using their expertise to ensure that the right things are prioritised and that money is spent effectively. It is very frustrating that the Government have missed the fundamental point of adopting a localist approach in the first place.</p>

We need a simplified, localist system of public services that is easier for people to understand and influence. The current difficult financial situation makes that more important, not less.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o347"><a name="100203-0018.htm_para8"><a name="10020382000037">The Liberal Democrats have put the localist agenda at front and centre of what we want to do, and that stands in direct contrast to the approach taken by Labour and the Conservatives. The Government's compartmentalised approach spreads across departmental silos, but it is also evident within Departments: today's debate has made it clear that the section of the DCLG that deals with localism and participation does not feel any need to work with the section that deals with local government finance. The localist agenda must cut across both this and other Departments, although I am not convinced that that happens. It is beginning to happen with the Total Place initiative but, unfortunately, as with a lot of things, that is driven by the Treasury.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o348"><a name="100203-0018.htm_para9"><a name="10020382000038">We need to encourage more cross-departmental thinking. The localist agenda is important now because some painful, difficult and controversial decisions will have to be taken on the delivery of local public services. Inevitably, they will have an impact on the front line in one way or another. We hear a great deal about how problems can be dealt with by efficiency gains, but that is not so-there will be dramatic cuts.</p>

The emphasis seems to be on administrative convenience, not on the interests of the people who use the services. A fundamental shift needs to happen, and it must cut across a variety of different areas. The tax system must change, so that the taxes that we pay locally no longer disappear into the Treasury to be spent elsewhere. We can achieve that by localising business rates and moving to a system of local income tax, although we would like to allow the councils that are keen to trial that system to pilot it first.</p>

I was therefore very disappointed that yesterday we saw only baby steps taken for the Westminster Parliament. No such steps were taken at the level of local government, even though some progress in that direction has been made in Scotland. We should remember that the crisis in confidence in politics is not exclusive to Westminster.</p>

I am disappointed that the Government have not proposed ways to deal with the fiscal crisis that we face and to ensure that people have a say and a stake in the process. The Government continue to assume the worst of local authorities and local people, while presuming that every action taken by central Government is in the best interests of those people and is the best possible outcome, which is certainly not the case.

<p><a name="stpa_o357"><a name="100203-0018.htm_para18"><a name="10020392000010">In the 1980s and 1990s, when the Conservative Government's home-grown recessions were putting pressure on local government, I remember the kind of things that they were doing. It must have been a temptation for my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State to follow their lead, with cuts in money, cuts in the percentage of funding that was given to local authorities, and cuts in the freedom of local authorities to act.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o358"><a name="100203-0018.htm_para19"><a name="10020392000011">I was a councillor in the 1980s and 1990s and my local authority, Wigan metropolitan borough council, was losing £8 million to £10 million year on year because of the way in which the Conservative Government dealt with the recession. There was no planning or forward thinking. We got the first indication in November or December and confirmation in February, and we had to start planning our cuts from 1 April. It was a disaster. Cuts were implemented with no thought given to efficiency. It was inexcusable. Programmes were abandoned halfway through because we had been told that we could not have that kind of money. The Government could have done the same this year.</p>

 I was chair of finance at Sandwell metropolitan council during those years. I reiterate my hon. Friend's point. After one settlement, we would start planning for the projected round of cuts in the next settlement. That continued for four or five years, and we ended up with large council tax increases combined with a slashing of public services to keep within the Conservative Government's revenue support grant.</p>

 My hon. Friend replicates my account of my own experience, which is shared by many people who were councillors in Labour-controlled authorities, in particular. As was pointed out by my hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, South-West (Dr. Starkey), who is no longer in her place, the Conservative Government used to gerrymander the system of grants to suit their own local authorities.</p>

Unlike the Eton old boys, we have learned some lessons. We learned not just in the 1980s and 1990s, but in the 1930s, that the way to make sure that we come out of a recession is not through public sector cuts, but by investing in that to slow the recession down and by investing to grow for the future.</p>

In my borough, we have half the number of job losses that we had in the 1980s and 1990s, half the number of mortgage repossessions, and half the number of businesses going bust. Local government is a major factor in that. Obviously, central Government play a hugely important role, but local government is able to put the funds from central Government into ensuring that people's homes are protected, businesses are supported and jobs are saved.</p>

 The proposal to return business rates to local government has a lot of merit, but it should not be considered in isolation. If we are to look at how local government is financed, we must do so in the round, rather than through a single issue, as I am sure the hon. Gentleman understands and agrees. However, I take on board his point about the return of the business rate to local government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o361"><a name="100203-0018.htm_para22"><a name="10020392000018">One major thing that we have done over the past few years is introduce the certainty of three years' funding, ensuring that local government is able to forward plan and develop strategic responsibilities. That has been a major element in the improved efficiency of all local authorities. The National Audit Office's figures show that almost every single local authority throughout the country, irrespective of party control, is more efficient and more effective than it was in 1997 at delivering its services. A major aspect of that has been the ability to plan three years on three years, rather than having to go hand to mouth as we did in the past. I do not know where the Opposition stand on that process, but it would be interesting to hear an indication-something that we could hang on to. Will they continue or abandon the three-year process?</p>

 The Government have not abandoned that process. Clearly, we have a problem with the comprehensive spending review, and we all know that, but it would be nonsensical to undertake a comprehensive spending review immediately before an election that could lead to a change in Government, as it would have been in an economic downturn, which could have been a depression if we had followed the economic advice of the Conservative party. The Government's policy is that the three-year settlement will continue from next year.</p>

<meta name="Date" content="3 Feb 2010">

<notus-date day="3" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><b>3 Feb 2010 : Column 395</b><br>
every single one has been brought up to the decent homes standard. We have been able to do so not only in the public sector, but in the private sector, where many thousands of houses have also been brought up to that standard. That is largely due not only to Government money, but to the certainty of being able to plan year on year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o364"><a name="100203-0018.htm_para25"><a name="10020392000025">Secondly, on education, we have been awarded a Building Schools for the Future programme in Wigan. That has now started, and we have a programme to rebuild every secondary school in the borough. I should also mention three primary schools: Canon Sharples, Woodfield and Westfield. For years under the Conservative Government, pupils at Woodfield were taught in timber huts, where in winter they were freezing and in summer they were sweltering. We have totally rebuilt that school under a Labour Government, and shortly we will start on Beech Hill primary school.</p>
<a name="10020392000156">
<p>Most importantly of all, throughout the borough we have 19 Sure Start centres. These are not just glorified nursery schools; that is only part of the job that they do. They are also places where parents learn parenting skills. We do not live in a broken Britain-a silly, trite phrase; if one did not know better, one would think it was thought up by some second-rate advertising trainee-but we do live in a Britain where there are people and families who have very difficult problems, and Sure Start is one way of addressing those problems. Mums-many of them are 15, 16 or 17-year-olds-who come from dysfunctional families can go to Sure Start centres and start to learn how to be good parents and how to be communicative beyond their small peer group. They can learn social skills and, equally, the skills that can get them into work once their parenting responsibilities are less onerous.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o365"><a name="100203-0018.htm_para26"><a name="10020392000026">Sure Start is absolutely essential to the long-term programme to give children from dysfunctional families, and those families themselves, a better start. They benefit from going from these facilities into much more modern primary schools, and then into modern secondary schools built under this Labour Government's Building Schools for the Future programme, which the Conservatives have not yet said that they would continue with in government; in fact, as I understand it, they would reduce it dramatically, if not scrap it completely. This is a whole package of long-term reform that will reap rewards not only next year but 10, 15 or 20 years down the line. It would be class vandalism for any party to stop or reduce any part of that investment in our people's future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o366"><a name="100203-0018.htm_para27"><a name="10020392000027">We have come a long way, but we could go further. We should implement not just a three-year settlement for local government but a rolling three-year settlement so that every year people will know three years in advance how much money they will be getting. Local government would then be able to plan even more effectively than it does now. I understand that it is not for the Department for Communities and Local Government to make that decision-it needs to be decided throughout Government, and with Treasury agreement. However, it would enhance local government's ability to deliver its services more effectively and efficiently, and there would be benefits to the public good as a result.</p>

further. The council tax system is inherently unfair. It was designed to be unfair, so producing such a system was one of the few things that John Major managed to succeed in. It surely cannot be right that a millionaire old Etonian in Notting Hill pays only three times more in council tax as a minimum wage earner pays for the same local services. I personally like banding. It is simple to understand and to administer, but we need to reform it. We need more bands at the bottom and more bands at the top-an open-ended banding at the top, I would suggest-so that, as my hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, South-West (Dr. Starkey) said, the amount of money that is paid more accurately reflects the income of people and their ability to pay for those services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o368"><a name="100203-0019.htm_para1"><a name="100203105000001">Revaluations should be carried out on a regular basis. We should never have cancelled them in the first place-we should have gone on with them at the beginning of this Government and done them again since. As the hon. Member for Falmouth and Camborne (Julia Goldsworthy) said, if we do not do this we will bring the whole system into disrepute; it will become similar to the poll tax in having to be totally reviewed in future. We can do that revaluation-it is not a difficult exercise. Every month building societies tell us by how much house prices have risen or fallen over the period. If they can do that on a monthly basis, I do not see why the Government, via the Valuation Office Agency, could not do it every four or five years. Let me reiterate what my hon. Friend said, because it did not seem to have any impact on the Conservative spokesperson. This is a zero sum game. Having a revaluation does not mean that local authorities will get more money. They may choose to get more money from it, but that is a different issue and a different argument. Some people will pay more, and some will pay less. It is important that there is some kind of damping effect in revaluations so that those who pay more are not suddenly faced with 10, 15 or 20 per cent. increases but they are brought in gradually. It is absolutely essential that we have revaluations if we are to ensure that the system does not fall into disrepute again.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o369"><a name="100203-0019.htm_para2"><a name="10020392000029">The final area in which we need reform is the grant itself. The formula is about right, as it recognises deprivation and the needs of councils to tackle the problems that come from that deprivation. It also recognises rurality and the extra costs of delivering services in sparsely populated areas, but it has not been fully implemented. We are still suffering from the disgraceful way in which the previous Conservative Government gerrymandered the grant to their own local authorities. In the years from 2008-09 to 2010-11, Wigan will have been underfunded by £8 million, £6.5 million and £5.5 million respectively-a total of £20 million over those three years.</p>

We have moved from 6 per cent. below it in 2008 to 4 per cent. below now, but we have to quicken that pace if we are to tackle deprivation properly in areas such as mine. That is all the more important when councils are linked in with primary care trusts. One difficulty is that local authorities and PCTs are now delivering services on a common basis much more. They have common offices, pooled resources and joint funding. When a local authority is underfunded, such   <br>

as Wigan and many others, the PCT that serves the same area is underfunded. In Wigan, the PCT was underfunded by £26 million in 2008-09, £25.5 million in 2009-10 and £25 million in 2010-11, so £76.5 million that should have gone to Wigan borough for its health services has not. If we want to tackle the health and social inequalities that exist in our country, we must urgently tackle health and local authority funding inequalities.</p>

Member for Richmond Park (Susan Kramer) complain about the funding for Richmond. We hear a lot from the Liberal Democrats about the fact that they believe in equality, yet here we can make an impact in that regard by reducing the amount of money that Richmond gets-it receives more than 200 per cent. more than it is entitled to. We could reduce that and put it into areas such as mine that are underfunded.</p>

 I think that my hon. Friend's point was that the situation is a bit similar to that of the council tax revaluation. The longer the period over which we try to deal with such issues, the more out of kilter they get. That makes it more painful for areas waiting to get up to their target funding, and more painful for areas that are a long way above their target to get back down to it. Because the problem has not been addressed over a shorter period, it has become even more of a problem to deal with.</p>

 That is not my understanding of what the hon. Member for Richmond Park said-I will read <i> Hansard</i>. I believe that the hon. Member for Falmouth and Camborne agrees with my point that we need to move more quickly towards the formula funding, so that each local authority gets the grant that it is entitled to under that formula. I welcome that agreement, as it is very important that that happens as quickly as possible. The pace of change is vital to local authorities if we are to achieve things.</p>

The three-year settlement builds on 10 years of growth in funding and allows local authorities to plan. Because of all the things that the Government have done over the past 12 years, local government is in a much better place than in 1997 when we came into power.</p>

 One of the delightful things about this debate was that the Secretary of State launched it, which is a little unusual. He gave a premier performance. He managed to present figures by using percentages where they were appropriate and actual figures where they were not-it was the performance of a magician, and I look forward to Debbie McGee following it up at the end of the debate to solve the whole thing for us. I suppose, as it has been put to me, I am speaking from a position of poacher turned gamekeeper, or watching from the sidelines. Today's debate has been intriguing.

<p><a name="stpa_o373"><a name="100203-0019.htm_para6"><a name="10020392000036">The Minister said that the Government gave a generous cash increase of 4 per cent. to local government. In those broad terms, as a headline, that is correct, but as with all local government announcements, those that gain are silent, with one or two exceptions, such as the hon. Member for Wigan (Mr. Turner), and those that lose complain. In London and the south-east, local authorities have had plenty of opportunity to complain and plenty of reasons to do so. In a way, it is fortunate that they have recognised that we are at the end of the three-year cycle and that they are looking for post-election changes, whoever the Government will be. They have knuckled down to produce savings, to ensure that they provide better services at a lower cost, so they do not hit their local citizens with high charges.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o374"><a name="100203-0019.htm_para7"><a name="10020392000037">What has happened under the 4 per cent. increase has varied. The Chairman of the Select Committee touched on this but skidded off it almost immediately. A recent Committee report, "The Balance of Power: Central and Local Government", reflected on local government expenditure and local council tax. Successive Ministers, some of whom have attended the debate, would tell us that the ties, targets and bureaucracy for local government have diminished, which they have. However, one must recognise that they have diminished from the enormous high that this Labour Government introduced. There has been a knock-on effect on expenditure and, because of gearing, a massive effect on council tax.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o375"><a name="100203-0019.htm_para8"><a name="10020392000038">The cry from local government, which is still valid, is that it wants the bureaucracy, auditing, ties and so forth removed, and local councillors, who have been elected by local people, to be given the opportunity to get on with the job with the minimum of direction from above. The implications of that include considerable savings for both central and local government-an easy example is the Audit Commission, which is five times the size it was in 1997.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o376"><a name="100203-0019.htm_para9"><a name="10020392000039">As a response to that reaction by local government, the Local Government Association recently produced a paper that said it could cut the total bill for local government by £4.5 billion, with a positive knock-on effect for central Government. If that were extended to the structure of local government finance, there could be large reductions in council tax, because there is reverse gearing. Gearing was mentioned earlier, but if savings were made in the right sort of areas, there would be reverse gearing, so council tax would go down.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o377"><a name="100203-0019.htm_para10"><a name="10020392000040">Perhaps the Government will heed those points. After the election, whoever wins, I hope to have the opportunity to take the new Secretary of State to some local councils-I am thinking in particular of one that my hon. Friend the Member for Putney (Justine Greening) knows. I want to have people explain to him or her in no uncertain terms just how damaging the current Government have been to local government, regarding not financing, but the burdens they have placed on it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o378"><a name="100203-0019.htm_para11"><a name="10020392000041">Of course, the behind-the-scenes selective local government funding cuts have not come up in the debate. As I said, we are at the end of the three-year cycle and there are going to be changes. One problem with a set three-year cycle is that the Government are inflexible. In the current financial situation, it would be risky for them to be too dogmatically tied to a three-year spending cycle. Over the next three years, flexibility will be required.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o379"><a name="100203-0019.htm_para12"><a name="10020392000042">Local government claims that its cost inflation is running at approximately 3 per cent. In the light of that, the 4 per cent. is generous, but the distribution, even under this Government-or perhaps particularly under this Government-is slanted. For example, it has not been mentioned tonight, but for most authorities in London the grant increase is only 1.5 per cent. Many of those authorities, especially in inner London, face the sort of dire problems that the hon. Member for Wigan raised. Those authorities are struggling with those problems, although hon. Members have failed to recognise that and, indeed, have criticised the funding for two inner-London authorities, one of which I know quite well. It would benefit those complaining to take a tour of those local authorities to see what has been done with much less money than in other local authorities around the country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o380"><a name="100203-0019.htm_para13"><a name="10020392000043">There will be the threat of capping, but those London authorities will probably look for, and find, efficiency savings so as not to pass excessive costs on to their council tax payers. The same applies in many south-east authorities. My constituency receives services from Mole Valley district council, Guildford council and of course Surrey county council. All are Conservative controlled and all would have been delighted to have received a 4 per cent. increase in grant. In fact, going by trends over many years, they would have been utterly amazed. Guildford's formula grant increased by 1.45 per cent.-not by 4 per cent. This 1.4 per cent. increases Guildford's grant to approximately £62 per head. The average for English district councils is approximately £79 per head. Mole Valley district council would have been delighted with Guildford council's increase, let alone the 4 per cent. Government headline, because it received a 0.5 per cent. Government grant increase. Following the same trend, Surrey county council's grant increase was 1.5 per cent., which follows on last year's 1.75 per cent. and the year before, which was 2 per cent.</p>

 I look at the figures for Mole Valley and I see that it will receive 30 per cent. more than the formula funding says that it should get in 2008-09, dropping to 21 per cent. more next year. How can the hon. Gentleman justify any increase above the floor when the council already receives so much more than it is entitled to? Moreover, half of the super-output areas in Mole Valley are in the top 10 per cent. most affluent in the country.</p>

<p><a name="st_o370"><a name="10020392000045"><a name="100203-0019.htm_spnew4"><a name="10020392000194"><b>Sir Paul Beresford:</b>
 It might help the hon. Gentleman if he took half a day to come with me to some of the Mole Valley villages, which have deprivation to match anything he has in Wigan. In addition, he should think back to when we had an Office of the Deputy Prime Minister and the funding formula changed dramatically. That change reduced the grant to Surrey county council and the local district councils dramatically. The year-on-year loss to Surrey county council was £39 million, and that loss was reflected by the other councils. The hon. Gentleman should reflect on the fact that the money moved with the change in the formula, but that does not mean that the formula is right.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o381"><a name="100203-0019.htm_para14"><a name="10020392000046">I accept that there are differences in needs from authority to authority, and that this must be reflected in the allocation.

the north and predominantly-at that stage-Labour authorities. The needs indices calculations are opaque. They are much more unintelligibly dense and complex than pre-1997. Pre-1997, shadow Ministers claimed that they would make the formula more transparent. I note, with some trepidation, that my own Front-Bench team says the same. Of course, it is always a balance. The more transparent and less complex a formula, the more there is rough justice. The fairer the assessment system-taking into account detailed needs-the more complex the formula. However, recent Government formulae have been designed to justify grant movement north despite increasing pressures from population, increased school rolls and increasing Government bureaucratic red tape in London and the south-east. I hope that we will have a new Conservative Government, who will have a massive reorganisation on their hands. It is overdue.</p>

 I spoke in a similar debate a year ago when we discussed the previous financial settlement. I struggle to see where the massive improvement that the Secretary of State talked about in his opening remarks has come from. Instead, there is greater uncertainty, and the attitude of central Government to local government during this year can be described only in terms of a master-servant relationship. One specific piece of legislation illustrated that fact for me and many other hon. Members when it was in Committee and as it progressed through the House earlier in the year, but I shall come to that later.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o382"><a name="100203-0019.htm_para15"><a name="10020392000048">Is the settlement really an attempt, as the Secretary of State made out, to talk up a Labour view of localism? I cannot recognise it as localist, and I do not think that any councillors could either. Overriding everything is the feeling of utter powerlessness of councillors, and that was one of the major reasons many stepped down at the last elections. Many still have that feeling of powerlessness, and nowhere is that more apparent than when it comes to money and their ability to set their own budgets.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o383"><a name="100203-0019.htm_para16"><a name="10020392000049">The Secretary of State referred to the importance of this time of the year, not just in relation to this debate, but because of the budget setting that many councils are going through and how the information before us feeds into it. My former colleagues on my own county council remain as frustrated and disappointed as I used to be every budget time because of the little influence they have in setting the budget and allocating money to their own priorities in the area covering a range of different subjects. That is partly a question of ring-fencing, and again the Secretary of State made great play of having improved the business of ring-fencing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o384"><a name="100203-0019.htm_para17"><a name="10020392000050">In preparation for this debate, I asked my local council to give me an idea of the ring-fenced and non-ring-fenced balance amounts. I have an e-mail from the finance and procurement team stating the latest grant figures for 2010-11: a total of £526.2 million, of which £484.8 million is ring-fenced and only £43.2 million is non-ring-fenced. When it comes to councillors being able to use the money and make changes according to their own lists of priorities, even major councils with overall budgets of about £1 billion have just a few tens of millions of pounds at the most. That is not the reason councillors-there are many former councillors in the Chamber-stood for election.</p>

 Does it not have a tremendously debilitating effect on both the quality of candidates and on voting, if people do not feel that councillors have real influence in the community or can make a difference? Is it not in many ways a reflection of the pretty poor state of British politics? Does it not in reality underline how the Executive continue to absorb powers whether from Parliament or by abstraction from local discretion?</p>

<p><a name="st_o373"><a name="10020392000052"><a name="100203-0019.htm_spnew7"><a name="10020392000197"><b>John Howell:</b>
 The hon. Gentleman makes some powerful points with which I agree. The Local Government Association has done some survey work showing that a large majority of people think that councillors should have the ability to make financial decisions. If anybody is to cut anything in their own area, they believe that it should be local councillors, who stood for their position, and over whom they have a great deal of democratic control and see regularly. I worry that if we carry on like this, it will be more and more difficult to recruit people to stand for election, because what will be the point of standing for election?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o385"><a name="100203-0019.htm_para18"><a name="10020392000053">The challenge of running an authority with a budget of £1 billion is completely frustrated when one gets down to the £20 million that can be distributed. The talent that is out there-the people who would otherwise come in and make a contribution-will simply go elsewhere, including to the golf course. I have nothing against golf, but if I had to choose between recommending that somebody play golf in their retirement and recommending that they be a councillor, I hope that I would be able to persuade them that it was still worth becoming a councillor.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o386"><a name="100203-0019.htm_para19"><a name="10020392000054">Ring-fencing has clearly made no impact whatever on the current situation. However, formal ring-fencing is only part of the problem, because even where it has been formally lifted and the funds transferred to the area-based grant-I am thinking of the Supporting People grant-it is still not possible to show genuine localism. Are the Government seriously saying that simply transferring the Supporting People grant to the area-based grant will give councillors the choice between spending on the Supporting People programme and spending on roads? That simply will not happen. In addition to legal ring-fencing, there is therefore also a practical ring-fencing that has happened with many grants, even where they have been shifted.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o387"><a name="100203-0019.htm_para20"><a name="10020392000055">We also need to focus again on the need for certainty. There are some examples, which I shall come to, of the Government creating considerable uncertainty about the funding for local councils. However, I do not accept the points made by the hon. Member for Wigan (Mr. Turner) about the reasons why his Government have not pursued a three-year settlement, particularly when the Local Government Association has shown that the funding gap by 2013-14 is likely to be in the region of £11 billion a year. That level of uncertainty is difficult for councils to live with.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o388"><a name="100203-0019.htm_para21"><a name="10020392000056">The Secretary of State also boasted of the overall increases in local government funding under this Government's administration. However, if he is going down that line, he has to look at the totality of individual councils' settlements. He can no longer concentrate on only one side of the profit and loss account. If he is going down that line, he has to accept the other side of the profit and loss account: the cost side, and the increases in those costs. Indeed, the percentage of expenditure that is borne by council tax increased from 22 per cent. in 1996-97 to 26 per cent. in 2006-07.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o389"><a name="100203-0020.htm_para0"><a name="10020392000057">Councils in my area have experienced a couple of issues that illustrate that point, and one of them is personal care at home. I know that that was covered in the House recently, but there are some specific issues about it, one of which is the cost. It is difficult to know what the cost will be. The Government have produced some airy figures, but it is difficult for councils to assess what the costs of the measure will be to them. First, there would be a loss of income from some of those who currently pay for care arranged by the council. Councils will need to assess what that loss might be, but that is not straightforward. It involves reviewing the detailed circumstances of everyone who currently receives domiciliary care to see whether they would be eligible for free personal care.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o390"><a name="100203-0020.htm_para1"><a name="10020392000058">Secondly, some people will have not presented themselves to adult social care, but will decide to come forward if they can obtain care for free. Trying to work out the figures for that is almost an imponderable, but given the experience in Scotland, they are likely to be great. The other aspect of personal care at home is about placing the risk and determining where it lies. Given that the amount of grant proposed for personal care at home in the area-based grant will be fixed, all the financial risk will be put on local authorities if the costs are higher than anticipated. The Association of Directors of Adult Social Services has already made its estimate, which is considerably higher than the original costing in the Budget. There is a review of that in 18 to 24 months, so that could leave significant pressure on councils until any changes are made.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o391"><a name="100203-0020.htm_para2"><a name="10020392000059">The council side of that funding is supposed to come out of more efficiency savings. I rather took exception to the Secretary of State's comment that, when councils had shared services and shared their management with the primary care trust or whatever, they could complain about being made to make efficiency savings. My own county council and district council have shared services that are in operation; in fact, I was the person at the county council who put that in. The councils have shared senior management. We share a director of public health with the PCT. My district council has shared management with the neighbouring district council. Both those councils have year after year had robust and aggressive efficiency saving targets, which year after year they have met.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o392"><a name="100203-0020.htm_para3"><a name="10020392000060">Perhaps in the winding-up speech the Minister, or if he would like to intervene now, the Secretary of State would like to tell me what I am supposed to tell councils such as my own, which have already gone through the pain of that, registered that pain with their voters, come through and increased their majority at the county council elections. They will feel insulted that they are dismissed in that way and that all that effort and pain was, in his idea of things, for nothing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o393"><a name="100203-0020.htm_para4"><a name="10020392000061">Two other issues arise in respect of pressures on funding. I have no idea how widespread those issues are. I suspect that one is more widespread than the other. One is unaccompanied asylum seeker children. There have been ongoing pressures in that area in Oxfordshire since 2002-03. There was a special circumstances grant of just under £500,000 in 2008 for 2008-09, but it does not reflect the ongoing shortfall, and the current forecast for 2009-10 is for an overspend of £800,000. There is no suggestion that that will be funded by central Government.</p>

That will pose a major challenge for directorates in county councils, which will have to reorganise their services to deliver what the Government want. There is not expected to be any additional funding to enable that to happen. There are burdens, too, from the micro-management of partnerships.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o395"><a name="100203-0020.htm_para6"><a name="10020392000063">At the evidence session on the Child Poverty Bill, Paul Carter, leader of Kent county council, discussed the big outcomes of the first round of local area agreements. He admitted to having been a sceptic initially, but he was won round by the size of the outcomes.

I will not detain the House by recapping the Bill, but broadly speaking, the Government set national targets in the first part of the Bill and then handed it all over-just dumped it-on to local government in the second part. They ignored the fact that many councils were already doing a tremendous amount of work, and they imposed a new duty that many people, including those we took evidence from, consistently said was not necessary.

words, how much would need to come from council tax-if the very secondary legislation was not there, not even in draft form, to enable such an assessment to be made? That is highly illustrative of the Government's approach and attitude towards local government.

 Many of us have confessed our local government experience, and I probably have more to confess in that respect than others, as I was elected to Croydon council in 1982, serving there until 2006, and I also served as a London Assembly Member. If I am allowed to be a little sentimental, I perhaps have an obsessive interest in local government financial settlement systems owing to the fact that my father was a senior civil servant who dealt with these issues in the 1970s, and matters associated with the Layfield report.</p>

Indeed, the amount given to local authorities has often been greater than the corresponding overall rate of growth in the UK economy.

 Speaking as someone from Croydon or for central London, I believe that the removal of the business rate has had a positive side, but it has had a negative effect on much of the rest of the country where there is little business. That is why, in my personal opinion, there must be equalisation across the country; otherwise many local authorities with no or next to no businesses will be savaged.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman has demonstrated his long-standing experience of local government, along with a recognition of the inevitability of Government involvement.

changes-what could be described as "population churn"-while also confronting the challenge posed by the Government's desire to remove a significant number of public sector jobs from the area.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o405"><a name="100203-0020.htm_para16"><a name="10020392000076">The Government are right to emphasise the £20 million of extra grant that Croydon will receive this year. There is no good reason why the borough should not be able to match the Labour authorities that are aiming for a zero per cent. increase-or, as that is rather a Brownism, perhaps I should say a freeze-in council tax. Nevertheless, Croydon has fundamental underlying problems.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o406"><a name="100203-0020.htm_para17"><a name="10020392000077">I will make only the briefest reference to a regional Select Committee, as another Member was chastised from the Chair in this regard. However, I think it is a positive result of the establishment of regional Select Committees that the London Committee is examining the important issue of the forthcoming census and its impact on local government financial settlements and other public sector flows.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o407"><a name="100203-0020.htm_para18"><a name="10020392000078">According to evidence given to the Committee by the London borough of Croydon, its population is likely to be 37,000 greater than the 340,800 that is presumed by the Office for National Statistics and used in local government financial settlement processes. Moreover, 41,034 migrants have registered with GPs in the last seven years, and 25,290 national insurance numbers have been given to non-British workers by Jobcentre Plus over the last three years. Those fundamental problems are undermining the credibility of the moneys given to the borough.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o408"><a name="100203-0020.htm_para19"><a name="10020392000079">The operation of the area cost adjustment and the distinction that is made between west and east London-Croydon being regarded as an east London authority-have led to a cumulative shortfall of £16 million. Obviously the operation of the ACA is valuable, but the way in which it is not applied to specific grants has a distorting and unhelpful impact on Croydon's allocations. The difference between the amount given to one authority and the amount given to another can be hard to explain. The London borough of Croydon considers itself to face challenges similar to those faced by the London borough of Enfield-in fact, I think it faces rather more severe challenges-but Enfield receives £423 per head, while Croydon receives £348. That is difficult for the authority to explain to local residents and taxpayers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o409"><a name="100203-0020.htm_para20"><a name="10020392000080">In addition, the authority could face significant pressures as a result of changes in the funding of the freedom pass in London. Given that support for London local government as a whole is to be reduced by £28.6 million, Croydon will lose £1.3 million. Croydon must also spend £1.9 million a year on supporting migrants-or asylum seekers-who, having exhausted the legal system, find themselves with no recourse to public funds. There has been considerable controversy about the decision to close the asylum walk-in centre in Liverpool and to concentrate activities in Croydon. I feel that the Home Office has turned a deaf ear to our concerns, and I have organised a petition on the issue which is securing a great deal of local support.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o410"><a name="100203-0020.htm_para21"><a name="10020392000081">I plead for the Department for Communities and Local Government to adopt a more open-minded approach, and to agree that, perhaps over the coming year, it will try to measure the number of additional asylum seekers who are resident in Croydon, in order to see whether the local authority's demand for a better allocation is fair.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o411"><a name="100203-0020.htm_para22"><a name="10020392000082">A couple of years ago, a former DCLG Minister, the current Minister for Borders and Immigration, the hon. Member for Oldham, East and Saddleworth (Mr. Woolas), got quite animated with me when I expressed concern about the amount of money that Croydon received, and reference was made to local enterprise growth initiative money. The point was made to me that £77 million of LEGI money came to Croydon, but in reality that money is not guaranteed, and there is a great deal of uncertainty as to whether it will continue to be given. That is an important concern.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o412"><a name="100203-0020.htm_para23"><a name="10020392000083">I am also worried about the negative effect on a very weak local economy of the supplementary business rate in terms of all of that money being abstracted from Croydon businesses and being spent entirely on Crossrail. That will have an adverse effect on potential positive investments in the business improvement district in Croydon.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o413"><a name="100203-0020.htm_para24"><a name="10020392000084">It is important that Croydon council aspires to achieve the same as some Labour councils in London have achieved: a council tax freeze this year. The incomes of many Croydon residents are either going down or are frozen, and they would find it entirely unaffordable to have yet another increase, especially bearing it in mind that the London Borough of Croydon has increased the council tax by the maximum amount allowed under the informal capping system. I am joined in this call for a council tax freeze by Labour councillors in Croydon, but they have no credibility as they previously increased the council tax by 27 per cent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o414"><a name="100203-0020.htm_para25"><a name="10020392000085">Let me turn now to a matter of great concern, on which I hope the Minister will be able to help. At a time when Croydon council is making real cuts-not merely efficiencies-in services, it has arranged for a loan of £145 million in order to build a new town hall. In addition, there is the prospect of £93 million of interest payments until 2036, making a total of £238 million. Considerable concern has been expressed to me by residents who have received a communication from the Labour party suggesting that the total cost will be £1,115 per household. That is a kind underestimate, as it does not take account of interest payments. The real cost for residents is £2,016 per household.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o415"><a name="100203-0020.htm_para26"><a name="10020392000086">I well remember the very important speech given by Neil Kinnock at a Labour party conference about how it was obscene to see Derek Hatton's Liverpool council issuing redundancy notices by taxi. In some ways, I think it is similarly wrong for Croydon council to be setting about cutting services while at the same time putting aside the equivalent of £3.5 million a year to service such a large loan for such a project. Now is not the time to be building a new council headquarters for the benefit of councillors.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman has identified an interesting trend. The proudest boast of the leader of Hammersmith and Fulham council is that he has got rid of 1,000 jobs in the last three years-he has sacked 1,000 people in the middle of a recession-yet that same council is investing £35 million in a new extension to the town hall. These municipal monstrosities are examples of just the sort of grandiose projects of local government that we thought were things of the past, but they are not. This is not only happening in Croydon, therefore.</p>

 I am extremely interested to hear that similar projects are being pursued elsewhere in London. It has always been a great weakness of local government and local councillors that they are obsessed with the grandiose, and with aggrandisement at home in the town hall, when it is services that are important. It is wrong that services are being cut back at the same time as such new projects are being taken on. This loan with the Public Works Loan Board is in place, but it has not yet been drawn down. Will the Minister have an opportunity to assess whether this really is appropriate behaviour? I know that our appropriate approach is to say that local authorities should be given discretion to make their own mistakes, but I think that this mistake will fall very heavily on Croydon council tax payers in future, particularly given that the local authority refuses to provide much detail on what the contract involves. It has been taken out in partnership with John Laing plc, which is no longer a public company-it is in the ownership of a private equity fund. Bearing in mind the difficult state in which private equity finds itself in terms of financing from the City, this is a dangerous circumstance for the local authority to have involved itself in.</p>

<p><a name="st_o379"><a name="10020392000089"><a name="100203-0020.htm_spnew5"><a name="10020392000203"><b>Bob Spink (Castle Point) (Ind):</b>
 The hon. Gentleman may be surprised to learn that the same problem occurred in Castle Point a few years ago under a Conservative Administration. It built what is known locally as "the bunker", spending millions of pounds in the process. That has proved to be a very expensive waste, it is much underused and local people are still paying for it.</p>

<p><a name="st_o380"><a name="10020392000090"><a name="100203-0020.htm_spnew6"><a name="10020392000204"><b>Mr. Pelling:</b>
 A worrying trend is being revealed in this debate. It is incumbent on local authorities to be concerned primarily about services, rather than about building new town halls. If Croydon council desires to move location, the best way of doing so would be for it to become a tenant of Stanhope, which has the real desire to start developing on the site next to East Croydon station. No doubt many Members have taken a flight from Gatwick and seen the desolate site next to that station, which gives a bad impression of the town. If the development of that site can begin, that would provide confidence to others to invest in the town. Such an approach from the local authority would have more vision and would have a multiplier effect on investor confidence in Croydon.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o416"><a name="100203-0020.htm_para27"><a name="10020392000091">It is also important to stress that local authorities face great dangers in being obsessed with their own party political propaganda. In many ways, I can often see little difference between what is produced by the chief executive's office and by the campaign of the Conservative parliamentary candidate in Croydon, Central. A recent example of that could be seen during the launch of a petition calling for extra police for Croydon. It is extraordinary that the council should be campaigning for extra police given that it has discretion to provide funding for extra police and that it is of the same party as the Mayor of London, who could decide to provide more police to Croydon. Indeed, the local London Assembly member, Steve O'Connell, is also chairman of the finance sub-committee that could decide to provide extra money for police. It is nonsense, and it is an abuse, for Croydon council to be spending money on this matter, given that at the same time as the council launched the petition it was also launched through e-mails from the Conservative parliamentary candidate.  <br>

It is an inappropriate use of public money to have such a close relationship between a parliamentary campaign and the spending of council money.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o417"><a name="100203-0020.htm_para28"><a name="10020392000092">As many Members have said in Westminster Hall debates, there are also great dangers in councils trying to get into the media business. The number of newspapers being produced by councils is unacceptable and risks undermining things. I know that the hon. Member for Ealing, Acton and Shepherd's Bush (Mr. Slaughter), who takes a great interest in the performance of Hammersmith and Fulham council, has been very critical of the way in which his local authority does that. I believe that the <i> Your Croydon</i> newspaper wrongly continues to be run so closely with the Conservative parliamentary party campaign and to give great prominence to things during this election purdah period.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o418"><a name="100203-0020.htm_para29"><a name="10020392000093">Finally, I wish to return to the issue of the role of business, because the pro-business borough was at the very heart of Croydon's success in the 1960s. I know that, in many ways, the approach taken then had many weaknesses: it was very municipalist and dirigiste, and it was perhaps a little old-fashioned compared with the more appropriately aggressive and laissez-faire approach taken in the London borough of Wandsworth. Nevertheless, co-ordination and co-operation between the council and businesses has an important role to play.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o419"><a name="100203-0020.htm_para30"><a name="10020392000094">It is fundamental to note that moneys are taken away through the business rate and the supplementary business rate, but we have no prospect of any of that supplementary business rate being reinvested in Croydon's economy. We need to deal with the significant issue of trying to improve confidence and reduce the fear of crime in the centre of Croydon-a justifiable fear, bearing in mind the number of killings that we have had along the A23 corridor-and of trying to leave some money behind. May I call on the Government-I know that the London Mayor also has some discretion-to try to use their persuasive powers so that some of that money comes back?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o420"><a name="100203-0020.htm_para31"><a name="10020392000095">I am very impressed by the campaign that is being run by Max Menon of Allders, the only remaining Allders store in the country. Calling for some discretion and for moneys to be returned to Croydon means that we can defend an exposed and fragile economy that, unfortunately, has not been helped by some real lack of vision from the local authority in Croydon.</p>

 First, I thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, for the opportunity to raise this issue in the House. Yemen used to be perceived as being in the backwaters of the middle east, but recent events have put it under the international spotlight.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o448"><a name="100203-0021.htm_para27"><a name="10020392000129">Before I proceed, let me declare my interest in Yemen, which is registered in the Register of Members' Financial Interests. I am also the chairman of the all-party group on Yemen and have a personal interest to declare. I was born in Aden, Yemen, in 1956. My parents had gone there for economic reasons from Mumbai, India, and settled in the then British-occupied south Yemen. I spent the first nine years of my life there, before leaving with my family to escape the mounting conflict. I still feel strongly attached to that beautiful country and I have vivid memories of my early childhood there. I was educated at St. Joseph's convent school, and, as a young child, I used to sit and watch the ships as they prepared to go up the Suez canal.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o449"><a name="100203-0021.htm_para28"><a name="10020392000130">The last few weeks have seen some very dramatic events concerning Yemen. International attention has been rapid, and these events continue to unfold on a daily basis.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o450"><a name="100203-0021.htm_para29"><a name="10020392000131">I want to thank the Yemeni ambassador to London, His Excellency Mohamed Taha Mustafa, for the role that he and his predecessors have played in ensuring that, despite its size and previous isolation, Yemen is a country that commands the interest of this House and this Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o451"><a name="100203-0021.htm_para30"><a name="10020392000132">I also want to thank the members of the all-party group-the hon. Members for The Wrekin (Mark Pritchard), for East Worthing and Shoreham (Tim Loughton), and for Rutland and Melton (Alan Duncan), and Lord Lea and Lord Kilclooney-for attending a meeting that I organised only a week ago with Dr. Abu Bakr al-Qirbi, the Foreign Minister of Yemen, prior to the very successful Yemen conference.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o452"><a name="100203-0021.htm_para31"><a name="10020392000133">I welcomed the Yemen conference, which took place on 27 January. Our present Prime Minister is the first person in his position to have decided to focus, laser like, on the problems in Yemen and on the country's importance for regional and global security. I also want to thank the Foreign Office and my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary for ensuring, before the conference, that we built up relationships with the country. As a result, the conference was very much an end-product of dialogue and assistance that had been going on for some time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o453"><a name="100203-0021.htm_para32"><a name="10020392000134">As I speak in the House tonight, the Minister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office, my hon. Friend the Member for Bury, South (Mr. Lewis), is actually in Sana'a. He went there following the conference in order to continue with the relationship that I have described. It is for that reason that the response to this debate will be made by my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for International Development. I think that the Foreign Office looked hard and far for a Minister to answer the debate, but they are spread all over Britain, if not the world. However, I am glad to see my hon.  <br>

Friend here, as he has had many discussions with me about Yemen, and has done a great deal of work in his Department in respect of international development in the country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o454"><a name="100203-0021.htm_para33"><a name="10020392000135">Only today, and despite his very busy schedule, I and members of the all-party group had a meeting with my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister. We discussed many important issues in connection with Yemen, and I am very grateful for the time that he made available to us.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o455"><a name="100203-0021.htm_para34"><a name="10020392000136">On Monday, the Foreign Secretary spoke about the need for deeds, not words. He was right. What we need are practical steps to be taken now, and pledges of aid to Yemen must be delivered immediately. As the Minister knows, we are still waiting for the pledges made at the 2006 Lancaster house conference to be realised. A total of £3 billion was promised by those who came to London to pledge support for Yemen, but only 7 per cent. of that has been paid over so far.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o456"><a name="100203-0021.htm_para35"><a name="10020392000137">Yemen is a country of legends, and its history is fascinating. It was rumoured to be the route taken by the three wise men. If that was not the case, it certainly heralded the start of the frankincense trail. The Queen of Sheba had her palace in Yemen.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o457"><a name="100203-0021.htm_para36"><a name="10020392000138">As the House knows, Ali Abdullah Saleh was elected President of Yemen at reunification in 1990. I pay tribute to him for all that he has done for his country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o458"><a name="100203-0021.htm_para37"><a name="10020392000139">Yemen is situated at a key position on the Saudi Arabian peninsula. It is strategically placed above the horn of Africa, and lies across the most utilised international shipping route. Its security, and the maintenance of stability there, are of vital interest-not only to Yemen but to all countries, both in the region and internationally.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o459"><a name="100203-0021.htm_para38"><a name="10020392000140">Political unrest has caused much trouble for the Yemeni Government since reunification in 1990. It led to the emergence of a separatist movement in the south and the rebellion of a minority sect of Muslims in the north that is now referred to as the Houthi rebellion. The Yemeni Government are addressing the unrest on both sides, while ensuring that unity remains.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o460"><a name="100203-0021.htm_para39"><a name="10020392000141">What has concerned us is the recent strengthening of terrorist cells in Yemen. This has meant that the Yemeni Government must additionally face an even more dangerous threat on another front. Terrorists bring the internal risk of disfranchised Yemenis being enticed into terrorist activities to undermine the Government. Effectively, that would rapidly lead to Yemen becoming a failed state- fragmented, drawn into a humanitarian crisis, and encouraging conflict beyond its borders.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o461"><a name="100203-0021.htm_para40"><a name="10020392000142">I know that some have described Yemen as a failed state, and I keep reminding Ministers that it is not a failed state. It has the capacity to become a failed state if we fail to support it. As the Minister will know, its commitment to democracy is much better than that of many other countries in the region. However, it is important that in pushing the case for reform, we do so with the Government of Yemen, who are committed to reform. They are aware of the need to reform, and they are aware that unless there are reforms, there will be internal schisms. Tackling corruption and improving co-operation with the Opposition was the first item on the agenda, to be achieved through a commitment to daily dialogue with the Opposition and by the establishment of a national anti-corruption authority.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o462"><a name="100203-0022.htm_para0"><a name="10020392000143">As well as political reforms, development and counter-radicalisation in Yemen should be our Government's main focus. Yemen has dwindling oil reserves. It has never had oil reserves like those of Saudi Arabia, for example, and the reserves that it had are dwindling. It has little water and has been deprived of international aid for decades, even after it was severely affected by the repercussions of the first Gulf war.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o463"><a name="100203-0022.htm_para1"><a name="10020392000144">America recently pledged £62 million to Yemen, which is up from zero, its previous support. Focusing aid on developing education institutions, infrastructure, employment and export diversification is vital. Counter-radicalisation is intrinsically connected to development and securing long-term jobs. Some 35 per cent. of Yemenis live below the poverty line, 65 per cent. are under 25, and 18 per cent. under 18. Therefore a large, idle and desperate population is being increasingly wooed by al-Qaeda and become increasingly vulnerable to its activities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o464"><a name="100203-0022.htm_para2"><a name="10020392000145">Counter-radicalisation seizes terrorism at the root. The current growth of terrorist networks must be dealt with through immediate action by establishing an effective system of counter-terrorism. This should avoid imposing a military presence or giving such an impression to the Yemenis, especially in light of their previous hostility to American involvement in the region. Providing weapons, equipment and intelligence assistance is the most effective way in which Yemen can combat terrorists within its borders.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o465"><a name="100203-0022.htm_para3"><a name="10020392000146">For example, Yemen needs help to develop an effective system of verification. Owing to a lack of helicopters, Yemeni security forces must rely on reports of nearby tribal leaders to confirm those dead or wounded after attacks on terrorist hideouts in the mountains. It is important that if al-Qaeda leaders are killed or prevented from engaging in action, that is independently verified.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o466"><a name="100203-0022.htm_para4"><a name="10020392000147">Therefore the creation and development of an efficient system of intelligence and information exchange within the Yemeni security services is extremely important. The US has 550 suspects on the "most wanted" list, but little is known of their whereabouts and the role in al-Qaeda of each of these suspects. Although this is a difficult starting point, building a system of counter-terrorism for the Yemeni security services will help enormously. That is why it is vital that we have dialogue. Without dialogue, we have real problems.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o467"><a name="100203-0022.htm_para5"><a name="10020392000148">We must also keep an eye on the areas beyond Yemen's borders which affect its internal instability through terrorist infiltration. The development of a lawless zone stretching from northern Kenya, Somalia, Eritrea and the Gulf of Aden to Saudi Arabia, is a real fear. We know that extremist groups are already involved in activities in the horn of Africa. We know of the piracy that occurs between Somalia and Yemen. It is extremely important that we provide effective resources for the Yemeni Government to deal with that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o468"><a name="100203-0022.htm_para6"><a name="10020392000149">Some of the security issues can be addressed immediately. Sadly, Yemenia Airways, the national airline of Yemen, has had its flights between London and Yemen cancelled since 20 January. I raised the matter with the Prime Minister today. I understand perfectly the concerns of the Department for Transport. It wants to make sure that when people board flights on Yemenia or from other countries, they are properly searched and scanned before they arrive in the United Kingdom. We heard on Tuesday that at Manchester airport and Heathrow,  <br>

<notus-date day="3" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><b>3 Feb 2010 : Column 415</b><br>
body scanners are to be rolled out. When we go to through those airports, Members of the House and everyone else will have to go through a full body scanner. If that is the case for this country, surely we can give Yemen one body scanner, so that it can be used at Sana'a airport. The Foreign Secretary talked about a comprehensive approach, but it is important that we look at practical help. We should not wait for reports to be considered by Cabinet Committees; we should act immediately to help those in Yemen who are our friends.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o469"><a name="100203-0022.htm_para7"><a name="10020392000150">We also need to look at what is happening within our borders. The President and the Government of Yemen have complained on numerous occasions about the existence on British soil of radio stations that go out of their way to make anti-Yemeni and anti-Government statements calling for the overthrow of the democratically elected Government in Yemen. We must do as much as we can to ensure that our territory-our land-is not used for those purposes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o470"><a name="100203-0022.htm_para8"><a name="10020392000151">Another concern is the British hostages who are held in Yemen. Discussions are ongoing, and I thank the Minister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office, the hon. Member for Bury, South, who flew to Yemen yesterday, for inviting me and other members of the all-party group on Yemen to join him on that mission. That was a wonderful gesture in view of the group's work. Unfortunately, owing to other duties, I could not go with him, but he does not need me to accompany him, because he will do a very good job himself.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o471"><a name="100203-0022.htm_para9"><a name="10020392000152">We want to ensure that there are practical steps, however, so here is my shopping list, which I have passed on to the Under-Secretary of State for International Development, so that he knows what I am shopping for in today's debate. There should be funding for development and the security services. Let us not wait any longer; let us deliver it now. We are doing our bit, but what about the other countries that pledged £3 billion four years ago? There should also be technical assistance, through the provision of weapons and training, so that we can engage the Yemeni forces and they can stop their country falling into the hands of those who wish to destroy it. There should be more effective intelligence. We have the best intelligence services in the world, so why do we not work with them to provide that help? We should continue to do what the Minister is doing so effectively: providing development aid. What he is doing will benefit people not so much in the short term, although there are immediate benefits, but in the long term. Let us try to get Yemen admitted to the Gulf Co-operation Council. Let us see whether it can be admitted to the Commonwealth, which it is entitled to join, because Aden was a British colony.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o472"><a name="100203-0022.htm_para10"><a name="10020392000153">In addition, I put to the Prime Minister an idea, which I hope that he will take up, to create a task force for Yemen, because he himself knows the importance of the matter. The task force should include some parliamentarians, British business men, officials from the Foreign and Commonwealth office and others-anybody who will try to help us keep Yemen stable. It would go hand in hand with the measures that Britain has already undertaken. I do not call for the appointment of an envoy, because that would take too long and what would they do? We have some wonderful Foreign Office Ministers who can do that job, but let us support them by creating a task force for Yemen. Let us not leave the situation as it is; let us do something positive.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o473"><a name="100203-0022.htm_para11"><a name="10020392000154">The Government of Yemen are more than willing to co-operate to combat the ills that face their country, and to deal with counter-terrorism. Economic growth, elite compliance and state stability will be welcomed, too, so long as they arrive with a good level of non-interference in Yemen's socio-cultural issues and institutional reform. To quote Dr. al-Kurbi, one of the longest-serving Foreign Ministers in the Gulf, who qualified as a doctor in our country-at Edinburgh university-and therefore knows and has great respect of our country:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o474"><a name="100203-0022.htm_para12"><a name="10020392000155">We should assist in tackling those challenges, resolving those problems and ensuring that people's expectations are not in vain. Now that the media frenzy is over, now that the television camera crews have packed their bags and left the Yemen conference and now that the international spotlight has grown a little dimmer, I urge the Minister, despite the huge amount of issues facing Foreign Office and Department for International Development Ministers, to keep our focus on Yemen. We should help them to help themselves. That would be a truly great legacy for this Government as far as foreign policy is concerned-not dealing with this after the event but preventing Yemen from falling into the same kind of disrepair and disillusionment as Afghanistan or Iraq. Because of the respect that Yemenis have for our country, this whole goal-the future of this country-is also in our hands.</p>

 I congratulate my right hon. Friend the Member for Leicester, East (Keith Vaz) on securing this debate and on giving the House an opportunity to have this discussion, and I thank him for his kind words. I know that he has a genuine and long-standing interest in the future of Yemen and its people. That is an interest that the Government share, reaffirmed following my visit to the country last year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o475"><a name="100203-0022.htm_para13"><a name="10020396000006">As my right hon. Friend pointed out, Yemen is a country that is beset by challenges. Fresh water resources are rapidly running out, its population is set to double within the next 20 years, and unemployment already stands at 35 per cent. At the same time, governance is weak, and there is ongoing conflict and political tension. In short, we are talking about a country that has been poor, is poor, and without action will be poor for the foreseeable future. Its development and humanitarian needs are as significant as they are clear to everyone.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o476"><a name="100203-0022.htm_para14"><a name="10020396000007">That is why the Department for International Development has long recognised Yemen to be a country desperately in need of international aid and support. We have stepped up our commitment considerably over the past five years; indeed, in 2007 we signed a 10-year development partnership agreement with the country, which was a signal of our intent. As the Foreign Secretary noted in his statement to the House on 5 of January, a renewed UK country strategy for Yemen was developed in September 2009. That set out our priorities and, crucially, made it clear that we are ready to offer our long-term support. The document and the rationale behind it met with agreement from right across this House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o477"><a name="100203-0022.htm_para15"><a name="10020396000008">Since then, of course, Yemen has acquired a much higher profile internationally, with December's attempted bombing making headlines around the world. My right hon. Friend will be aware of the potential role of al-Qaeda and the related terrorist activity in Yemen, which are matters of grave concern to the UK Government. However, let me be clear. Our view, and that of many Foreign Ministers who gathered in London last week, is that such activity is a symptom, albeit a corrosive one, of wider problems within Yemen. To treat that symptom, we need to treat the cause, and that is poverty: poverty of resource, poverty of means, and poverty of opportunity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o478"><a name="100203-0022.htm_para16"><a name="10020396000009">That is why in recent weeks we have moved quickly to see what we could do to encourage the international community in its support for Yemen. The Foreign Ministers' meeting in London last week, convened by the Prime Minister and attended by Yemeni Prime Minister Mujawar, had three main objectives: first, to forge an international consensus about the nature of the challenges that face Yemen; secondly, to build an impetus behind the economic and governance reform agenda; and thirdly, to improve the way that we co-ordinate international aid that goes to Yemen.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o479"><a name="100203-0022.htm_para17"><a name="10020396000010">In his statement to the House earlier this week, the Foreign Secretary outlined what had been agreed at that meeting. I can reiterate today that everybody present agreed that the main responsibility for tackling Yemen's problems lies with Yemen itself. However, the international community is ready to stand by Yemen and to offer its support, both in addressing the challenges presented by al-Qaeda, including through enforcing all relevant United Nations sanctions, and in helping the Government to tackle the political, social, governance and economic challenges that they face.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o480"><a name="100203-0022.htm_para18"><a name="10020396000011">The agenda is both short term and long term. Short-term support will be provided through a new Friends of Yemen Group, which will act as a kind of critical friend, ready to challenge, question and advise the Yemeni Government. This will be particularly important as Yemen faces up to some tough decisions on how and where it should focus its energies. The first meeting of that group will take place in the Gulf in late March, and it will discuss how Yemen can best deliver much-needed economic and governance reforms and tackle the challenges and instability that it faces.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o481"><a name="100203-0022.htm_para19"><a name="10020396000012">During the London meeting, the Yemeni Government and the International Monetary Fund reaffirmed their agreement to talks to establish an IMF programme for Yemen. That is extremely encouraging and should help Yemen identify ways to tackle some of the most immediate economic problems, including the burden placed on its budget by national fuel subsidies and the civil service wage bill. If that process is successful, it should encourage other donors to align their funding accordingly, potentially making funding streams more effective.</p>

<p><a name="st_o387"><a name="10020396000013"><a name="100203-0022.htm_spnew0"><a name="10020396001325"><b>Keith Vaz:</b>
 I thank my hon. Friend for what he has said so far, but I still cannot understand how, after the conference that we hosted at Lancaster house in November 2006-a wonderful decision by the Government, and we have always hosted such conferences-£3 billion was pledged but only 7 per cent. has been paid. What has happened to the other 93 per cent.? Who is not paying?</p>

 I hope to come to that point, and indeed I turn now to the very subject of aid. The secretary-general of the Gulf Co-operation Council has called a meeting of donors to discuss the barriers to disbursing aid in Yemen. Securing progress by the Government of Yemen on key economic and government reforms is critical to that, as is the capacity of the Government to absorb funds. The GCC meeting is specifically intended to identify barriers to the disbursement of Gulf donor funds.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o482"><a name="100203-0022.htm_para20"><a name="10020396000015">As my right hon. Friend acknowledged, disbursement has been limited ever since the 2006 London consultative group meeting, at which some $5 billion of support was pledged. That money, together with funding from other donors, will help Yemen diversify its economy. That is particularly crucial given that its oil reserves, which represent some 90 per cent. of the country's export revenue, are expected to run out within the next 10 years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o483"><a name="100203-0022.htm_para21"><a name="10020396000016">In the short term, the Yemeni Government need support in delivering basic services and providing jobs for their people, and we can help on that. However, they themselves need to take the critical decisions that will reverse Yemen's trajectory by delivering services, stabilising the economy, tackling terrorist activity and resolving conflict. They need the political will to do that. I know that the challenge is immense, but it must be co-ordinated if we are to stand a chance of success.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o484"><a name="100203-0022.htm_para22"><a name="10020396000017">Long-term support for Yemen is also needed to help it develop new markets, invest in its future and create job opportunities. However, economic growth will also depend in part on Yemen's ability to resolve conflict and strengthen its governance, including by tackling corruption. Conflict can disrupt internal trade and discourage investment. Indeed, the evidence that we have suggests that it can reduce a country's growth by more than 2 per cent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o485"><a name="100203-0022.htm_para23"><a name="10020396000018">We do not want Yemen to fail. Its problems are complex and will be addressed only through concerted and sustained effort on the part of the international community and, most importantly, on the part of Yemen itself.</p>

<p><a name="st_o389"><a name="10020396000019"><a name="100203-0022.htm_spnew2"><a name="10020396001327"><b>Keith Vaz:</b>
 Obviously my hon. Friend was not at the meeting with the Prime Minister, because I know he has his own engagements. Will he consider the idea of a taskforce on Yemen, which would deal not only with Government-to-Government contact but with people-to-people contact? There are many Yemenis in this country. As he knows, I am not a Yemeni-I am of Indian origin, although I was born in Yemen. However, there are many Yemenis in places such as Cardiff, the Foreign Secretary's constituency of South Shields and elsewhere. It will be helpful if we can provide something more than just Government-to-Government contact, especially as far as trade and industry are concerned.</p>

 I accept totally what my right hon. Friend says about the contacts that exist in the UK and our good will towards Yemen. I will consider his suggestion and also offer him opportunities to raise it with others in the very near future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o486"><a name="100203-0022.htm_para24"><a name="10020396000021">Yemen has many friends beyond the UK, including the United States, the European Union and the GCC. Together with those partners, we stand ready to help  <br>
