 At each stage, I have set out to the House what the Government propose to do and what the cost is. In relation to the purchase of a shareholding, the Government purchased shares, and that came to a total of &#163;37 billion. That was part of the recapitalisation process. I have to tell the hon. Gentleman that that part of the Government&#146;s proposals over the past few months was supported by hon. Members on both sides of the House. It was recognised as being absolutely necessary to recapitalise the banks because we were within hours of the banking system collapsing last October; that is why we did it.</p>

Gentleman asks about other measures that we have put in place&#151;for example, the special liquidity scheme, which I announced in April last year and of which the Bank of England reported last week that about &#163;185 billion has been taken up. That has been more than covered by the collateral lodged by banks, which is over &#163;240 billion, and in addition the Government charge fees that total about &#163;2 billion for that. That is just one example of where we have given guarantees that are just that&#151;guarantees, not money that is being paid out at the moment. I believe that the range of measures that we have taken&#151;other countries around the world have done the same or similar&#151;was absolutely necessary. What I really find surprising is that having supported us last October the hon. Gentleman is now attempting to run away from the decisions that we all took then.</p>

 Let me make a couple of points to my hon. Friend. First, as he is no doubt well aware, because this matter is currently before the courts there is a limit  <br>

<notus-date day="12" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><b>12 Feb 2009 : Column 1497</b><br>
to what I can say. As a matter of general principle, Ministers do not normally comment on the individual circumstances of any taxpayer, corporate or individual, for perfectly good reasons. However, I can say to him that the so-called double dip scheme was shut down by the Government in 2005. In addition, anti-avoidance measures that we have introduced have saved the taxpayer about &#163;11 billion over the past couple of years. On top of that, from 2004 schemes of this sort have had to be reported to HMRC to ensure that if there is abuse or if any measures that are being taken have unintended consequences that are harming the taxpayer, action can be taken very promptly. That will remain the case. At each Budget, I will ensure that if there are loopholes that need to be closed, we will take the action necessary.</p>

 Can it really be right that the body looking after the taxpayer&#146;s interest in these two banks should be chaired by Mr. Moreno, who appears to have been heavily involved in tax-dodging in Liechtenstein?

 Is it not becoming increasingly clear to the Chancellor that the ferocious resistance of the management of these banks to the Government&#146;s full takeover of them, albeit on a temporary basis, is motivated by a desire to protect bonuses and salaries, to resist write-downs and loss declarations and to protect cynical tax avoidance schemes?

 I do not agree with everything that the hon. Gentleman says.

 I think that the answer to my hon. Friend the Member for Sevenoaks (Mr. Fallon) means that the Government are about to lose their second key banking adviser, but may I ask about the resignation of the first? Are we really expected to believe that when the Prime Minister appointed Sir James Crosby to the board of the Financial Services Authority, and when the current Chancellor promoted him to the job of deputy chairman in 2007, neither of them had any idea that they were appointing someone whose business model at HBOS was being investigated by the regulator whose board they were appointing him to?</p>

 As the Prime Minister has just told the Liaison Committee, Sir James&#146;s appointment in 2003 was made on the recommendation of a selection panel that followed an open competition, and that panel, which was chaired by the senior official then responsible for banking regulation, Sir James Sassoon, recommended the appointment of James Crosby. At that time, there was no reason to question that appointment. With the benefit of hindsight, many people now make claims about what they say they knew at that time, but the then Chancellor followed the proper procedures and followed the advice, and he had no reason not to make the appointment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o5"><a name="90212-0001.htm_para5"><a name="09021256000046">The FSA has said that in 2002, and subsequently, it drew attention to a number of concerns, as it did with several other organisations. In terms of the law, the way in which the FSA supervises any bank, let alone this one, is a matter for it. Neither the subsequent investigation into the allegations made against James Crosby, nor the concerns that it had, were reported to the Treasury. I would not expect them to have been, given the information that I have from the chief executive of the FSA at the moment.</p>

 Either the Chancellor knew what was going on and did nothing, or he was entirely ignorant, and neither is much of a defence. Is not the net closing in on the Prime Minister and the Chancellor? Their accomplices are resigning, their alibi that no one knew what was going on has been blown apart, and their fingerprints are all over the mistakes that were made during the age of irresponsibility.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o6"><a name="90212-0001.htm_para6"><a name="09021256000048">Is there a coherent view in the Cabinet about how long this recession will last?

Is the Health Secretary expressing the collective view of the Government on this issue?</p>

 In relation to the FSA, the hon. Gentleman&#146;s claims are frankly ridiculous. Appointments were made in the normal way, which is a great deal more open than for some of the appointments that were made in the past.

I am clear, though, that if we had followed the hon. Gentleman&#146;s advice and done absolutely nothing to prevent the full effects of the recession from being felt, the impact and the long-term damage to this country would have been substantial. I believe that the action that we have taken is not only justified but will ensure that this recession will be shorter and less painful than would otherwise be the case.

As the hon. Gentleman will know, in addition to the current temporary disclosure regime, the FSA is proposing greater transparency in short selling more generally.

 Perhaps we should demystify short selling a little. I do not know whether the hon.

That is short-selling activity. We believe&#151;and the markets understand&#151;that short selling can help facilitate price discovery, which is important for valuing companies fairly, price efficiency and liquidity in the market. However, we need to ensure great transparency about the matter. We do not want to go back to the days of George Soros, speculation, and major runs on companies and countries. That is why the disclosure regime is important.</p>

 The action we took in October prevented the collapse of the banking system. That, together with the measures that I announced in the pre-Budget report, continues to support businesses and families in this country.</p>

 I thank my right hon. Friend for that reply. Given the amount of toxic debt in the system, will he consider creating a public-private investment fund, designed to remove toxic debt from financial institutions&#146; balance sheets? Or perhaps he favours the Credit Suisse model of banks creating internal hedge funds in which they put their toxic debts to pay directors&#146; bonuses.</p>

 My hon. Friend is right that different solutions are being developed across the world to deal with the basic problem, which is that far too many banks have assets that either turn bad or have clearly reduced in value because of the economic downturn.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o8"><a name="90212-0002.htm_para0"><a name="09021256000068">The new United States Administration have proposed the first suggestion that my hon. Friend made&#151;a joint venture by Government and the private sector&#151;although the details have still to be worked up. I said on 19 January that, in this country, we wanted to develop an insurance scheme, whereby the Government could provide back-stop insurance for some assets. That would remove some of the uncertainty in the system, which holds back banks&#146; ability to lend to businesses and people in this country. I also said that we have not closed our minds to the creation of a so-called bad bank. Indeed, we did precisely that in the case of Bradford &amp; Bingley&#151;we split the bank between the part that took deposits, which is still viable and was sold to Santander, and the long-term liabilities, which have been kept and run down. There are a variety of solutions to the problem.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o9"><a name="90212-0002.htm_para1"><a name="09021256000069">The main problem, as I said in reply to the hon. Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable), is that we need to get banks to realise and disclose the extent of the liabilities as soon as possible. Until that uncertainty comes out of the system, banks will continue to be reluctant to lend to each other and to their customers, not only here but throughout the world.</p>

 The proper test of the effectiveness of the recapitalisation scheme is the willingness of the banks to continue viable lending. Unfortunately, the failure of that willingness has led to a viable, profitable, long-term and well respected company in my constituency having to declare 1,000 job losses, 400 in my constituency and in that of the Health Secretary. That is a failure of the recapitalisation regime, of the credit guarantee regime and of the Treasury, in not intervening. Will the Chancellor undertake now to intervene in the case of the finance company Cattles, to ensure that the credit guarantee scheme underpins it?</p>

 There are two issues there. First, I do not agree with the right hon. Gentleman in relation to the recapitalisation scheme that I announced in October. It was there primarily to stop the banking system collapsing. That was the scheme&#146;s purpose, and it was supported by all parties in the House at the time. I appreciate that since then it has been convenient for his party to run away from that, but that is why the scheme was there. In relation to his general point about lending, he is right  <br>

that the crucial thing is for us to try to get lending going as quickly as possible. The recapitalisation was of course necessary, because if there were no banks, there could not be any lending. That was the first stage. The measures that I announced in January are designed to do more to get lending going.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o10"><a name="90212-0002.htm_para2"><a name="09021256000072">In relation to Cattles, I am aware of the problem, which has been raised with me by other hon. Members in the House. In relation to the credit guarantee scheme, that is available to banks. That is what it was set up for and it has been run by the Bank of England. I am aware of the Cattle scheme and I will continue to keep the House informed on it.</p>

 Is my right hon. Friend aware that when the Conservative party was in power, unemployment in my constituency was 20 per cent.? Today it is less than 3 per cent. During that time we were told that high unemployment was a price worth paying and that if it was not hurting, it was not working. Is it not the case that today we are trying to prevent that scenario?</p>

 My hon. Friend is quite right. Yesterday&#146;s unemployment figures surely demonstrate the need to do more, not less, to help people who lose their jobs. The lesson from the 1980s is that the Government waited almost two years before they started to introduce any help, and most of that help was aimed at people who had been out of the labour market for some considerable time. As a result of that delay and doing nothing at that time, a whole generation of people was written off, and many of them never went back to work again. My hon. Friend and, I suspect, hon. Members in most parts of the House will have personal experience of knowing people who were in precisely that position.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o11"><a name="90212-0002.htm_para3"><a name="09021256000075">That is one of the reasons we set up Jobcentre Plus. We set it up in the good times, when unemployment was falling rapidly. We have given Jobcentre Plus more resources, in order to help people. Even today, the majority of people get back into work within six months of losing their jobs. We will continue to ensure that we put more money into the system to help people get back into work. There are nearly 500,000 vacancies in the economy. There are jobs; it is our job to match people up as soon as we can, preferably before they leave employment, in the event of being made redundant, and help them get back into work as quickly as possible. That is another example of where the Government can make a difference for the good.</p>

 A moment ago the Chancellor told my right hon. Friend the Member for Haltemprice and Howden (David Davis) that the primary purpose of the bank bail-out was to prop up the banks, but that is not how he described it when he made the announcement last October. He defined the criterion by which the effectiveness of that intervention was to be measured in these words:</p>

 No, and the hon. Gentleman well knows that what he is saying is absolute nonsense. The primary purpose of our intervention last October was to stop the banking system collapsing. Indeed, that is why he and his hon. Friends on the Front Bench supported us, so it is no good their now saying that they were not in favour of it and would have done something different. Of course, if there are no banks in the first place, there will be no lending, so propping them up was a precondition of getting lending going again. That is no more than a statement of the obvious.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o13"><a name="90212-0002.htm_para5"><a name="09021256000079">Since that time, there has been a substantial downturn of economies, not just here but in every country in the world. We can see that in all the forecasts and in all the figures that we know about at the present time. That is all the more reason for us to ensure that we get lending going again and help to fill the gap that has been left by foreign banks withdrawing from lending, not only in this country but in other parts of the world. It is also all the more reason for the Government to step in to help to support businesses and families.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o14"><a name="90212-0002.htm_para6"><a name="09021256000080">That approach is supported right across the world, and the Conservatives are virtually isolated as far as that is concerned. It has been backed by the independent Institute for Fiscal Studies&#151;which is often favourably cited by the Conservatives when it suits them&#151;and, even yesterday, the Bank of England&#146;s inflation report made the case that if Government support comes through, it will make a substantial difference to the position that would otherwise be the case. We are clear that supporting the banks and supporting our economy are absolutely essential, and I am sorry that the Conservative party cannot bring itself to give that support, because it is pretty essential for the future of our country.</p>

 My hon. Friend is right. Investigations have been launched, as she will know, to look at issues around diversity in the City and the way in which men and women have been paid, including bonuses, in the financial services industry. It is also, I think, important to recognise that there may be differences in the impact on employment. So far, unemployment over the past 12 months has increased by less for women than for men at the national level, but there are very wide variations at the regional level. My hon. Friend is also right to highlight the importance of looking at part-time employment. It is also the case that the tax credit system might help some people who see a cut in their wages, for example, as it can help to cushion them from the impact of what might otherwise be difficult circumstances.</p>

 Internal risk models for United Kingdom banks are required to be approved for use by the Financial Services Authority. Internal risk rating is complemented in the Basel II framework&#151;and, in EU law, the capital requirements directive&#151;by a requirement for supervisors to undertake supervisory reviews of the banks&#146; risks and make appropriate adjustments as required. The framework also incorporates a third pillar: disclosure of key supervisory requirements of a bank to ensure market discipline.</p>

 Northern Rock&#146;s banking practices were compliant with the Basel accords, so I think that this can be described as, in effect, a highway code written by boy racers. The system effectively hands all the risk assessment over to the banks themselves, and is fatally flawed as a result of being allied to a system of balkanised regulation.

 I believe that it is essential to have an independent regulator such as the FSA. Indeed, the hon. Gentleman might do well to remember that it replaced some seven or eight self-regulatory organisations that, for example, manifestly failed to prevent the mis-selling of pensions in the late 1980s. That is why we set it up. The FSA has a responsibility to regulate the financial services industry. It routinely raises concerns about firms from time to time. It would not routinely report those concerns to the Treasury unless at that time it felt that there was a major systemic risk. Clearly, it did not feel that such a risk was evident when it carried out its investigations, because it did not report any suspicions to the Treasury at any point. However, I do not think that one can argue from that that there should not be independent regulation of the financial services industry. That position is just patent nonsense.</p>

 Yes, we have, and I agree with the point that I think that the hon. Gentleman is getting at. Credit rating agencies are a useful aid to decision making, but they cannot be a substitute for decision making on the part of boardrooms. People need to decide whether a risk is good or not or, if there is a risk, how they are going to price it. To do that, they should, of course, refer to credit rating agencies but that should not be the last word. Other issues are involved, such as the conflict of interest that arises when credit rating agencies certify products in which they have a financial interest.

 May I thank the Leader of the House for giving us the business?

Can she explain, for instance, why the Secretary of State for Health seems to want to deny Members the opportunity to debate a key matter such as dementia? Moreover, we have been waiting for the child health strategy for five months. It is a very important issue, yet it has only been announced today in a written statement. Indeed, today, as we rise for a half-term break, we find that there are no fewer than 39 written ministerial statements published.

We very much hope that such a statement will be delivered to the House, and that he will practise properly in front of the mirror beforehand. Is it his intention, in that same statement, to confirm the status of Glen Moreno, who chairs the trust that holds the shares that bought the banks that saved the world, albeit, sadly, through tax havens in Liechtenstein? With Sir James Crosby being sacked yesterday, and Mr. Moreno being downgraded a few minutes later, is it now confirmed that Mr. Moreno is on the way out altogether?</p>

We also gained an insight into the nationality of those who are employed. We learned that in 2008, employment of workers born in the UK fell by 278,000, while employment of foreign workers rose by 214,000.

We are extremely concerned about anybody who faces the prospect of losing their job, which is why we have taken all the action we possibly can to stabilise the economy in the face of a global financial crisis and to give as much help to businesses as we can. We have been prepared to see Government borrowing rise in order that we can defer tax requests to small businesses, and about 30,000 businesses have been helped by not having to pay their tax. The only way to allow them to do that is to allow Government borrowing to rise, so we have, as the Chancellor has just told the House, put potentially &#163;12 billion into the economy through the VAT cut in order to keep the lifeblood of business flowing and protect people from losing their job.</p>

Again, that has meant extra public spending, and we have had to allow borrowing to rise to compensate for it&#151;for example, by bringing forward the help on interest payments on their mortgage from 39 weeks to 13 weeks for those who lose their job. That all costs money, and we have allowed the public debt to rise to provide that help.

We must be very careful not to overlook the role that migrants have played in the life of this country over the centuries. I will share with the hon. Gentleman some figures that I was reading this morning. The House should listen. The figures relate to the Queen Elizabeth II hospital in Welwyn Garden City. In the Welwyn Hatfield area 6 per cent. of the population are from black and Asian minority ethnic communities, but of the people who work in the hospital, 50 per cent. are black and Asian. Migrants to this country are more likely to be standing at our bedside saving our life than lying in a hospital bed. We must recognise the role in the economy and our public services played by people who were not born in this country. Indeed, many hon. Members were not born in this country, so I do not agree with the hon. Gentleman&#146;s approach.</p>

He&#146;s the same as all the others,&#148; but I said, &#147;No, I think he&#146;s different.&#148; I even bought him a Valentine&#146;s card, and I thought me might buy me, or rather get me, a little trinket from the Sultan of Oman. It is clear now that he is the same as all the others. He does not see things in the way that I do, and he does not believe in the things that I do&#151;he does not believe in helping people, if they get into difficulties; I do.

 I endorse the shadow Leader of the House&#146;s request that the Youth Parliament be able to use the Chamber for its meetings.

We have annual debates on fisheries and on Welsh affairs, but the number of young people in the United Kingdom is far greater than the population of Wales. Would that not be an important step forward in raising the profile of the issue of the disengagement of young people from politics?

The Leader of the House and her predecessor said that the House should not be bombarded with vast quantities of statements immediately before a recess. That used to happen before the long recesses, but now there are 39 statements before a one-week recess. It is not the fact that the statements have been made; it is the timing and the fact that they have all been released on the same day before a recess. That cannot be right; will she please look into the matter for us?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o50"><a name="90212-0004.htm_para29"><a name="09021256000190">I mentioned the weather conditions last week. Snow in my constituency gave way to floods, and we experienced severe flooding before Christmas. It would be helpful, when people have recovered from the difficulties that they have experienced, to hold a debate in this House on the resilience of local communities to adverse weather conditions, how we can make better preparations, how we can properly assess risk and how we can enable local communities and volunteers to play a better part in dealing with adverse weather conditions. Can we have a debate on that?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o51"><a name="90212-0004.htm_para30"><a name="09021256000191">Immediately after today&#146;s statements, there is a debate on social security and pensions uprating. I suggest that we should also have a general debate on pensioners. A lot of pensioners are finding life extremely difficult at the moment with the return from savings down, pensions not going very far and difficulties with keeping themselves warm over winter and with council tax&#151;there are a lot of factors. Before the 11 wasted years of Labour Government, the Prime Minister said:</p>
<a name="90212-0004.htm_brev8"><a name="09021256000489"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;I want the next Labour Government to achieve what in 50 years of the welfare state has never yet been achieved&#151;the end of the means test for our elderly people.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o53"><a name="90212-0004.htm_para32"><a name="09021256000193">Lastly, may we have a debate on the future of the British pub? It is a fact that 39 are now closing every week. Insolvencies in the sector have gone up by 45 per cent. in the last quarter. The Chancellor of the Exchequer is barred from practically every pub in the country; that is not surprising, given that his response to the crisis in the pub trade has been to increase beer and cider taxes&#151;that is resented, to say the least. May we have a debate on what we can sensibly do to protect what is a key part of many local communities up and down the country?</p>

 I will look into this, but I think that I am right in saying that there is an expectation that we brigade the spring supplementary estimates and publish them at the same time, in a co-ordinated way, so that people know when to expect them.

Gentleman mentioned pensioners and whether we should have a debate on the effect of the economic recession&#151;the global financial economic crisis&#151;on those in retirement. By way of background, I should say that he should bear in mind that retired people&#151;particularly older pensioners, the overwhelming majority of whom are women&#151;have been the biggest beneficiaries. Their incomes have risen more than those of any other group in society, and quite right too. There was an appalling problem of pensioner poverty and many steps have been taken to address that over the years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o56"><a name="90212-0004.htm_para35"><a name="09021256000197">Having said that, I recognise that many pensioners are worried about not getting income from their savings and the fact that fuel bills are a disproportionately high part of their household budgets. We are trying to take all the steps that we can to give them the help that we can. Again, that has implications for public spending. That is why we are prepared to allow public borrowing to rise. If that means extra insulation, winter fuel payments and putting in &#163;60 extra and bringing the payment forward to January for all pensioners, we are prepared to do it. I know that the hon. Gentleman and his party back us on that. However, it has implications for public spending and we are prepared to face up to them.</p>

Pubs play a big part in community life in rural and urban areas, but as people worry about how the recession might affect their families, they start cutting back on going out and on outings. That is why we wanted to ensure that we were putting money directly into the economy in every way that we could. I am disappointed, therefore, that the hon. Gentleman&#146;s party does not back the VAT cut. We will do everything that we can, through both the Department for Culture, Media and Sport and the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform, to help the pub trade.</p>

Just a fraction of the money saved could be used to provide free car parking.

The situation was not helped by the fact that Gloucestershire county council seemed to run out of salt. Is that not worthy of a debate and investigation, not least because if the council had not invested its money in Icelandic banks, it could have put the money to good use on the roads?

 The extreme weather conditions have underlined the importance of the work of local authorities and the co-ordinating role of central Government.

 With permission, Mr. Speaker, I would like to make a statement about new investment for our railways. The House will understand that, because of the significant and sensitive commercial nature of this announcement, it was necessary to make the information available to the markets in advance of informing the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o68"><a name="90212-0006.htm_para2"><a name="09021256000276">Britain&#146;s rail network has been a remarkable success story over the past 10 years. There are more passengers using our trains than at any time since the second world war&#151;more than 1 billion last year. We have taken decisive action to remedy the failings of privatisation and put in place a stable structure for the long term. We have delivered, on time and to budget, the United Kingdom&#146;s first high-speed railway line. As I announced to the House last month, we have set up a new company, High Speed 2, which has already started work on planning the new high-speed rail services to the west midlands, the north of England and Scotland.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o69"><a name="90212-0006.htm_para3"><a name="09021256000277">To ensure that our railways remain resilient during the economic downturn and are well placed to support future economic growth, I am determined that we take the necessary steps now to invest in that critical part of Britain&#146;s infrastructure. Our priority is to deal with overcrowding and increase capacity to meet future demand. That is why we are investing more than &#163;20 billion in enhanced rail capacity and in new and improved trains to accommodate the record passenger numbers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o70"><a name="90212-0006.htm_para4"><a name="09021256000278">Britain&#146;s &#163;5.8 billion first high-speed line is now open, and from December this year commuters will be able to use high-speed rail services between London and Kent. Work has already started on the &#163;16 billion Crossrail project, which will link the Docklands, the City, the west end and Heathrow. We are upgrading the Thameslink service, bringing more frequent and longer trains to commuters on that critical route, and passengers on the west coast main line are now starting to see the benefits of an &#163;8.8 billion upgrade that has reduced journey times and delivered more frequent services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o71"><a name="90212-0006.htm_para5"><a name="09021256000279">I would like to inform the House today of what we are doing to invest in the next generation of long-distance trains, to make the UK a centre of excellence for European rail manufacturing. This morning, I announced to the stock exchange that a British-led consortium of John Laing, Hitachi and Barclays had been chosen as the preferred bidder for the contract to re-equip the east coast and Great Western main lines with new express trains. The high-speed trains that operate on those routes are up to 30 years old and although they have served passengers well, they now need to be replaced with more reliable, more efficient and greener trains that can carry more passengers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o72"><a name="90212-0006.htm_para6"><a name="09021256000280">I hope that the House will allow me to make a personal observation. My father, who worked on the railways all his life, was involved in the testing of the 125 high-speed trains as they were brought into service. I am delighted to have the opportunity to announce their successors today. They will have longer coaches, allowing up to 20 per cent. more seats on each train. Faster acceleration will allow journey times between London and major centres to be cut significantly, so a train leaving London will arrive in Leeds or Bristol   <br>

10 minutes sooner, Edinburgh 12 minutes sooner and Cardiff 15 minutes sooner. Faster journey times will mean that more frequent trains can be fitted on to the network, and improved reliability will mean that passengers face less disruption to their journeys. Moreover, the new trains will be up to 17 per cent. lighter than their existing counterparts, increasing fuel efficiency. Modern braking systems will further drive down energy consumption.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o73"><a name="90212-0006.htm_para7"><a name="09021256000281">The contract, worth some &#163;7.5 billion, is the biggest single investment in inter-city trains in a generation. It involves the construction and maintenance of up to 1,400 new vehicles. The first of those trains will enter service in 2013, and over the following years they will provide high-quality journeys to passengers between London and destinations across the UK, including Leeds, Newcastle, Edinburgh, Cambridge, Bristol, the Thames valley and south Wales. They will also be able to run on both electrified and non-electrified lines, which means that through trains will be able to run from the electrified to the non-electrified parts of the network. That is why I have announced, in parallel to the introduction of those trains, that we are developing plans for the electrification of the Great Western and midland main lines. That will allow us to deliver the widest possible range of high-quality services for passengers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o74"><a name="90212-0006.htm_para8"><a name="09021256000282">The announcement is good news for United Kingdom jobs, as well as rail passengers. As part of the contract, the winning consortium has agreed to make significant inward investment in the UK to construct a new state-of-the-art train assembly and manufacturing facility. I expect that nearly three quarters of the value of the order will be spent in the UK, benefiting the UK economy and providing UK jobs. The exact location of the new factory remains subject to further negotiation, but the company has confirmed to me that it will be in the east midlands, Yorkshire or the north-east.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o75"><a name="90212-0006.htm_para9"><a name="09021256000283">In addition, new maintenance depots will be built in Bristol, Reading, Doncaster, Leeds and west London, with upgrades to existing depots throughout Great Britain. That means that new manufacturing jobs will be created and maintained in those regions, and that many more jobs will be safeguarded across the country in the supply chain. In all, I estimate that some 12,500 long-term jobs will be created or safeguarded as a result of today&#146;s announcement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o76"><a name="90212-0006.htm_para10"><a name="09021256000284">As hon. Members know, Japan is one of the most advanced nations in the world in high-speed rail and new rail technology. Japanese trains have extraordinarily high levels of reliability and speed. Meanwhile, the rail industry is expanding across Europe&#151;with countries such as France, the Netherlands, Germany and Italy investing in high-speed rail and new train fleets, and significant new opportunities in the countries of central and eastern Europe.</p>

That means that the UK will continue to develop as a centre of excellence in train manufacturing, enabling the country to become a key player, as what was once a domestic rail industry becomes increasingly international.</p>

Today, I can also confirm that the Department is in advanced discussions with National Express East Anglia to provide 120 new carriages to renew and expand the train fleet operating on the West Anglia route between Liverpool Street and Stansted airport. The preferred bidder for those trains is Bombardier Transportation Ltd, which plans to assemble the new carriages in Derby, safeguarding jobs there.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o84"><a name="90212-0006.htm_para18"><a name="09021256000293">How much in total has been spent on consultants during the procurement process since the end of 2007, when the total was already a startling &#163;6.7 million? How much would have been saved if the Government had opted for a more standardised, off-the-shelf train rather than setting down the very detailed and complex specification that they chose?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o85"><a name="90212-0006.htm_para19"><a name="09021256000294">How much has been added to the cost of the programme because a decision has yet to be made on whether to electrify the Great Western line? Is the Secretary of State promising the delivery of the new trains on the Great Western line by 2015, even though the final outcome on electrification may not be determined by then? To what extent will costs consequently be driven up?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o86"><a name="90212-0006.htm_para20"><a name="09021256000295">The specification in the contract for the bids was for trains that weighed 362 tonnes, yet the Hitachi bid, which has been accepted, is for 411 tonnes. The Secretary of State claims that that is substantially compliant, but was Bombardier disadvantaged by sticking more rigorously than Hitachi to the weight specification?</p>

The inaptly named Thameslink 2000 is now running around 15 years later than planned. Not one, not two, but three Secretaries of State for Transport have promised us 1,300 extra carriages, some of which were reannounced today, yet only four have been delivered.

Nowhere did she mention the fact that such important commercial decisions are subject to competition, or that that is exactly how the issue was resolved. Bombardier is a great train maker. It has an order book of some 2,000 carriages, which, as I have indicated, will be added to by the announcement that I have just made, and it is bidding&#151;with some prospects of success, I anticipate&#151;for further orders in due course.

It also means that jobs in the supply chain&#151;the estimate is up to 10,000 jobs&#151;will be protected and safeguarded, as they support the manufacture. Three quarters of the value of the contract will be spent in the United Kingdom. That figure means that the great majority of the benefit will be provided for United Kingdom jobs and the United Kingdom economy.</p>

 I welcome my right hon. Friend&#146;s announcement and the investment that goes with it. May I suggest to him, as he knows the midland main line very well, that the welcome announcement about the completion of its electrification be accompanied by an announcement on the relevant rolling stock that he has announced for the east coast and Great Western main lines? The Meridian trains that are now being inflicted on passengers on long-haul journeys to Sheffield are appropriate for short-term sprints, but they are noisy, they vibrate, passengers cannot use mobile phones appropriately on them and they are not suitable for long-haul inter-city work. Given that, perhaps he could encourage the possibility of expanding manufacturing, so that we get not only a high-speed rail line but the high-quality rolling stock that we deserve.</p>

The trains that are being procured as a result of the announcement that I have just made will have advanced technology, allowing them to operate on both the electrified and the non-electrified parts of the network. That means that they will be very flexible and will be capable of operating across our network. As my right hon.

If the markets had to be told separately, they could have been told simultaneously. I resent the fact that, yet again, this House has learnt about such matters after the general public. We on the Liberal Democrat Benches welcome any new investment in railways, particularly in rolling stock and jobs. However, the Secretary of State will understand that there is some scepticism about his announcement, given the fact that of the 1,300 new vehicles announced in July 2007, and reannounced at regular intervals since, only 423 have so far been ordered, according to a parliamentary answer that I received only this week.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o93"><a name="90212-0007.htm_para6"><a name="09021256000308">Will he also accept that the fact that we have such a desperate shortage of rolling stock&#151;there is none spare anywhere in the country&#151;is not a good reflection on 12 years of this Government? Is that dramatic shortage not a consequence of the Treasury-driven franchise arrangements, which until recently encouraged train operating companies to reduce the number of their carriages? In effect, what we have heard today is a U-turn.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o94"><a name="90212-0007.htm_para7"><a name="09021256000309">Does the Secretary of State accept that the industry is dubious about the bi-modal train&#151;jointly a diesel and electric train&#151;that he appears to have settled on? The industry believes that it will push up costs and add weight unnecessarily to the vehicle, and that more flexibility would be provided if a locomotive were simply added at the point in the network where the electricity supply runs out and diesel traction is required. Is it not the case that, as a consequence, the vehicle that the Secretary of State is ordering is much more expensive than need be?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o95"><a name="90212-0007.htm_para8"><a name="09021256000310">When will we have longer platforms in place to accommodate the new rolling stock that the Secretary of State has announced today?

Lastly, to repeat the question that was asked but not answered a moment ago, when will all 1,400 trains&#151;or, as the statement says rather carefully, &#147;up to 1,400&#148; new carriages&#151;be in service?</p>

 Normally, the hon.

However, in the light of his previous observations, I will take it as read that he does think it a good thing.

I followed a well established practice in the House of ensuring that sensitive decisions were communicated to the markets at their opening this morning. That is not an unusual practice when commercially sensitive issues are decided on. It is right that we should not affect the markets by, for example, coming to the House in the middle of the day when the stock market has been open for many hours. I know that the Liberal Democrats do not worry unduly about matters such as the commercial implications of these decisions. Nevertheless, they are matters to which responsible Governments have to have some regard.</p>

First, on rolling stock, when will the new carriages enter service? Secondly, a year ago&#151;or possibly more&#151;we were promised longer platforms and more track on that vital route. There have been a lot of delays and uncertainties about that. Will the Secretary of State confirm that the Government still hold that commitment, and tell us when the work will begin on the track?</p>

 I have made it quite clear that capacity constraint is an important part of the work that we need to do to improve our rail network, and there are some significant steps that can be taken. Today&#146;s announcement on inter-city trains, which will have greater carriage capacity, will be part of that, as will the continuing work to lengthen platforms. The negotiations between the manufacturer and Anglia will proceed in relation to Stansted, and I anticipate that the carriages will be in service by 2011-12.</p>

 I thank my right hon. Friend for his statement, which is very welcome. May I just check that a single train travelling from, say, London King&#146;s Cross to, say, Skipton will be able to change from electric to diesel power in that one journey? The reason why I ask is that the part of the Airedale line that runs from the constituency of the hon. Member for Shipley (Philip Davies) through Keighley and up to Skipton was electrified under the previous Conservative Government but, unfortunately, the cabling is such that if a 225&#151;an electrified high-speed train&#151;goes on to it, it drains the power from the whole line so that nothing else can use it. Up to now, therefore, trains going from King&#146;s Cross to Skipton have to be diesel-powered 125s. A lot of my constituents will be pleased to hear that the one train that travels each way between Keighley and King&#146;s Cross can be a fully modernised train that is much more comfortable than the 125s that we are using at the moment.</p>

I will, however, ensure that she is written to and that an explanation is provided.</p>

That, of course, is literally correct, but high-speed locomotives are of little value if their progress is impeded by poor track, out-of-date signalling, bad bridges and level crossings. When may we expect that the line between Canterbury and Manston airport will be upgraded in every respect, so that we can take advantage of the possibilities for Manston to play its part in aviation in the south-east and so that commuters from east Kent can travel to London at something like the speed at which they used to be able to travel in 1927?</p>

welcome today&#146;s announcement. Will my right hon. Friend do what he can to ensure that those responsible for setting the timetables of the new services take full advantage of the opportunity for faster journey times? He will know that trains from Edinburgh to London are capable of journeys much quicker than they are timetabled for. The new trains provide an opportunity, perhaps with minor track improvements, to reduce journey times to under three and three quarter hours. I am sure that the same is true elsewhere. Therefore, it would be a tragedy if we did not make full use of the faster trains to provide shorter journey times. Will my right hon.

 It is true that there have been extra pressures, especially this year. I am about to describe some of the other measures that we have taken&#151;particularly in regard to the winter fuel allowance&#151;to reflect some of those increased pressures, while, as the hon. Gentleman says, sticking to the formula. That, as I am sure he knows, is the way in which a number of Administrations have worked.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o106"><a name="90212-0008.htm_para7"><a name="09021256000367">As I have said, from April 2009 pensioners on the lowest incomes will see the biggest increase in the pension credit standard minimum guarantee since its introduction in 2003. It will rise by &#163;5.95 a week for single pensioners and by &#163;9.10 a week for couples, which means that no single pensioner need live on less than &#163;130 a week, and no couple on less than &#163;198.45 a week. That underlines our determination to target help on the people who need it most&#151;those with the lowest incomes. This year we will spend more than &#163;13 billion more on pensioners than we would be spending if we had retained the policies we inherited from the last Government. As a result of those tax and benefit changes, the average pensioner household is &#163;1,600 a year, or &#163;31 a week, better off, while the poorest pensioner households are, on average, around &#163;2,200 a year better off.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o107"><a name="90212-0008.htm_para8"><a name="09021256000368">As the hon. Member for Ribble Valley (Mr. Evans) pointed out, it is vital for us to do all that we can to ensure that benefit recipients and pensioners receive the support to which they are entitled. That is why we have tried to simplify the claims process, removing the need for people to complete and sign claim forms: claims for housing benefit, council tax benefit and pension credit can now be made together by means of a single telephone call.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o108"><a name="90212-0008.htm_para9"><a name="09021256000369">We are considering a number of other ways we can ensure that people receive their entitlement, such as the use of data matching to identify those who may be entitled to pension credit but do not currently receive it, provision for around 13,000 home visits a week by the local pensions service to vulnerable customers, and the promotion of take-up through a range of activities including direct mail initiatives, local partnership work, and regional radio, press and outdoor advertising. We also intend to support Members of Parliament who run their own campaigns locally. Those campaigns in themselves can be quite successful.</p>

 Today the <i> Lancashire Telegraph</i>, a newspaper that covers my constituency and several others in east Lancashire, is launching its own campaign on behalf of the elderly and pensioners to raise the profile of all the issues that cause problems to them. The Minister will be concerned to learn that over the past six weeks, during the very cold spell that we have experienced, there has been an enormous increase in the percentage of elderly people who have died as a result of, for instance, respiratory problems and lack of heating. What more does she think could be done, particularly during the current bad weather, to ensure that no pensioner will have to make the choice between food and turning the fire on?</p>

 When I visited one of the headquarters of the Pension, Disability and Carers Service&#151;perhaps the hon.

I constantly keep in touch with the directors of the service and so on, not only to ensure that the service provision targets are being met, but to examine all the time what else can be done to improve the system. It is vital that we examine different methods&#151;for example, working with organisations such as Age Concern or Help the Aged, and, in particular, with local centres that older people&#151;perhaps those on lower incomes&#151;might frequent, so that we get the services and the information to these people, with a particular emphasis on the fact that these are entitlements.

That means that the total direct help with fuel costs this year for pensioners aged between 60 and 79 will be &#163;250&#151;the figure will be &#163;400 for those aged 80 or over. My right hon.

 One of the slightly disappointing things about the Minister&#146;s announcement is that the cut in savings credit, which was supposed to come in when the basic state pension was increased by earnings, is being implemented early&#151;this year. She will recall the national insurance contributions change where the upper accrual point was introduced. Again, that was supposed to happen because the basic state pension was being uprated by earnings, but it was brought in early&#151;last year. Is it not time that she did what her old friends in the TUC suggest and introduced the uprating by earnings or prices, whichever is the higher now?</p>

 Of course if we had introduced the increase by earnings this year, it would been lower than the change that we are making by using the RPI. We have said that we will restore the link with earnings, either by 2012 or before the end of the next Parliament. That is our commitment&#151;the Conservative party abolished the earnings link and we have said that we will restore it. As I said, this Government are spending about &#163;13 billion more on our pensioners in general.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o110"><a name="90212-0009.htm_para0"><a name="09021256000379">This morning, I tabled a statement&#151;I did inform both the Opposition Front Benchers about it&#151;explaining two supplementary issues concerning payments of invalidity allowances to pensioners from April 2009. In December, we announced new rates of invalidity allowance for customers under pensionable age to support the alignment of the rates of incapacity benefit and employment and support allowance. The rates for eligible pensioners due to receive invalidity allowance will be increased in line with the RPI in the usual way. The Department subsequently wrote to pensioners eligible for an invalidity allowance informing them of their entitlements, however, because of a technical error a number of incorrect entitlement notices were sent. That means that about 45,000 people may be overpaid and about 25,000 may be underpaid, depending on their individual circumstances. Weekly overpayments will range from a minimum of 5p to a maximum of &#163;3, and the maximum underpayment will be &#163;1.80 a week. Any arrears will be paid to customers, and we will not take any action to seek recovery of the overpayments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o111"><a name="90212-0009.htm_para1"><a name="09021256000380">As the Department works through the affected areas, we will write to all customers who are affected to explain their position. As people become pensioners from April 2009, they should automatically move on to the higher rate of invalidity allowance. Because the uprating order for this year does not provide the statutory basis ordinarily needed to make these higher payments, we shall be making them on an extra-statutory basis in the coming tax year&#151;about 7,000 customers are affected, and the payments involved total about &#163;350,000. Obviously, I am sorry that this unfortunate situation has occurred, but the issue is a technical one and we will put it right.</p>

 Can the Minister say a word about the carer&#146;s allowance? Most people who receive it are of working age, and a recent report by the Select Committee on Work and Pensions recommended that the Government should look to synchronise the increase in the carer&#146;s allowance with the increase in the minimum wage. It did so because too many carers who are working receive an increase in the minimum wage in the autumn that then disqualifies them from the carer&#146;s allowance, and they have to wait until the April uprating before they can be eligible again.

 Yes, I will certainly look at the points that my hon. Friend has made. I know that she cares passionately about this issue and I can reassure her that we value the work that carers do. In the national carers strategy, we have outlined our vision that by 2018 carers will be universally recognised and valued as being fundamental to strong families and stable communities. Within that, we will of course constantly bear in mind the support that carers receive through the benefits system. We have amended our proposal so that we will not move carers from income support until we have a clear and detailed plan setting out reform of the benefits system over the long term to take account of the needs of carers.</p>

 The Conservatives support the uprating of benefits and pensions because we believe that anything that will help hard-pressed individuals and families at this incredibly difficult time for the United Kingdom is welcome. In these orders, the guaranteed minimum pension increases by 3 per cent.; incapacity benefit claimants with age additions receive an increase of 3.15 per cent.; the standard minimum guarantee element of pension credit increases by 4.8 per cent.; the basic state pension, carer&#146;s allowance, attendance allowance, disability living allowance, industrial injuries benefit, incapacity benefit and child benefit increase by 5 per cent.&#151;by the increase in the RPI; and income-related benefits, including income support, jobseeker&#146;s allowance, employment and support allowance, housing benefit and council tax benefit increase by 6.3 per cent. or by the Rossi index which is unusually, as the Minister has already told us, more than the RPI this year because housing costs have fallen. While most tax credits will increase by 5 per cent., the child element of the child tax credit is rising by 7 per cent.</p>

I wonder whether he is aware that Capital Economics, a forecasting house, has calculated that the pensioners&#146; inflation rate to December last year was actually 12.2 per cent.

 The hon. Gentleman makes a valid point, and we will have to keep the issue under review, especially as far as pensioners are concerned, in the extraordinary circumstances into which we are heading.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o117"><a name="90212-0009.htm_para7"><a name="09021256000395">Depending on the benefit, either the RPI or the Rossi index is used. Before we decide on the merit of the order, it is worth trying to understand which inflation measure is applied to each benefit and why. It is important to debate those issues because they open up important questions about whether different groups in our society suffer from different inflationary pressures. The benefits that people will access as a result of the order being made today will differ depending on the inflation measure that is applied to the benefit. The question that we have to ask when considering the merits of the order is whether the uprating will cover the increased cost of living to which the particular group drawing that benefit is subject. The RPI is applied to uprate contribution-based jobseeker&#146;s allowance, child benefit, incapacity benefit, carer&#146;s allowance and disability living allowance. Those are the main benefits to which it applies. The RPI is calculated by the Office for National Statistics each month by collecting some 110,000 prices of about 650 goods and services in about 150 locations, including on the internet. These goods include the obvious ones&#151;bread, cereal, furniture and clothing, as well as water, gas and electricity. With that information, the ONS uses data from the Department&#146;s family expenditure survey and other detailed expenditure analyses put together by market research companies and trade reports, and arrives at a representative shopping basket. The changes in prices of the goods in the basket are used to produce a headline figure that is intended to be broadly representative of the cost of living.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o118"><a name="90212-0009.htm_para8"><a name="09021256000396">With reference to the RPI, which is the subject of the order, it is worth pointing out that the patterns of pensioner expenditure are not explicitly factored into the representative shopping basket. The ONS explains that that pattern of demand is probably atypical and would distort the average. Pensioner households, which on average derive about three quarters of their income from the state one way or another, are having some of their benefits uprated by the order according to an inflation index that does not explicitly acknowledge or comprehend how they spend their money. That is an important point that we need to bear in mind.</p>

 If elderly people have got into financial difficulties, they may have borrowed money either on credit cards, for which the rate of interest bears no relationship to current bank rates, or they may even have been induced to borrow from loan sharks, who can charge obscene rates of interest.

 I am very glad that my hon. Friend has raised that point. He is right to do so: those on very low incomes, such as pensioners and others, are extremely vulnerable to unscrupulous people charging very high rates of interest. Indeed, that was why the former shadow Secretary of State was right to raise concerns that people on benefits were going to be charged rates of up to 27 per cent. in the White Paper brought forward by the Department.

has to do with the lack of availability of affordable credit for very large numbers of constituents around the country. We need to be a lot more innovative about involving credit unions and perhaps many other players who are not in the field to meet what is a very real need. This is a serious point, and my hon.

<p><a name="stpa_o119"><a name="90212-0009.htm_para9"><a name="09021256000399">The Rossi index is the other main index used to uprate the different allowances and benefits&#151;jobseeker&#146;s allowance, council tax benefit, housing benefit and income support&#151;covered by the order. It is compiled in the same way as the retail prices index, except that it excludes rent, mortgages, interest payments and housing depreciation costs. It is higher than the RPI this year because housing costs were falling over the year to September to 2008. It is also important to remember that the Rossi index is different from the consumer price index which, confusingly, is the main inflation index used by the Government and the Bank of England.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o120"><a name="90212-0009.htm_para10"><a name="09021256000400">Later in my remarks, I shall refer to the Government Actuary&#146;s report accompanying the two orders before us. It looks at the orders&#146; effect on the national insurance fund that is used to pay out benefits and pensions for which national insurance contributions are a necessary qualifying condition. They include state retirement pension, contributory jobseeker&#146;s allowance and contributory employment and support allowance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o121"><a name="90212-0009.htm_para11"><a name="09021256000401">There are concerns about the assumptions being used by the Government Actuary and the Chancellor in the pre-Budget report, and the use to which the fund may be put.

<p><a name="stpa_o122"><a name="90212-0009.htm_para12"><a name="09021256000402">The benefits and pensions that are uprated by these orders are vital elements in combating child, adult and pensioner poverty, but by no means are they the whole solution. We want to help the workless get back into work, where appropriate, and we want to find the best possible ways of enabling people to avoid poverty, including poverty later in life. We recognise the strong connection between worklessness and children growing up in poverty, and that it leads to fewer life chances for those children.</p>

On its own, however, uprating the benefits in this order will not be enough, as the Department&#146;s figures show that the number of children in poverty has risen by 100,000 for the second year in a row. On current progress, the Government will miss by 500,000 children their target of halving child poverty by 2010. We believe that a broader approach is needed, one that does not just involved the benefits uprated by the order. They are vital, of course, but there needs to be serious engagement with schools, family life, local authorities and registered social landlords.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman is making some very important points. We all recognise that, in general at least, unemployment is rising in everyone&#146;s constituency. Does he agree that we should reformulate the statutory redundancy pay to assist those being made redundant? It is a long time since it was looked at, and does he agree that we should consider introducing annual uplifts?</p>

 I am very grateful that the hon. Gentleman has raised that issue, and I studied carefully the comments that he made on this matter on the Gallery News email service yesterday. He has a point, and I shall refer to it in my remarks very shortly. I was quite struck by the percentages to which he drew attention yesterday, so I think that he is certainly on to something. I do not know exactly how we will solve the problem, but I commend him for raising it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o126"><a name="90212-0009.htm_para16"><a name="09021256000407">Jobseeker&#146;s allowance for people over 25 has been raised to &#163;64.30 a week, an amount that the Minister for Employment and Welfare Reform admitted yesterday that he would be unable to live on. That is relevant because the claimant count for January increased to 1.23 million, which means that 73,800 more people were claiming the uprated benefit than was the case the month before.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o127"><a name="90212-0009.htm_para17"><a name="09021256000408">As the hon. Member for Chorley (Mr. Hoyle) has noted, there has been no increase in statutory redundancy payouts, and the important point that he raised yesterday is that they represent some 56 per cent. of average weekly earnings, as opposed to 203 per cent. when they were first brought in in 1965. That is something that the House should be concerned about. If there has been a specific policy change, I think that we should know about it and debate it. We should see whether we think that it is fair and right, and what we can do about it within the limits of public expenditure. However, if the amount paid has been allowed to wither on the vine without anyone noticing or caring, that is concerning to me.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o128"><a name="90212-0009.htm_para18"><a name="09021256000409">This is important, because redundancies are, very sadly, up. In the three months to December, 259,000 people reported that they had become redundant. Sadly, the OECD believes that many more people will claim the benefits uprated in the order, and it has predicted that unemployment will rise faster in the UK than in any other G7 country.</p>

There are 3.7 million beneficiaries aged 60 and over in receipt of income-related benefits, and that is 30 per cent. of the population of that group. However, 1.8 million are not claiming the pension credit uprated in the order, which has now been increased to &#163;130 a week. That is of great concern. It may interest the House to know that, in November 2004, the then Secretary of State for Work and Pensions said:</p>

About 40 per cent. of those entitled to council tax benefit, uprated also in the order, do not claim it.</p>

I find it quite extraordinary that up to &#163;4.5 billion of means-tested benefits that should rightly go to older people is unclaimed each year. Perhaps that is what the Prime Minister feared when he said:</p>
<a name="90212-0010.htm_brev1"><a name="09021256000499"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;I want the next Labour Government to achieve what in 50 years of the welfare state has never been achieved&#151;the end of the means test for our elderly people&#148;.</p>

Will the Minister also tell us exactly when the Government intend to restore the link with earnings for the state pension? She alluded to the well-worn formula, but many people would like greater precision on that subject. If she said something on that when she replies to the debate, we would all be grateful.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o136"><a name="90212-0010.htm_para3"><a name="09021256000417">It is worrying that the take-up of pension credit continues to decline, as an answer that the Department gave on 3 November last year shows.

So we not only have a problem, as my hon. Friend the Member for Ribble Valley has quite properly identified, but one that is getting worse.</p>

entitled. Up to 350,000 older people are not claiming housing benefit&#151;18 per cent. of those entitled. Up to 2.14 million older people are not claiming council tax benefit&#151;a staggering 45 per cent. of those entitled.</p>

In 2006-07, 2.5 million pensioners were living below the poverty threshold of 60 per cent. of median income, representing 23 per cent. of pensioners. After allowing for housing costs, 19 per cent. of pensioners were below 60 per cent. of median income, representing 2.1 million individuals. Those facts were pointed out by Help the Aged as recently as Tuesday of this week. Again, perhaps when the Minister replies, she will tell the House what estimate of pension credit take-up the Chancellor of the Exchequer will use in his Budget report this year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o139"><a name="90212-0010.htm_para6"><a name="09021256000420">The Government received quite a lot of criticism last autumn for their decision to reduce the period of backdating from 12 to three months for pension credit claims. That suggests that they are more interested in saving money than in increasing take-up. So will the Minister confirm that at least 110,000 pensioners will be adversely affected by that change and that they will tend to be older pensioners, who will not be able to claim some of the benefits uprated by the order?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o140"><a name="90212-0010.htm_para7"><a name="09021256000421">Falling interest rates may be popular with some people&#151;indeed, with many people, particularly home owners&#151;but they are really bad news for one section of the population. So does the Minister recognise that many pensioners are facing real hardship because their hard-won savings are now attracting very low interest, thus forcing them to rely on many of the benefits uprated by the order? We are talking about people who have done the right thing and what successive Governments told them to do: they saved during their working lives, so that their savings could supplement their incomes in retirement. To add insult to injury, those with modest savings are assumed to earn 10 per cent. on their savings in respect of their eligibility for pension credit, which is uprated by the order.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o141"><a name="90212-0010.htm_para8"><a name="09021256000422">Will the Minister update the House on the conversations that the Minister for Employment and Welfare Reform told the House that he would have with her and the Treasury on this matter when he made his statement on 11 December, as reported in column 697 of <i> Hansard. </i>We would like to know how they got on when they went to the Treasury on that matter. Will the Minister confirm that she is wholly confident that the new personal accounts system will begin on time and that people who are being auto-enrolled into personal accounts will not be worse off by not being eligible for pension credit, which is, again, uprated by the order.</p>

Again, that has a bearing on the 5 per cent. figure used to uprate the basic state pension.</p>

 Certainly there is some truth in what the hon.

We could do all sorts of things&#151;for example, with the Post Office card account, the use of which the hon. Gentleman will be particularly keen to encourage. People could be provided with decent information, telling them whether they are getting the cheapest tariff. They should not have to ring up and ask; it should be made absolutely obvious to them&#151;something that the Conservative party is proposing. There is something in what the hon.

It is an important issue, because if we were able to deal more effectively with the &#163;2.6 billion overpaid, we could uprate many of these measures more generously. The figures are pretty staggering: &#163;2.6 billion overpaid, and &#163;1.1 billion of benefit expenditure underpaid. That has been going on for a very long time, and it includes money paid wrongly to prisoners, to people who have moved abroad and who were not entitled to it, to people already earning an income through employment and to people already claiming other benefits.</p>

Again, I ask her to go back to the Department and discuss the matter with the Secretary of State and her fellow Ministers and to urge that that matter be pushed rather higher up the Department&#146;s agenda. We could be more generous with the uprating of a number of these benefits, which, as a number of Members have pointed out already, are not that generous for many of our fellow citizens in great need.</p>

If there are points to which she cannot respond, will she write me a fairly full letter on the subject, and put a copy in the Library? I refer to the thorny issue of what is happening in the national insurance fund. I have great concerns about the assumptions that the poor old Government Actuary, Mr. Trevor Llanwarne, has been forced to use, namely the ones given to him by the Chancellor in the pre-Budget report. I have before me a report from the Government Actuary&#146;s Department; it is directly relevant to the debate. Indeed, it was produced for the House, and is about the two orders before us. The Government Actuary is forced to use the assumption, made by the Chancellor in the pre-Budget report, that there will be an increase in earnings growth of 3.2 per cent. in 2009-10. The average of the forecasts in the Treasury&#146;s January comparison of independent forecasts for the UK economy is an increase in earnings growth of only 2.7 per cent for 2009-10.</p>

The Treasury&#146;s January forecast for 2009-10, which uses independent forecasts, is average claimant count unemployment of 1.83 million, so the first thing that I want to say about the national insurance fund is that I am concerned about the assumptions in the pre-Budget report that the Government Actuary has been forced to use. Even small changes in those assumptions are likely to have a very large impact on the fund.</p>

I do not know about the situation in the Minister&#146;s constituency, but in mine, the Dunstable pensioners&#146; association and other bodies haul me in once a year and ask, &#147;What are you MPs doing? You are sitting on more and more cash in the fund. We&#146;re not very well off. By law, the money can be given only to pensioners and others.

The surplus, and therefore the overall balance, has got larger year on year since about 1997, and it is forecast to grow in a substantial way. If Members look at page 30 of the report, they will see that the balance will rise from &#163;52 billion in 2008-09 to &#163;102 billion in 2013-14. That is a substantial rise.

I hope that I am not blind-siding the Minister on that issue; I know that it is technical and complicated, but it is incredibly important. I am not playing party politics on this serious issue.

We hope, too, that more of our fellow citizens will be able to make arrangements for their pensionable age, so that some of the all-too-low pensioner incomes will be higher. We will work with the Government on any proposals that they make, but I serve notice on them that the Opposition will make their own proposals to deliver better welfare, and a fairer system that lifts more people out of dependency, which is not where so many of our citizens want to be.</p>

 It is interesting that in a week when much of the news has been about people at the other end of the pay scale&#151;those earning large sums of money&#151;we are considering people who are surviving on benefits, and who are very much at the opposite end of the scale. Sadly, important though the measures before us are, they will not get the same news coverage as people who have been getting large bonuses and salaries. That is not to say that the measures are not important; they affect millions of people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o160"><a name="90212-0010.htm_para27"><a name="09021256000444">The hon. Member for South-West Bedfordshire (Andrew Selous) covered many of the issues in great detail in his excellent speech. We welcome the uprating today. We are talking about a significant amount of money that will go to those who are most in need. I am delighted to see pensioners getting a significant rise in their pension. Of the &#163;6.2 billion, &#163;4 billion is going to pensioners. I could say it is too little too late, but we should welcome what has been announced today. It is a good thing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o161"><a name="90212-0010.htm_para28"><a name="09021256000445">We have heard the details of the figures involved. I share with the hon. Member for South-West Bedfordshire a concern about the complexity that runs throughout benefits uprating and the entire benefits system. The 14 pages of details are too much. It is not only difficult for those receiving the benefits to understand; it is also very difficult for those trying to give them advice and work out exactly what benefits people are entitled to.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o162"><a name="90212-0010.htm_para29"><a name="09021256000446">As I said in my intervention, I thank the Minister for prior sight of her statement on invalidity allowance. I am pleased that no amounts will be claimed back. It is clear, once again, that because of the complexity of the system, many errors are made. So many people contact hon. Members regularly about errors made by the Department for Work and Pensions, particularly on tax credits. The Minister dealt with one relatively small error, but there are far larger errors out there that need to be tackled. It is also worth remembering today that there are many tapers, allowances and premiums that are not being uprated and have not been uprated for many years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o163"><a name="90212-0010.htm_para30"><a name="09021256000447">We are entering different times. Last year&#146;s benefit uprating occurred before the increase in unemployment that we are, sadly, seeing now. With unemployment nudging the 2 million mark and with four unemployed for every vacancy, tackling poverty among the population of working age will assume increasing importance. Even in my constituency, which is not normally noted for much unemployment, Royal Bank of Scotland headquarters announced 2,300 redundancies earlier this week. Many people, for the first time in their lives, will be looking at the results of today&#146;s debate. People who have never known unemployment in the past will rely on the upgrading and the benefits that we are discussing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o164"><a name="90212-0010.htm_para31"><a name="09021256000448">With unemployment rising across most sectors, there will be an increasing number of skilled workers on benefits and seeking employment. Although the extra money for jobseeker&#146;s allowance is welcome, is the Minister concerned that back-to-work benefits and policies under the Welfare Reform Bill are ill suited to high unemployment? We are considering a number of changes but, in the words of one famous individual, the times are a-changin&#146;.</p>

frustration of disability groups, in particular, that the rate of support component will be no more than incapacity benefit, despite past promises to the contrary? Does she share my concerns that welfare to work and jobseeker&#146;s allowance arrangements have been designed to work in a period of low unemployment, as I said, unlike the circumstances that we will see in the year ahead? We are considering the uprating and various cost of living rises&#151;the Rossi increase was mentioned&#151;but we may be moving into a time of negative inflation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o166"><a name="90212-0011.htm_para1"><a name="09021256000450">In the year ahead, as we enter uncharted waters, the Minister and her Department should consider how we ensure that benefits reach a more realistic level. I am amazed at how many people survive on the basic benefits. In the Treasury Committee, one banker asked what the level of jobseeker&#146;s allowance was&#151;what people have to survive on. The figure is about &#163;60 a week. The individual who answered the question was earning about &#163;60,000 a month. Some people out there are surviving on very low levels of benefit.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o167"><a name="90212-0011.htm_para2"><a name="09021256000451">I welcome the decision to increase the state pension to &#163;95.25 a week. Will the Minister take on board the point that when benefits are calculated, the income that savers are assumed to receive from their savings is 10 per cent., but that is not happening in practice? People who have been prudent throughout their lives, people who have saved and put money by, do not want to dip into their capital because that will reduce their income and affect the amount of benefits they will have to ask the state for. Many pensioners who have been prudent all their lives do not want to apply for means-tested benefits.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o168"><a name="90212-0011.htm_para3"><a name="09021256000452">There is too much means-testing in the system which, along with the complexity, puts many people off applying for benefits. It has been estimated that 1.8 million eligible pensioners do not claim pension credit. When I have raised the issue of means-testing in the past, it has been argued by the Government that that will focus most help on the people who most need it, so that the most deserving are in receipt of the amounts to which they are entitled. Sad to say, those most in need are not those who are entitled to and receive means-tested benefits, but those who are entitled to but do not receive the means-tested benefits, and they are right at the bottom of the heap. Those 1.8 million pensioners who are entitled to money but are not receiving it were often told by the Government that increased amounts such as the Christmas bonus would help make up the difference, but the sum paid out in that form is a small fraction of the &#163;2.8 billion in unclaimed pension credits.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o169"><a name="90212-0011.htm_para4"><a name="09021256000453">Fraud and error have been mentioned by previous speakers. It is vital that we ensure that fraud and error are kept to a minimum because both, in effect, take money away from those who are entitled to benefits. The elderly, the disabled, the unemployed, and people trying to get into work and off benefits should get the maximum support to which they are entitled, and if money is being lost through fraud or error, it is not going where it needs to go.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o170"><a name="90212-0011.htm_para5"><a name="09021256000454">The Minister mentioned the winter fuel payment. Although I agree that that is usually a Budget issue, will she consider a higher rate for those who claim the higher rate mobility component of disability living allowance? Although benefits help many of those who are disabled, it is extremely expensive to keep the home of someone who is disabled warm, for two reasons&#151;partly because, in certain cases, disabled people do not move  <br>

around as much as the rest of us, and partly because there is a far higher unemployment level among the disabled so they are more likely to be at home and to need their home heated. The third factor is that the average income of a household with a disabled person in it is lower, so although the costs of running a disabled household are often higher, the income is often lower. The people caught in that pincer movement need extra benefits, and we must make sure that those who are entitled to the benefit receive it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o171"><a name="90212-0011.htm_para6"><a name="09021256000455">It was mentioned earlier that falling interest rates were helping those with mortgages, but many of those who are unemployed and receiving mortgage interest relief are on fixed rate mortgages. I was pleased to see that the Chancellor and the Department have agreed not to introduce the formula which reduces the amount of mortgage relief until May, but if the base rate stays at 1 per cent., the current system whereby people receive their mortgage interest relief is 1.58 per cent. above base rate. That will give people mortgage interest relief at about 2.5 per cent., but 50 per cent. of those paying mortgages have fixed rate mortgages at 5 or 6 per cent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o172"><a name="90212-0011.htm_para7"><a name="09021256000456">I appreciate the action that the Government have taken by not reducing until May the amount that such people are paid, but between now and May a new system will have to be introduced or we will find that the new group of unemployed people who are on fixed rate mortgages will receive a benefit that does not cover their mortgage interest. The end result of that will be that not only will they have lost their job but they will be in danger of losing their house. We hope that many people who are unfortunate enough to lose their job will get back into the job market fairly quickly, but in these times of rising unemployment, that will be more difficult. The last thing that they need is to lose their house at the same time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o173"><a name="90212-0011.htm_para8"><a name="09021256000457">As I have said, I do not want to be niggardly, and I welcome the measures that have been introduced. When the Minister winds up the debate, I would like her to address the issues that we must deal with in the future&#151;higher unemployment, means-testing, which is a major problem with the uprating, low inflation, complexity, which other hon. Members have mentioned, and the high levels of error and of fraud.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o174"><a name="90212-0011.htm_para9"><a name="09021256000458">In conclusion, I welcome what has been given, but the Department has far to go.</p>

 I am glad to have the opportunity to contribute to this important debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o175"><a name="90212-0011.htm_para10"><a name="09021256000460">The hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (John Barrett) echoed a point that my hon. Friend the Member for South-West Bedfordshire (Andrew Selous) made from the Front Bench about the complexity of the benefits system and of the uprating that we are considering today, which is where I want to start. It is widely recognised that the system of benefits is complex. When the question, &#147;What is a reasonable amount of money for an income replacement benefit?&#148; is asked, there are many different answers. It has been thought for some time&#151;the Work and Pensions Committee has reported on this&#151;that we, as a country, should have a serious look at our benefits system and what a proper level of income replacement benefit should be.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o176"><a name="90212-0011.htm_para11"><a name="09021256000461">We should not have a situation in which carer&#146;s allowance goes up by one amount and jobseeker&#146;s allowance goes up by another, and we should not have a situation in which carer&#146;s allowance, which is supposed to be an income replacement benefit for carers, is a totally different amount from JSA, which is also supposed to be an income replacement benefit. Our system is over-complex, and the case for simplification is strong. I hope that the Minister and her colleagues will, in the quietness of their private discussions, examine whether we cannot move to a system that better suits the needs of the new century.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o177"><a name="90212-0011.htm_para12"><a name="09021256000462">There are, of course, temptations for Ministers in an over-complex system, and the devil is often in the detail. On the face of it, it is surprising that Ministers come here every year to announce &#147;handsome&#148; increases in benefits, yet at the same time the Institute for Fiscal Studies, which produced a major report on the matter last autumn, tells us that in 10 years&#146; time pensioner poverty will be exactly the same as it is now. It is very surprising that with all those handsome increases, the Joseph Rowntree Foundation told the Work and Pensions Committee that over a 20-year period the effect of fiscal drag and benefit erosion, which lies in the detail of what has been announced, means that the Chancellor will recoup 3.6 per cent. of gross domestic product from the overall bill. That raises questions about the core benefits system, such as whether those benefits are sufficient for the people whom they are supposed to help and what is really going on behind the scenes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o178"><a name="90212-0011.htm_para13"><a name="09021256000463">I suspect that a good deal of sleight of hand goes on, and I will give two examples after I have commented on the point made by my hon.

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o180"><a name="90212-0011.htm_para15"><a name="09021256000465">The Government have been diverting money from the national insurance fund into the health budget. The Minister may want to comment on that, but it did not use to happen to the extent to which it does now. That is why the parliamentary answer to which my hon. Friend the Member for South-West Bedfordshire referred pointed out that we must bump up income tax, or a tax, if we do not want a large balance in the national insurance fund&#151;it is jiggery-pokery or sleight of hand.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o181"><a name="90212-0011.htm_para16"><a name="09021256000466">The Work and Pensions Committee produced a major report on carers in the autumn. One of our points concerned the size of carer&#146;s allowance, which is much smaller than other income replacement benefits. We made the case that the Government should conduct a major review of carer&#146;s allowance and that they should treat it as a proper income replacement benefit.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o182"><a name="90212-0011.htm_para17"><a name="09021256000467">The Committee also made a more technical point, which the hon. Member for Blackpool, North and Fleetwood (Mrs. Humble) mentioned earlier. Each year, the decision about uprating the amount that people can earn if they are on carer&#146;s allowance is made in April, whereas the decision on the national minimum wage is  <br>

<notus-date day="12" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><b>12 Feb 2009 : Column 1563</b><br>
made in October. The effect is that if the national minimum wage goes up by a certain amount, a number of carers are forced off benefit. In the spring, when the uprating takes place, they go back on to benefits, because the benefits have caught up. The Committee felt that that was unhelpful and that the changes should be synchronised, because that would help many carers organise their lives.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o183"><a name="90212-0011.htm_para18"><a name="09021256000468">The sad thing is that that would inevitably cost the Government a little bit of money, because those people would no longer be forced off benefit, which is an example of the sleight of hand that occurs. Maintaining that lack of synchronicity saves the taxpayer a little bit of money, but it messes up the lives of carers and is not helpful. Perhaps the Minister will care to admit that that is why the situation has not been changed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o184"><a name="90212-0011.htm_para19"><a name="09021256000469">The Committee highlighted that problem and pointed out that it is making life very difficult for carers. It is therefore surprising that the limit for earnings by those receiving carer&#146;s allowance has been frozen, so carers will not catch up this year. Not only is there no synchronicity, which we wanted to help carers, but carers have been done down a little bit by the limit not being increased in line with inflation, which is slightly higher than normal this year. That is another example of sleight of hand.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o185"><a name="90212-0011.htm_para20"><a name="09021256000470">My other example concerns the savings credit element of the pension credit. This year&#151;this is being done at a very odd time&#151;the band of income covered by savings credit is being raised. The effect is to narrow the band of income that is eligible for savings credit, which means that pensioners who have got just a little bit more than the basic state pension will get less help than previously. The timing is odd, because the band was supposed to be raised in the context of the Government&#146;s introduction of the new system, under which the basic state pension will be uprated by earnings rather than prices. The argument was that if the basic state pension plus the new arrangements for the state second pension were in place, that would already be helping those who had a little more than the basic state pension, so it would be right at that point to start cutting back on the savings credit. However, to raise the band now, when nobody has even set a date for the introduction of the uprating by earnings, is an example of the Government taking advantage. They are trousering a little money now, when really that should be done later.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o186"><a name="90212-0011.htm_para21"><a name="09021256000471">It is the same sort of thing as happened last year with the National Insurance Contributions Bill. The Government introduced the upper accrual point for national insurance contributions&#151;again, that was supposed to happen when the basic state pension was uprated by earnings. However, the Government introduced that early as well. They have another year or two, perhaps more, during which people with incomes in the band between the upper accrual point and upper earnings limit are paying national insurance contributions and getting nothing for it. That approach&#151;eroding benefits through the details, with a little sleight of hand&#151;is one of the things that leads to strange results. Generous announcements are made, yet the overall effect, when we consider the detail, is not as good as it seems. So, yes, I support the uprating measures that we are discussing; obviously, benefits should be uprated. However, why do Ministers not have a look at what such little sleights of hand say to the general public and savers?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o191"><a name="90212-0011.htm_para26"><a name="09021264000009">It is important that I make two observations about pensioners and their role in our communities, and explain why it is so important that we value that role. We in this place can never, ever do enough for pensioners. If I were Prime Minister, I would very much like to uprate the annual pension by &#163;100 or &#163;200 a week. However, I am not the Prime Minister and I appreciate that that would be impossible to do, whoever I was. I welcome the Government&#146;s announcement that they are uprating the state pension, but it is, frankly, not generous: &#163;100 or &#163;150 is the bare minimum. Therefore, we in this place constantly need to ask ourselves what more we can do for the retired. Are we doing enough? Of course, the answer will be that we are never, ever, doing enough, but we need to ask ourselves the question.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o192"><a name="90212-0011.htm_para27"><a name="09021264000010">It is important that when we discuss pensions, we consider the many issues facing pensioners today. We understand that although the value of their savings is not deteriorating, the interest on them is going down. A little more than eight months ago we have interest rates of over 5 per cent.; now, we have interest rates of 1 per cent. That is reducing pensioners&#146; income. A few months ago, we had historically high petrol prices; again, that took a disproportionate amount of pensioners&#146; income. As we have discussed, one index of inflation&#151;the retail prices index percentage&#151;puts pensioner inflation at 12.2 per cent., not the accepted percentage that we live by in this place. We have also seen year-on-year above-inflation increases in council tax, which have a disproportionate impact on pensioners and their incomes. A couple of hon. Members alluded to that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o193"><a name="90212-0011.htm_para28"><a name="09021264000011">There is also the cost of utilities. The cost of electricity and gas in the wholesale markets has come down, but that has not yet fed through into the pricing of utilities on the doorsteps of pensioners. I am a relatively wealthy Member of Parliament, and I can afford to wait for utility prices to come down. I do not like waiting&#151;nobody does&#151;but I can afford to do so. For many pensioners, this is becoming very serious. We are having one of the coldest winters for 20 years. I congratulate the Government wholeheartedly on recognising that, but it is very important that they continue to place pressure on the utility companies to get their act together in this respect.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o194"><a name="90212-0011.htm_para29"><a name="09021264000012">Pensioners are absolutely at the heart of all our communities, and we owe them a huge debt of thanks and gratitude. Much of what they do goes unpaid and unrecognised, so we in this place have an obligation, year on year, to ensure that we are doing as much as possible for them.</p>

 This has been a positive and engaging debate. I join the hon. Member for Broxbourne (Mr. Walker) in his praise of pensioners and the very positive points that he made. Labour Members believe that we have demonstrated that we share that view through several of the measures that we have taken and increasing provision for pensioners, whether in the pensions and benefits system itself, or on wider issues such as investment in the national health service and other public services that are used by our pensioners.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o195"><a name="90212-0012.htm_para0"><a name="09021264000014">Many points have been made during the debate. I will try to cover all of them, but if I do not do so, I will ensure that I write to right hon. and hon. Members. A number of contributions, particularly that of the hon. Member for North-East Hertfordshire (Mr. Heald), referred to the slightly complicated benefits system. The Department has a simplification unit that is constantly looking at how we can simplify benefits. I am sure that it would acknowledge that complexity has been placed on complexity, but we try to refine the system as much as we can. It is important, as the hon. Gentleman said, to look at a system that allows for longer-term decisions, and an element of certainty. However, as constituency MPs, we can all own up to the fact that when we press for changes to the benefits system, such changes can sometimes inevitably lead to a greater degree of complexity.</p>

<p><a name="st_o251"><a name="09021264000015"><a name="90212-0012.htm_spnew0"><a name="09021264000149"><b>Andrew Selous:</b>
 On a point of genuine inquiry and interest, is the Minister aware of any country that has cracked this nut? Are the UK Government looking for inspiration from any other country that has gone down this path successfully? I would be interested to hear if she is aware of any.</p>

<p><a name="st_o252"><a name="09021264000016"><a name="90212-0012.htm_spnew1"><a name="09021264000150"><b>Ms Winterton:</b>
 Other countries often look to our welfare state for inspiration, because it has led the way in providing a crucial safety net for many vulnerable people. We look to other countries to see whether changes have been made that could help to simplify our system. On welfare-to-work benefits, for example, we have considered whether there are simpler systems in other countries.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o196"><a name="90212-0012.htm_para1"><a name="09021264000017">I want to deal with a number of points raised, starting with the so-called 10 per cent. rule, which was raised by the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (John Barrett). I want to emphasise that there is no 10 per cent. rule. The income tariff is a simple method of calculating the contribution that people are expected to make to help to meet their living costs. Some 80 per cent. of pension credit recipients are unaffected by what is called the income tariff. The rules have been in place since 1988, but the Government have tried to make the system more generous than it was. Under the previous system, anyone with savings above &#163;12,000 was not eligible for any support at all. The less generous rules also assumed &#163;1 a week for every &#163;250 of savings. Not only is the rate of tariff income half of the previous rate, but we have abolished the upper capital limit, which gives more people access to more support.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o197"><a name="90212-0012.htm_para2"><a name="09021264000018">The hon. Member for North-East Hertfordshire, among others, raised the issue of carer&#146;s allowance. As I said, as we work towards reforming the benefits system we will consider how we can best support carers in line with the principles outlined in the carers strategy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o198"><a name="90212-0012.htm_para3"><a name="09021264000019">The hon. Member for Edinburgh, West talked about the fact that inflation was very low and asked what would happen next year. Decisions on uprating for 2020-11 will be made later in the year, but the Government have already made a commitment to increasing the basic state pension by at least 2.5 per cent. Should inflation fall to a negative figure next year, I can assure the House that we would not be looking to reduce current benefit levels.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o199"><a name="90212-0012.htm_para4"><a name="09021264000020">A number of hon. Members touched on the question of trying to increase pensioner take-up. I said during my speech that there were a number of areas in which we wanted to see how we could improve take-up, and we will continue to do so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o200"><a name="90212-0012.htm_para5"><a name="09021264000021">On benefit fraud and error, I reassure the House that we have an error strategy and that we are constantly considering ways to ensure that errors are not made. As I said earlier, I have tabled a statement to apologise for the fact that two types of error have been made, but we certainly try to minimise them. The estimated level of overpayment due to fraud and error across all benefits is at 2 per cent., the lowest ever, and we are bringing it down. There has been a great deal of consensus that personal accounts and auto-enrolment are the right way forward, and we certainly want to ensure that they start in 2012.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o201"><a name="90212-0012.htm_para6"><a name="09021264000022">I turn to the rate of pensioner inflation, as I believe it is called. It is true that a report by the Institute for Fiscal Studies on the inflation experiences of older households, published in October, suggested that in August 2008 pensioners were experiencing inflation of 7.4 per cent., or about 9 per cent. in the case of the oldest and poorest pensioners. However, it is important to point out that it also stressed that in the long term average inflation is almost identical for pensioners and non-pensioners. It showed also that pension credit is worth about &#163;430 a year more than it would have been if it had been uprated since 2001 according to the inflation index used in the report. Similar figures show that the state pension is currently &#163;340 a year more than if it had been uprated according to the inflation figures given in the report since 1987.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o203"><a name="90212-0012.htm_para8"><a name="09021264000026">I will write to the hon. Gentleman about the national insurance fund. I am sure that he realises that the combination of recent economic prosperity and demographics means that contributions currently exceed claims. Some of that money has been used to reduce Government borrowing, which ensures that everybody benefits, including pensioners. However, that does not necessarily mean that today&#146;s recipients have an unlimited claim on the fund. We need to consider the balance between what is currently happening and what will happen if things become difficult, perhaps because of the downturn or when the demographic balance shifts. We need to ensure that we get that balance right. As hon. Members said, there is a campaign by people who say, &#147;There is &#163;30 billion, it is our money and we should  <br>

<p><a name="stpa_o204"><a name="90212-0012.htm_para9"><a name="09021264000027">I reiterate a point that I believe I mentioned earlier: we have legislated to re-establish the link between the basic state pension and earnings.

 We have tried to get the balance right between a fair pension system for all and ensuring that the most vulnerable people get the help that they need. As I said earlier, the extra assistance that we have made available to people on pension credit&#151;and the savings element of it&#151;is far more generous than that under previous Administrations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o206"><a name="90212-0012.htm_para11"><a name="09021264000031">We are considering a comprehensive package of help for pensioners. We have a robust foundation on which to redouble our efforts to do more. We can do even more by looking to the longer term, planning for the future and making the right choices to answer the questions posed by demographic change and turning challenge into opportunity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o207"><a name="90212-0012.htm_para12"><a name="09021264000032">The Pensions Act 2007 and the Pensions Act 2008 have laid the foundations for pension reform, backed by positive consensus. The Welfare Reform Bill will ensure that support is matched by responsibility. That is especially important in an economic downturn. The cost of uprating benefits for next year is nearly &#163;6.2 billion and almost two thirds of that will go to pensioners. That is significant investment which recognises that it is right to protect the most vulnerable in society, especially in times of economic hardship.</p>

 On 13 January, I stumbled across a copy of <i> The Wall Street Journal</i>. An articled headed &#147;Tehran&#146;s strip club&#148; reported something that is widely known across the Atlantic in the United States but has not had much oxygen, or light shed on it, in the United Kingdom either in the media or in Parliament. Nevertheless, it relates to our security policy, and our attempts to combat terrorism and have high standards of banking.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o213"><a name="90212-0012.htm_para18"><a name="09021264000039">I discovered that Lloyds TSB had pleaded guilty to the Attorney General&#146;s Department in the United States to doing things in London to circumvent US sanctions against Iran. Not only <i> The Wall </i><i> Street Journal</i>, but many other<i> </i>journals report that Lloyds TSB has entered into what is described as a deferred prosecution agreement with the US federal authorities, whereby it has already paid $300 million to those authorities by way of a fine. That was done not with a view to settling the matter, but to entering into an agreement with the federal authorities to make full disclosure of what is known in the industry as &#147;stripping&#148; in relation to money that came from Iran via London and got into the United States by the falsifying of documents in London. This is a very serious matter. The US Department of Justice and the district attorney concerned have done a favour not only to the United States but to the wider international financial community and us in the United Kingdom by detecting that operation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o214"><a name="90212-0012.htm_para19"><a name="09021264000040">As I have said, there is no disagreement or debate about the matter. Lloyds TSB has acknowledged fully and unreservedly that it was involved in the practice. However, it made that declaration after being discovered. Lloyds TSB was certainly using the practice, which is illegal in the US, between 2001 and 2004, but never acknowledged that until being challenged after 2007. Indeed, in the period up to 2007, Lloyds TSB used similar practices in relation to moneys that came from Sudan, which were stripped here in London and then got into the US financial and banking system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o215"><a name="90212-0012.htm_para20"><a name="09021264000041">What was the purpose of such a complicated process? I inquired about that. It would seem that Lloyds&#151;and, regrettably, some other financial institutions here in London&#151;helped Iran&#146;s rogue banks to infiltrate the US. The Iranians needed American dollars, sometimes to purchase things within the US borders, but also to channel other moneys through US banks to third countries or other parties demanding payment in dollars. All the evidence suggests that at least some of the money was destined to be used to purchase dual-use materials or technology, as part of the Iranians&#146; desire to increase their weaponry and develop weapons, to the disadvantage of the international community.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o216"><a name="90212-0012.htm_para21"><a name="09021264000042">The system worked like this. The UK branches or subsidiaries of the Iranian banks would send electronic messages via what is described as the SWIFT banking payment system, which would go to Lloyds. Employees at Lloyds in London would then re-key the data into a new SWIFT message, carefully removing any reference to Iran or its banks. Employees at the British bank called the process &#147;stripping&#148;, as I have already said.  <br>

The US sophisticated screening operations and software would normally have flagged up concerns, but as the transfers came from a respected British financial institution, the alert system did not operate. As I have said, that is agreed ground, and Lloyds TSB has acknowledged it. The Iranians also benefited sometimes from overnight deposits in the US, taking advantage of favourable interest rates.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o217"><a name="90212-0012.htm_para22"><a name="09021264000043">The US authorities are now in a race to track down the ultimate destinations of those moneys and their precise origins. The district attorney&#146;s office has made it clear that he fears some of the funds</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o218"><a name="90212-0012.htm_para23"><a name="09021264000044">I also regret to tell the House that it is not just Lloyds TSB that is involved. Since starting to delve into the issue, I have discovered that Barclays is having to co-operate with both the US Department of Justice and the district attorney, apparently in relation to similar transactions. Regrettably, the Royal Bank of Scotland has indicated that ABN Amro, which it bought earlier this year with our money, is also being investigated by the US Department of Justice about a similar issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o219"><a name="90212-0012.htm_para24"><a name="09021264000045">On 21 January, I raised this matter at Prime Minister&#146;s questions, and the Prime Minister undertook to look into the matter and to write to me. I asked him how on earth this action could have been taken in London by Lloyds TSB, a British financial institution, to get around US sanctions, and how Lloyds TSB staff could have falsified documents&#151;not my words; that is the admission&#151;to get round those sanctions. Bearing in mind the fact that the United Kingdom has boasted about the need for a strict regime of banking transparency across the membership of the United Nations in order to combat terrorism, how could this have happened in the United Kingdom without there being a breach of UK law? I asked what regulatory bodies such as the Financial Services Authority, the Serious Organised Crime Agency, the Bank of England and the Treasury, and our security and intelligence services, had been doing about it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o220"><a name="90212-0012.htm_para25"><a name="09021264000046">On 29 January, the Prime Minister wrote to me in reply to my questions. He said:</p>

There is nothing further I can add in relation to the agreement reached between the US authorities and Lloyds TSB which is a matter between those two parties. You asked why the Bank has not been prosecuted in the UK regarding this matter. The US action against Lloyds TSB concerns past breaches of US sanctions. We can only prosecute in the UK in relation to breaches of UK law.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o221"><a name="90212-0012.htm_para26"><a name="09021264000047">In my view, the Prime Minister has missed the point. After 9/11, the United Kingdom led the call for transparency across the United Nations, and many of us are proud of the diligent work of Sir Jeremy Greenstock, the then United Kingdom ambassador to the UN, who led the sanctions committee. I had assumed, as had other hon. Members, that we had the most rigorous regime of scrutiny and oversight of our banking and financial sector, in order to frustrate illegal transfers across countries in breach of United Nations sanctions.

many British soldiers had been killed by ordnance emanating from Iran, that significant sanctions were in place. For a long time, all of us&#151;particularly Her Majesty&#146;s Government&#151;have been concerned about Iran&#146;s desire to develop missiles and nuclear weapons to a point that we believe will threaten our interests. I find it fantastic that it is not in breach of United Kingdom law for officials at Lloyds TSB in London to falsify documents. Even if I am wrong about the sanctions and that none existed at the time, there must surely be an offence relating to the falsifying of documents.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o223"><a name="90212-0012.htm_para28"><a name="09021264000049">I am concerned that there is no indication of any attempt by the regulatory bodies to which I have referred to investigate this matter, or of any serious attempt to find the law in this matter. I felt, from the tone of his letter, that the Prime Minister went on to slap my wrists. He said:</p>
<a name="90212-0012.htm_brev5"><a name="09021264000123"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Contrary to the assertion that you made in the House, the US case against Lloyds TSB has not involved accusations of money laundering. Therefore there is no suggestion that Lloyds TSB has contravened UK anti-money laundering legislation.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o224"><a name="90212-0012.htm_para29"><a name="09021264000050">I was slightly irritated by that, so I thought I would look up the definition of money laundering. I had assumed that it was quite an old term, but I found that it was apparently invented by <i> The Guardian </i>newspaper at the time of Watergate, so it is a relatively recent one. Money laundering is, I discovered,</p>
<a name="90212-0012.htm_brev6"><a name="09021264000124"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;the practice of engaging in finance/financial transactions in order to conceal the identity, source and/or destination of illegally gained money&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o225"><a name="90212-0012.htm_para30"><a name="09021264000051">The Prime Minister&#146;s thesis is that at the time of this action, the UK did not have sanctions against Iran in place; apparently we have had them only since early 2007, which will no doubt feature in the Minister&#146;s brief. The Prime Minister thus seems to think that this is not a matter for the UK authorities, but I believe that money laundering is.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o226"><a name="90212-0012.htm_para31"><a name="09021264000052">Money laundering is something that has had to be combated&#151;both in principle and, I think, in law&#151;for a number of years. We are parties to an organisation known as the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering; it is based in Paris and is primarily known by its French name&#151;Groupe d&#146;action financière sur le blanchiment de capitaux. We signed in 1996&#151;it was revised in 2003&#151;and agreed to criminalise money laundering and to enable the authorities to confiscate the proceeds of money laundering. Countries are required to ensure that their banks</p>
<a name="90212-0012.htm_brev7"><a name="09021264000125"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;report certain suspicious financial activities to the appropriate financial regulators and law enforcement authorities.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o227"><a name="90212-0012.htm_para32"><a name="09021264000053">There is also something known as the suspicious activities report, to which even Members of Parliament are subject. Lloyds, of course, was hardly going to declare its own wrongdoing, but the UK has an obligation under FATF membership to bear down on such activities. That, however, we have singularly failed to do. Will the Minister kindly address that point in his reply?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o228"><a name="90212-0012.htm_para33"><a name="09021264000054">The biggest potential payoff is that Lloyds must now disclose fully to the US authorities all the details of these wire transfers originating in Iran and help the CIA and the FBI to track them to their final destinations. I would like to be assured, however, that, at least from now on, the UK authorities will say they also want full disclosure.</p>

Lloyds TSB has not used that as a defence in any case, but there is no doubt that the particular FATF agreement to which the UK is party requires us to ensure the highest standards of banking. The UK has clearly failed in that regard and we should be ashamed of that. It is acutely embarrassing to the UK, particularly to the Foreign Office, which, metaphorically speaking, beat around the head those states that were somewhat reluctant after 9/11 to adopt the required transparency.</p>

In particular, I discovered that a man named Conal Walsh had written in <i> The Observer </i>on 8 October 2006:</p>

Even if at the time of these practices by Lloyds TSB there was no Order in Council or statutory instrument making the activity specifically illegal in the United Kingdom, surely through our lack of intervention we were acquiescing in a serious breach of our international obligations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o243"><a name="90212-0013.htm_para12"><a name="09021264000069">Lloyds had not owned up to that activity, although it had ceased to engage in it in 2004. It was rumbled only because in 2006 the diligent US authorities had embarked on an investigation of the relationship between the Government of Iran and two New York entities. It was during that investigation that they stumbled across evidence that Lloyds</p>
<a name="90212-0013.htm_brev9"><a name="09021264000135"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;was engaged in the illegal transfer of funds into Manhattan on behalf of sanctioned Iranian banks.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o244"><a name="90212-0013.htm_para13"><a name="09021264000070">Regrettably, it seems that they also discovered that other UK financial institutions might be involved in the practice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o245"><a name="90212-0013.htm_para14"><a name="09021264000071">The authorities discovered that Iranian business men were looking for high-quality American electronics. They had to act stealthily. They sought special parts coveted by Iran and especially by those seeking to make roadside bombs to kill United States troops in Iraq. That seems to have been the position. When the US Attorney General was asked whether these moneys were being directed towards terrorism, he said, &#147;Actually that&#146;s why we need the full disclosure. We want to know where this came from and where it was going to.&#148; If the United States has not, as of this afternoon, fully discovered and had declared to it the totality of this criminal act in the United States, what confidence can I have, as a Member of the House of Commons, that our FSA, our security and intelligence services, the Bank of England and the Treasury have the slightest notion of what has gone on? I have no confidence about that. All the evidence suggests that there has been wilful ignorance and a washing of hands on the part of these agencies.</p>

One internal Lloyds TSB document said that transactions from the London branches of Iranian banks should be processed in &#147;the normal  <br>

way&#148;, which meant removing information that would tie them to Iran&#151;this is all according to the agreement that Lloyds has now entered into with the US authorities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o247"><a name="90212-0013.htm_para16"><a name="09021264000073">Lloyds eventually dedicated specific employees to scrubbing the Iranian transactions&#151;I think there was even an instruction book on how the employees dealt with that. One of the main questions on which the United States authorities are focusing is whether the money went to terrorism. I, too, want to know the answer to that, and I am entitled to know it, given that, apparently, I and others in this House have sent our armed forces into conflict situations where ordnance is coming from Iran.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o248"><a name="90212-0013.htm_para17"><a name="09021264000074">In summary, I ask the Minister to address the following points. Will he tell us precisely to what extent this has been examined by the Treasury, the Bank of England, the FSA, SOCA and our security and intelligence services? I guess that he will not tell us about the last of those, and that goes to the heart of the problems with this place&#151;there is no oversight of the security and intelligence services. The ridiculous Intelligence and Security Committee is not a parliamentary Committee; we do not even know, and we not allowed to know, whether it is even trespassing on this issue. That is a further indication of why we need a proper parliamentary Committee. Perhaps we could also create a precedent&#151;perhaps the Minister will indicate whether the Intelligence and Security Committee has looked at this. If it has not, will he invite it to do so?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o249"><a name="90212-0013.htm_para18"><a name="09021264000075">I have focused largely on Iran, but some $20 million came from Sudan, through this process, to the US. As has been indicated, this practice went on until 2007&#151;I do not know whether it is a coincidence, but that was when a statutory instrument was passed here. That was probably the cut-off point. It rather indicates that there was full knowledge of and consent about this grave matter by people at a certain level in Lloyds&#151;they were watching all the time. I want the Minister to tell me specifically whether it is lawful for a UK bank to falsify documents in the UK&#151;let us forget about the US on that particular point.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o250"><a name="90212-0013.htm_para19"><a name="09021264000076">Obviously, this was a systematic process; people were prepared to do this and it was sanctioned at the highest level in Lloyds TSB. One of the things that we have discovered over the past few weeks is that people do not do things for nowt&#151;clearly, bonuses would have been paid to these people. I would like the Minister to say&#151;if he would not mind&#151;whether or not bonuses were paid to the staff and managers involved.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o251"><a name="90212-0013.htm_para20"><a name="09021264000077">Over the past three or four months, the sums of money that have been discussed in this place are beyond belief&#151;not billions, but trillions&#151;so a mere $300 million may appear small change. But to most of us, it is a very serious matter. That is the sum paid to the US authorities by Lloyds TSB as an interim payment. It is no exaggeration to say that that is our money, which is not to say that the US authorities were wrong to demand it. Therefore, we have a right to know what happened. There was criminal wrongdoing, and the response by the UK has been pathetic. I am disappointed with the Prime Minister&#151;not because he wrote the letter, but because he should have told the Treasury that it had to look into what happened. I will not let him get away with washing his hands of this issue; it is a very serious matter. It makes us a laughing stock around the world, it will prejudice the reputation of reputable financial institutions in this country, and I look forward to the Minister&#146;s response.</p>

 I congratulate the hon. Member for Thurrock (Andrew Mackinlay) on securing this debate and bringing this important matter to the attention of the House. I intend to make only a brief contribution.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o252"><a name="90212-0013.htm_para21"><a name="09021264000079">We live in a morally ambivalent age, and nothing will change that. But what on earth was a British bank doing, doing business with Iran? It was a shameful performance by Lloyds TSB. As the hon. Gentleman rightly points out, the $300 million fine is not coming from a magical printing press. It is shareholders&#146; money and, as taxpayers, we are the shareholders, so it is our money. We need to know exactly what was going on.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o253"><a name="90212-0013.htm_para22"><a name="09021264000080">All this happened a few years ago. Since then, we have had a bail-out of the banking sector, in which Lloyds TSB received the full endorsement of Government to take over HBOS, with this appalling act in the US hanging over its head. We can ask Lloyds TSB and its senior board members&#151;they are still in place&#151;how much money is enough. How much money do they need to make? Why did they do business with Iran? After all, we know full well that in Iran homosexual men are routinely murdered and hanged from cranes. Lloyds TSB makes great play of its corporate social responsibility. It claims to value its people. Well, in this matter, its corporate social responsibility does not amount to a hill of beans.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o254"><a name="90212-0013.htm_para23"><a name="09021264000081">As the hon. Gentleman so rightly pointed out, we do not know whether the transactions conducted via Lloyds TSB have resulted in the loss of life of young American men and women who are meant to be our allies and whom we are meant to support. Lloyds TSB still has a huge amount of explaining to do on this issue and I hope that the Minister can address those issues when he winds up.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o255"><a name="90212-0013.htm_para24"><a name="09021264000082">I do not expect the banking sector to be a paragon of virtue. Indeed, we have seen over the past year that it is very far from that. It is one thing to make bets on derivatives and overseas mortgage markets; it is quite another to do business with the regime in Iran. Lloyds TSB not only did business with that regime, but actively falsified the evidence and covered it up. It cannot claim that an innocent mistake was made, or a rogue manager was responsible and the bank had no idea what was happening. It was sanctioned at the very highest levels of one of the UK&#146;s leading plcs. And at that time it was one of our leading plcs&#151;it was probably one of the top large companies quoted on the stock exchange. Again, I agree with the hon. Member for Thurrock that that is of critical importance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o256"><a name="90212-0013.htm_para25"><a name="09021264000083">The hon. Gentleman also highlighted the very important fact that Lloyds did business with Sudan as well as with Iran. Month in and month out, hon. Members and Ministers come to this place to express concern and disgust about what is going on in terms of the persecution of minorities in Sudan, yet one of this country&#146;s leading banks was doing business there. I imagine that Lloyds bank thought that it was a sweetener to secure further business. I do not know for sure, but I have a strong suspicion that if the people involved had not been caught they would have continued to grow their business in Iran.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o257"><a name="90212-0013.htm_para26"><a name="09021264000084">I accept that there are issues to do with dual jurisdiction, and that we live in a global marketplace where there will always be conflicts and problems such as have been set  <br>

out today. However, I shall conclude my brief comments by repeating my question of a few moments ago&#151;that is, how much money is enough?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o258"><a name="90212-0013.htm_para27"><a name="09021264000085">I always thought that the people who run our major industries, and most politicians, were fundamentally decent people tasked with making hugely important decisions. A lot of people do not like the decisions that our leading business men and politicians take, but they put themselves in such leadership positions, and that means that they have to take difficult decisions and stand by them. The British people are fair minded: we may not like the decisions that are taken, but we recognise the right of the people involved to make those decisions and the reasons why they take them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o259"><a name="90212-0013.htm_para28"><a name="09021264000086">However, I doubt that anyone in this country can fathom how probably decent people thought that it was legitimate to do business in Iran. On the scale of things, and compared to Lloyds&#146; global portfolio, the amounts of money involved are quite small. It did business in Iran because it wanted to earn a little extra. Again, how much money is enough? How much profit did it need to make? Frankly, it is not surprising that our banking sector is in its current mess if such morally ambivalent people are in leadership positions.</p>

 It is early in his response, but the Minister is uttering the spin given to him by Lloyds TSB and the Treasury. He says that the matter has been settled, but it will be final only if there is full disclosure. The settlement is contingent on Lloyds TSB coming up with the fine and full disclosure, but that process has not been concluded yet. The US authorities will draw a line under the matter only when they are satisfied that it has been concluded. I do not feel comfortable that some people involved in criminal activity might get off scot-free, but that has not been agreed yet. The deferred prosecution is precisely that&#151;deferred.</p>

 Indeed, and as long as Lloyds sticks to the agreement for two years there will no further fine or action. The disclosure process to which my hon. Friend referred is not about to start, and neither did it commence with the agreement on 9 January: as I shall explain in a moment, it happened well before that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o261"><a name="90212-0013.htm_para30"><a name="09021264000093">I want first to explain a little more of the facts of the US case; secondly, to explain how the case fits into UK law and international best practice at that time&#151;I hope to answer some of my hon. Friend&#146;s questions&#151;and thirdly, to explain more generally the actions that we have taken to improve the transparency of inter-bank payments and to deal with the financial threats posed by Iran.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o262"><a name="90212-0013.htm_para31"><a name="09021264000094">The US Department of Justice&#146;s statement of 9 January 2009 set out that Lloyds TSB committed a violation of the US International Emergency Economic Powers Act&#151;legislation under which the US Executive are able to prohibit transactions in response to an &#147;extraordinary threat&#148; arising outside the United States. Of course, the US has had sanctions in place against Iran since 1979, so now for 30 years. They have been progressively tightened since then due to growing concerns about the Iranian regime&#146;s sponsorship of terrorism, as my hon. Friend said, and, more recently, its nuclear programme. However, until November last year, US financial sanctions against Iran included a special licensing arrangement, to which my hon. Friend referred, known as the U-turn exception, which allowed some US dollar transactions that involved Iran to be processed through US dollar clearing in New York.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o263"><a name="90212-0013.htm_para32"><a name="09021264000095">Those transactions were allowed if, first, they were sent between two non-US banks; and secondly, if the transactions did not require the debiting or crediting of an account of an Iranian individual or entity managed on the books of a US bank. The way that my hon. Friend referred to that slightly gave the impression that a bank had to apply for such a licence. My understanding is that that was a general licence that could be exercised if those two conditions were met. In other words, the exception applied if the Iranian link to the transaction did not touch the US or a US bank directly. It was designed to prevent US sanctions completely shutting off Iranian access to the dollar, given that oil transactions are globally denominated in US dollars. There was quite a wide interest in Iranian oil sales having such access.</p>

 The Minister might recall that I raised the issue in the context of a reply to the right hon. Member for Richmond, Yorks (Mr. Hague), where the then Minister, our hon. Friend the Member for Dudley, South (Ian Pearson) indicated in his reply that there was not much activity. I raised it in the House to demonstrate that, in my view, there has not been due diligence by our authorities, because demonstrably a lot of activity was going on, but the reply, diligently given by a decent Minister but fed to him by the machine behind, indicated that there was nothing much in this. I do not want to labour the point by going back over my notes, but the <i> Official Report </i>will show that the tenor of the reply was that there was no problem. Well, there was a problem, and part of my submission to the House is that there has not been due diligence by the other agencies, not even to scratch the surface of this matter.</p>

 The point that I want to underline is that the general licence allowed banks to conduct such transactions with Iran in those circumstances.</p>

has explained, to SWIFT messages&#151;messages on the international worldwide funds transfer network, which are known in the US as wire transfers&#151;worth more than US$350 million that involved principally Iran, but also Sudan, as he has mentioned, and, I understand, Libya as well. That involved removing payment originator information from some inter-bank payment instructions, so that payments would not be identified by US correspondent banks as originating from countries subject to US sanctions. The infringement related to removing originator information, rather than to the transactions themselves. That is quite an important point. The infringement had to do with the removal of that information.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o265"><a name="90212-0014.htm_para1"><a name="09021264000099">I understand that Lloyds TSB ceased removing payment originator information from Iranian transactions in 2003. I think that my hon. Friend said 2004; anyway, it was round about then. It is perhaps worth noting that the US banks did process the payments, even though the SWIFT messages did not contain originator information. My hon. Friend suggested that that was because they thought that if the payments were from a UK bank, everything must be fine. My hon. Friend said that ABN AMRO had also been doing such things, too. I was not aware of that; I do not know whether that is correct, but I have no reason to doubt it. It was not a UK bank at the time. There is at least a question that ought to be raised about how the transactions were processed by the US banks, even though the messages did not contain originator information.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o266"><a name="90212-0014.htm_para2"><a name="09021264000100">As we have heard, as a result of the breaches of US law, Lloyds has agreed to pay a fine of $350 million. Lloyds has notified the markets of that, and made provisions in its accounts last year for the payment of the penalty. Given its hedging arrangements, the &#163;180 million provision in place in its accounts will, I understand, cover the full size of the penalty. It is important to stress that the US investigation is specific to breaches of US sanctions law; I know that my hon. Friend was concerned about that point. The US investigation does not allege that Lloyds TSB breached international sanctions, or that it facilitated terrorist finance, proliferation finance or money laundering. Indeed, the deferred prosecution agreement between the US authorities and Lloyds records that subsequent screening of the payments routed through the US between August 2002 and the time when the accounts were closed found no matches with names on the US terrorist or weapons of mass destruction watch lists. The US Department of Justice has acknowledged that Lloyds&#146; co-operation with it has provided substantial assistance to the New York District Attorney and the Department of Justice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o267"><a name="90212-0014.htm_para3"><a name="09021264000101">My hon. Friend, perfectly fairly, asks why no one has been prosecuted in the UK over the issue. As he says, he raised the matter with the Prime Minister on the Floor of the House on 21 January. He has anticipated the answer: it is that we can prosecute only for breaches of UK law, and not for breaches of US law. As I have set out, the US case against Lloyds TSB concerns breaches of US sanctions. I certainly have not seen evidence of breaches of UK law in this case. I have seen no evidence of breaches of international sanctions, money laundering rules or terrorist finance rules. That is consistent with the findings in the US case, which is specific to breaches of US sanctions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o268"><a name="90212-0014.htm_para4"><a name="09021264000102">It is worth noting that the US imposed comprehensive financial sanctions on Iran after the Iranian revolution in 1979; we remember some of the circumstances. However, United Nations and European Union sanctions against Iran have been much more recent, and more targeted. Given the history of relations between the US and Iran, it is not a surprise that breaches of US-Iran sanctions did not necessarily amount to breaches of UK or European Union law.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o269"><a name="90212-0014.htm_para5"><a name="09021264000103">Given the concerns that my hon. Friend raised about the way in which changes were made to the messages, I shall say a little more about how international banking practice relating to the transparency of inter-bank payments has developed. Decisions on what payment information should be included in SWIFT messages has, in the past, been regarded as a commercial matter for the banks. The decision was dependent mainly on what was required, technically, to allow the SWIFT messaging system to be used successfully. However, new international standards for measures to counter illicit financing were introduced following the 11 September terrorist attacks. The Financial Action Task Force, to which my hon. Friend referred, made nine special recommendations on terrorist financing in 2001, one of which&#151;special recommendation VII&#151;covers wire transfers. It aimed to correct the lack of transparency in inter-bank payments, which was recognised as a potential weakness in the system. Special recommendation VII calls on countries to</p>
<a name="90212-0014.htm_brev0"><a name="09021264000136"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;take measures to require financial institutions, including money remitters, to include accurate and meaningful originator information...on funds transfers and related messages&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o270"><a name="90212-0014.htm_para6"><a name="09021264000104">That recommendation was agreed in 2001, and was followed up by technical work on how it should be implemented, which continued until 2005. Once the technical work was complete, the European Union decided to implement special recommendation VII at the Community level. That was done through the Transfer of Funds (Information on the Payer) Regulations 2007, known as the wire transfer regulation, which was taken forward during the UK presidency of the EU in 2005. Following an agreement by the Council of Finance Ministers in, I think, November 2006, the regulation came into effect in January 2007.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o271"><a name="90212-0014.htm_para7"><a name="09021264000105">The EU wire transfer regulation requires payments to contain complete information&#151;name, address and account number&#151;on the payer. To remove payment information, as was done in the case that my hon. Friend rightly highlighted, is not permitted under the regulation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o272"><a name="90212-0014.htm_para8"><a name="09021264000106">Until the regulation took effect in January 2007, there was no requirement in UK or EU law for banks to provide full payer information. So the actions of Lloyds TSB involving transactions before January 2007 do not constitute breaches of UK or EU law. And, as I pointed out, Lloyds stopped removing payment information from Iran transactions in 2003, well before 2007 when the legal obligation to do so under UK law and EU law came into effect.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o273"><a name="90212-0014.htm_para9"><a name="09021264000107">Actions to tighten the law have been complemented by efforts by the banking organisations to raise standards of best practice. The Wolfsberg group of international banks has set out what it calls messaging practice standards to ensure that the payment system is not abused. Wolfsberg also acted to encourage SWIFT to make technical changes to the messaging system that will increase the  <br>

 I apologise for interrupting. I indicated in my speech that part of the issue was the embarrassment to the United Kingdom and inconsistencies with our foreign policy. I listened carefully to the Minister. It took the United Kingdom and the EU six whole years to implement that financial agreement, yet we were bragging and boasting and beating people about the head around the world from 2001 through the United Nations, in a committee headed by Sir Jeremy Greenstock, to implement it without delay. It is a revelation to us. It shows how we&#151;our Foreign Office and the Treasury&#151;were deficient in due diligence on the matter. It is a disgrace.</p>

My hon. Friend asks why it took so long. That is a fair question. That was the period that the FATF took to achieve and agree that interpretive note. The European Union then acted quite promptly and a proposal was made in July 2005. As I have said, ECOFIN approved the regulation in November 2006, and the regulation took effect on 1 January 2007.</p>

We have been at the forefront of international efforts, including action to deal with the threats posed by Iran&#146;s nuclear programme and by its weak anti-money laundering and terrorist finance controls. We continue to work closely with the US and other international partners to utilise a dual-track strategy towards Iran of pressure and engagement. We have taken a leading role in negotiating international financial measures to maintain pressure on the Iranian Government and to protect our financial systems from abuse.</p>
