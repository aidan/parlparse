It is important that those in the industry recognise that they have to work together, and I was pleased to see the issues raised by Sir Philip Otton&#146;s report, which was commissioned by the levy board.

 I pay tribute to my hon. Friend for his work with local race courses. He is right to say that racing is a universal sport that everyone can enjoy, but it is a commercial entity. Complex issues affect the sport, and sports betting, and we need the industries to work together. It should not be left to the Government at the eleventh or twelfth hour to resolve the issues. The industries should consider those issues in a commercial and practical way, while remembering that the sport is there to serve the people. My hon.

If the bookmaking industry is going to survive and thrive in this country, any future levy settlement will have to be much more in their favour.</p>

The British Horseracing Authority is seeking a sum adjacent to &#163;150 million, while the bookmakers&#146; representatives believe that they should pay only &#163;40 million because of the costs of Turf TV, to which they contribute.

read that, but I suggest that you take no advice from this Government, who have not had a lot of luck with the horses recently. We have just heard that there is still a problem with the levy, and we know that the on-course bookmakers dispute rumbles on. I think that we were promised in 1999 that the Tote would be sold off, but that option has been kicked into the long grass. When will the Minister&#146;s Department take these matters seriously, and ensure that racing stays on the back pages, not on the front pages because of unresolved problems?</p>

 Quite apart from the behaviour of Jonathan Ross and Russell Brand, does the Secretary of State share the concern expressed by viewers of the BBC and other public service channels about the torrent of gratuitous bad language that is now found on programmes ranging from comedy to cookery after 9 pm?

 May I welcome what the Chair of the Select Committee on Culture, Media and Sport has just said? I do not expect him to read all my speeches, but if he reads some of them, he will see that since I took on this job, I have spoken many times about the importance of maintaining standards, particularly in a changing world. People can look online for all kinds of information, gossip and so on, but TV needs to uphold standards in this changing world. That is incredibly important. I welcomed very much what the chairman of ITV said last week about the importance of the watershed. I note that one newspaper&#151;<i> The Sunday Telegraph</i>, I think&#151;did a survey that found a spike in programmes containing heavy use of swearing immediately after the watershed. I do not think that that is acceptable. The watershed is there as a guide to broadcasters.

 Certainly I recognise that the BBC is still a great national institution and I am usually a great supporter of it.

 Does the Secretary of State agree that one of the things that has emerged over the past few weeks from the Russell Brand-Jonathan Ross incident is that it is difficult for viewers to know exactly to whom they should complain if they are unhappy with BBC programmes that are funded by their licence fee? Should they complain to the BBC management, the BBC Trust or Ofcom?

 Let me say quite clearly that the episode to which the hon. Gentleman refers was a serious lapse of broadcasting standards, and, indeed, of the editorial controls designed to uphold those standards. Furthermore, the BBC management was too slow to recognise the seriousness of the situation. However, I would refer the hon.

One example of those actions is the review of the BBC&#146;s editorial guidelines.</p>

It already has a record of doing that on behalf of the licence fee payer. It is also true to say that Ofcom has a role to play in taking a wider view of broadcasting and ensuring that standards across the board are upheld. Those two roles are complementary, and they are working well. Indeed, in this case, the regulators have set action in train and done their job.</p>

 If the system works so well, will Secretary of State explain why it is so difficult for licence fee payers, even after freedom of information requests, to find out the salaries paid to BBC management or BBC stars? Should not the first lesson be that, if the BBC is to restore confidence in what it does, it needs to be totally transparent? This is our money, not the BBC&#146;s, and we are entitled to know how it is being spent.</p>

 I agree with the hon. Gentleman that the BBC Trust has a job to do in representing the licence fee payers to the BBC management and the BBC executive. I also agree that, if it is to do that job effectively, it is important for there to be proper transparency and disclosure of information that can have a bearing on public opinion in relation to the BBC. However, I would refer him to some of the strong actions that the BBC Trust has already taken since it came into existence. An example is the King report, which looked into news reporting across the four home nations. There should always be disclosure of information, where that is in the public interest, and if the hon. Gentleman would like to write to me to suggest further areas in which that could be improved, I shall give the matter my consideration.</p>

 As I have said before, hon. Members will have their own views on the services provided by the BBC. However, it is important in this instance not to let the failings of one part of the BBC lead to a situation in which the whole organisation is tainted. There are many professionals within the BBC who provide an excellent standard of service, and we would do well to remember that. Clearly, there were serious failings in this particular case, but I urge the hon. Gentleman not to think that that damns all the BBC&#146;s coverage; it does not.</p>

 Mr. Speaker, if I used that English vernacular word that begins with f and ends in k, you would chop me off at the knees&#151;if not higher&#151;before I had even got up. Yet all the broadcasters now use it regularly, and it is really offensive. This is not a watershed matter. There are plenty of children watching TV programmes on Friday, Saturday and Sunday nights after 9 o'clock. I have watched Jamie Oliver reporting from Rotherham, and I have watched quiz shows, and I hear f, f, f, f. Please tell the BBC and Ofcom that we do not hear that in France, Germany or America, so why, with our great language, does British broadcasting have to be in the linguistic sewer?</p>

 My right hon. Friend has expressed himself very clearly and trenchantly. The report that I mentioned a moment ago revealed an increase, indeed a spike, of bad language immediately after the watershed, which suggests that it needs to be said that it is not obligatory to use bad language after the watershed.</p>

 While I welcome the Secretary of State&#146;s desire for transparency in the BBC, may I tempt him to go a little further and say that, as BBC staff are public servants like Members of Parliament, its senior executives&#146; salaries should be published, as should their expenses?</p>

 I do not consider it right for me, or any other Minister, to provide a running commentary on the levels of individual salaries in the BBC, just as it is not right for me to provide a running commentary on the salaries of footballers, although I am often asked to do that. However&#151;<i> [Interruption.] </i>There is a &#147;however&#148; coming. However, there is significant public interest in these issues, and they do affect public confidence in the BBC. It is therefore important for the BBC management and trust to show sensitivity to them, particularly when market conditions are changing and the rest of the country is facing real pressure in an economic downturn.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o3"><a name="81110-0002.htm_para1"><a name="0811107000075">I agree that a judgment needs to be made about these issues, and&#151;as I told the hon.

 I am sure my right hon.

 I understand my hon. Friend&#146;s point. The issues that he has raised are very much up for discussion at the moment. The nature of our regulation of broadcasting, particularly commercial public service broadcasting, is changing. We need a debate to establish the best way in which to sustain the aspects that the public like and on which they depend, which will mean devising a new way of sustaining public service content beyond the BBC in the future.</p>

 I am disappointed at the tone of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s question. If he were to cast his mind back a little further than just the past two weeks, he would recall that many people in this House and beyond were deservedly congratulating the BBC on its superb coverage of the Beijing Olympics. I think that, on the whole, people get excellent value for their licence fee. The issues the hon. Gentleman identified were looked at when the charter renewal process was taken through by my right hon. Friend the Member for Dulwich and West Norwood, and there was found to be majority support for the continuation of the licence fee. There will always be a debate about whether it is set at the right level, but, as I have said, on the whole the BBC provides very good value for money, and British public service broadcasting, of which it is the bedrock, is admired around the world.</p>

 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State said a few moments ago that it was not down to him to keep a running tally of salaries within the BBC, but does he think it is right for a senior BBC executive to be awarded a pay rise this year of &#163;100,000, when other workers in public sector-funded organisations are required to accept pay rises at and around 2 per cent?

 What the BBC pays its staff is a matter for the BBC, but it is a matter for the BBC Trust to ensure that maximum value for money is achieved by the BBC management and executive. It is important that the BBC shows sensitivity on these matters and understands the wider climate in which we are all operating. If it does so, that is the right way to maintain high public confidence in the BBC in the long term.</p>

 As I said earlier, it is important to understand that the ITV licences are changing. A phrase was used some time ago&#151;that they were a licence to print money. That is changing as we move to a world where the ITV franchise is not very different from others in a multi-channel world. However, I agree with the hon. Gentleman that regional news and production is one of the successes of ITV over many generations&#151;the company&#146;s regional roots are what many people like about ITV. It has put forward revised proposals on regional news, and Ofcom is conducting a consultation on them until early December. I am sure that Ofcom will bear in mind the views that the hon. Gentleman has just expressed, but I also urge him to make further representations before the closure of that deadline.</p>

 Is the Secretary of State aware that there is real concern among local newspapers about the competitiveness of the local media market?

 I recognise the concern in the newspaper and publishing industries about the proposals, and the BBC Trust will consider this issue later this month. Regarding the job that the trust does, in addition to the issues I mentioned earlier, it is now required to conduct a wider public value test on any new services that the BBC intends to introduce, which includes a market impact assessment. The trust is therefore required to consider these issues in the round, and not just to look at the BBC. As my hon. Friend said, there are widespread concerns. They have been expressed to the trust, and I am sure that it will take them into account.</p>

 Further to the question from the hon. Member for Slough (Fiona Mactaggart), local newspapers are among the most vibrant and dynamic locally based institutions in this country, ensuring that our democracy is delivered locally, as well as nationally. As we have seen with the impact on regional news, the BBC&#146;s going in further and driving local newspapers out of business will have a major impact on the variety and diversity of our media. This creeping monopoly cannot be allowed to proceed, and we cannot leave this issue to the chairman of the BBC Trust, when it is the Secretary of State who should defend the right of the people to have the news provided locally.</p>

 I agree with the hon. Gentleman that local newspapers are a much-valued part of the media industry. My constituents, I am sure, are very similar to his, and they depend on the local press in the Leigh area as a trusted source of news. I also appreciate the urgency of these issues. Two respected national newspaper editors are writing about them in today&#146;s <i> Media Guardian</i>, presenting a well-argued and persuasive case for ensuring that we appreciate the pressures on the newspaper industry. All these issues will be considered in the round, and that is why I say to the hon. Gentleman that that is the job of the BBC Trust. It is able to take a broader view, and it is important that we let it do its job.</p>

Booze Britain&#148; report by my Liberal colleagues asks that there be a minimum price for alcohol sales, and negotiation with the EU, if necessary, can he give an undertaking that this issue will be addressed by his Department, so that we can stop vodka, other spirits and beers being bought for cheaper than almost everything else that is available in many of our supermarkets?</p>

 I certainly recognise the importance of the issues that the hon. Gentleman has raised. He will know that the Government have in hand a review of alcohol price, promotion and harm. I have not yet had a chance to study all the Committee&#146;s report, but I have had a look at the sections that relate to my Department. I believe that the Committee&#146;s Chair was on the radio this morning saying that he did not see evidence that the Licensing Act 2003 had contributed to fuelling alcohol-related violence, although the Committee did say that it did not believe that the full powers of the Act were being used properly to target and clamp down on problem areas. We recognise that conclusion; indeed, we have said a similar thing ourselves. We will study the Committee&#146;s report carefully, but I can say that I agree with that central recommendation.</p>

Is this not the point: younger people have heard a lot of swearing and seen appalling behaviour on the TV&#151;and heard it on the radio&#151;so believe that such things are acceptable? They reflect the language and whatever they see on the BBC and on other things.

She is absolutely right to point to the variation in the initiative and imagination shown by local authorities, not just in London but across the country. There are many incentives: the opportunity to host training camps and to maximise the number of local volunteers. The opportunity is part of the economic development strategy to bid for contracts. Of course, there is the opportunity to win the right to show the Inspire mark, which is a symbol of excellence in achievement by organisations, clubs and individuals around the country.

 Let me separate out two elements from my hon. Friend&#146;s question. First, as he will know, the private-sector contribution to the construction of both the Olympic village and the press and broadcast centre is subject to renegotiation in the light of the economic downturn and the reduction in the equity and contingent borrowing available. Again, it is important that the House understands the Olympic village&#146;s investment in new homes for the people of east London.

<p><a name="stpa_o6"><a name="81110-0003.htm_para0"><a name="0811107000144">The second part of his question was, I think, essentially about the amount of sponsorship raised by the London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games. I can assure him that it is on target to meet its sponsorship goals. It has already raised more money at this stage than any previous Olympic city. However, it would be ridiculous to pretend that the economic climate is as easy and susceptible as it was when we made the bid. In these circumstances, LOCOG is doing an extraordinarily good job of raising money.</p>

 I am afraid that that is a rather half-baked Liberal Democrat analysis of the accounts. Expertise was brought in for the Olympics early on. That is why we are on budget and, so far, on time for all aspects of the development. Without going into the rest of the rather cheap and unsubstantiated points that he makes, I can absolutely confirm that legacy is the basis on which long-term investment decisions about the Olympics will be made. Before we make a major commitment of money, we want to be absolutely convinced that there is a legacy to be realised.

The Conservative shadow Chancellor is not present, but I remember that when I last spoke about economic matters, he intervened to rebuke me for irresponsible behaviour in respect of interest rates.

<p><a name="stpa_o14"><a name="81110-0004.htm_para7"><a name="0811107000162">Without indulging too much in anecdote, however, I think that it would be useful to record some of the facts of the current economic situation. Those of us who talk to local business groups know that the position is really dire and will feed through to statistics in the coming months, but let us stick initially to the facts. The Government&#146;s own figures recorded a decline in output in the third quarter, and that represents a fall over the year. The International Monetary Fund predicts a stagnation of growth this year and a decline of 1.3 per cent. next year, which it believes is the deepest cut in any major western country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o15"><a name="81110-0004.htm_para8"><a name="0811107000163">We talked at length about the housing market in our last Opposition day debate. The main market indicator suggests that there has been a 15 per cent. fall from the peak at the end of October last year and that house prices at auctions have now fallen by 30 per cent. since last year. It is worth contrasting that with what the former Financial Secretary to the Treasury told us when we debated this subject a few months ago:</p>
<a name="81110-0004.htm_brev4"><a name="0811107000366"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;House price inflation is declining, but it is doing so relatively gradually, and house prices remain higher than they were a year ago.&#148;&#151;[<i> Official Report</i>, 2 April 2008; Vol. 474, c. 803.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o16"><a name="81110-0004.htm_para9"><a name="0811107000164">The Government told us that repossessions were not a problem, but they have doubled since the first quarter of 2007; at the end of October this year, they were 71 per cent. up on the year before. The latest figures suggest that there were more than 4,000 insolvencies in the third quarter of 2008&#151;a 26 per cent. increase on the corresponding quarter the previous year. The unemployment rate is, mercifully, much lower than during the last recession, but at 5.7 per cent. on the international measure it is up worryingly, although we hope that it will not reach those alarming levels of the early 1990s.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o17"><a name="81110-0004.htm_para10"><a name="0811107000165">Those are the facts, although we will no doubt argue endlessly about the causes. A reasonably fair-minded view is that the problems and the depth of the recession that we now face are partly due to domestic policy failures and partly due to international factors beyond our control. As far as domestic policy failures are concerned, it is reasonable to point out the growing consensus that there was an excessive build-up of personal household credit linked to the boom in the housing market. We warned about that for the first time back in October 2003. Others, including the IMF and the Governor of the Bank of England, also issued warnings; even Conservative Front Benchers eventually spotted that there was a problem&#151;the shadow Chancellor referred to it for the first time in January 2007. Clearly, there is now an acceptance that that major UK problem was domestically generated.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o18"><a name="81110-0004.htm_para11"><a name="0811107000166">There has also been an international banking crisis, for which obviously the Government are not responsible, at least directly. We should not be too complacent about that, however, because much of the shadow banking industry that originally grew up on the back of sub-prime lending activity originated or developed in the City. Until very recently, there was extraordinary hubris and complacency about the workings of financial markets in the City. A few months ago, the Minister&#146;s predecessors were talking to us in loving terms about how the City operated, a bit like little boys who had just discovered an unexploded bomb and thought that it was a shiny new toy. The Minister&#146;s predecessors now realise that many of the activities that were taking place were dangerous.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o22"><a name="81110-0004.htm_para15"><a name="0811107000172">It becomes more important that we establish exactly what that commitment meant and what was understood about what would happen.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o23"><a name="81110-0004.htm_para16"><a name="0811107000173">Let me put a series of specific questions to the Government. Are they or anybody else actually monitoring the amount of business lending, in particular, that is taking place? Are they monitoring on a weekly or monthly basis how much credit is going from each individual bank into the business sector? I hear anecdotes&#151;I cannot prove this&#151;that several of the banks have instructed their managers to cut credit and are incentivising them to do so. One way of proving or disproving that point would be to have evidence, and I hope that the Government are monitoring it very carefully. Do they have any mechanism for telling us what is happening as regards the flow of funds?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o24"><a name="81110-0004.htm_para17"><a name="0811107000174">What instructions have been given to the Government directors? Do we know who they are?

 Does the hon. Gentleman accept that the Government are saying two contradictory things to the banks? Through their regulator they are saying that the banks have to improve their ratios, which means cutting their loans as well as increasing their capital, and through their guidance they are saying that the banks need to increase their loans, which would worsen their ratios?</p>

<p><a name="st_o106"><a name="0811107000176"><a name="81110-0004.htm_spnew5"><a name="0811107000504"><b>Dr. Cable:</b>
 The instructions are indeed contradictory, and we need more clarity. In fact, they are not the only instructions that the banks are being given. As of the other day, we understand that the Government have now told the banks to pass on interest rate cuts&#151;a third objective. Again, we need to understand the implications. The banks tell us that they are making a loss by doing that; I do not know whether that is true, but we need to understand precisely what the banks are being instructed to do and in what circumstances.</p>

<p><a name="st_o107"><a name="0811107000177"><a name="81110-0004.htm_spnew6"><a name="0811107000505"><b>Susan Kramer (Richmond Park) (LD):</b>
 I have checked on the internet with several banks today, and rate cuts are certainly being passed on to savers. For example, a product that was available with 6.9 per cent. interest two weeks ago is now down to 5.7 per cent., which seems to be the best deal available. Does he agree that that does not seem to be matched by the offers being made to mortgage holders?</p>

 Indeed. The banks are simply widening their spread. That is their objective, as the right hon. Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood) suggested. The Government appear not to have thought through the implications of the agreement that they reached.</p>

Mr. Hornby, who on any conceivable measure could be described as a business failure, is now being very lavishly rewarded by his new employer, Lloyds TSB. How is it possible that the Government reached a very specific agreement with the banks on bonuses only to have them completely disregard it?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o26"><a name="81110-0004.htm_para19"><a name="0811107000180">Let me make various suggestions on the banking programme before we move on. First, it is clear, as we have heard in the previous two interventions, that merely telling the banks that the Government are going to operate on an arm&#146;s length basis is causing confusion. The rational response of the banks is to build up their reserves to get the Government off their backs as quickly as possible so that they can pay dividends and bonuses. The Government&#146;s ambition appears largely to be limited to getting the taxpayers&#146; money back as quickly as possible. While those objectives seem rational in themselves, pursued in isolation they potentially have devastatingly negative consequences. If the economy goes into a downward spiral and business credit is cut off, that further increases bad loans, which increase the amount of the recapitalisation that will have to take place. Can the Government be absolutely clear about whether they are going to intervene to give the banks more specific instructions?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o27"><a name="81110-0004.htm_para20"><a name="0811107000181">Secondly, can the Government tell us why they are now proceeding, in terms of their approvals, with the Lloyds TSB-HBOS merger? There may well be good commercial and public policy reasons for that, but I think that they are assuming that because it made sense six weeks ago in order to rescue HBOS from collapse, it still makes sense today. There are growing numbers of authoritative people in the banking system who say that it does not make sense. They want to have the options re-examined and they want alternative bids to be looked at properly. Along with Tavish Scott MSP, I have written seeking an appointment with Mr. Hornby and Lord Stevenson to explain why they are not willing to reopen matters on the part of HBOS. There is also a question for the Government, however. Will Ministers explain why they are allowing matters to proceed? The deal may well be beneficial to Lloyds TSB, but why is it in the national interest?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o28"><a name="81110-0004.htm_para21"><a name="0811107000182">Finally on the banking system, what the Government did in broad terms made sense in the context in which they introduced it, but a whole set of other problems are now coming over the horizon that have not yet been discussed. When will the Government discuss them? One of them was raised from the Back Benches a few moments ago: we have had half the policy. The Swedish model had a combination of elements, one of which was recapitalisation, and another concerned the &#147;bad bank&#148;&#151;the Paulson-type plan, and the Americans have had the other half of the programme, but are the Government going to bring both halves together, and how will they do so? Are they thinking ahead to how the new banking system will operate?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o29"><a name="81110-0004.htm_para22"><a name="0811107000183">We are discussing at the moment a Banking Bill that is valid in many respects, but is limited in what it covers. It does not explain how the banking system, once it has emerged from its massive heart attack, will lead a different kind of lifestyle. One thing that cannot continue is the ambiguous relationship in which banks have what Cruickshank called eight years ago &#147;regulatory privileges&#148;&#151;they depend on being bailed out, in other words&#151;while they continue to operate on the maximisation of shareholder value. That contradiction cannot continue, and the Government need at an early stage to give ideas as to how they will deal with that problem.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o30"><a name="81110-0004.htm_para23"><a name="0811107000184">My second point about forward-looking policy concerns housing, which is the sector that has been most damaged. We encouraged the Government to pursue an idea that  <br>

they had some months ago of buying up empty property and land, which is now available at heavily discounted prices, so that registered social landlords can increase the availability of social housing, thereby providing an injection into the building industry. Although the Government are talking the right language, the feedback that I have received suggests that absolutely nothing is happening. It appears that approval was given for &#163;8 billion of investment in social housing, but that the money is not reaching the social landlords. There are problems with the Treasury funding arrangements and the rental arrangements that operate under Treasury rules, which are preventing progress from being made with the programme. Will the Government tell us how much of the social housing package has reached the social landlords, and how many houses they propose to proceed with in the context of the emergency to which we are told that they are reacting?</p>

We had been urging that, and we welcomed it at the time. The feedback I have received suggests that no instructions have yet been given, or if they have been, they are very discreet. No one is aware of any change in practice being communicated to the courts that process such matters. Moreover, there is an extremely alarming story in the <i> Financial Times </i>today, which says that banks and building societies whose clients are in arrears for a few weeks can proceed to repossession without going to the courts; they simply issue an instruction to the bailiffs to repossess after a few months&#146; arrears. The Government need to tell us how, through legislative or other action, they will prevent a cascade of repossessions from proceeding through the winter, as growing numbers of people find that they are on short-time working hours, losing overtime or losing their jobs, and simply cannot afford their payments.</p>

Will that extend to the vast numbers of quangos that operate under Government scrutiny? Will it be used for companies that are subject to Government procurement? The 10-day payment&#151;the accelerated payment&#151;is a good principle, but how far will the Government spread it? How far has the programme already gone?</p>

been updated to take account of current realities. Given the strength of the Government&#146;s balance sheet relative to the private sector, the Government could do a variety of things to help. They have made several helpful gestures, but they could go much further.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o33"><a name="81110-0005.htm_para0"><a name="0811107000189">Let me consider the issue of the day&#151;tax cuts. I approach the matter with caution, given that the Conservatives and the Government seem desperately anxious to run on to the ground that we staked out. Our approach was that there should be tax cuts for people on middle and low incomes, for which people who are relatively wealthy would pay. We argued that primarily on the ground of fairness. At the time, there was no major economic crisis, but the proposal now happens to be appropriate to the context in which we operate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o34"><a name="81110-0005.htm_para1"><a name="0811107000190">Clearly, people on low incomes have a higher propensity to spend than those on high incomes, who are very wealthy. Our proposal, which the new President elect of the United States echoed at least generally, seems highly relevant. We have advocated a programme whereby income tax should be cut for people on low incomes, either by raising thresholds or cutting the basic rate by the equivalent of 4p in the pound. We are therefore considering an amount of approximately &#163;1,000 for a &#163;30,000 income tax payer. The proposal would be funded in a variety of ways, which we have set out, one of which involves tackling potential tax avoidance and the existing concessionary rates that people pay on capital gains tax. We were impressed with the sensible way in which Lady Thatcher and Lord Lawson devised the capital gains tax rules, and we would like to revert to that, with potentially major Revenue implications.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o35"><a name="81110-0005.htm_para2"><a name="0811107000191">We believe that people who contribute to large pension pots should be incentivised, but that larger incentives should not be given to people who make small savings&#151;we believe in closing that loophole. We also believe in a much tougher approach to tax havens. Again, the President elect of the United States wanted to go down that road. Specific measures, such as dealing with leading corporations&#146; evasion of stamp duty, which the Government should have tackled long ago, are blatantly obvious. A series of measures could, if implemented, enable us to make a substantial cut in income tax for people on low and middle incomes.</p>

 Does the hon. Gentleman agree that, when the proposal was made, it was not intended to be a fiscal stimulus? Indeed, it would not be a fiscal stimulus, because he is describing how revenue would be raised to pay for it. Given that there may be a case for some temporary fiscal stimulus in the not-too-distant future, does not it make more sense to consider a temporary reduction in value added tax, which would relate directly to consumer demand? It seems likely that we will need to stimulate consumer demand in the new year.</p>

 The measures that I have described would be stimulating for the reasons that I gave: people on low incomes are more likely to spend. The right hon. and learned Gentleman&#146;s proposal could have the same effect, but it depends on how it is funded. That gets to the heart of what I am sure that Conservative Members will tell us in the next day or so. As I understand it, the Conservative party proposes funding the VAT cut through parallel cuts in Government spending. Although there may be a case for cutting Government spending generally,  <br>

in the context that we are considering, the proposal would simply offset a stimulus with a reduction in spending. The right hon. and learned Gentleman must deal with the same problem that the Government have and that we have tried to tackle.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o36"><a name="81110-0005.htm_para3"><a name="0811107000194">If there is to be a tax cut, it should operate under three simple principles. First, it must be substantial; a nominal cut has no effect in such circumstances. The package that I have described would cost something in the order of &#163;16 billion. That is a large sum, but as a share of GDP it is not enormous and is certainly affordable within the parameters that I have described. The second principle is that a cut should be fair and equitable, which was where we started from. The third principle is that a cut should be funded. There are dangers in doing what I believe the Government propose, which is to have an unfunded tax cut, which I understand would be financed by Government borrowing. However, Government borrowing ultimately has to be paid for&#151;it is deferred taxation or inflation, and that is not a satisfactory way forward either.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o37"><a name="81110-0005.htm_para4"><a name="0811107000195">We need a stimulus that will be funded and is seen to be fair, but which also makes sense in the context of the need to inject demand from people on low incomes, whose income standards are being squeezed. With that, Mr. Speaker, I thank you for the opportunity to introduce the motion and look forward to hearing the reactions to it.</p>

It is undoubtedly caused by global events originating outside our borders. This recession began in the sub-prime mortgage market in America and spread across the world, mostly because of irresponsible behaviour by banks. The twin shocks of the credit crunch and the surge in energy and food prices have hit every country in the world. As one of the most open trading economies in the world, the UK has not been immune to the effects of those shocks. Although the crisis is global in origin, we recognise that its effects are local.</p>

It is easy to look at the new realities as they are being created as if, prior to those events, we all had crystal balls and everybody knew what was going to happen. We did not.

First, an appalling fiscal problem piled up, the scale of which is being debated but which is plainly making us all very cautious about considering how we can afford a fiscal stimulus now. Secondly, a complete regulatory failure took place here. Nothing happened in the American housing market that did not happen in the British housing market.

 I always do my best to avoid siren voices, but my hon. Friend is right to point out that, despite all the diverting and difficult things going on in the immediate term, it is important at times such as these to look through the sound and fury to the medium term, and to ensure that, in the areas my hon. Friend mentions, the Government position this country&#146;s economy so it can get through in the best possible shape.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o47"><a name="81110-0006.htm_para0"><a name="0811107000230">The scale of the problem caused by the disruption we have all been experiencing in the global financial system is enormous. As the International Monetary Fund said last month, the world economy is now entering a major downturn in the face of the most dangerous shock in mature financial markets since the 1930s. As a result of the credit crunch, we have already seen falling output in Germany, France, Italy, Ireland, Japan and Canada, and we now also hear that the USA is in recession. We are now seeing falls in output in the UK, too.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o48"><a name="81110-0006.htm_para1"><a name="0811107000231">Two weeks ago, the Bank of England&#146;s financial stability report estimated sub-prime and related losses at almost $3 trillion, and it is clear that there can be no return to business as usual in these unprecedented circumstances. The interconnected nature of our financial institutions substantially increases systemic risk if any one financial institution fails. The capacity of private sector institutions to rescue each other has proved to be limited. Governments around the world have therefore acted on an unprecedented scale to support a financial system that has been shaken to its foundations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o49"><a name="81110-0006.htm_para2"><a name="0811107000232">There will be long-term implications for the relationship between Government and the financial sector at both national and international levels. The Chancellor has made it clear that we need to return to the issues of regulation and transparency, and to the design of the international financial architecture, which must be made fit for purpose in a more globally interdependent world. We also need progress on a world trade deal and the rejection of a beggar-thy-neighbour protectionism, which changed the great stock market crash of 1929 into the great depression and the global calamity of the second world war.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o50"><a name="81110-0006.htm_para3"><a name="0811107000233">Unlike the Conservatives when they were last in government dealing with a recession, the Labour party in government does not believe that unemployment is a price worth paying; nor does it believe that if it is not hurting, it is not working. We believe it right to stand alongside people and use the power of the state to help them through difficult times, and we are determined to help people and businesses with targeted support. Therefore, at the last Budget we gave a tax cut worth &#163;120 to all 22 million basic-rate taxpayers. We delayed the planned fuel duty increase, at an annual cost of &#163;1 billion. We helped 9 million households by making additional winter fuel payments of &#163;50 for the over-60s and of &#163;100 for  <br>

However, we are not complacent, and I recognise that each and every repossession is a tragedy for the people involved.</p>

 My hon. Friend is treating us to many pearls of wisdom today, and that was another one.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o52"><a name="81110-0006.htm_para5"><a name="0811107000243">In September, we announced a range of new measures to support thousands of vulnerable home owners. Help newly available as a result of these announcements includes a &#163;200 million mortgage rescue scheme that will help up to 6,000 households avoid the trauma of repossession over the next two years. From 1 January, we will reform the help available to home owners who lose their jobs, so that their mortgage interest is paid after 13 weeks, rather than after the 39 weeks that they would previously have had to wait for help. We have brought forward &#163;400 million of Government spending to deliver up to 5,500 new social rented homes at affordable prices while the private sector market remains weak.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o53"><a name="81110-0006.htm_para6"><a name="0811107000244">The Government believe that repossessions should be a last, not a first, resort, so we have asked mortgage lenders to review their voluntary arrangements for supporting borrowers who are facing difficulties. The Council of Mortgage Lenders has produced its guidelines, and the Finance and Leasing Association is preparing best practice guidance for lenders, which will be published later this year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o54"><a name="81110-0006.htm_para7"><a name="0811107000245">On 22 October, the Prime Minister announced new guidance for the judiciary to halt court action on repossessions unless alternative options to help the home owner have been fully examined. The new court protocols set out clear guidance on the steps that lenders are expected to take before bringing a claim in the courts, to ensure that repossessions are indeed a last resort. Lenders will now be expected to demonstrate that they tried to discuss and agree alternatives to repossession when borrowers got into trouble with their mortgage payments. If a case reaches court, lenders will be required to tell the court precisely what they have done to comply with that protocol.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o55"><a name="81110-0006.htm_para8"><a name="0811107000246">The recent cut in the Bank of England base rate has been widely welcomed. The UK now has its lowest interest rates since 1954, which will provide some welcome relief to home owners who are struggling with mortgage repayments. In the context of responsible lending, we want customers to benefit from the rate cut, and where banks are benefiting from cheaper borrowing, we want that to be passed on to their customers, too.</p>

 There are serious shortages of affordable housing, and fewer houses are being built at the moment. Government policy instructs local councils to reduce the leasing of private properties in order to house people in housing need, on the basis that that is a temporary solution. Right now, a temporary solution of that sort would help to meet not only the housing needs of a large number of people, but the need to cover mortgage costs of those who have these properties and would like to let them out. There might be a solution that meets the needs of two groups: those facing the loss of their property, and the many who are in housing need.</p>

about the difficulties we face, but confident that we can get through them. The UK is better placed to weather the global economic storm than it was in the 1970s, 1980s or the 1990s. Following last week&#146;s Bank of England actions, the UK has its lowest interest rates since 1954, and we also have low inflation.

That problem was not simply made elsewhere and inflicted on an entirely innocent bystander&#151;the Prime Minister.

We have looked at that, and many academic economists around the world have asked themselves that question.

I should be interested to hear from the Economic Secretary when he replies whether the Government have something to say about that proposal and, of course, fiscal discipline&#151;not a Liberal Democrat unique selling point.

we can protect the real economy, and secondly to get every penny of the &#163;37 billion back, preferably with a substantial gain for the taxpayer over time. Those must be our objectives. Let us not forget that we have a big stake in the banks in question.</p>

 My right hon.

As far as I can tell, that bit of the package is not working. I do not know whether the Economic Secretary can, in his winding-up speech, give us any figures on what take-up there has been of that &#163;250 billion. The information is difficult to come by, but my inquiries in the City suggest that there has been minimal take-up. That may have to do with the conditions attached or the pricing. That is a critical matter that the Government must look into, because the whole package depends on our being able to reopen and restore confidence in the money markets, so that in future, the Bank of England&#146;s base rate cuts are automatically followed by cuts in the cost of funding to the banks, and thus automatically followed by cuts to mortgage rates, small business overdraft rates, and lending rates to families.</p>

we are in. I hope that when the Chancellor and the Prime Minister announced the &#163;250 billion guarantee facility&#151;a very big, eye-catching, headline-grabbing number&#151;they did not announce it with the expectation and intention that virtually none of it would be taken up. I hope that they announced it in the expectation that it would have the desired effect. It has not, however, because if it had, LIBOR rates would have fallen by 1.5 percentage points last Friday. That is where we need to get to. We must restore the link, because that is what is broken, and that is what needs urgent attention if we are to fix the credit famine that is affecting families and small businesses throughout the country. No amount of rhetoric or exhortation will deliver sustainable relief if we do not fix that mechanism.</p>

We heard a suggestion earlier about the creation of a &#147;bad bank&#148;. I should like to hear from the Exchequer Secretary not that she has a magic wand but that the Government at least recognise that the extent to which that part of the package has not been taken up demonstrates that the package as a whole is not delivering the intended results, which it clearly is not.

Future generations would be burdened with even higher debts and the recovery might be threatened by the prospect of large tax rises. We would simply be sowing the seeds of the next crisis, but, as we heard earlier, carefully targeted and fully funded tax cuts, and other specific support measures, would bring relief to families and businesses.</p>

Fiscal prudence and a concern for the future does not mean, however, being unable to help, although others who have behaved more prudently in the past have greater scope for action now: the Australians recently enjoyed the luxury of making a decision to spend half their public sector surplus on stimulating demand from families and businesses. We have set out a number of suggestions and already announced the following proposals: a council tax freeze, funded by cuts in Government consultancy and the Government&#146;s advertising budget; the abolition of stamp duty for 90 per cent. of first-time buyers; the use of the Post Office card account to give access to direct debits&#151;thus cutting the fuel bills of the most vulnerable householders&#151;while the Government appear set on privatising it; cuts in the small companies corporation tax rate, funded by scrapping the annual investment allowances; a temporary cut of 1p in the pound in employers&#146; national insurance contributions for the smallest employers for six months to stimulate employment; the deferment of small-to-medium enterprises&#146; VAT bills for six months at commercial rates of interest to help businesses with their cash flow; and, changes in the law to provide breathing space for businesses facing insolvency and households facing repossession for amounts that were incurred as unsecured debts.

The Exchequer Secretary claims that Government debt has been reduced since 1997, but she and almost everybody else in the House knows that the Office for National Statistics figures show that, in fact, Government debt is up a little on the 1997 level. After 10 years of continuous economic growth, our national debt position has not improved but slightly worsened.</p>

 May I take the hon. Gentleman back a little to the issue of household debt? One of the difficulties has been that for more than 30 years there has been a shortage of housing supply in the UK, and that has led to ridiculously high property prices. On the back of that, equity release, based on optimism that house price rises would continue, has gone on apace. The Government&#151;and, I hope, the Opposition&#151;are stretching towards what we need to do, which is to build a lot more housing so that there is no boom and bust in the housing market.</p>

Like me, the hon. Gentleman is old enough to remember when people could not get money from a building society or bank on a house unless it was to buy or improve the property&#151;the money could not be for buying a car, more furniture or whatever.

 I urge the hon. Gentleman to be a little cautious with that analysis. I suggest to him that although house prices are now falling rapidly&#151;and, according to the hon. Member for Twickenham, will fall significantly further&#151;the housing shortage has not gone away. The housing-asset price bubble has been driven by the growth of credit and the invention, for it was an invention, of clever new ways of creating credit, mainly through securitisation. That led to more money being available in the system and manifested itself as an inflation in asset prices.</p>

House prices get driven up when the people who want to live in the houses can borrow effectively unlimited amounts of money to bid up the prices. That is what we have seen in the past few years.</p>

In fact, back in January Alan Greenspan described us as being particularly vulnerable. The EU reports, and the IMF report that we saw last week, have confirmed that Britain is ill prepared for the recession, that we go into it with a bigger deficit than any other country and that because of our economy&#146;s narrow base, we are struggling to find the locomotive that will pull us out. That is because we have been so heavily dependent on financial services, rising public spending and the housing market during most of the economic growth of the past decade.</p>

We have heard lots of rhetoric and been given lots of briefings that are then not matched by the words that come out of the Prime Minister&#146;s or the Chancellor&#146;s mouth. Having heard the hon.

 I should like to start with several welcomes. First, I welcome the fact that we are having this debate, because given the enormity of the challenge we face, the more time that we spend discussing it and seeking solutions and responses, the better. Secondly, I welcome the steps that are already being taken by our Government. I hope that that is widely recognised. Whatever other areas of disagreement might exist in this House, the Prime Minister, the Chancellor and the Government should be congratulated on the courage, decisiveness and leadership that they have shown not only in this country but internationally. It would be churlish for anyone in the Chamber not to recognise what has been recognised in so many other countries. Thirdly, I welcome the fact that the Government, and indeed many Opposition Members, recognise the requirement to address these complex issues in a multi-layered way: at the international, global level; at the level of central banks; at the sovereign, national level; at the level of inter-bank relationships; and at the level of individuals.</p>

I have been here long enough to remember the one before that, Lord Kinnock, calling for a revision of Bretton Woods in the early 1980s. It just shows that if we stay around long enough, common sense&#151;born out of a crisis&#151;afflicts everyone.</p>

 Does the right hon. Gentleman think that one of the priorities should be to put more capital into the International Monetary Fund so that it has enough money to lend to impecunious countries that are borrowing too much?</p>

 I certainly think so, but there has been a shift in economic predominance from the west to the east, and we cannot merely ask other countries to inject liquidity into the international monetary system or the IMF without having regard to the fact that they may want something in return. That is an element of the international rearrangement of the mechanisms set up in the late 1940s, and since the 1970s it has been obvious that those mechanisms are inadequate in some respects.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o87"><a name="81110-0008.htm_para3"><a name="0811107000317">I welcome many of the measures that have at least been hinted at regarding the protection of individuals, particularly those who need the most protection, through targeted cuts in taxation and so on. I do not know whether the Government are considering such measures. If so, I feel that they are to be welcomed. Of course, such measures need to be responsible and prudent, and there are automatic stabilisers in the system anyway, which entail an increasing dependence on Government finances because of the reduction of incoming income, and the increase in outgoing expenditure to protect the poorest.</p>

 Ultimately, all tax cuts have to be funded from some quarter. I agree entirely with the Prime Minister and my Front-Bench team that a recession is not the time to cut back on public expenditure. Some of the increase in borrowing is automatic through the stabilisers, some of it comes through capital programmes, and some of it could be the result of targeted taxation cuts that result in borrowing. The overall limit to indulging in such borrowing has to be set at a responsible level. The point has been made that we are in a stronger position to do that than many other countries because of the stewardship of the economy during the past 10 years.</p>

relatively easy to envisage how we would address the reconstruction of the International Money Fund and associated bodies, and to see how we would address the problems of an individual bank through recapitalisation. It is a controversial matter, but it is relatively easy to see how we would help an individual.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o89"><a name="81110-0008.htm_para5"><a name="0811107000321">It is not relatively easy, however, to see how we might get long-term, sustainable acceptance and confidence among banks that resurrect inter-bank lending, and I would like to deal with that point today. In doing so, I want to make it plain that what I have to say is a result of my involvement in very unusual parliamentary practices in the recent past&#151;effectively, staying silent, listening and thinking. I apologise, and I include that because the ideas that I refer to are not my original ideas but those of some of the people I have been speaking to.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o90"><a name="81110-0008.htm_para6"><a name="0811107000322">We all know that the global banking system has been under severe stress for more than a year, largely owing to a lack of trust between banks. Lack of confidence has resulted in banks largely, although not exclusively, being prepared to lend to each other only at accentuated rates on an overnight basis. That makes it impossible for the banks to provide the necessary funds to industry or the public&#151;both need funds for a much longer time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o91"><a name="81110-0008.htm_para7"><a name="0811107000323">However, if a bank is not fully confident that it can get money in future, it cannot take the risk of lending the money that it has to customers. That problem is easily described. In dealing with the difficulties in the inter-bank markets and in trying to make funds available for industry and the public, several Governments have guaranteed the inter-bank markets. I contend that that can be only a temporary solution and that none of us can be confident that the crisis would not happen again if the Government withdrew the guarantees. That gets to the nub of a thorny problem. Indeed, in the absence of change, a crisis is likely to recur. Once confidence has been lost in the working of the banking system, it becomes far more fragile because everyone knows that it has broken down once and that, therefore, it can happen again. That clearly points to the need for a new structure.</p>

 The right hon. Gentleman is talking about an incredibly important matter, which, as he says, has been neglected. Does he realise that in the United States, several states&#151;for example, California&#151;are initiating major efforts to try to identify whether fraud lies at the bottom of many of the problem loans on banks&#146; books? There is concern that fraud and extreme mis-selling, which has not been unravelled in the UK and other markets, is holding up reinvigoration.</p>

 I do not intend to deal with fraud today&#151;the issue of confidence is difficult enough to tackle.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o92"><a name="81110-0008.htm_para8"><a name="0811107000326">The essence of the banking system is intermediating between the essentially short-term nature of deposits and the longer-term nature of loans. In addition, the banking system intermediates between areas where there are surplus funds and those where there is excess demand for them. The inter-bank market has evolved to deal with that intermediation. The problem is that the market has evolved largely on a self-regulating, principal-to-principal basis. The market is also extremely opaque, with participants having only limited, historic information about their intended partners, whether borrowers or lenders.</p>

<notus-date day="10" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><b>10 Nov 2008 : Column 519</b><br>

<p><a name="stpa_o93"><a name="81110-0008.htm_para9"><a name="0811107000327">The problems that have arisen require a new structure for the inter-bank market, one which instils confidence, is transparent to the regulators at the very least, and is fully controlled. Regulation must be enhanced to focus on all exposures rather than operating in a world where exposures can be made to disappear by being taken off balance sheet.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o94"><a name="81110-0008.htm_para10"><a name="0811107000328">There is no doubt that the problem is huge. I make a modest suggestion, which may catch the Government&#146;s attention and that of other hon. Members as a possible solution. In summary, it would entail the world&#146;s central banks establishing an international monetary exchange, through which all future inter-bank transactions would go&#151;let us call it &#147;IMX&#148;. It would operate like any normal exchange, with the central banks fully and unconditionally guaranteeing the exchange counterparty performance, so that no bank would have a reason not to supply funds to the exchange. All central banks would be fully responsible for the liabilities to the exchange of the banks for which they were the primary regulator. The central banks would own and run the IMX.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o95"><a name="81110-0008.htm_para11"><a name="0811107000329">In the time available, let us consider the mechanism carefully. The IMX would operate like any other exchange, with the critical benefit that exchange participants could deal freely with the exchange without having to inquire about other participating members&#146; credit status. Exchange technology is already well established and is available from many vendors. In my view, and that of those with whom I have discussed the matter, an exchange could be established in a matter of months by adopting the proven technologies from established exchanges.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o96"><a name="81110-0008.htm_para12"><a name="0811107000330">There should be an exchange for each major currency, with the initial establishment of a global euro exchange, a global dollar exchange, a global yen exchange and a global sterling exchange, which would be owned and run by the respective central banks for each currency. Each central bank would guarantee the performance of its relevant currency exchange and set rules for the institutions that would be eligible to borrow from the exchange.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o97"><a name="81110-0008.htm_para13"><a name="0811107000331">It is possible to identify some key features of such a system, even in the limited time available. First, anyone could offer liquidity to the exchange at a set price, including the central banks. Secondly, all inter-bank lending of participating institutions must be transacted through the exchange. Thirdly, borrowing from the exchange would be at the same price irrespective of the borrower, that price being set by the providers of liquidity to the exchange at any point in time. Fourthly, each central bank would set limits on local institutions and charge them for use of the guarantee.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o98"><a name="81110-0008.htm_para14"><a name="0811107000332">It is also possible to identify the major benefits that might flow from such a system if established. Such a system would restore the necessary trust and confidence to inter-bank lending, allow for an innovative and free market to operate, and provide regulators and Governments with consolidated real-time information on global liquidity flows and counterparty exposures, thereby helping to prevent excesses before they occur. One of the problems that we have experienced in the past is the lack of forewarning, just as the asset valuation of lenders and borrowers was opaque. Such a system would reduce redundancy through inter-bank netting at the exchange level and significantly reduce counterparty management and friction costs. I therefore put my proposal forward as one worthy of consideration.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o99"><a name="81110-0008.htm_para15"><a name="0811107000333">Such a system would do one further thing: assist in providing the basis for regulation. The current structure of the inter-bank market, coupled with the off-balance-sheet nature of many products, makes proper regulation of the financial system almost impossible. The unregulated nature of inter-bank and derivative activity, to which spokespersons in all parts of the House have referred, together with the many off-balance-sheet products, has facilitated the largely uncontrolled growth of credit and provided no early warning system to central bankers on either a global or local basis.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o100"><a name="81110-0008.htm_para16"><a name="0811107000334">The introduction of an exchange would provide central banks with the complete and instantaneous information required to regulate those banks that they stand over. The inability of any institution to access the exchange without receiving the approval and meeting the requirements of the authorising central bank would provide that central bank with a formidable array of controls, information and potential regulatory levers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o101"><a name="81110-0008.htm_para17"><a name="0811107000335">We could ultimately provide an exchange that was self-funding, because institutions that would be members of the international monetary exchange should be charged for the access to funds which the scheme affords them. The unit cost of exchange participation could be set based on the stand-alone rating of the bank and the maturity of its net obligations&#151;namely, on the degree to which it is a net borrower from the exchange.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o102"><a name="81110-0008.htm_para18"><a name="0811107000336">I do not pretend that there are not many other considerations that would affect my proposal, such as the central bank limit and over-the-counter transactions, such as credit default swaps and so on, which can be moved into it. However, such a system would at least begin to tackle the central problem that we face when we consider the recession, the acute crisis that we have come through and the chronic problems that we are somewhere near the beginning of addressing. In many ways, the most intractable problem is restoring sustainable confidence in the inter-bank lending system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o103"><a name="81110-0008.htm_para19"><a name="0811107000337">I thus conclude by saying that, irrespective of the economic actions that are taken to stimulate national economies or, indeed, the global economy, it is essential that structural change should take place in the global banking market to avoid a future reccurrence of the collapse in confidence and the freezing of the banking market that we have seen. I am entirely with the Prime Minister and condone his leadership in attempting to reformulate the international monetary institutions. However, in the absence of an exchange, it is unlikely that full confidence will ever be restored in the global banking system, as today&#146;s problems can easily reccur.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o104"><a name="81110-0008.htm_para20"><a name="0811107000338">The essence of banking is ensuring the efficient use of funds for the benefit of industry and society, with a fully functioning inter-bank market being the cornerstone of that intermediation. However, the current inter-bank market is not working. It is inefficient, opaque and largely unregulated. Introducing a regulated exchange would restore confidence, and it would be more efficient and transparent, as all inter-bank and even derivative-type activity could be instantaneously, centrally recorded. It would also greatly enhance the regulatory power and information of the central banks. It would not solve all the problems, but I believe it would be a major contributory factor to addressing the central problem.</p>

 The right hon. Member for Airdrie and Shotts (John Reid) has made an important speech, and his idea is worthy of longer consideration, although some of the details would need to be fleshed out in order to see whether it was practical or could work. What motivates it is a sense shared on some parts of the Labour Back Benches, and certainly on the Opposition side of the House, that the twin crises that we are living through&#151;the financial crisis and the recession&#151;are not yet responding to treatment as quickly as we would like, and that the Government would be well advised to listen to friends on their side of the House, and to people on my side of the House who wish them well in trying to tackle the crisis, when we offer them advice on the other things that they could do to head off some of the worst disasters that might still lie ahead.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o105"><a name="81110-0008.htm_para21"><a name="0811107000340">Listening to the Exchequer Secretary, I felt that she was being very complacent. She wanted everyone to believe that this was a global, rather than a British, crisis. Let us go back to August and September 2007, however. Northern Rock was a very British bank, lending too much money to British mortgage holders to pay too much for their houses, and getting into difficulties because it and its customers were greatly over-extended. It was regulated by British regulators, and they let it down very badly. They allowed it to expand too fast, and then starved the money markets of money in August and September. The Chancellor and the Governor of the Bank of England then lectured Northern Rock on how it had to live with its own mistakes. They brought the bank down and, afterwards, decided that the taxpayer should stand treat. That was not good management, or good regulatory practice, and I hope that the Government will learn from that and not do it to another bank.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o106"><a name="81110-0008.htm_para22"><a name="0811107000341">If we look at the problems that the Government now have with Northern Rock, we can see what a bad so-called solution that was. Taxpayers were put on risk for more than &#163;100 billion, and they have lost &#163;580 million in the first half year in owning 100 per cent. of the equity. That was the stated interim loss. The second half losses might be bigger; there will certainly be such losses. Extra capital amounting to &#163;3 billion has had to be sunk into the bank, and I do not think that we shall see a return on that any time soon. Half the staff are being sacked, &#163;14 billion-worth of mortgages have now been repaid, and the bank is unable to make new advances. It is crippled, higgled and gravely damaged, and the taxpayer is going to have to pay all the costs involved in winding up a lot of the business, getting rid of the staff and shrinking the thing that was once a flourishing institution.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o107"><a name="81110-0008.htm_para23"><a name="0811107000342">I invite hon. Members to cast their minds back to what the directors and owners of Northern Rock were debating in the spring and summer of 2007, as recorded in their annual report, which came out just before the crunch. They were discussing their response to the regulatory signals that were being sent out. The British and global regulators, but particularly the British regulators for Northern Rock, were telling them that they had too much capital for the volume of loans that they were making, and the discussion within the Northern Rock boardroom related to how it could get its capital down, or its loans up, in order to get nearer to the ratio that the regulator said was needed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o108"><a name="81110-0009.htm_para0"><a name="0811107000343">More recently, the British regulators have said to all the banks in Britain that the ratios to which they used to manage are no longer sufficient for the current circumstances, and they are making all banks have more capital, relative to the amount of lending that they do. So in the good times, when there was too much credit, the regulator was saying, &#147;Don&#146;t worry. Lend some more. You don&#146;t need to have a very high ratio.&#148; In the dreadful times, when there is very little credit available for anyone, the Government and the regulators have decided to send the alternative message that banks in the middle of this crisis have to raise a lot more capital, relative to their lending. That does not strike me as wise regulation on either score, but once the regulators have taken such action it becomes the new hurdle or standard, and every other organisation must do the same, not just to meet the regulatory requirements but in an effort to rebuild confidence. The Government need to understand the important point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond), who observed that the &#163;250 billion package of guarantees was not being taken up to a great extent. That is a sign that the package was not properly constructed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o109"><a name="81110-0009.htm_para1"><a name="0811107000344">I fully support the action of Government and the Bank of England in standing behind any major bank that is in trouble, and have always done so. Only a lunatic would want to see a major bank go down, and in view of the impact of Lehman&#146;s going down, I would think that even someone who was a lunatic before that event might now understand that it is better to manage institutions through crises such as this rather than precipitate a major crash on the back of a very large institution&#146;s biting the dust. That is why I supported the Government&#146;s &#163;200 billion of extra loans; and it is why I supported all the extra money that they flushed into the money markets, and the &#163;250 billion guarantee scheme.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o110"><a name="81110-0009.htm_para2"><a name="0811107000345">I think that that guarantee scheme should be revisited. It is not the case that the lending rates in the market between the banks have fallen to the extent that they have returned to their normal relationship with the rates that the Bank of England is signalling, and it is not the case that there is now a fluid and functioning inter-bank market. The best chance that the Government have of getting that market going again is to tweak, or change, the guarantee scheme in the short term, so that more money can flow between the banks. They should be warned, however, that it will never function as well as it did before the crunch, because the regulators&#151;perhaps for good reasons&#151;are now requiring much more capital relative to the amount of lending. All the banks are now fighting to reduce, rather than increase, their loan books, because that is what the regulator and the Government are asking them to do. The inter-bank markets cannot be expected to be as fluid and successful as they were in June 2007, because the regulatory mood&#151;along with the confidence mood&#151;has changed in the banking market.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o111"><a name="81110-0009.htm_para3"><a name="0811107000346">An additional problem is that the twin difficulties of the financial crunch and the banking crisis are reinforcing each other. While we have lived through some of the worst parts of the financial crunch&#151;let us hope that we now have more stability, because there is a clear understanding in the markets that Governments around the world stand behind their banks in one way or another&#151;we are only on the edge of the serious recession that is now being widely forecast by independent bodies  <br>

as well as by most Governments. I suspect that this Government will soon be forecasting one, when they get around to revising their figures.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o112"><a name="81110-0009.htm_para4"><a name="0811107000347">That factor is particularly damaging to an economy such as that of the United Kingdom. The last 10 years in particular have seen very lopsided growth in Britain. Growth rates in London, with its financial services, professional services and business services, have far outpaced those in the rest of the country. Indeed, the growth rate in London has been more than double that in the north and west of the United Kingdom, reflecting the success of those financial institutions and the impact of the credit bubble on property-related and finance-related activity emanating from the very expensive districts in the centre of London. That concentration of effort makes the British economy doubly vulnerable to the downturn now hitting it. The epicentre of the crisis is the financial services and property sector, which is going to fall further&#151;and we have more of it to fall than more balanced economies on the continent and in the Americas.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o113"><a name="81110-0009.htm_para5"><a name="0811107000348">As the recession bites, the loan experience on all the bank books will deteriorate further. To date, we have been discussing the mortgage mess. The Government would like us to believe that the only mess that we really had to face was the sub-prime market in America, and it is true that some of our banks foolishly lost some money on that market, but we know that a far bigger crisis for the British banks was the mortgage crisis in Britain, where too much mortgage advance was made on house prices that were too inflated. There are big losses coming through as a result of that, which is why it was Northern Rock and Bradford &amp; Bingley that needed special treatment in the United Kingdom. British banks under British regulators built a British property bubble.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o114"><a name="81110-0009.htm_para6"><a name="0811107000349">The next phase of the crisis, unfortunately, will be a sharp deterioration in the loan experience that constitutes lending to everyone else, not just those involved in property and finance. The economy is now falling off a cliff, and activity is falling dramatically in sectors beyond finance and property.

in the Government, and in the amount of Government debt they will have to issue, if they do not behave sensibly by doing some basic accounting work and risk assessment on these huge banks that they are now thinking of nationalising or buying major shareholdings in. The Government should be warned by the fact that they lost &#163;580 million in the first half on a very small bank&#151;Northern Rock. They should remember that RBS is 20 times the size of Northern Rock, so if something goes wrong they will be playing not for a few billions of pounds, but for tens of billions. That is serious money, even for a rich country with a Government who collect as much in tax revenue as the current Government do.</p>

Ultimately, they are responsible for the lending policy, the bonuses and the number of highly paid staff, and for whether a loan is made to Mr. Snooks or Mrs. Smith. They will be made responsible by their electors&#151;the people out there&#151;who will not understand if they say, &#147;This nationalised bank is not actually run by the Government. Yes, we the Government put in all the money on behalf of the taxpayers, but we have no control over how the money is spent.&#148;</p>

 There is at least one difference between us, in that I would not nationalise a bank at all, as I think that would be too dangerous for the taxpayer. The hon. Gentleman is right, however, that if the Government persist in nationalising&#151;taking a majority stake or complete control&#151;they cannot avoid ultimately being responsible for the financial consequences of their actions. I think that Ministers are completely responsible for Northern Rock. They own 100 per cent. of it on behalf of the taxpayer, and I quite understand why people will want to make that an issue with Ministers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o118"><a name="81110-0009.htm_para10"><a name="0811107000355">Why did the Government take this huge stake in Northern Rock? They presumably did so because they felt they could do a better job in the public interest by backing the bank than by enforcing a market solution. They did not seem to want a private sector bank to take over Northern Rock, and they did not want just to lend it some money to see whether it could then find ways of making more profit or raising capital in the normal way. I therefore think the hon. Gentleman has a point. When Ministers say they will not intervene, they do not really mean that, of course, because they have already told us they have views on bonus payments and on how much lending should be done. When Ministers try to enforce elements of those views, they will discover that they are trying to do so in respect of very complicated institutions that could lose the taxpayer a fortune if the wrong guidance is given, and which might lose them quite a lot of money even if they do not give any guidance at all. They will find this situation extremely difficult.</p>

It is vital to put more spending power into people&#146;s pockets as quickly as possible.

 I would not start from where the right hon. Lady and her Government start from. I would be running a much more prudent show than they are, because I would not want to spend all this money on bank shares; I would do it by short-term loans and in the other ways that have been identified, so I would have room for a fiscal stimulus in my Budget. My Front-Bench colleagues have backed the banking package in full, which was very generous of them. However, they are absolutely right: given that amount of borrowing&#151;the banking package as well as the rest of the borrowing&#151;it is too risky to borrow yet more for the fiscal stimulus. They are drawing attention to the fact that Britain is not well equipped to do what it should be doing, which is to give a fiscal stimulus by cutting taxes and borrowing in the short term to pay for that tax cut. Given where the national accounts are, it would be ruinous to add yet more to the borrowing.</p>

Past history in this country shows that markets can be very forgiving for quite a long time. Of course, markets are just groups of people: they are all the people in the country and overseas counterparties, and they, like Ministers, want the economy to do well and would like all these packages to work. However, if the Government start to present markets with too big a burden of borrowing&#151;if they say that they need to borrow such colossal sums that the markets say, &#147;But we&#146;re not sure we can find that money any more&#148;&#151;we will be in a far worse crisis than we are currently experiencing.</p>

We can do that in a very sharp, quick, deep, damaging way; or we can try to manage it over a longer period, so that there is not such a sharp downturn, but a longer period of slow growth, no growth or modest reductions in activity. The Government seem to have lurched from wanting a very sharp reduction in private sector debt&#151;that is what their regulators and the Monetary Policy Committee were saying last year, with the Chancellor saying that it would serve the private sector right&#151;to wanting a much slower run-down.

The Liberal Democrats have at least been consistent in their critique of the Government. It was quite interesting to hear the sharp change in tack from the official Opposition Front Benchers. One moment they were espousing bipartisanship; now they seem to have lurched to the opposite extreme of criticising everything that the Government do. Both Opposition parties have come together in blaming the Government, and particularly my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister, for presiding over a build-up of personal and public debt during his time as Chancellor of the Exchequer. They seem to think that the credit crunch and the global issues that we face are largely the result of domestic policy errors in the United Kingdom.

 Does the right hon. Lady think that the Chancellor was wise to make his moral hazard speech in September 2007, in which he said there would be no support for any bank, and that it served the banks right if they got it wrong?</p>

<p><a name="st_o196"><a name="08111015000007"><a name="81110-0009.htm_spnew6"><a name="08111015000114"><b>Ruth Kelly:</b>
 We have all learned lessons during this credit crunch crisis and its implications. A natural fear of moral hazard at the emergence of the tightening of credit conditions has turned to a preoccupation with trying to fend off a global slump, as the reality of the impact that a severe credit crunch can have on the economy has dawned.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o127"><a name="81110-0009.htm_para19"><a name="08111015000008">The seeds of the crisis can be traced back to the development of current account and trade imbalances over the past decade, fuelled by financial market liberalisation and abolition of capital controls in the late 1980s, one symptom of which was the unfettered access of businesses and individuals to credit. Of course, many businesses and individuals are perfectly good credit risks, and not for a moment would I suggest&#151;I hope that few Members of this House would suggest it&#151;that we should roll the clock back to the days when individuals and businesses were denied credit lines.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o128"><a name="81110-0009.htm_para20"><a name="08111015000009">The soaring of current account surpluses in Asia led to low global real interest rates, which, combined with cheap exports, created downward pressure on inflation. The consequence was a sharp increase in borrowing in a number of countries, including the United Kingdom, partly financed by the inflows of foreign capital lending. As we all know, that was accompanied by the greater integration of capital markets, an increase in risk, a reduction in transparency and an explosion in credit derivatives as a response to the huge market in securitised assets. Credit derivatives were supposed to make securitisation less risky, but they ended up making it far riskier.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o129"><a name="81110-0009.htm_para21"><a name="08111015000010">As a result of that global interdependence&#151;between banks and between banks and other financial institutions &#151;the global system became particularly vulnerable to any shock. The immediate shock in this case were the losses in the US sub-prime mortgage market. Those losses made credit derivative contracts prohibitively expensive, securitisation ground to a halt, and banks became fearful of lending to each other and fundamentally reassessed each other&#146;s creditworthiness. Overnight lending dried up and this systemic risk was noticed and perceived not just in one country but across boundaries.</p>

I apologise for not taking up the proposition of my right hon. Friend the Member for Airdrie and Shotts as an automatic conclusion, and for not dwelling at length on that issue. As has been acknowledged, he was right to concentrate on that fundamental weakness in the system, but capitalisation and the degree of capital injected into the system were key ingredients in confidence. My right hon. Friend the Prime Minister and my right hon. Friend the Chancellor were, I think, right to take bold and urgent action to re-inject capital  <br>

into the banking system, to inject liquidity and, of course, to institute the guarantee of inter-bank lending. We might need to reassess whether that guarantee is working, but I certainly would not jump to the conclusion that it was not being taken up and that that was a clear sign of failure: far more important is the price of inter-bank lending, which, of course, as my hon. Friend the Exchequer Secretary said, has fallen recently.</p>

My right hon. Friend the Chancellor, too, should be congratulated on persuading the banks that they should pass the cut on to mortgage holders. It remains to be seen whether any further cuts in interest rates will have the same impact on personal lending rates.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o133"><a name="81110-0009.htm_para25"><a name="08111015000014">What about fiscal policy? It is absolutely right that the key macro-economic question, rather than the one of inter-bank lending, is whether there should be a fiscal stimulus. It is clearly right that borrowing should be allowed to rise during a recession, because accommodating an increase in benefit bills and a reduction in tax receipts will naturally lead to an increase in borrowing. I am glad that the official Opposition have now made up their mind that it is right to allow borrowing to rise and automatic stabilisers to be used during an economic downturn.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o134"><a name="81110-0009.htm_para26"><a name="08111015000015">The big debate is whether there should be a discretionary fiscal stimulus or loosening on top of the use of the automatic stabilisers. The judgment on whether there should be an additional fiscal stimulus seems to depend on whether we think that foreign investors will have confidence that we are not going to default on our debt, and, in particular, on what will happen to long-term interest rates. For any fiscal stimulus to be effective, it must be seen to be temporary. Were the Government to embark on such a venture, they would also have to plot a clear path back to a more sustainable or more balanced position.</p>

My right hon. Friend the Prime Minister, with the Chancellor, is leading on reforming the international financial system and has argued for a long time for the overhaul of credit agencies.

 The Exchequer Secretary referred earlier to the benefit of hindsight, but the benefit occurs only if we are prepared to learn the lessons. There was enough evidence to be able to spot the crisis coming. The International Monetary Fund identified 64 banking crises around the globe between 1970 and 1999. It showed&#151;as did other studies&#151;an overall pattern in each of the crises, starting with lax lending, preceded always by a lending boom. The lending was on risky assets, which were often politically directed for social purposes. The result was unusually exposed institutions and unusually exposed risks.</p>

The third element was that at the time no one was interested in curtailing the level of debt, because they could not see that it was in their interests to do so. Each crisis led to a change of behaviour and of attitude, where reckless lending was described as bold and rewards for risk takers increased beyond the risk involved.</p>

relationships of financial institutions and products, the major issue in surviving such a crisis is the strength of national economies. To see the situation as nothing more than a contagion from abroad is fundamentally to misrepresent it, and fails to distinguish the contagion of the disease from the contagion of knowledge of the disease. For example, the latest US research into the sub-prime market shows that what did for Fanny Mae and Freddie Mac was not that they had caught the sub-prime disease but that everyone thought they had caught it. That is what burst the bubble&#151;a domestic situation and a domestic issue of confidence.</p>

 I am grateful to my right hon. Friend for making that point. He is absolutely right: a number of factors have not been taken into account&#151;the pensions element is one, and the whole business of private finance initiatives is another. That is why it is crucial, as I said, to recognise that although the rules are too vague and flaky, it is not the rules themselves that cause the problems but their underlying assumptions. We can all make nice big rules, but if the assumptions and the data behind them are not accurate, there is no point in having them.</p>

 I am pleased to have an opportunity to speak in this important debate, but I do not think that we should give the Liberal Democrats quite so much credit as some hon. Members have done. I remember not so long ago when the Liberal Democrats were signed up as hard-liners to the neo-liberal project, the same as the Front Benchers of the two major parties. I never signed up to that. Indeed, the Liberal Democrats not so long ago had an orange book putsch in their party that was a victory over the minor group of social democrats who remain from the days of the past. Just recently, they have rediscovered little bits of social democracy, but just because they are dipping their toe into the water does not mean that they have been fully converted.

 I have always felt that a significant state sector, as we had until some 30 years ago, was useful not just because it provided the public with a good deal, but because it was a component of economic management and brought a considerable amount of income into the Treasury. The mixed economy that we used to have worked very well. The instabilities have taken place since we started to dismantle that and to put everything into the private sector and the market, and I think that we will see a reversal of that. In fact, if I had said in the debate on Europe, when the now leader of the Liberal Democrats was so kind to me, that I believed that the Government should take a substantial stake in the banking sector and start to arm-twist the Bank of England to reduce interest rates, and that a Chancellor would tell the banks and building societies to reduce their lending rates and pray in aid the name of J. M. Keynes, he would have thought that I had gone mad. However, that is precisely what has been happening in the past few weeks, and I am very pleased that it has been.</p>

 As the hon.

Curiously enough, the bank in which the state has one of the biggest says&#151;the Bradford &amp; Bingley&#151;has stopped lending altogether.

 The two could easily go together. Indeed, the rate that is charged to existing borrowers and whether one is extending borrowing are two issues. I would want to ensure that both of them are positive in helping the economy. Nevertheless, the reduction in interest rates last Thursday will make a significant difference to the disposable income of the existing mortgagors and borrowers, of whom there are millions, who have been paying interests rates that are too high. That will put a significant stimulus into the economy. I welcome that very much indeed.</p>

I was an opponent of giving the Bank of England so-called independence. Interest rates should be controlled by the Government, who should be accountable to the House for their policy on interest rates. I have always thought that, and I think that it is the case now. Interest rates should not simply be geared to the inflation rate.

just inflation. If the Bank had been looking at inflation, which is currently and temporarily quite high, we would not have seen that reduction in interest rates last Thursday. I am glad that the Bank is now looking at the wider economy and acting appropriately.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o151"><a name="81110-0010.htm_para14"><a name="08111015000040">The danger indeed is not inflation, but deflation, which is much harder to deal with than inflation. If prices start to fall, which happened in Japan, arresting a fall in prices is very difficult indeed. People anticipate falls in prices and therefore abstain from spending until prices have fallen further, which generates a vortex of deflation and a downward spiral into slump. We must avoid that, and anyone who looks at the situation now and urges caution in Government spending or the fiscal stance is gravely mistaken. We are still in a very difficult situation, and I want to ensure that unemployment does not rise and that living standards do not fall, as is possible if we were to move in that direction.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o152"><a name="81110-0010.htm_para15"><a name="08111015000041">Another lever that the Government have wisely kept control of&#151;to an extent at least&#151;is the exchange rate. I applauded the Prime Minister when he decided as Chancellor not to enter the exchange rate mechanism. He kept control of our own currency, as a lever of economic management, and rightly so. Of course, the problem was that, after 1997, sterling appreciated substantially. That was a big mistake. I was one of those who supported the ideas of Gerald Holtham, who had been the director of the Institute for Public Policy Research and who said that we ought to intervene in the international money markets to bring down the value of the pound, because sterling was overvalued. If hon. Members want evidence of how overvalued it was, they should look at our structural trade deficit over the past many years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o153"><a name="81110-0010.htm_para16"><a name="08111015000042">We should have intervened to reduce the value of our currency relative to other currencies and avoided the situation that we are now in, with record trade deficits. Okay, that will have an effect on what we buy from abroad. I like a good bottle of French wine, for example, and I might have to pay more for it. What a terrible shame. It is appropriate that we ensure that our currency value is correct and suits our internal economic needs. If the pound depreciates, it deflects demand to home products and home producers, and it keeps the demand in our domestic economy high. That is what we should be doing now. I welcome the fact that the pound has been depreciated significantly in the past year, and I hope that it stays down and is managed to stay down for some time to come.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o154"><a name="81110-0010.htm_para17"><a name="08111015000043">Of course the third lever is spending and taxation. Perhaps we have not taxed enough. I would not say that we have not spent enough&#151;we should have spent more&#151;but we certainly have not raised enough in taxation while we have been spending over the past few years. I have said in the Chamber on a number of occasions that we should have raised taxes, particularly on the rich. I have also suggested that the Government should make greater efforts to collect all those taxes that are avoided&#151;&#163;33 billion-worth, according to the TUC&#146;s recent booklet. We should do more to avoid tax fraud. Tobacco smuggling and VAT fraud account for another &#163;14 billion.

That is a serious danger now. There has been talk about why the banks are still nervous. They are still nervous because there is still a lot of toxic debt around and they do not quite know where it is. The banks are nervous about lending to one another, because they do not quite know how much toxic debt each one has got.</p>

I must say that I applaud what my right hon. Friend the Member for Airdrie and Shotts (John Reid) said about international regulatory machinery. We are going back to something like the Bretton Woods agreement; we are starting to talk seriously about regulating the international finance sector, instead of leaving regulation to the financial markets and people who gamble with our lives&#151;our money&#151;for their own benefit. It is interesting that Nick Leeson, who went to prison for gambling with Barings bank&#146;s money to the extend that it went bankrupt, complains that people who do the same sort of thing now are just bailed out. We ought to look at that. We should make sure that those people do not get hold of our economies and our lives again.

That is inherently deflationary, because rich people save more of their money, and poor people tend to spend it. If one wants to keep an economy buoyant, one has to make sure that poor people have enough money in their pockets to keep it going. If one gives it all to rich people, they put it in banks, save it, or put it in offshore accounts, and they deflate the economy. Redistribution and intervening actually help to keep economies buoyant, maintain employment, ensure a decent life for working people and bring about a high level of social justice, which is what most Labour Members have spent their lives fighting for. Obviously, I will vote with the Government tonight against the Liberal Democrats, but I hope that, in their new-found enthusiasm for social democracy, the Liberal Democrats continue to move further to the left, and eventually become socialists.</p>

 It is always an honour to follow the hon. Member for Luton, North (Kelvin Hopkins). We are getting a blend of the 18th and 21st centuries in speeches tonight, and that is always a pleasure. I want to pick up some of the issues that have been raised and perhaps to take them a little further. I was very interested in the speech made by the right hon. Member for Airdrie and Shotts (John Reid) about the inter-bank market. He proposed that the central banks create an exchange that takes account of party risk for banks on either side of the inter-bank market. I just want to point out possible fundamental flaws in that approach. That is not to say that we should not explore it; however, it might not be the palliative that it appears to be at first glance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o159"><a name="81110-0011.htm_para0"><a name="08111015000051">As hon. Members will know, there are already exchanges within financial markets&#151;an example is the futures market&#151;that take different kinds of counterparty risk. However, they do it by having margin pools. In other words, they require parties to pay ahead of their due dates, if that is the easiest way to describe it, in order to limit their exposure to the counterparties on either side. If an exchange takes the full credit risk of the counterparty for the banks on both sides of a transaction, the encouragement given to banks to make an irresponsible decision is quite extraordinary, because the transaction is protected by the exchange that stands in the middle. That is almost like saying that the package put together by the British and other Governments to come to the rescue of banks should not only be placed on a permanent footing but should be of a size and proportion that would, in effect, cover the whole banking market. That is a degree of exposure that we cannot possibly underwrite and undertake.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o160"><a name="81110-0011.htm_para1"><a name="08111015000052">For all of us, there is a sense of great failure in the fact that banking institutions have failed to assess the risk of the transactions with which they have been involved. Rather than relieve them of responsibility of ever having to assess that risk, we ought to require them to assess it. That is the direction in which we have to go; we should not basically say that central banks, and essentially Governments, will stand in the middle and take that counterparty risk.</p>

 I share my hon. Friend&#146;s concern about the proposals made by the right hon. Member for Airdrie and Shotts (John Reid). Does she agree that if we tried to establish a central body to take on the counterparty risk, the danger is that it would take on the counterparty risk for entities regulated in other European economic area countries? As a consequence, we would be taking on risks for places far beyond the UK&#151;for Iceland, Estonia and so on.</p>

 My hon. Friend is right, and it strikes me as impossible for an international body to have sufficient grip on and be sufficiently responsive to the sort of transactions and changes made by individual banks all over the globe. Such an arrangement would also remove responsibility from banks&#151;a responsibility that no Government or central bank should take.</p>

That has been a concern of mine for a long time. There was a general feeling that it was following the direction of the future, and not taking a risk, to allow developments in financial services and the various spin-off industries and businesses to become overwhelmingly dominant within the UK economy. However, there has always been a risk involved. For example, nobody in this Chamber, when considering their pension, would put all their eggs in one basket or all their money in one sector of the economy. However, we in this country have largely allowed ourselves to invest heavily in one sector of the economy, largely on the assumption that it would be immune from the cyclical patterns that we know exist in manufacturing and what we might consider to be the more traditional industries. We have discovered that financial services are no more immune than other sectors to inevitable cycles; they follow the patterns that have developed in other industries and sectors. We have put ourselves into the terribly difficult position of having only one major arrow to our quiver. We must avoid going in that direction in future.</p>

They have always seen the two as being in conflict with each other. I have never believed that they are in conflict. This is surely an opportunity for the Government to use every mechanism possible to encourage those industries, for example by encouraging the development of new technologies that will reduce our use of carbon and new forms of energy. Work needs to be done on infrastructure, too. There is a whole range of activities that the Government could begin to develop and underpin. We have before us a great opportunity to channel investment into the future; we know that that is required if our children are to have a reasonable environment in which to live.

regulation. We must work out what needs to be regulated and how it would be most effectively done, so may I suggest one step in that direction? Members will be aware that the Parliamentary Ombudsman recently reached a verdict of maladministration against three of our most significant regulators in the case of Equitable Life, but the Government have not acted on that verdict. What better lesson could the markets, more broadly, and the regulators in particular, be taught than to live up to the terms that the ombudsman laid down, with an apology from every regulator to all those who lost out by taking pensions through Equitable Life, and the payment to them of the full compensation that the regulator called for?</p>

 I very much agree. The ombudsman was very clear and, so that it was not too complex and difficult for the Government to grasp, made only two recommendations: one was the apology, and the other was a swift process for implementing compensation in full.

One particular group in my constituency has been suffering, and its situation indicates the depth of the problem. This group, traditionally, has not needed credit lines and therefore has no credit history. Today, however, the companies need credit because their customer base is starting to pay late, but because they have no credit history, the banks are closed to them. Tied to that is the issue of suppliers. I know that the Government have said that they will try to pay people in 10 days, but my hon. Friend the Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable) asked for much more detail about exactly what that means, how it will play out, and whether it will apply to quangos and related Government institutions, because the private sector is doing almost the opposite.</p>

 I very much agree. There is a fundamental flaw in many Government contracts, because they are designed so that only the large entity can bid on them; they are not examined to try to find ways they might be bid on by relatively small businesses to stimulate new enterprise. In that context, several private companies&#151;Tesco is the name that comes to mind&#151;are going not from 30 days to 10 days but in the other direction, and, I understand, adding another 30 days to the payment period. Very powerful entities, such as the major supermarkets, need to feel some heat from the Government to join them in their approach.</p>

 I thank my hon. Friend for giving way as we move towards 6.30pm. Does she think that the Government should review the insolvency laws and examine the chapter 11 experience in America because of the difficulty that companies could face in a tight credit situation, whereby, owing to payment delays, they face legal action to be wound up? Perhaps chapter 11 is something that we in the UK might consider.</p>

 My hon. Friend makes a pertinent comment and an important recommendation. Having worked in the United States for 18 years, I am conscious that chapter 11 often allows companies to continue and to be restored to health.

when the Government are coming to the rescue, the numbers seem almost immoral, but there is a deeper problem with the bonus culture in our institutions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o166"><a name="81110-0011.htm_para7"><a name="08111015000073">The Government know that many bankers at a variety of grades are paid exactly the same salary and that most of their income is from bonuses, which have always been tied to short-term performance. The problem is that when somebody makes a sensible decision, recognises risk and refuses to take it, they lose out on bonuses and rewards, whereas the person at the desk next to them who takes that extraordinary risk gets the great bonus. When that persists year on year, we end up with a culture in which not only do we reward risk-taking but we penalise people who make the appropriate decision and identify and begin to recognise both risk and systemic risk. We must turn the whole picture upside down if we are to have a healthy banking economy.</p>

 Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, for calling me to conclude the debate. My hon. Friend the Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable) kicked off the debate in a typically thoughtful and insightful way, and no doubt his speech was of interest to all who heard it. My hon. Friend the Member for Richmond Park (Susan Kramer) later made a similarly insightful and interesting contribution.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o167"><a name="81110-0011.htm_para8"><a name="08111015000075">As my hon. Friends have dwelt in such depth and detail on a lot of the salient points at issue, I will concentrate slightly more on the political response to what in recent months has indeed been an unfolding economic crisis, as the title of the debate suggests. This debate is extremely timely because the economy is shrinking, unemployment is rising and tax revenue is falling. The backdrop to the debate is the issue of how that happened. Two arguments have been advanced by the two main parties. The Prime Minister&#146;s essential take on the current situation is that it is all the fault of sub-prime mortgages in America which have contaminated our domestic economy&#151;an economy that in other circumstances would have been just fine. As has been reiterated by the hon. Member for Henley (John Howell) and others in this debate, the Conservatives&#146; take is different: they say that the problems are the Prime Minister&#146;s fault as he grew a bubble of personal and public debt in Britain.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o168"><a name="81110-0011.htm_para9"><a name="08111015000076">In a spirit of generosity, let me say that both sides are half right; they have identified the twin causes of a grave situation. As my hon. Friend the Member for Twickenham said, there have been international factors beyond our immediate control, but in many ways they have been made worse by how the Government have prepared the country for this situation.</p>

make prudent assumptions when setting budgets for the public finances and were painfully slow to respond to rapidly changing economic circumstances earlier this year. As the Minister said, it is easy to make such observations in hindsight; it is much harder to make them in advance. That is why my hon. Friend the Member for Twickenham deserves such credit and admiration, because he did precisely that. The Minister spoke for half an hour, but at no point did she address the salient point made about her response in the House to the economic crisis earlier this year. She was completely dismissive and high-handed about the warnings that my party was offering, free of charge, to the Government. If they had listened at that point, they might have been better equipped to deal with the current situation than they have been so far.</p>

It is hard not to wince when recalling the cluelessness, opportunism and inconsistency that has come from those on the Conservative Front Bench. Earlier, the shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury, who is no longer in his place, made a partisan speech, but he was the one who got his party&#146;s uncertain start under way when he made his now infamous observations on borrowing. In one interview, the hon. Gentleman said both this:</p>

I have followed the career of the Conservative child prodigy with a benevolent interest, and it gives me great sadness to say that at every single juncture of this economic crisis he has been found wanting. Let me illustrate the point. My hon. Friend the Member for Twickenham has led the debate on interest rate policy. We have already heard what the shadow Chancellor said in the House about interest rates in response to my hon. Friend the Member for Richmond Park less than a month ago:</p>

I thought that progress had been made, but soon found out that the headline referred to a completely separate catastrophic error of judgment by the hon. Gentleman.

I took the trouble of reading the article, which contained quotations attributed to the shadow Chancellor&#151;they may have been written by him or by one of the teenagers in his office. One of the quotations stated that</p>
<a name="81110-0011.htm_brev3"><a name="08111015000103"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;there is plenty of scope to stimulate demand with lower rates&#148;.</p>

It read, &#147;Support for George Osborne collapses&#148;. I did not say that, and neither did Labour party Members&#151;Conservative party supporters did. Anybody who thinks that last week&#146;s cut in interest rates was a dramatic percentage fall needs to see the shadow Chancellor&#146;s credibility rating. In one month, his approval rating has fallen from 70 per cent. to 2 per cent., which is a mark of how well the Conservative party has responded to the economic crisis. The article went on to describe the sheer horror of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s position.

They wanted to share the proceeds of growth, seeming never to have considered that there may not be any growth to share the proceeds of.

My party had a reasonably detailed conversation about the Conservative proposal, concluded that it was completely potty, and therefore decided not to support it. We were well advised in that, because now the Conservatives, keen to tell everybody their policies, will be putting out leaflets, inappropriately called &#147;In Touch&#148;, in every constituency saying, &#147;Vote Conservative&#151;we&#146;ll put your petrol up by 5p a litre.&#148; <i> [</i><i> Interruption</i><i> .</i><i> ] </i>It is 5p this week, and it could get a lot worse.

<p><a name="stpa_o184"><a name="81110-0012.htm_para7"><a name="08111025000003">I am not pretending that there are no lessons to be learned&#151;we have done so. That is why the Financial Services Authority is introducing its enhanced supervisory regime and why we have asked Lord Adair Turner, its relatively new chairman, to advise us on further reforms that might be necessary. However, the general public will find it difficult to take seriously the judgment of the official Opposition, who were against our actions on Northern Rock, who opposed the Banking (Special Provisions) Bill, and who would not have safeguarded Bradford &amp; Bingley but who, in effect, would have let it go to the wall.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o185"><a name="81110-0012.htm_para8"><a name="08111025000004">I think that British people have welcomed our decisive action in leading and co-ordinating the efforts of Governments across the world to support the global economy through these very difficult times. At home, we have taken unprecedented steps to shore up the UK&#146;s domestic financial system, providing &#163;37 billion of public money to some of our high street banks so that they can improve their capital positions. Through the Bank of England, we have made available more than &#163;200 billion of Treasury bills to provide liquidity to the banking sector, and we have introduced a &#163;250 billion credit guarantee facility to restore confidence and breathe new life into inter-bank lending. This support is crucial, because banks lie at the heart of our economy. We will do whatever it takes, despite the fact that the official Opposition do not support us, to ensure financial stability&#151;to ensure that small businesses have access to credit and that home owners are able to re-mortgage when they have to do so.</p>

 When the regulator decided to increase the capital requirement for each bank in the system, did it calculate how much lending that would take out of the system and, if so, was it happy with that?</p>

 I will answer the right hon. Gentleman&#146;s question in a moment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o186"><a name="81110-0012.htm_para9"><a name="08111025000007">We recognise that it is tough out there, and getting tougher, for hard-working families and small businesses, so we are targeting support at those who need it most. We are supporting households that are facing higher food and fuel bills by raising the income tax personal allowance for 2008-09 by &#163;600, which is worth &#163;120 to the basic rate taxpayer. All basic rate taxpayers will have seen that in their take-home pay from September. We have delayed the fuel duty increase from April this year to April 2009, saving businesses and families nearly &#163;100 million every month, as opposed to the Tories&#146; bungled policy, which would mean that people would now be facing a fuel duty escalator. We are making additional payments to the over-60s and over-80s of &#163;50 and &#163;100 respectively alongside the winter fuel payment, to the benefit of some 9 million households. We have announced a &#163;1 billion package of energy efficiency measures, which means that all households will be able to save at least 50 per cent. on a range of practical energy-saving devices, for which 11 million of the most vulnerable households will qualify free of charge. We are offering financial support through the winter fuel payment, the Warm Front scheme and the expanded carbon emissions reduction target.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o187"><a name="81110-0012.htm_para10"><a name="08111025000008">Despite the global credit crunch, we need to ensure that the small firms that are vital to our economy have access to the loans and capital they need to let their businesses grow and develop. An announcement from the Chancellor at the end of last month means that Britain&#146;s small and medium-sized enterprises stand to benefit from up to &#163;4 billion in loans from the European Investment Bank over the next four years. Based on the UK&#146;s shareholding in the EIB, British small businesses should be able to benefit substantially between 2008 and 2011. As a first step, UK banks have already signalled their interest in securing around &#163;1 billion a year from the EIB.</p>

<p><a name="st_o235"><a name="08111025000009"><a name="81110-0012.htm_spnew6"><a name="08111025000920"><b>Mr. David Gauke (South-West Hertfordshire) (Con):</b>
 If the Government are on small businesses&#146; side, can the Economic Secretary explain why they are increasing the rate of corporation tax on small businesses?</p>

<p><a name="st_o236"><a name="08111025000010"><a name="81110-0012.htm_spnew7"><a name="08111025000921"><b>Ian Pearson:</b>
 It is always the task of the official Opposition to raise points that deflect us from the key issue. We are acting to help small businesses and to promote inter-bank lending. There were issues, as the hon. Gentleman well knows, relating to the way in which individuals set themselves up in business because of relative tax positions. That was one of the reasons we took the action we did, and we have debated the matter on many occasions. Moreover, the availability and active marketing of competitively priced lending to small businesses and to home owners is part of the conditionality agreements under the recapitalisation scheme.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o188"><a name="81110-0012.htm_para11"><a name="08111025000011">I shall deal with some of the key issues raised. I say to my right hon. Friend the Member for Bolton, West (Ruth Kelly) that we will continue to hold our nerve, and stay on the side of the British people during this difficult time. We in this country will work with others to help to reform the international financial system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o189"><a name="81110-0012.htm_para12"><a name="08111025000012">My right hon. Friend the Member for Airdrie and Shotts (John Reid) raised an important issue. He is right that guarantees on inter-bank lending are only a temporary  <br>

solution&#151;they are specifically designed as such in response to the current crisis. He suggested that we ought to have an inter-bank market exchange, which would be a long-term solution to enable inter-bank lending in future. I would be happy to meet him and those advising him on these matters, along with my officials, because inter-bank lending is of fundamental importance&#151;a point raised by a number of hon. Members.</p>

<p><a name="st_o237"><a name="08111025000013"><a name="81110-0012.htm_spnew8"><a name="08111025000922"><b>John Reid:</b>
 I thank my hon. Friend for that generous offer, which I will take up. I would like to make it absolutely plain that what I suggested was meant to supplement the measures taken by the Government. I congratulate the Government and I fully support everything they have done. Given the magnitude of the crisis, all of us in this House should be acting&#151;as far as we can&#151;to bring together our efforts to address it. I thank my hon. Friend for the spirit in which he accepted what I said, and I shall respond likewise.</p>

<p><a name="st_o238"><a name="08111025000014"><a name="81110-0012.htm_spnew9"><a name="08111025000923"><b>Ian Pearson:</b>
 I appreciate the constructive way in which my right hon. Friend set out his proposal.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o190"><a name="81110-0012.htm_para13"><a name="08111025000015">The Government&#146;s policy on credit guarantees is an important part of the overall financial package announced on 8 September, and progress has been made. Overnight LIBOR was 6.8 per cent. on 16 September; today, it is 3.2 per cent. The three-month LIBOR rate has declined over the past 10 days from 6.3 per cent. to 4.4 per cent. Contingent liabilities taken on through the scheme will be reported to Parliament through the usual winter and summer estimates process.</p>

<p><a name="st_o239"><a name="08111025000016"><a name="81110-0012.htm_spnew10"><a name="08111025000924"><b>John Hemming:</b>
 On the reintroduction of 150 basis points in the minimum lending rate, LIBOR went down by only 120 points. Does that not demonstrate the failure of some aspects of the Government&#146;s policies?</p>

<p><a name="st_o240"><a name="08111025000017"><a name="81110-0012.htm_spnew11"><a name="08111025000925"><b>Ian Pearson:</b>
 I would like to think that the hon. Gentleman supported our action on credit guarantees and welcomed the Bank of England&#146;s cut in interest rates. Some of these things will take time to work through the system, but the credit guarantees, the measures taken through the special liquidity scheme and the bank recapitalisation comprise a sophisticated package that has been copied by other countries around the world. We believe that it will have a hugely positive impact. We will, of course, keep all the policies under review, as we always do with such matters.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o191"><a name="81110-0012.htm_para14"><a name="08111025000018">A number of other points were raised, and I would like to address in particular the Liberal Democrats&#146; tax proposal, which, as expressed by their leader on television this morning, was a sustainable cut of 4p, to make the rate 16p in the pound. I have not seen any real explanation of how the Liberal Democrats would pay for that. It would cost &#163;19.2 billion per annum. If the Liberal Democrats propose to pay for the cuts by raising the higher rate of tax, it would have to go up to 52p in the pound. If they were to say, as they often like to, that the top earners on more than &#163;100,000 should pay, a 26 per cent. increase in the top rate of tax would be required, taking it to 66 per cent. I am told by officials that that estimate does not take behavioural impacts into account. I am not sure how many high earners would remain in the country if they had to pay a 66 per cent. marginal rate of tax on income over &#163;100,000. I am afraid that Liberal Democrat tax policies simply do not add up.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o192"><a name="81110-0012.htm_para15"><a name="08111025000019">The Government cannot and should not try to prop up house prices, but we recognise that volatility in the housing market can be a cause of great concern. That is why we announced a significant package of measures on 2 September, and it is why we will continue to consider what more we can do.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o193"><a name="81110-0012.htm_para16"><a name="08111025000020">On the contention that we did not fix the roof when the sun was shining, I remember the dog days of the Labour Government of 1974 to 1979. We were investing in fixing roofs even during those very difficult economic times. When we came to power in 1997, capital spending was less than half what we spent during that hugely difficult economic period. Since 1997, we have been able to more than triple in real terms capital spending in this country. We have not only fixed many roofs, but we have built new schools and hospitals, and improved the UK&#146;s transport infrastructure.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o194"><a name="81110-0012.htm_para17"><a name="08111025000021">We must not let the official Opposition con the British public into thinking that we have not fixed the roof&#151;we have, and we have taken decisive action. What is more, we were prudent and sensible in running the UK economy. Since 1997, inflation has averaged 3 per cent., compared with more than 8 per cent. in the previous three decades. Long-term interest rates have averaged about 5 per cent., compared with roughly double that previously. That is how the Government have managed to triple public investment while cutting debt. It was not always easy, and we have had to make tough choices&#151;for example, the decision to spend the &#163;23 billion that we secured from the spectrum auctions not on public services but on reducing Government debt. That has put us in a strong position as we face difficult economic times. The Government want to show in our pre-Budget report the further steps that we will take on the side of hard-working people and small businesses in this country.</p>

 There are clearly a number of ways in which the debate could be classified. However, there are also a number of inconsistencies between the Government&#146;s actions and their words. They said that they would sign new contracts for the replacement of the Post Office card account at the beginning of 2008, but it is now November, and we still do not even know who has won the tender. They said that the managed closure programme  <br>

would ensure a viable future for the post office network, but Ministers have campaigned against post office closures in their constituencies while voting in favour of closures elsewhere.

In the same year, they told people who received their benefits and pensions through the Post Office card account that it was being withdrawn, and that they would have to open bank accounts to continue to receive their benefits.

 It is, indeed, the case that the removal of POCA from the Post Office would lead to a chaotic and messy series of closures, and it would also entail a string of personal tragedies, as my hon. Friend highlighted, because the closures would be the result of sub-postmasters facing bankruptcy. They would not be planned. I do not believe that we should be prepared to consider the prospect of sub-postmasters facing bankruptcy as a result of Government decisions. At a time of economic uncertainty, with increasing unemployment and increasing numbers of people needing to access benefits over the next few years, it is extraordinary that the Government would seek to pursue a policy that would actively destroy the livelihoods of at least 3,000 people. Those closures could be far worse for the long-term future of the post office network as a whole, because a chaotic series of closures across the network could leave serious gaps in provision, which would mean post offices would lose critical mass, and that would undermine the Post Office&#146;s ability successfully to bid for future contracts, so this could be the first stage in a very dramatic decline in numbers.</p>

 No, I will not give way any more at present. However, POCA is worth significantly more than that in some deprived urban areas. On average, POCA payments bring in about &#163;400 a month, which is 12 per cent. of net pay. That contrasts sharply with the proportion of income post offices receive from bill payment&#151;only 5 per cent.&#151;and from banking transactions, which is currently 1 per cent. It is therefore clear that removing POCA would leave a huge gap in the budgets of sub-postmasters.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o209"><a name="81110-0014.htm_para5"><a name="08111027000043">This is not just about the income from the transactions themselves, because POCA brings people into the post office, and at that point they also spend money on other goods and services there. Each of the 3.8 million POCA customers pays on average seven visits per month to the post office, and in each visit they spend on average &#163;6 on the retail side. Therefore, the loss of business that would follow from the removal of POCA could lose the Post Office much of its annual &#163;2 billion retail income.</p>

Basic bank accounts do not make any money for banks, and it is becoming increasingly difficult for some people&#151;those with poor credit histories, large debts, previous debt problems or no address, and people with certain mental health problems&#151;to open one. In the current climate, banks do not want to take on additional risk, and the number of people in that group is actually increasing. Therefore, when the Government moved giros to direct payment and made people open basic bank accounts or Post Office card accounts, 40 per cent. of the people converting opened the latter&#151;a figure far higher than expected. They could have chosen to open a bank account, but they did not want to or were not able to.</p>

 The hon. Lady is explaining the case very clearly.

 The hon. Gentleman is absolutely correct, and the issue of trust is an important one. There are lots of reasons why people would choose to have a Post Office card account rather than a bank account, and one is that the post office is often an important community resource. It is a source of advice and information and a place where people meet and socialise, particularly in rural areas. Sub-postmasters play a very important role in many communities. They usually know their customers and they are trusted, as the hon. Gentleman said. I recently spoke to a pensioner in my constituency who relies completely on the postmaster in the post office where she collects her pension. She cannot remember her PIN. He knows it, and he tells her what it is every week&#151;it is the only way that she can access her pension. Clearly, that gives rise to security issues, but it shows just how much postmasters are trusted by members of the community.</p>

Post Office, uniquely, has branches in most rural and in most urban areas, so it has a much wider spread than most other providers. Those using the Post Office card account as their main source of cash are particularly likely to have mobility or health problems and no access to a car, and they are more likely to rely on public transport. It is particularly difficult for that group of people to access a bank or another outlet, particularly in rural areas, where usually there are no banks or ATMs. Help the Aged has produced research highlighting particular concerns among those in this position. They are worried that if they have to travel a long way by public transport to get hold of their money, they will have to take out larger amounts each time they travel, which will lead to security concerns while they bring the money back home on public transport. They are also concerned about having more cash at home.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o215"><a name="81110-0014.htm_para11"><a name="08111027000073">Access is a question not just of distance but of access to the outlet itself. Most post offices have been physically adapted to allow disabled access. For people in the customer group we are talking about today&#151;it includes incapacity benefit, disability living allowance and pension credit claimants&#151;the compliance of such properties with the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 is absolutely essential so that they can access their money. The Post Office has taken this issue seriously, but what guarantees do we have that any new outlets that people are forced to use would do the same? Have the Government done a DDA impact assessment on the closing of the Post Office card account and taking it away from post offices? Have they looked at people&#146;s access to outlets and within outlets? If, as the rumours suggest, PayPoint takes over, what consideration has been given to the accessibility of PayPoint outlets? What control would the Government have over that, given that PayPoint operates on a franchise basis? How much control would the Government have, in order to ensure that people could access their money in disability-friendly properties?</p>

The Post Office is working toward an unsubsidised post office network by 2016, but that relies on people going through their branches and using banking and benefit services, and on the Post Office card account as a transition. If the Government continue on the destructive path that they are pursuing, the Post Office will not have enough time to recover from the damage caused by the withdrawal of Government business from the Post Office over the past five years and to rebuild itself. We have the perfect opportunity to use an existing network of well-trained, well-informed, trusted staff who are in offices in almost every corner of the country to deliver meaningful improvements in terms of financial inclusion. Post offices actually want and need the custom of the people the banks are turning down, so we should be building on that, rather than destroying it.</p>

 The tendering process certainly gives rise to issues that I want to raise myself, and the hon. Lady makes an interesting point. So far as I can see, the tendering process is probably one of the least open such processes that we have had. I, among others, have been trying to get hold of the terms of the tender. I recently asked for a copy of the documentation setting out the criteria used for the basis of making a decision on the contract to be placed in the Library. The Minister replied as follows:</p>

All Members are aware that the decision is being looked at, but the documentation could still be made public. The Government&#146;s evasiveness on this point raises questions about the criteria that they have laid out in the contract tender, such as how much emphasis they placed on the need for geographical spread, which links to the issue of rural communities.</p>

 My hon. Friend is right to talk about geographic spread. She mentioned earlier that PayPoint is one of the bidders. The island of Colonsay has a post office, and if people put the postcode into the PayPoint website, they are told that the nearest outlet is at Bowmore, on the island of Islay, which is 22 miles away. Rural areas will be badly hit; however, islands that have post offices but no banks or PayPoint outlets will be much harder hit if the Government do not take into account the fact that, for all these small islands, they must keep the account with the Post Office.</p>

The Government need to start being joined up and to stop undermining themselves.

We do not believe in a purely commercial network, because the Post Office is not a purely commercial service; it reaches parts of our community that others do not, it is used and understood by people in ways that others are not, and most of all it is a cornerstone of our local communities.

Some 4 million fewer visits a week are made to a post office and 1 million car tax disc renewals are done online each month. <i> [Interruption.]</i> The Opposition can protest if they want, but these changes are happening in our society.

It sells one in 50 of all car insurance policies and insures one in every 200 homes. It is the largest provider of foreign currency in the country. That is all because of the investment that we have put into the Post Office.

Those examples might not be direct comparisons to do with the same type of contract, but they have occurred in other areas to do with public service where there is a social motive.

 I listened carefully to the Secretary of State, but my clear view is that the Government should be ashamed of their handling of local post offices. Over the past few years, I have heard time and again how little Ministers have done to find a new role for post offices at a time of change.

The Secretary of State says, &#147;Trust us and what we are doing&#148;, but we have only to remember how the Government and their Ministers handled the launch of the Post Office card account in the first place. They published booklet after booklet. There may have been corrections in one&#151;as we heard today&#151;but over the years booklet after booklet has explained to people how payments can be made directly into their bank account, and has set out other new ways of dealing with the Department for Work and Pensions and its agencies. However, to the fury of local postmasters and postmistresses in my constituency and around the country, the Post Office card account was mentioned only as an afterthought, buried in the small print in leaflets that most reasonable people judged as completely biased against it.</p>

 The Secretary of State is absolutely right that the issue that we are debating today is not simply access to the Post Office card account to enable pensioners to get pension payments. The issue is also about social deprivation and the challenges that exist in many of our communities. It is a crucial issue for families in the battle against poverty. It is all very well for us; we have easy access to financial services, banking, credit, cash to pay our bills, and funding for major purchases such as a car to get to work. However, the truth is that one in 25 families still has no bank account of any kind, and 800,000 children are being brought up in households with no bank account. Some 7.8 million people in the UK are unable to access mainstream credit. That puts huge extra financial pressure on families. That is why the debate has deeper significance; it is not simply about the future of the post office network, however important that is. We are dealing with a vehicle that can address some of the biggest social issues in our society.</p>

the hon. Gentleman agree that one of the sad things about all that has happened to the Post Office is that it is not just central Government who have withdrawn their services from it; local government started the process. Members from across the political parties could encourage local authorities to look again at the services that they could still provide through the Post Office.

 I would like Departments and local authorities to look at ways of strengthening our post office network, yes, but the significance of the debate is that it shows that there is no other step in the pipeline that would lead to such an extensive further closure programme in our post office network. That is why the debate is so important.</p>

 My hon. Friend has not yet mentioned small businesses, but those in my constituency absolutely rely on local post offices. We have lost more than half our network in the past five years.

 My hon. Friend makes an important point. We know that small businesses use post offices vastly disproportionately more than any other similar services available to them. The disappearance of the local post office can be a real blow to small local businesses, particularly emerging businesses in areas of society that face significant challenges.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o241"><a name="81110-0017.htm_para0"><a name="08111027000171">Of course, there is another dimension to the financial pressure on families, apart from the lack of access to banking services. Someone without access to financial services cannot access the cheapest tariffs, because they do not have the basic ability to pay through direct debit. There have been all kinds of estimates of the cost of the poverty premium to people on low incomes&#151;the extra that they pay to access basic financial services and utilities: the figure of &#163;1,000 a year is common. The Financial Services Authority has said that the lack of access to those services pushes family costs up by as much as &#163;700 a year&#151;money that could be better used for other things.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o242"><a name="81110-0017.htm_para1"><a name="08111027000172">What has the Government&#146;s response been? Instead of looking at how we can build up the Post Office, so that it can offer people extra services, the Government are taking steps that risk emasculating the one institution that has national reach, and that could help to bridge the banking gap left behind as the branch networks of the big banks have retreated in the past 10 years. When the Secretary of State talks about renewing the Post Office card account, what is in doubt is whether, in the end, it will be a &#147;Post Office&#148; card account. If the post office network disappears or goes into another period of great retrenchment, we will condemn entire communities to a life in the financial wilderness, when a degree of planning and thinking could have turned&#151;could still turn&#151;our post office network into a real force for good in many areas, growing, becoming more diverse and offering a route into banking for those who are deprived of it. That is why we have proposed an extension of the functionality of the Post Office card account&#151;initially to help people to access a better deal on their utility bills&#151;and it is why we think that there is enormous potential in expanding the account into other areas.</p>

Ministers have talked a lot in the past few weeks about the fact that some of our poorest people cannot access the cheapest tariffs from electricity and gas providers. If people were able to use their Post Office card accounts to make direct debit payments for their utility bills, they would be able to access those much cheaper tariffs. It is a simple idea at a time of high energy bills, and I wish that Ministers would seize on it and turn it into a reality.

The Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats try to portray the accounts as a grand old British tradition, like fox hunting or the Poor Law, but the account was created by the Labour Government in 2003 as the electronic equivalent of the benefits order book, which people used to collect their pensions. The Post Office card account is a hugely valued public service, and it was created by this Labour Government.</p>

Of course, the account costs money. It is quite expensive compared with other services, but so are other initiatives created by the Labour Government: Jobcentre Plus offices, Sure Start and the new deal are all expensive, but who today would disband any of them on the ground that they cost a lot of money? The answer, I suppose, is the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats, as they opposed their creation in the first place.

Gentleman agree that in many communities&#151;particularly, speaking as an urban Member, inner-city communities&#151;we should think of these post offices as an outreach: a fantastic resource through which we could find many other ways of getting to people in difficulty instead of seeing them, as the Government do, as a problem because there are too many of them?</p>

 I entirely agree with the right hon. Gentleman. What we have is a public resource going right back to Rowland Hill in 1840. These days, there are very few institutions that are greatly respected by ordinary people&#151;obviously the national health service is one of them, but the Post Office is certainly another.

 I intend to speak primarily as Chairman of the Business and Enterprise Committee, which this morning produced a report on this very subject. We published it because we were so concerned about the extraordinary delay in reaching a decision that was originally trumpeted as coming in early 2008, then hinted at before the summer recess, and now here we are in the middle of November still with no decision.

An 84-year-old man from Droitwich rang my office this morning to say how worried he was about the future of the Post Office card account. He explained that he and his elderly friends find it increasingly difficult to sort out their affairs because they can no longer speak to anyone to in order do it. He said that they find all these &#147;touch machines&#148;&#151;his words&#151;for statements of accounts and so on very confusing, and that even parking the car and using ticket machines is worrying. He said how important the post office was to him and his friends because, as the National Federation of SubPostmasters pointed out in its submission, they get advice there on how to do these things.

First, touching on an issue we have already debated, it trumpets the fact that there was no subsidy before 1997. A word in the Secretary of State&#146;s ear: that is the wrong attack. Royal Mail Group is in trouble because the Conservative Government probably took too much money out of it, denying it the investment it needed, because it was making so much money. It did not need subsidy. I strongly advise the Secretary of State not to repeat the line about no subsidy before 1997. If he wants to attack my party, there is a better way of doing it. Subsidy is not a particularly good thing to trumpet anyhow because the Post Office does not want to be subsidised; it wants to be commercially viable again and it has a plan to work towards that. That is really important.</p>

I find bewildering and surprising the idea that ID management in some sense replaces the Post Office card account. I shall vote with pleasure for the Liberal Democrat motion, knowing its origins, and with pleasure against the Government&#146;s amendment because it is so outrageously wrong.</p>

courteous of him to be here, listening to the debate, rather than leaving after making his contribution, and I greatly appreciate that. There is a solution. The contract has been advertised on the basis of the most economically advantageous tender. That is important, because it is not a simple question of cost. Even if one bidder offers a cheaper option than another, the Secretary of State has the right to choose the one that will give the best overall result. As the report states:</p>
<a name="81110-0018.htm_brev3"><a name="08111032000120"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;This allows the Government to take a wide range of criteria into consideration.

<p><a name="stpa_o275"><a name="81110-0018.htm_para8"><a name="08111032000043">I do not understand the reason, but the Department for Work and Pensions and its predecessor have never liked the post office network. Those of us who were Members of Parliament between 1992 and 1997 remember that the Conservative Government played with the same idea and speculated about ending payments through post offices. There was a huge outcry from those of us who then sat on the Government Benches and the Government quickly retreated, realising the error of their ways. Clearly, civil servants in the then Department of Social Security kept the idea in the back of a drawer, brought it out and offered it to a new set of Ministers, who willingly and unthinkingly embraced it. They were wrong to do so. The civil servants in the Department have something against the network.

Post Office card account. Those two issues were at the forefront of my mind. I must tell my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State that there is no way that the majority of hon. Members support any body other than the Post Office delivering POCA 2. I cannot speak strongly enough in favour of POCA 2 coming through the post offices.

The problem is that as more people retire, the older generation that uses POCA is dying off and the new people coming into the system use their bank accounts. They do not go near a post office. We have to find an alternative, so that people will go back into the post offices. We have to find the work and bring it back into the post offices.</p>

POCA 2 now, so that we have another two, three, four or however many years after 2010. However, we cannot rely on that to save the Post Office. That is why we have to come up with alternatives and go through other Departments to see what other work we can bring into the Post Office. That work must be sustainable and long term.</p>

We know that a true community bank operating throughout the country is lacking. That is a system that we could use, by introducing a community bank that would offer all the services to the people who cannot access them unless they go through the internet or are willing to travel to the nearest town. We will replace the banks that have been lost throughout the towns and villages in this country. We now have a great opportunity to do just that. We can sit down, look to the future and find the right formula for introducing a community bank, because that is what is lacking. It is also lacking for businesses. Why should the few remaining milkmen, for example, have to bank their money in the town, when they should be able to bank at the post office? There are many small businesses that could use a Post Office bank, and this proposal is about putting such a bank in place and giving people a real assurance of the future.</p>

It is willing to take taxpayers&#146; money, yet it is not willing to support taxpayers&#146; business through the Post Office. Those are wrongs that we can put right.

That message was: rethink, look again and deliver. Supporting the Liberal Democrats tonight will not save anything; far from it. I have achieved more by saying this tonight from these Benches than they have done. We have already reached agreement on a taskforce and on the advertisement of POCA. We have made great strides tonight, and that is because we are willing to fight for the future of the Post Office.

 It is a pleasure to follow the impassioned plea made by the hon. Member for Chorley (Mr. Hoyle). I enjoyed his speech, as I often do, although I cannot understand his logic, which reflects the Government&#146;s lack of joined-up thinking and their contradictions over this whole issue. It illustrates their inconsistency, accompanied by a real lack of leadership and will. We have seen service after service withdrawn from the post office network over the past few years, and the services that remain&#151;on which the post offices rely absolutely&#151;are not advertised. The hon. Gentleman made that point in his speech.</p>

They also underestimate the exasperation of the people who are running our post offices&#151;the sub-postmasters. My constituency has suffered over the past few years, as has every other area in the country. In 2004, we lost four post offices, and in 2008 we lost another three. None was reprieved, although we have a rather surreal situation at Bramhope in that the Post Office now says it will sit down with the local parish councillors to talk about whether a local consortium might be able to open a post office, even though it has let the closures go ahead. That is another case of an extraordinary lack of consistency and joined-up thinking.</p>

 Is not the question &#147;Where will people go?&#148; particularly relevant to the most rural and isolated communities in the country? As for access to supermarkets and other shops, for many of those communities the last shop has gone as a result of the recent closure programme. People cannot gain access to benefits through shops because they have all gone, and there is no public transport. What is my hon. Friend&#146;s solution?</p>

 I entirely agree, and I pay tribute to what my hon. Friend has done in regard to rural issues in his community. Let me give another example of the lack of joined-up thinking. I think we would all agree that the Sustainable Communities Bill was an excellent idea, but the Government&#146;s action is eroding precisely what it aims to do. Sandra Jarvis also asked:</p>

I refer to older people, disabled people, and people who find it hard to access services: people with learning difficulties and people with mental health issues. Those people were marginalised in the so-called network change programme. The Post Office spin doctors came up with that extraordinary phrase to describe what was, in fact, a closure programme. How very new Labour! Now the same people have been marginalised by the confused process involving the Post Office card account. The issues relating to access have been glossed over again.</p>

that 76 per cent. of older people fear that they will lose essential services if there are more closures, 73 per cent. fear that they will not be able to access similar services in the local area, and 88 per cent. would have to make special travel arrangements to reach alternative services.</p>

He said that one of the wonderful things about the account&#151;let us concentrate on the positives&#151;was that pensioners could go anywhere in the country to pick up their pensions from the post office. That is very useful when he is away on holiday or visiting relatives. He also not only made the point that people feel that through POCA they can access services in post offices they know and trust, but asked where the machines will be sited if the contract goes elsewhere. They will be sited in places that older and vulnerable people do not necessarily know or feel comfortable accessing, and they will probably simply not want to do so. Awarding POCA outside the Post Office will therefore be a blow from a business point of view&#151;apart from the clear absurdity of doing that when it is supposed to be called the Post Office card account, as several Members have pointed out.</p>

 That is true but, equally, what about areas such as Otley, north of the river? It is not necessarily a deprived area, yet the wonderful work done by Otley Action for Older People will be undermined by the recent closure of Newall post office.

 I agree with my hon.

The Secretary of State mentioned the Republic of Ireland. Yes, its Government were taken to court, but the decision was unproven, so they got away with it, if we want to put it like that; I would say that they stuck up for their citizens, which is what our Government should be doing. It is time that we stood up to some of the ludicrous rulings and directives that come from the European Union. Instead of making people feel that the Union is helping them, such measures make them feel that all the Union cares about is a bureaucracy at Brussels that is telling people in this country how to run their lives.

As everyone has said, winning the POCA contract will not be a solution to the many future challenges that the post office network will face.

It was such a vital thing to save that everybody put in a huge amount of work to make sure that that happened.

Those are big figures for small rural constituencies. It has been pointed out that losing the POCA would be a disaster for rural areas. My home village of Llanuwchllyn near Bala&#151;the name will be a challenge for some&#151;has one shop, which is a sub-post office. It will be lost and we will lose the only outlet in our village. There is a social side to this. Some of us have cars, but others do not and they will have to rely on relatively expensive public transport to travel five miles to the nearest town just to get the basics of life. That is unfair and we can reverse that situation. The Post Office needs some breathing space to enable it to do this work&#151;we need this card account to remain where it is. I, for one, cannot understand what possible benefit will ensue if it is sent to a private concern.</p>

We have bandied a lot of figures around this evening, but it is crucial that we maintain and develop this network for the future. We have seen double standards on this issue&#151;Cabinet Ministers are voting for the closure programme but are then protesting vocally in their own constituencies. I will not call that anything stronger than double standards&#151;there are other words, but I would probably be ruled out of order if I used them. If POCA 2 is not awarded to the Post Office, I believe that the situation will get quite near to being hypocritical. I hope that we will not see that act of betrayal towards those hard-working men and women who run the sub-post offices&#151;often for long hours and little return.

The point that I made about the Welsh Language Act 1993 was simply that the Act would cover the public delivery of a public service. If a private concern were to deliver the service, it would not be covered. The tens of thousands of people in Wales who would wish to access services in the medium of Welsh, as they do currently, will undoubtedly be denied. There will be no legitimate expectation that the organisation running POCA 2 should deliver that service. That is extremely important. If the Welsh language is undermined, there will be huge repercussions, not just in this place but in the National Assembly and elsewhere. Acts of Parliament in this place have been made to secure the future of the Welsh Language Act. This move will undermine it, and it is wrong.</p>

 There is a glint of light in this debate, through the smoke and mirrors, from those on the Government Front Bench. They seem to have moved from hostility to uncertainty, and surely that is good as far as the card account is concerned. The right hon. Member for Manchester, Gorton (Sir Gerald Kaufman), with his customary disingenuousness, suggested that the card account had been introduced by Labour along the lines of the national health service&#151;as a miracle cure. May I remind the House that Labour brought the account forward with the greatest reluctance, because it was compelled to do so by the pressure in this House and in the country?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o314"><a name="81110-0019.htm_para16"><a name="08111032000101">As soon as the account was introduced, a series of bullying and inaccurate letters were sent to anyone who dared to apply for one, telling them to do something else. Of course, if that did not work, that letter would be followed up with a telephone call. I know that, because I have the letters and because my wife received the telephone calls. However, there was still massive take-up. Some 4 million took out the card accounts. Even this year&#151;it might have been a clerical error, but it was an extraordinarily consistent clerical error&#151;another letter  <br>

That is equivalent to 50 per cent. of their business rate. If the Secretary of State takes that away from them, he will be putting a 50 per cent. hike on their business rate. They will go down.

During most of that time, banks were the UK&#146;s totemic success story, yet still my constituents did not want to switch. Some could not switch because they did not have the necessary credit rating. Many are unable to switch, because of mobility or disability problems, and for some of the other reasons that have been given already. Now that banks have never been more distrusted or reviled or more in disgrace, along come the Government, telling my constituents, &#147;Leave the safe haven of a simple public sector system based on your local post office and put your trust in a nice big bright shiny bank where you can make a small contribution to a fat cat&#146;s big bonus&#148;.</p>

He wants to cancel his account but the bank will not accept the cancellation because his signature is wrong. What sort of bank will not cancel a card because a signature is wrong? My constituent was told that he could get power of attorney. Brilliant. It is not his mind that has gone, but his handwriting.</p>

 I am grateful for this short opportunity to speak in an important debate on an issue that is so long-running that a positive outcome for the postal service and postal workers seems more distant by the day. The sooner we have a conclusion to this fiasco, the better.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o323"><a name="81110-0019.htm_para25"><a name="08111032000111">The context and backdrop for the debate is the Government&#146;s long overdue decision on the Post Office card account. In 1999, there were 25 post offices in Crewe and Nantwich; we now have 11. A large swathe of the south of Crewe has no post office at all. The town of Nantwich, with a population of 12,000, now has only one post office. We need to remember that backdrop when we look at the future of the Post Office card account.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o324"><a name="81110-0019.htm_para26"><a name="08111032000112">Why have the Government decided that the postal system is so unfit for purpose that they are considering trying to clip its wings even more? They claim support for the Post Office card account in their amendment, yet all the while they are encouraging customers to bank elsewhere. They seem either unwilling or unable to tell us who will run the second phase of the Post Office card account. I suspect that when they had the opportunity to make that decision in May they decided to put it off for other reasons.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o325"><a name="81110-0019.htm_para27"><a name="08111032000113">The card account is only the tip of the iceberg; other services are being stealthily withdrawn from the sub-postmaster&#146;s realm. We have heard about tax discs, and that renewal reminders do not even point out that the service is available at the post office.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o326"><a name="81110-0019.htm_para28"><a name="08111032000114">In my discussions with members of the Communication Workers Union in Crewe, I have been told that confusion still remains about the Government&#146;s policy on the Royal Mail, so this evening provides an opportunity for the Minister to clarify exactly what the Government see as the future role of the Post Office and whether the Post Office card account will be there to safeguard the future of those people. On behalf of my constituents, I therefore urge the Government to take a step back, to halt the post office closure scheme and the sorting office closure schemes, of which Crewe is a victim, and to sit down with the CWU to discuss a manageable and national strategy for the Royal Mail, rather than trying to dismantle it piecemeal. We need to review what services community hubs could offer people, rather than just taking them away, and to renew the Post Office card account to ensure that the Post Office has a safeguarded future. At the moment in Crewe and Nantwich, it really does seem that the Government are only there to take things away.</p>

part that the Post Office card account plays in maintaining their post offices and their footfall. Indeed, even the Secretary of State made that point.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o327"><a name="81110-0020.htm_para0"><a name="08111034000002">My hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, Central (Jenny Willott) made an eloquent case in opening the debate. She was generous in taking interventions, which allowed many hon. Members who were not able to take part in the debate to make a point. She went straight to the heart of the matter: whether the Government should be allowed to kill the Post Office by slow stages or whether the Post Office should be helped to transform into a 21st century service&#151;a point that the Secretary of State failed to address. Indeed, the highlight of his contribution appeared to be to tell us that a purely commercial post office network would consist of only 4,000 post offices. I wonder whether that is actually the DWP&#146;s target. However, I welcome the fact that he has promised us a statement, and I hope that it will be the statement that we would all like to hear. I also hope that he will take away from the debate the strength of feeling in the House.</p>

Member for Chorley (Mr. Hoyle) made the point in a customarily passionate and excellent intervention that we all want the card account. There is no hon. Member on either side of the House who does not want the card account and who does not want it to go to the Post Office. He made the valid, absolutely telling point that that is not because we particularly like the card account, but because our constituents tell us it is what they want and need. He and the hon. Member for Mid-Worcestershire (Peter Luff) have produced an excellent report&#151;succinct and to the point, with very good, albeit not bold, points&#151;that goes to the heart of the matter.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o329"><a name="81110-0020.htm_para2"><a name="08111034000004">I was glad that the hon. Member for Mid-Worcestershire referred in his report to the work done by the Treasury Committee. Indeed, he quoted extensively from it. When I was serving on the Treasury Committee, we went into this in considerable depth. One of the interesting points was a question that I asked of an official on the comparison of cost between the Post Office card account and other services, and the answer was that it is an apples and pears comparison: the two costs are quite different. We should take that point on board.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o330"><a name="81110-0020.htm_para3"><a name="08111034000005">The right hon. Member for Manchester, Gorton (Sir Gerald Kaufman), whom I like to think of as a friend if not a right hon. Friend, was his usual self. He made two charges of me. First, he accused me of sending him reams of Focuses, to which I plead not guilty. I think that he knows me well enough to know that that is not my style. Secondly, he accused me of being an opportunist, and I plead guilty. I take every opportunity I can to support my constituents. I took the opportunity before POCA was announced to ask the Government to change their mind about the evisceration of post offices. I took the opportunity to support POCA when the Government did not want to introduce it, and I take the opportunity now to ask the Government to give us POCA 2.</p>

I will not bore the House with a recitation of the small villages in north-west Sutherland or the middle of Caithness that would have no opportunities if POCA 2 were not given to the Post Office.</p>

They want to provide a 21st century post office that can be profitable. However, they need the breathing space to get from here to there. That is what is absolutely critical about the award of POCA 2. Indeed, sub-postmasters have very good plans to make the post office a post bank&#151;plans that I think many Members present would support.</p>

People now have to travel for three hours, in places where there is no public transport, to attend a face-to-face interview. They have grave difficulties, and I could tell many stories about that. Post offices and sub-post offices are operated by literate, numerate, intelligent people. Why not use them as the front line for the delivery of services to the citizen? Why not give allow them to help fill in forms and explain matters? For a very modest cost to the Department, there would be a massive increase in the quality of service. People would not be forced to spend many hours on the telephone to Clydebank, and would not end up with the wrong answer at the end of it all.</p>

It is that human contact that is missing, but that is so important to many people. Our constituents do not want to spend hours on a telephone, only to be given the wrong answer, or put on to another department when they finally get through.</p>

That is not the case. On the contrary, we are opening 12,500 accounts every month. We have written to customers who are paid by cheque and encouraged them to move to payment into an account, including those that can be used at a post office, for the simple reasons that it is more secure for the customer, it reduces fraud and it is more efficient. We will provide a successor to cheques&#151;a better and safer product that will be easier for people to operate; but, there will be no compulsion on people using cheques, and there are certainly no instructions as the Liberal Democrats have suggested. As my right hon.

 I welcome that comment about the BBC. We all know that the BBC was wrong and that it has got to put the situation right, but is my right hon. Friend aware that we need training to ensure that people who answer the phone get across the message that the Post Office card account is open for business and that the Post Office wants to do business? We may need some extra training to ensure that people understand the message that they give out on the phone.</p>

 My hon. Friend is right to say that training is an important aspect of getting communication right.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o341"><a name="81110-0020.htm_para14"><a name="08111034000023">The hon. Member for Epsom and Ewell (Chris Grayling) asked what more could be done in terms of services provided. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State assured my hon. Friend the Member for Chorley (Mr. Hoyle) that he will set up a task group of MPs to work with the Government to identify new business opportunities for the Post Office, and continue to work with the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o342"><a name="81110-0020.htm_para15"><a name="08111034000024">My right hon. Friend the Member for Manchester, Gorton (Sir Gerald Kaufman), in his usual thoughtful and witty way, set out his support for the Post Office card account and sent out a search party for one of Manchester&#146;s other Members. My right hon. Friend emphasised the account&#146;s public service element, reminded us that a Labour Government established the account in the first place and pointed to the cynical opportunism of the Liberal Democrats.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o343"><a name="81110-0020.htm_para16"><a name="08111034000025">In a speech that reflected the depth of his understanding of the issue, particularly following his Committee&#146;s report, the hon. Member for Mid-Worcestershire (Peter Luff) made intriguing comments about better ways of attacking the Conservative party. Frankly, we have enough to go on at the moment, but we certainly look forward to more advice from the hon. Gentleman in that regard. At least he said that it was necessary to subsidise the Post Office; his party&#146;s Front Benchers refuse to commit to that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o344"><a name="81110-0020.htm_para17"><a name="08111034000026">My hon. Friend the Member for Vauxhall (Kate Hoey) spoke of the work of the all-party group on sub-post offices and the role of sub-postmasters. The hon. Members for Hazel Grove (Andrew Stunell) and for Crewe and Nantwich (Mr. Timpson) spoke of their constituents&#146; concerns about access, and the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy (Mr. Llwyd) talked about the Welsh language.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o345"><a name="81110-0020.htm_para18"><a name="08111034000027">My hon. Friend the Member for Chorley spoke powerfully about the opportunism of the Liberal Democrats. He referred to the task group that the Secretary of State has agreed to set up and thanked the Secretary of State for the assurance that we will do all we can to ensure that we advertise the Post Office card account effectively. I reiterate that assurance.</p>

who on earth does? The only thing that the Liberal Democrats have managed tonight is to make off with the early-day motion tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Chorley, without even asking his permission.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o347"><a name="81110-0020.htm_para20"><a name="08111034000029">The Post Office has been transformed since 1997 and offers far more than it ever did when the Conservatives were in power. As the Government amendment states, the Post Office is the largest provider of foreign exchange and one of the largest providers of travel insurance in the UK. It also provides car insurance, telephone services, driving licence processing and passport application services. The current Post Office card account has played a key role in helping people make the move from having their payments made by order book to using a simple electronic account. About a fifth of Department for Work and Pensions customers use the account. Every week, nearly 4 million people use the Post Office card to collect their pensions, benefits or tax credit in cash at post offices.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o348"><a name="81110-0020.htm_para21"><a name="08111034000030">As the Secretary of State made clear at the start of the debate, we will make an announcement about the Post Office card account at the earliest opportunity. Our objective is clear: to maintain the Post Office&#146;s role while facing up to change. That is the responsible thing to do.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o349"><a name="81110-0020.htm_para22"><a name="08111034000031">I come back to the fundamental point made clear by the Secretary of State. The Post Office is essential as far more than a purely commercial service; it touches the lives of millions across the UK. That is why we have subsidised the Post Office by more than &#163;2 billion since 1997 and why we have announced that we will spend another &#163;1.7 billion until 2011. We have made the investment because the Post Office plays a valuable role in our society. This Labour Government will ensure that the Post Office continues to pay its unique role in British&#151;</p>

 It is a real honour to speak in this Chamber on behalf of my constituents and my local football team, Gloucester City football club. The team has 125 years of history and tradition&#151;roughly the same as Tottenham Hotspur. Earlier this season, much was made of Tottenham being in crisis, before Harry &#147;Houdini&#148; Redknapp turned up and sorted out their problems. I must say that if Tottenham Hotspur think they have problems, they should see what it is like non-league, at the grass roots, where clubs really do have major difficulties to overcome. Gloucester City have had major difficulties to overcome, not least those brought about by the floods of 2007.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o374"><a name="81110-0022.htm_para8"><a name="0811112000587">As I said, the club has 125 years of history. It came into being in March 1883, and one of Gloucestershire&#146;s most famous sons refereed the opening game&#151;a certain W.G. Grace. He was famous for playing cricket, but he refereed that game all those years ago. We have had many ups and downs over the years. In the mid-1980s&#151;1986, to be precise&#151;we moved to Meadow Park, in the Gloucester docks area. In the 1980s we also hosted Wealdstone, who had quite an effective young left back by the name of Stuart Pearce. We do not know what happened to him since, but we went on to have some great seasons in the 1990s. West Ham United fans will recall a player by the name of Leroy Rosenior, who was our player-manager. In 1996-97, we had a particularly good season, with a great cup run. Come the very last game of the season, we were on the edge of promotion. We got the wrong result and unfortunately, Cheltenham Town got the right result for them. They went up.</p>

 I give way to the Cheltenham Town fan.</p>

 I thank my hon. Friend for giving way. As he said, I have to own up to being a season ticket holder and lifelong supporter of the arch-rivals of Gloucester City, Cheltenham Town. I offer my hon. Friend my support, as a Cheltenham supporter. I remember going, long before he was even thought of, to the old Longlevens ground to watch Cheltenham play Gloucester, and then of course to Horton road and, more recently, Meadow Park. The loss of the football ground has deprived Gloucestershire of one of the key highlights of the football season: the annual Cheltenham versus Gloucester game. A new ground would give them a tremendous boost, so that they might rise up the leagues and play us on equal terms again.</p>

 I appreciate the comments of my hon. Friend, who is probably the most famous Cheltenham Town fan in Parliament. He is right: the local rivalry is important, although in recent years the clubs have worked very well together. We have also learned something very important from the fact that Cheltenham have been successful and have got into the Football League. Ours is the largest area in the country that does not have a professional team in the Football League, which just  <br>

goes to show that we have a real opportunity and real possibilities. At the minute, we have a very young and effective team that is doing well, pushing for promotion and full of local lads. We have real cause to be ambitious in terms of what we are doing on the ground.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o375"><a name="81110-0022.htm_para9"><a name="0811112000592">Along came that day in July 2007&#151;22 July. Local people will be well aware of the famous picture of Meadow Park 8 ft under water. All that could be seen was the top of the crossbars. It was impossible for us to return to Meadow Park, and we have not played in Gloucester since&#151;for the last 15 months. That was the third time that the ground had flooded in 21 years, which makes Meadow Park uninsurable, so we cannot go back there. There could be serious rainfall and flooding, and if we wanted to play there again it would cost nearly &#163;100,000 to get back in and repair the damage caused by the last set of floods.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o376"><a name="81110-0022.htm_para10"><a name="0811112000593">We have been beavering away in the southern premier league. Even though we are playing a long way outside Gloucester, we have the largest away support of any team in our division. That shows the devotion of our fans. Last season, we played in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew), at Forest Green. We are very grateful to Forest Green for letting us play there last season, although at a price. This season, we are playing our games in Cirencester, at the home of Cirencester Town. For myself and all other Gloucester City fans, that means a 40-mile round trip to see our local team play a home game, and that is not an acceptable situation for us to be in 15 months after the floods.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o377"><a name="81110-0022.htm_para11"><a name="0811112000594">I pay tribute to those involved in running the club. They have kept it afloat&#151;pardon the pun&#151;and alive despite all the difficulties that they have had to face. In particular, I am thinking of someone whom I am proud to say has become a good friend&#151;we spend a lot of time together of late&#151;the chairman, Dave Phillips; Phil Warren, the club&#146;s historian and the chair of the supporters trust; Mike Dunstan, the club&#146;s press officer; and Tim Harris, the general manager. All of them have made the journey up to London to witness tonight&#146;s debate, and that shows their level of devotion. I also pay tribute to Eamonn McGurk, the club&#146;s biggest shareholder, who has had to bail it out on many occasions. Most importantly, I should mention the volunteers who muck in week in, week out to help to keep our local team ticking over.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o378"><a name="81110-0022.htm_para12"><a name="0811112000595">This debate is a very important occasion for us, and I know that a lot of people in Gloucester will be watching it at home, so it would be remiss of me not to take the opportunity to put a few requests to the Minister. The Football Foundation has been a good friend to my constituency. I play whenever I can; on Thursday nights, I have a kick-about with the reserve team at Abbeymead Rovers. The club has a wonderful new third-generation Astroturf pitch, laid in no small part thanks to the Football Foundation, which has put hundreds of thousands of pounds into that project in Abbeydale. It has also invested a similar sum in a project supporting Quedgeley Wanderers, in the south of my constituency, providing new changing facilities. The Football Foundation is a wonderful organisation that does good work, but I must make it clear that if Gloucester City is to survive as a club, given that it has little resource and has fallen on hard times through no fault of its own&#151;the fault lies with the flooding&#151;we will need the Football Foundation  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="10 Nov 2008">

to step in, support us, probably to the tune of millions of pounds, and help us to find a stadium back in the city.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o379"><a name="81110-0022.htm_para13"><a name="0811112000596">Throughout the flooding, Gloucester City football club was frank in putting its concerns to one side and saying, &#147;This is about people&#146;s lives and about properties.&#148; But 15 months have passed and people&#146;s lives are moving on. We are heading into an economic downturn, but at times like this people rely on their local sporting institutions more than ever. A thriving football club with our catchment area and our young players, back in the heart of the city of Gloucester, could make an economic difference to our city. What can the Minister do to support us? The Football Foundation has been very helpful in the past, so if she can help to engage it with me, with the club and with our local authorities, that will make a difference.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o380"><a name="81110-0022.htm_para14"><a name="0811112000597">I had not planned to talk about specific options tonight, but having spoken to the club, and as the Minister is in her place, I shall briefly mention the two most likely ones for a return, because she could help us on this matter. The first option is to return to Meadow Park. The ground would require a lot of work in order for it to be insurable again. The level of the ground would probably have to be raised, the pitch might even need to be rotated through 180° and new channels might have to be found to release the water. We might even need to take mitigating measures so that other floodplain is available, because we do not want properties to be flooded as a result of raising the pitch level. Thus, an involved, thorough and quick piece of work needs to be done by the Environment Agency. The club has to play this season and the following one at Cirencester Town&#146;s ground, so we need a quick solution to give the fans hope for the future that they deserve. Any help that the Minister can give me in engaging the Environment Agency in a possible return to Meadow Park is one avenue that could be taken. That approach may not be possible, because returning may be far too complicated.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o381"><a name="81110-0022.htm_para15"><a name="0811112000598">There is another good, strong possibility. Last week, I met the leaders of Gloucester city council. A couple of weeks ago, I met the leaders of Gloucestershire county council. This is not about politics. Across political lines, I have heard only good things from the leaders of both councils, who tell me that they are keen to work with the club and to bring it home as quickly as possible. I viewed another site last Friday, which was Blackbridge playing fields&#151;a 20 to 30 acre site in the heart of my constituency, which is owned by Gloucestershire county council.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o382"><a name="81110-0022.htm_para16"><a name="0811112000599">I look forward to engaging with the council on the possibility of bringing Gloucester City home to the Blackbridge site. We would not need the whole site; a small corner of the site could offer the strong possibility of a modest stadium, a clubhouse and some car parking. It would take only a 50 yd road&#151;at most a 100 yd road&#151;from Stroud road, which is one of the busy roads in my constituency, to the ground in a parcel of that land. It stands alongside a strip owned by Network Rail, so I encourage my hon. Friend the Minister to work with me and with local agencies to involve Network Rail in any possible dialogue to speed along any solution for the club at the Blackbridge playing fields.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o383"><a name="81110-0022.htm_para17"><a name="0811112000600">I am encouraged, as I say, by the contact that I have had with Gloucestershire county council and Gloucester city council. I believe that the time could well be right now to work together to bring one of the two solutions  <br>

 I thank my hon. Friend for his recognition that we hosted Gloucester City last year. Does he agree that one problem in a county such as Gloucestershire is that we have historically had very good football, rugby and cricket, but our facilities have not moved on? The rugby club, as he knows better than I do, has had a difficult job in developing a new stadium. We need outside help, because every area is looking to renew and regenerate. It is about time we did that in Gloucestershire.</p>

 I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that, not least because he reminds me that there are far greater implications for the community, too. Gloucester City have 120 people involved in their youth teams. A further 100 are involved in coaching and working with young women, too. To have a modern site, albeit a modest one, in the heart of my constituency would make a real difference to all the local communities.</p>

One activist there&#151;a diehard fan by the name of Nigel Hughes&#151;came up to me. He has recently been widowed; he lost his wife just a few weeks ago. He said, &#147;Parmjit, right now at this time in my life, this football club means more to me than you could ever imagine.&#148; I know that many other people in the city of Gloucester feel the same way. They are equally passionate about our local club. For Nigel Hughes&#146; sake, for Beverley Hughes, for all Gloucester City supporters and for the city of Gloucester, I hope that my hon. Friend can help me to work with the local authorities, the Football Foundation and the local club to bring Gloucester City back home where they belong.</p>

 I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Gloucester (Mr. Dhanda) on securing the debate and I commend him for the passion with which he talks about his football club. A football club is much more than just somewhere to play sport; it is about identity and family, and I am glad that members of a family have been so supportive of my hon. Friend and that he in turn has been so supportive of them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o386"><a name="81110-0022.htm_para20"><a name="0811112000606">I know from my Stevenage constituency what a difference a regenerated football club has made both to the town&#146;s whole ethos and to its economy.

of ill health; it can also improve skills and confidence&#151;something we badly need at present&#151;enhance social networks and strengthen social cohesion. As my hon. Friend has demonstrated, the power of sport goes way beyond the pitch, court or track, and Gloucester City football club is a wonderful example of that power.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o388"><a name="81110-0022.htm_para22"><a name="0811112000608">Only last week in the House, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport spoke about the Government&#146;s key legacy goals for sport, which include creating a world-leading community sports system and getting 1 million more people playing sport. Our goal builds on significant investment in sport over recent years, particularly in facilities. Since 2001, more than &#163;1 billion has been committed to develop new or refurbished facilities through a mix of Exchequer and lottery funding. In total, 4,000 new or refurbished sports facilities are being supported by Government funding programmes. It is clear that the investment is paying off; in the last decade, 65 per cent. of the nation&#146;s facilities stock has been either rebuilt or refurbished.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o389"><a name="81110-0022.htm_para23"><a name="0811112000609">We have also taken steps to protect places where sport is played, specifically playing fields. After years of having our playing fields sold off, we now have tough measures to protect them. Sport England is a statutory consultee on all planning applications affecting playing fields, and planning guidance to local authorities is clear: no playing field needed by the community should be removed. All that work has brought us to a position where currently 90 per cent. of the population of England is within 20 minutes&#146; travel time of at least two different facilities for sports that are most in demand by the public. I realise that for Gloucester City there is a 40-mile round trip, so the distance is further in that case.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o390"><a name="81110-0022.htm_para24"><a name="0811112000610">The Government have provided an unprecedented level of support for sport. However, I stress the fact that local authorities are the main providers of sports and recreation facilities and, as such, are best placed to make decisions about what facilities best meet the needs of the local community. I am glad that my hon. Friend has engaged both the county and the city councils, as I know from my constituency that in the end the solution comes from the council&#151;working with Stevenage borough council we broke through.</p>

<p><a name="st_o428"><a name="0811112000611"><a name="81110-0022.htm_spnew10"><a name="0811112001181"><b>Mr. Dhanda:</b>
 I appreciate what my hon. Friend is saying. She rightly sets out the level of funding for sporting infrastructure. Although she is not the sports Minister, does she feel from her understanding of the situation that it is the sort of project that the Football Foundation should and would want to get behind?</p>

<p><a name="st_o429"><a name="0811112000612"><a name="81110-0022.htm_spnew11"><a name="0811112001182"><b>Barbara Follett:</b>
 That is, of course, a matter for the Football Foundation, but I am sure that, as my hon. Friend has raised the matter tonight in the House, it will take it into account and work with Gloucester city council and the county council, as it has with many other authorities, to ensure that we have the provision in England that we need.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o391"><a name="81110-0023.htm_para0"><a name="0811112000613">The support that the Government give to local authorities comes mainly through Sport England, which has developed a range of strategic planning tools to assist authorities to modernise their leisure facilities and to ensure that the right facilities are provided in the right locations. That is helping local authorities to identify the gaps and to target resources where they are most needed. Sport England&#146;s facilities improvement service is also working  <br>

closely with local authorities to improve their strategic planning for community sport locally. Additionally, the unprecedented Government investment through Building Schools for the Future offers a number of unique opportunities to local authorities. The Government therefore expect local authorities to consider how new developments can build on the current and anticipated sporting needs of local communities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o392"><a name="81110-0023.htm_para1"><a name="0811112000614">Investment in football is very important. Football is our national game and incredibly popular. However, the peak of the game accounts only for a very small amount of those that are involved in football. As my hon. Friend mentioned, children and young boys and girls are really getting involved at a much lower level. Football authorities recognise the wider impact of the game, especially in the lower leagues and at the grass-roots level. Sport England&#146;s active people survey shows that football is as popular an activity in Gloucester as anywhere else in the country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o393"><a name="81110-0023.htm_para2"><a name="0811112000615">Football is one of the sports that have submitted a whole sport plan to Sport England for funding from 2009. That includes how it proposes to invest money in facilities to help to develop the sport. It is right that football receives Government funding, as the sport helps to deliver our sporting aims. That is why the Football Foundation, the premier league, the FA and the Government together have invested more than &#163;300 million in football since 2000. That includes &#163;2 million in community projects in my hon. Friend&#146;s constituency of Gloucester. Those projects have ranged from a &#163;400 grant awarded to Gloucester City girls football club for new kit right up to a &#163;426,000 grant to Abbeydale Community Association towards the development of its facilities. In addition, the Government have, through Sport England, invested more than &#163;59 million in community football since 2005.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o394"><a name="81110-0023.htm_para3"><a name="0811112000616">Turning specifically to Gloucester City football club, I should first like to acknowledge and congratulate the club on its 125-year history and on its incredible resilience. Having been flooded out of its ground three times during its history, it is remarkable that it has reached that milestone. I note that my hon. Friend is sporting the club&#146;s yellow and black tie; it looks like a bee or a wasp, and they are very tenacious insects.</p>
