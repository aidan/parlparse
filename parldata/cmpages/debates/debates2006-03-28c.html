</p>



<p><a name="st_o0"><a name="60328-01_spmin0"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland  (David Cairns): </b> 
 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State and I regularly meet ministerial colleagues and we discuss a range of issues.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o1"><a name="60328-01_spnew0"><b> Mr. Reid: </b> 
 The Government&#039;s plan to abolish the Post Office card account in four years time will, according to Post Office management, lead to the closure of 10,000&nbsp;of the country&#039;s 14,000&nbsp;post offices, which will mean that hardly a rural post office will be left in Scotland. Surely that cannot be allowed to happen. Will the Minister back those Scottish pensioners who have chosen to collect their pension at a post office, and will he urge the Department for Work and Pensions to retain the post office option for pensioners after 2010?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o2"><a name="60328-01_spnew1"><b> David Cairns: </b> 
 I have completely given up hope that when the Liberal Democrats raise the issue of post offices, they might pause for a moment to reflect on the &#163;2&nbsp;billion of investment that this Government have put in to help sustain the post office network. Hundreds of millions of pounds of investment will enable people to access universal banking. The hon. Gentleman knows as well as I do that the commitment on the Post Office card account runs out in 2010; moreover, more than 70&nbsp;per cent. of people who have such accounts also have bank 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>28 Mar 2006 : Column 660</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>accounts. It is this Government&#039;s investment in the Post Office that is giving it a fighting chance, and I fail to see how the hon. Gentleman&#039;s party&#039;s policy of privatising it would help.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o3"><a name="60328-01_spnew2"><b> Mr. Weir: </b> 
 Is the Minister not being a little complacent about the future of the Post Office? Does he not know, for example, that Citibank, which runs the Post Office card account, has transferred such accounts to another provider without even telling those who have them? Does he not feel that the Government&#039;s card account policy, which is undermining the situation prior to 2010&nbsp;and also the future of post offices, is in utter confusion? Will he get the Department for Work and Pensions to look again at this ridiculous decision?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o4"><a name="60328-01_spnew3"><b> David Cairns: </b> 
 As I just said, no decision has been taken on how the situation will work out after 2010. I point out again that it is thanks to this Government putting thousands of millions of pounds into the Post Office&#151;including an additional &#163;300&nbsp;million into sustaining the rural network&#151;that it has any kind of future at all. The hon. Gentleman&#039;s policies would allow the post office network to wither on the vine, but we are not prepared to do that.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o5"><a name="60328-01_spnew4"><b> Mr. Tom Clarke  (Coatbridge, Chryston and Bellshill)</b> 
 (Lab): Does my hon. Friend agree that when the Post Office decides to sell premises&#151;it decided, for example, to sell the post office in Coatbridge town centre to Spar&#151;it would be appropriate for consultations to take place, but not during the Christmas and new year period? Moreover, when applications for drink licences are part of the project, it might be courteous to inform the Member of Parliament concerned and, indeed, the Member of the Scottish Parliament.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o6"><a name="60328-01_spnew5"><b> David Cairns: </b> 
 Obviously, the Post Office&#039;s commercial arrangements for disposing of its assets are primarily a matter for it, but I would of course hope that it could extend to my right hon. Friend&#151;who is well known in this House as a diligent and hard-working MP who represents his constituents&#039; best interests&#151;the courtesy of informing him of such decisions. Of course, he is talking primarily about the Crown post office network, which represents less than 4&nbsp;per cent. of the total network and loses more than &#163;70&nbsp;million a year. The Post Office has some tough commercial decisions to take, but that should not short-circuit the normal planning application process, or the courtesies to which my right hon. Friend refers.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o7"><a name="60328-01_spnew6"><b> David Mundell  (Dumfriesshire, Clydesdale and Tweeddale)</b> 
 (Con): Last week, the Department for Work and Pensions said that the new products and services available from the Post Office from 2010&nbsp;would&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be based on customers actual behaviour and requirements. How will the requirements of customers in Scotland, particularly those in rural areas, be factored into those products and services?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o8"><a name="60328-01_spnew7"><b> David Cairns: </b> 
 This is precisely the point: it is because people&#039;s shopping habits are changing that we have to take these difficult decisions. More and more people are choosing to have their benefits paid directly into bank and building society accounts, which is why we invested 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>28 Mar 2006 : Column 661</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>money to make sure that the Post Office is part of the universal banking network. Had we not done so, it would have had absolutely no chance whatsoever. The hon. Gentleman mentions rural post offices, but he would do well to remember that when his party was in power, 3,500&nbsp;rural post offices closed, so he is in no position to lecture anyone on this issue.

 The Scottish labour market is in its strongest position in decades, with more people in work and fewer unemployed than ever before.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o10"><a name="60328-01_spnew8"><b> Ann McKechin: </b> 
 My right hon. Friend may be aware of the article in Monday&#039;s edition of <i>The Herald</i>, showing that Glasgow&#039;s and Edinburgh&#039;s economic performance outstripped that of every other city in the United Kingdom, with the exception of London. Does he agree that that represents a success for the employment policies of this Government, who are spending much more time and money on ensuring that more people in Scotland enter the employment market?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o11"><a name="60328-01_spnew9"><b> Mr. Darling: </b> 
 I agree with my hon. Friend that it is good that both Edinburgh and Glasgow are doing extremely well in terms of economic performance. It is good to see so many people in work today, whereas a decade ago many were out of work. There is still more to do, particularly in Glasgow, where there are still many people who could, with appropriate help, get back to work. What has happened shows that those who opposed the new deal almost 10&nbsp;years ago were wrong to do so.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o12"><a name="60328-01_spnew10"><b> Mr. Devine: </b> 
 My right hon. Friend will be aware that when the Conservative party was in power, unemployment in my constituency was in excess of 20&nbsp;per cent. When I was working in a health centre, I saw doctors prescribe anti-depressants, but if they could have prescribed a job people would not have needed to come to the health centre. Today&#039;s figures are only a tenth of what they were. Does my right hon. Friend agree that &quot;caring, compassionate conservatism&quot; is a contradiction in terms?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o13"><a name="60328-01_spnew11"><b> Mr. Darling: </b> 
 Anyone who visited West Lothian during the Tory years will have seen exactly what happened to thousands of people who were out of work and left with no prospects whatever. Livingston now has one of the highest employment rates in the country. The constituency is doing well precisely because we have built a strong and stable economy with good job prospects. Scotland is now a place where people want to come and do business.


<br>&nbsp;<br>

<p><a name="st_o14"><a name="60328-01_spnew12"><b> Jo Swinson  (East Dunbartonshire)</b> 
 (LD): I am sure that we all welcome the employment figures overall, but there are still 285,000&nbsp;people in Scotland on incapacity benefit, many of whom would like to find work. Will the Secretary of State explain how the loss of 1,500&nbsp;staff from the Department for Work and Pensions in Scotland over the next two years&#151;on top of the 1,500&nbsp;jobs already axed&#151;will help claimants with the support that they need to find work?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o15"><a name="60328-01_spnew13"><b> Mr. Darling: </b> 
 First, let me welcome the hon. Lady to her new position as the Liberal Democrat shadow Secretary of State for Scotland. The fact that she welcomes the low levels of unemployment is good, but it is a pity that when we introduced the new deal the Liberals opposed it&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i> They were in favour of the concept, but against providing the money to pay for it.

</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-01_para0">
<a name="stpa_o0">As for the hon. Lady&#039;s question about the DWP and Jobcentre Plus, at one point the DWP employed more than 100,000&nbsp;people. However, unlike many banks and insurance companies, which have automated their payment procedures and changed the way they work, the DWP has not done so. What is happening in the DWP and Jobcentre Plus now is the result of having to take account of new IT systems and different ways of working, which will help to provide a better service. If the hon. Lady has visited one of the new Jobcentre Plus offices, she would know that they are a world apart from what they used to be 10&nbsp;or 15&nbsp;years ago. They provide effective help, so that people who lose their jobs can have the support that they need to get them back into work as quickly as possible. I suspect that none of the difficult decisions would have been taken by the Liberal Democrats.

 (Lab): Is my right hon. Friend aware that Scottish Coal, which operates surface mines in my constituency and elsewhere in Scotland, is currently consulting on making up to 150&nbsp;redundancies, largely as a result of consecutive rises in gasoil duty? The straw that broke the camel&#039;s back was last week&#039;s Budget announcement. Will my right hon. Friend meet me urgently to discuss the problem and will he ask the Chancellor to examine the practical implications of his policy in that regard?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o17"><a name="60328-01_spnew15"><b> Mr. Darling: </b> 
 I am aware of the Scottish Coal announcement that was made last week. I or my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary will be happy to meet my hon. Friend to discuss the matter.

 (SNP): What does it tell us about employment prospects in the fishing industry when Banff and Buchan colleges have been forced through financial pressure to discontinue all training courses relating to that industry? Does the Secretary of State realise that this is the only such training provision on the mainland of Scotland, which educates through mates and skippers tickets the vast majority of people across the UK? How does that square with what the Chancellor said last Wednesday about a rosy future for further education colleges? Does the right hon. Gentleman agree that those courses represent training in a strategic industry and should be protected for the future of employment in that industry?


<br>&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br></p>








<p><a name="st_o19"><a name="60328-01_spnew17"><b> Mr. Darling: </b> 
 As the hon. Gentleman will know, the funding of further education colleges in Scotland is a matter for the Scottish Executive. Because we are increasing the amount of money spent on education more generally, Scotland has benefited, but what courses are appropriate is a matter for the Scottish Executive and further education colleges.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o20"><a name="60328-01_spnew18"><b> Mr. John MacDougall  (Glenrothes)</b> 
 (Lab): Does my right hon. Friend agree that it is no coincidence that one of the longest periods of stability in the economy in our history has resulted in the remarkable reduction of unemployment that we have seen since 1997?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o21"><a name="60328-01_spnew19"><b> Mr. Darling: </b> 
 That is right. One of the main reasons for such high unemployment in the 1980s and 1990s was the fact that, under the previous Conservative Government, we saw two of the deepest recessions of the last century. Many individuals and their families suffered in consequence. Now that we have a strong economy, we have had growth in each consecutive quarter since we came to power&#151;and we have had very low levels of unemployment, with record numbers of people going into work. We have also been able, crucially, to increase the amount of money given to families, particularly those with children, in order to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;help them do well for themselves and to adapt to changing labour market conditions.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o22"><a name="60328-01_spnew20"><b> David Mundell  (Dumfriesshire, Clydesdale and Tweeddale)</b> 
 (Con): Is it not complacent of the Secretary of State to base his view of Scotland&#039;s economy on only one set of employment figures? Is he not aware of the growing concern among the business community and economists in Scotland that recent growth was due to expansion of the public not the private sector&#151;an unsustainable trend in the long run?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o23"><a name="60328-01_spnew21"><b> Mr. Darling: </b> 
 No, I think the hon. Gentleman is wrong on all three counts. First, I did not base what I said on one recent set of employment statistics. If he looks at the employment statistics issued over the past few months and the past few years, he will see that unemployment is at an historically low level and that employment is at an historically high level.

</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-01_para1">
<a name="stpa_o1">The size of the public sector in Scotland has not changed much over the past few years but, yes, there are more doctors, more nurses, more teachers and more police. We are in favour of that, but the Conservatives are pledged to reduce public expenditure, which inevitably would result in less resources being available for it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-01_para2">
<a name="stpa_o2">The hon. Gentleman referred to surveys. The last few business surveys have actually been extremely optimistic about Scotland&#039;s prospects. Indeed, Scotland, like the rest of the United Kingdom, continues to be a very good place to do business, which is why so many people are in work. If the hon. Gentleman wants to make comparisons, why does not he cast his mind back to 10&nbsp;or 20&nbsp;years ago when the position was completely different?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o24"><a name="60328-01_spnew22"><b> David Mundell: </b> 
 I know that the right hon. Gentleman, like his right hon. Friend the Chancellor, prefers to talk about the past rather than the present and the future, but he cannot dispute the fact that 51&nbsp;per cent. of Scotland&#039;s gross domestic product is in the public sector, 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>28 Mar 2006 : Column 664</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>compared with 40&nbsp;per cent. in the UK as a whole. Does he think that the proportion in Scotland is too high, too low or just about right?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o25"><a name="60328-01_spnew23"><b> Mr. Darling: </b> 
 I refer the hon. Gentleman to what I said a few moments ago. The size of the public sector has not changed that much, but I make no apology for the fact that we are employing more teachers, more doctors and more nurses. I would have thought that most people in Scotland would think that that is a good thing. At the same time, despite what the hon. Gentleman says, employment prospects in Scotland are good&#151;as is the number of people in work&#151;but we are not complacent, as there will be changes and constant challenges from different parts of the world.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-01_para3">
<a name="stpa_o3">I am happy to talk not just about the present but the future too, because as long as we maintain our present policies and maintain stability&#151;taking the right decisions about public expenditure, instead of being locked into a wholly dogmatic rule that there must be public expenditure cuts regardless of what is required&#151;and stick to the course we have set, the prospects for Scotland and the United Kingdom are good. If the hon. Gentleman and his colleagues were to get into power, many of the things to which people are becoming accustomed would be lost.

 (Lab): Does my right hon. Friend agree that the latest figures are far from a one-off? In my constituency, there has been an increase of more than 25&nbsp;per cent. in employment since 1997, although the constituency has still not fully recovered from 18&nbsp;years of Tory rule, when industry after industry was closed. Will my right hon. Friend join me in welcoming the recent initiative to create an Irvine bay regeneration company to bring investment to my area and create jobs, because our goal of full employment is vital in ensuring that we spread prosperity throughout the whole community?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o27"><a name="60328-01_spnew25"><b> Mr. Darling: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is right. She is right, too, to stress the importance of regeneration, not just in her constituency but in certain other parts of Scotland. Most of us can remember what Ayrshire was like 10&nbsp;or 15&nbsp;years ago, when thousands of people were not only out of work, but had no prospect of ever getting any work. A second generation of people was growing up with no prospect of getting work. The position is different now, but we cannot be complacent&#151;we must constantly be aware of the fact that there are still people we need to help to get into work, but the strong economy and background created by my right hon. Friend the Chancellor has benefited my hon. Friend&#039;s constituency as well as every other constituency in Scotland.

 I thank the Minister for that answer, but is not it the case that phasing out the rural subsidy and ending the Post Office card account&#151;a betrayal if ever there was one&#151;will leave pretty well every post office in rural Scotland non-viable?

 It is interesting that the hon. Gentleman used one &quot;p&quot; word, plan, but did not use another, privatisation.

With measures such as the minimum wage, the working tax credit and the child tax credit, we are making work pay for those families. Spending per head in Glasgow is higher than in any other part of Scotland, which is quite right because of the deprivation and poverty that still exist there. An enormous amount of progress has been made. We are making tremendous inroads into reducing poverty, with a view to eradicating it altogether, but all of that would be put at

 Has the Secretary of State seen the recent Royal Bank of Scotland report that indicates that private sector employment in Scotland has risen in each of the past 12&nbsp;months? Given that situation, will he take up the challenge that the Chancellor set out in his Budget last week so that we plan for long-term challenges, ensure that the globalisation agenda, with the increasing drive from China and India, is taken on in Scotland, and ensure that Scotland&#039;s private sector is indeed the engine of growth for the country?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o41"><a name="60328-02_spnew9"><b> Mr. Darling: </b> 
 I did see that recent report. It was encouraging that the bank said that Scottish manufacturing appeared to be in better shape than that in many other parts of the country. My right hon.

 The single most important thing is to ensure that we have a stable economy with low interest rates so that firms coming into Scotland can plan ahead for the future. The hon.

They generally help firms and encourage them to come and invest, and that policy has been hugely successful. As I said a moment ago, we must be mindful of the fact that there are challenges from all over the world, but I am confident that Scotland will continue to do well, and many recent surveys recognise that.

<p><a name="st_o44"><a name="60328-03_spmin0"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland  (David Cairns): </b> 
 I refer my hon. Friend to the answer that I gave a few moments ago to my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Central (Mr. Sarwar).
</p>








<p><a name="st_o45"><a name="60328-03_spnew0"><b> Miss Begg: </b> 
 While it was slightly disappointing that the Government did not hit their target on reducing child poverty, that was partly because the target was very ambitious, and it does not detract from the fact that a large number of children in Scotland have been taken out of poverty. In the next stage, the Government will obviously have to work with the Scottish Executive. There were welcome measures in the Budget, especially regarding the child trust fund, and money was also made available to the Scottish Executive for education. Will my hon. Friend discuss with the Scottish Executive how we can ensure that that money is targeted on helping to lift more of Scotland&#039;s children out of poverty.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o46"><a name="60328-03_spnew1"><b> David Cairns: </b> 
 May I just correct my hon. Friend on one point? Although it is true that the Government just failed to meet their target on the reduction of poverty throughout the UK, we actually exceeded the target in Scotland&#151;we met and went beyond it. Of course, that was due to the excellent close partnership that exists between the Government and the Scottish Executive. The measures that we are putting in here, such as the child tax credit, the working tax credit and a 26&nbsp;per cent. increase in child benefit, together with the measures that the Scottish Executive have put in place have, as a package, meant that we have made great progress on reducing poverty. That shows that the partnership works, and that Opposition parties that want to break that partnership&#151;or mess about with it, as the Liberal Democrats want to do&#151;are playing with fire.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o47"><a name="60328-03_spnew2"><b> Danny Alexander  (Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey)</b> 
 (LD): Is not the fact that many of the lowest income families face benefit withdrawal rates of 70, 80, or even 90&nbsp;per cent. one of the major reasons why many children still find themselves living in poverty? Is not tackling that problem, which means that many people are paying effectively higher rates of tax than the top rate of tax, vital for improving incentives to work and thus helping more children out of poverty?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o48"><a name="60328-03_spnew3"><b> David Cairns: </b> 
 If that were the case, there would have been no reduction in child poverty, but instead there has been a 34&nbsp;per cent. reduction, which is way ahead of target. That proves that the hon. Gentleman&#039;s analysis is wrong and that the child tax credit is helping the poorest families and those on average incomes. The child tax credit, together with all the other measures that we have put in place&#151;the working tax credit and big increases in child benefit&#151;is the reason why we are seeing remarkable and dramatic reductions to poverty in Scotland, so I simply cannot agree with the hon. Gentleman.

 I believe that people will support the idea that people have to identify themselves, especially for the purposes of social security payments and in relation to employment and nationality and immigration matters. The whole point of the legislation is to enable us to set up a database. Hon. Members should remember that most people are required to prove their identity now, not just to open bank accounts, but to get passports and so on. It makes sense to put that on a proper basis. When the surveys are carried out, some people are surprised to learn that most people in Scotland do not think that there is anything wrong in principle with having to say who they are when accessing a public service.

 I entirely agree with my hon.

Obviously, we want 100&nbsp;per cent. take-up of the pension credit. I hope that every Member of Parliament will lead the campaign, as I know he is doing in his constituency, to ensure that every pensioner claims what they are entitled to, because it can make a very big difference to their lives.

 The Government share my hon. Friend&#039;s concerns about solicitors double-charging successful claimants. I had a useful meeting with the chairs of the Law Society&#039;s regulation board and consumer complaints board on Thursday 23&nbsp;March&#151;last Thursday&#151;to discuss the matter. The Law Society assured me that it views the matter very seriously and is doing all it can to take disciplinary action and to process claims for redress. I assure my hon.

 Claimants, backed by their MPs, are working with the Law Society to take up individual cases of redress. Rather than pursuing cases individually, will the Minister pursue the Law Society to take a more comprehensive approach so that we can learn lessons, so that firms can be audited and so that all claimants, rather than just individuals, can be compensated?

<p><a name="st_o88"><a name="60328-04_spnew17"><b> Bridget Prentice: </b> 
 My hon. Friend has made a good point. The Law Society has assured me that it, too, takes the matter very seriously. It is planning an advertising campaign using local media to alert those consumers who are entitled to the repayment of fees by their solicitors. I have discussed the issue of taking a more generic approach with the Law Society, which is examining the matter. I can also tell my hon. Friend that the Law Society has already referred 45&nbsp;solicitors to the tribunal, although no cases have yet been heard.

<p><a name="st_o90"><a name="60328-05_spnew0"><b> Kerry McCarthy: </b> 
 In my constituency, there is woeful under-provision of expert legal advice, particularly for asylum seekers and people who are going through the immigration service, which means that many people are actually pursuing hopeless claims or have been left without any legal advice. I am concerned that the acting chief executive of the LSC seems to think that that need can be met by the Community Legal Service Direct, and I wonder whether the Minister agrees with his take on the matter.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o91"><a name="60328-05_spnew1"><b> Ms Harman: </b> 
 CLS Direct, which allows people to phone up and get early legal advice, is an important service that is doing an important job, and it is going to expand. However, I agree with my hon. Friend that there is a problem, which particularly applies to poorer people in socially excluded areas, with getting access to family and civil legal aid. The truth of the matter is that we have greatly increased the legal aid budget since we entered government in 1997. Despite the fact that there have been fewer criminal cases in the courts, most of the increase&#151;in fact, nearly all of it&#151;has gone on criminal legal aid, and civil and family legal aid has experienced a cut of &#163;200&nbsp;million, or about 24&nbsp;per cent. I hope that all hon.

 With permission, Mr Deputy Speaker, I would like to make a statement about the outcome of the review that I announced on 12&nbsp;December 2005&nbsp;of the Government&#039;s ex gratia payment scheme for former far east prisoners of war and civilian internees.

</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-06_para0">
<a name="stpa_0">The review has been thorough. It has been an immense undertaking, requiring a check of nearly 30,000&nbsp;claim and policy files to determine whether consistent eligibility criteria had been used for civilian internees over the life of the scheme. The review has confirmed that the eligibility rules, based on the 1950s Japanese asset scheme, were the basis for making payments between the introduction of the scheme on 7&nbsp;November 2000&nbsp;and March 2001.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-06_para1">
<a name="stpa_1">The civilian eligibility criteria under the 1950s scheme were based on normal residence in the United Kingdom at the time of internment. We now know that that was not consistent with the birth-link criterion introduced from March 2001. The birth-link criterion was introduced to expand eligibility, not restrict it. Consequently, the number of former civilian internees who qualified increased by 40&nbsp;per cent. However, some 245&nbsp;claimants who were paid under the Japanese asset scheme criteria cannot, on the evidence available, be shown to meet the birth-link criterion.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-06_para2">
<a name="stpa_2">Furthermore, some 13&nbsp;claimants who would have met the Japanese asset scheme criteria were denied payments because they failed to meet the birth-link criterion. Fewer than 20&nbsp;claimants were paid in error around the time of the introduction of the birth-link criterion, apparently on the basis that they were recorded as British on contemporary camp lists.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-06_para3">
<a name="stpa_3">I have considered a wide range of options for how we should proceed in the light of those inconsistencies. I have listened to the views of the Association of British Civilian Internees of the Far East Region. I have met the chair of the all-party group on far east prisoners of war and internees, my hon. Friend the Member for Hendon (Mr. Dismore), and other colleagues.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-06_para4">
<a name="stpa_4">I have also looked again at the principle that to qualify, claimants should have a close link to the United Kingdom. That principle has underpinned the scheme from the start, and the fact that decisions were originally based on a 1950s scheme whose criteria included normal residence in the United Kingdom before internment is consistent with that. I have considered very carefully whether this is still a reasonable basis for the Government&#039;s definition of those to whom the country owed a debt. I have concluded that it is&#151;a view that was supported by the courts.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-06_para5">
<a name="stpa_5">I understand the argument put forward by many that all those who were British subjects at the time&#151;and interned on that basis&#151;should qualify for a payment. However, anyone born in a British colony was a British subject, and many of those people are now the citizens of a country that was given independence, and have never had a close link to the United Kingdom. I have therefore concluded that the right course of action is for 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>28 Mar 2006 : Column 682</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>there to be a further widening of the scheme to include those who have made some clear commitment or contribution to the United Kingdom.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-06_para6">
<a name="stpa_6">On that basis, I have decided to make certain changes to the criteria for civilian internees. First, I am clear that we must include those who were rejected under the birth-link criterion but who would have met the Japanese asset scheme criteria, whether or not they had a Japanese asset scheme record. It would be unfair and improper if, as a matter of policy, claimants who were identical in all significant respects should have succeeded before March 2001&nbsp;but failed thereafter. These rules will also apply to new claimants.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-06_para7">
<a name="stpa_7">Secondly, I have decided to introduce a new provision to include those who have resided in the United Kingdom for at least 20&nbsp;years since world war two, until November 2000, when the scheme was introduced. I have had discussions with the all-party group and with ABCIFER, and I have listened to their views. Indeed, I pay tribute to my hon. Friend the Member for Hendon and his colleagues, and to Ron Bridge of ABCIFER, whose comments and advice have been extremely helpful as we have all sought to resolve the matter before us. I have chosen the figure of 20&nbsp;years as a reasonable measure of an individual&#039;s commitment to the United Kingdom, meaning that they are likely to have spent at least part of their working life here. This is consistent with the original principle that British civilians should have a close link with the United Kingdom in order to qualify.

<a name="stpa_8">Eligibility will go to anyone who was alive on 7&nbsp;November 2000, when the scheme was introduced, or to their spouse or estate if they have since died. It will also extend to members of the armed forces of our former colonies, including the Indian army, who similarly meet this residence requirement and were held as prisoners of war. We have previously had reservations about a residence criterion because of the difficulty of providing supporting evidence. However, the 1950s scheme was residence based, and we expect the numbers now to be much smaller, both of which considerations suggest that the task before us should be manageable.

<a name="stpa_9">We also need to resolve details of how the 20-year rule should be applied. We will publish details of the qualifying criteria as soon as they are agreed, and I would ask potential claimants not to apply until then, so that when they do so they can provide the evidence required to process their applications. To that end, I can announce that ABCIFER and the chair of the all-party group on far east prisoners of war have accepted my invitation to join me in a working group to consider how we should take forward these points and resolve them. We assess that the change could admit some 500&nbsp;new claimants, although the figures cannot be estimated with certainty.

 First, I thank the Minister for advance notice of his statement. I welcome the widening of the scheme announced today and his further apology to the House&#151;the fourth that he has had to make. I also welcome his promise that he will deal as a matter of urgency with those who have not received the payment that they should have done. I am afraid that that is as far as my welcome can extend. Following such a thorough and lengthy review&#151;nearly four months in the making&#151;the House could reasonably have expected a comprehensive statement resolving all the outstanding issues and bringing matters to an honourable conclusion. That is not what we have.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-07_para0">
<a name="stpa_13">I have some questions on the statement. For the avoidance of all doubt, can the Minister confirm that the first change to the criteria means that the 13&nbsp;claimants to whom he referred, who would have met the Japanese asset scheme criteria, but were denied payments because they failed to meet the birth-link criterion, will now be paid the &#163;10,000? Can he confirm when they can expect to receive payment? In answer to a written question that I tabled, the Minister confirmed last week that 162&nbsp;cases were awaiting decision. I would be grateful if he would update the House on when he expects those cases to be decided.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-07_para1">
<a name="stpa_14">Given that problems have arisen with the scheme&#151;which, I acknowledge, was welcomed on both sides of the House&#151;because, as the Minister acknowledged, the Ministry of Defence did too much in haste and was not clear about the details, I am concerned about the way in which he made the announcement about the 20-year rule. He has admitted that the details of how the rule should be applied have not yet been resolved and that the number of new claimants cannot be estimated with certainty. There is a danger that he will have raised expectations again, only to see them dashed when the details are resolved. Given the history of this scheme, does he agree that it would have been better to conclude the work on the details prior to today&#039;s statement? I welcome the inclusion of ABCIFER and the chairman of the all-party group in the working group to resolve

In answer to a written question, he confirmed to me that he will make a statement to the House as soon as possible after that. Will he also confirm that he expects that to be an oral statement, enabling Members of the House to raise the questions that they will no doubt have?

Yes, a number of claims are yet to be decided&#151;he mentioned the answer that I gave him about the 162&nbsp;cases.

<a name="stpa_19">Yes, the scheme was introduced in haste. Everyone, on all sides, felt that it was time for us to show our appreciation and sense of value, given the horrible suffering undergone by some of the people concerned. It was felt that that should be recognised properly. We tried to do it rather quickly and&#151;as my statement made clear, and as will doubtless be made clear in the report that I will present to the House later this year&#151;we did not get it right, perhaps because of the speed with which we were acting.

<a name="stpa_20">I cannot give a view on the details of the 20-year rule at this stage. The delay does not mean that I do not have views, or that work has not been done. I have been hugely impressed by the advice and information given to me by ABCIFER and by my hon. Friend the Member for Hendon. For that reason, I want to involve them in the working group so that we can get the criterion right. I do not want to come back and say, or hear my successor say, &quot;Sorry, we got it wrong again.&quot; I want to take account of the important contribution made by ABCIFER and by my hon. Friend, and to do a bit of work on that criterion. I hope that the first meeting of our working group will take place immediately after the recess, and that a week or so later we will announce the details of the criterion that will apply to the 20-year rule.

I welcomed the scheme originally introduced by the Government, which put right wrongs that have lasted half a century or so, and I welcome the good news that 500&nbsp;people will now share in the result of the Minister&#039;s statement. Will he confirm, however, that there are still some 4,000&nbsp;other people who were interned by the imperial Japanese army on the basis that it believed them to be British and they believed themselves to be British? If that is so, and if contemporary camp lists exist&#151;presumably the imperial Japanese army inquired about people&#039;s nationalities and beliefs&#151;does that not constitute sufficient grounds?

<a name="stpa_24">There is clearly an issue. As I have said, people feel that because they were interned as British by the Japanese, they should be paid under the scheme regardless of whether they have any link with this country in the sense of ever having lived here. We do not share that view; we take the view that there should be a close link with the United Kingdom.

His approach is very welcome compared with the stonewalling that we had from the Ministry of Defence for far too long on this issue. He has come up with a workable solution that will, as far as I can see, deal with all the outstanding claims that we can identify relating to people who live in the UK.

 Is the Minister aware that more than 2,500&nbsp;Royal Norfolks were captured by the Japanese when the Singapore garrison surrendered? All those prisoners of war suffered appalling brutality, and many died on the River Kwai rail project. There are very few survivors left, but many impoverished widows. Of course I welcome today&#039;s statement, but does the Minister agree that it is a disgrace that the Japanese Government have not given more money to the survivors&#151;more than about &#163;100&nbsp;or so per prisoner&#151;and that surely the second richest country in the world should be doing more to help those survivors and the impoverished widows who are still left?

 The Government, and previous Governments, have made quite clear this country&#039;s views about the Japanese Government&#039;s attitude in the past to apologies and compensation. I cannot add much more to what the hon. Gentleman says; I am sure that it is a view shared by hon. Members on both sides of the House. However, the Japanese Prime Minister has made an apology. People may well feel that that should be expressed more tangibly, but although I accept the points that the hon.

 I welcome the Minister&#039;s statement, and I commend the work of ABCIFER and the cross-party pressure applied by a number of Members, particularly as it affects Diana Elias, a constituent of mine. Nevertheless, is not the delay that has led to this situation a travesty? To get to this point, the Government have had to be dragged through the courts and have had to deal with both the parliamentary ombudsman&#039;s complaints and the Public Administration Committee. Will the Minister confirm that he will fully adopt the ombudsman&#039;s recommendations? Will he recognise the fact that for constituents such as Diana Elias, the fight not to be treated as a second-class citizen&#151;as someone who is &quot;not quite British enough&quot;&#151;has taken not five years but 60&nbsp;years to win? In that time, Mrs. Elias&#039;s sister and cousin have died, and her brother-in-law has recently been diagnosed with cancer and has only a few months to live.

 I do acknowledge the pain and suffering that Mrs. Elias, her family and others have gone through throughout this process. As I said at the beginning of my statement, there were problems with the criteria that we introduced, which were not consistent. Until I appeared before the Public Administration Committee, of which the hon. Gentleman is a member, we believed that they were consistent, and it is the inconsistency that led to some of the difficulties. I fully understand the views that he expresses, and I can only say that I sincerely apologise to Mrs. Elias and others for the grief and worry that has been caused by the manner of the scheme&#039;s operation. I am seeking to put that right today to the best of my ability, with, I hope, the support of the whole House.

His complaint, reflecting those of others, was not that he wanted the money, which he did not. Rather, he was incensed by being told, in effect, that he was not British enough, despite a lifetime of distinguished service to this country. Has the Minister not said today that Professor Haywood and the ombudsman are right? If so, that is the right outcome.

My understanding is that under today&#039;s proposals, Professor Haywood will qualify. I might disagree with some of the points made by the ombudsman, but it would be churlish and wrong of me not to pay tribute to the work done by the ombudsman on Parliament&#039;s behalf, and to the work of the Public Administration Committee, chaired by my hon.

 Slave labour, or those interned as a result of conflict. We take the view, as does the House, that those who had to endure Japanese prisoner of war camps had an exceptionally horrible existence. That is exemplified by the fact that 25&nbsp;per cent. of prisoners of war in the far east died in captivity, as opposed to about 5&nbsp;per cent. in Europe. That shows why we feel that it is important to do something to recognise the suffering that so many of our fellow citizens had to endure. I hope that the House will welcome what I am doing, and I look forward to working with ABCIFER and the all-party group and updating the House with further statements at the appropriate time.

 On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. Will you provide some guidance on parliamentary inquiries into what is commonly called the loans or cash for peerages scandal, particularly when Scotland Yard detectives have asked for such inquiries to be delayed, lest they adversely affect police investigations or even a possible criminal trial?

</p>








<p><a name="st_25"><a name="60328-09_spmin0"><b>Mr. Deputy Speaker  (Sir Alan Haselhurst): </b> 
 I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving me notice that he intended to raise that matter. As I understand it, no charges have yet been brought, so the normal sub judice rule would not apply. It is therefore for Committees of the House to take their own decisions about the conduct of their business. I understand that the Select Committee on Public Administration has decided to delay its inquiry, which is entirely a matter for a Committee of the House in these circumstances. I hope that that helps the hon. Gentleman.

 Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker. I thought I had given you notice of my intention to raise a point of order in respect of an answer given yesterday by the Minister for Local Government. That Minister said that he did not accept the premise that the Government have a policy on what the council tax should be or on whether the council tax should be allowed to increase beyond the rate of inflation. I wish to clarify for the House the fact that the Government have had a policy on the council tax, which is called CTSS, council tax for standard spending, and ANCT, assumed national council tax. It is also important to note, for clarification, that the council tax has gone up beyond the rate of inflation.
</p>








<p><a name="st_31"><a name="60328-09_spmin3"><b>Mr. Deputy Speaker:</b> 
 I have to tell the hon. Gentleman that I received no notice that he intended to raise that point of order. I am afraid that his point does not fulfil the criteria for a proper point of order, but he has had his opportunity to put his remarks before the House.

<p><a name="st_32"><a name="60328-09_spnew9"><b> Mr. Stephen Crabb  (Preseli Pembrokeshire) (Con):</b> 
 I beg to move,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1">That leave be given to bring in a Bill to require the Secretary of State, when reporting on departmental expenditure, to publish an independent evaluation and measurement of the effectiveness of United Kingdom bilateral aid projects in reducing poverty and a comparison of the effectiveness of different projects and forms of aid in reducing poverty; to require the Secretary of State to redirect resources towards the most effective projects and forms of aid; and for connected purposes.</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-09_para0">
<a name="stpa_29">Throughout the past year I have been struck time and again by the commitment of people from all walks of life to the campaign to make poverty history. It captured public imagination and galvanised support across social boundaries and partisan divisions in a way that few other grassroots campaigns have managed to achieve in recent years. Many people still wear their &quot;Make Poverty History&quot; wristbands, not just from forgetfulness or as a fashion item, but from a lasting desire to see the overarching goal of the campaign realised&#151;that the grinding poverty and misery that so many people on the&nbsp;planet face daily should be consigned to the dustbin of history.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-09_para1">
<a name="stpa_30">Aid is only one part of a complex set of issues that can make a difference to the developing world, but more aid, delivered more effectively, has a key role to play in ending global poverty. However, as 2005&nbsp;grew to a close I sensed some disillusion in the &quot;Make Poverty History&quot; campaign, as domestic concerns about terrorism and security diverted attention from it, and the disappointing outcome of the Hong Kong trade summit seemed to lead to a dissipation of the excitement and energy of some of the activists.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-09_para2">
<a name="stpa_31">The best way to restore enthusiasm to all the people who campaigned, marched and wrote letters to us all is for the Government to demonstrate real follow-through on the rhetoric and to show tangible progress on meeting the eight millennium development goals that form the bedrock of our international development strategy. To that end, much better linkage must be shown between high-level development rhetoric, the nature of our international aid and interventions and the outcomes achieved on the ground in terms of poverty reduction, lives saved, children educated and all the other relevant indicators that the public understand and seek.

</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-09_para3">
<a name="stpa_32">My Bill aims to strengthen that linkage. I pay tribute to the work of the right hon. Member for Coatbridge, Chryston and Bellshill (Mr. Clarke), whose International Development (Reporting and Transparency) Bill has stimulated much discussion about how we can lock Department for International Development Ministers into a clear framework of accountability. His Bill represents an extremely useful and substantial step forward, especially as it places Parliament at the centre of the accountability process. I congratulate the right hon. Gentleman on both the Bill and the skilful way in which he is piloting it through this place. I am extremely impressed by the degree of cross-party consensus it has achieved.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-09_para4">
<a name="stpa_33">My Bill would provide a useful complement to that of the right hon. Gentleman. At its heart is a requirement that the Secretary of State regularly publish an 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>28 Mar 2006 : Column 693</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>independent evaluation of UK aid projects. In recent years, calls have been made repeatedly for greater evaluation, and more independent evaluation, of DFID activities. The sixth report of the International Development Committee in the last Parliament urged DFID to ensure the independence of evaluation by, first, increasing the proportion of evaluations conducted by external evaluators and, secondly, ensuring that the results of all its evaluations were made publicly available. Above all, it said that careful thought must be given to the ways in which the monitoring of DFID&#039;s progress against the millennium development goals can be more closely integrated with the monitoring of the Department&#039;s individual programmes and projects.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-09_para5">
<a name="stpa_34">A year after the Select Committee report, the Department published an internal document entitled &quot;How Effective Is DFID?&quot;, which observed:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_2">&quot;Compared with some other agencies, DFID spends a much lower proportion of its budget on independent evaluation, and evaluates a much lower proportion of its activities.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-09_para6">
<a name="stpa_35">My Bill would help to close the gap in independent evaluation and meet some of the criticisms that have been raised.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-09_para7">
<a name="stpa_36">Let us be clear: we are not talking about the mere reporting of data and the repackaging of departmental data. That would not be good enough; it would be no substitute for a systematic and independent assessment of effectiveness. As the DFID effectiveness report demonstrated, a large volume of performance information may already be available, but there is


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3">&quot;generally insufficient information on the links between DFID&#039;s inputs and interventions on the one hand, and the positive outcomes observed on the other&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-09_para8">
<a name="stpa_37">Higher priority must be given to performance assessment and evaluation so that DFID can better understand its own organisational effectiveness and its contribution to successful international development.

</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-09_para9">
<a name="stpa_38">The Bill would certainly make sure that such evaluation received higher priority by making it a statutory requirement. Again, I emphasise the importance of independent evaluation. To quote again from the DFID effectiveness document: the Department


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_4">&quot;needs to be more confident about independent verification and assessment by its partners and others, and to increase the resources allocated to evaluation&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-09_para10">
<a name="stpa_39">My Bill also requires the Secretary of State to publish a comparison of the different types of aid project and the different forms of aid that we support. DFID spends about &#163;4&nbsp;billion each year on a variety of programmes that are delivered through different mechanisms. Some of that spending takes the form of bilateral aid; some is 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>28 Mar 2006 : Column 694</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>multilateral. We need to achieve a far better understanding of the relative effectiveness of the main types of aid that we provide. The independent evaluation envisaged in the Bill should, I hope, provide the evidential basis, which will in turn lead to better decision making about which aid programmes should be targeted to ensure the greatest possible reduction in poverty.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-09_para11">
<a name="stpa_40">Anyone who has spent any time at all reading through the literature about aid effectiveness will be aware that the territory is hotly contested. There is a great deal of conflicting evidence about what constitutes good aid and what constitutes bad aid. Measuring the effectiveness of aid is difficult and it is easy to talk about it in general terms, but it is essential that every effort is made to improve this discipline. I have been extremely impressed by the DFID officials whom I have met and by the Secretary of State, who brings unquestionable commitment to his job. I am confident that they would wish this agenda to be developed in their Department.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-09_para12">
<a name="stpa_41">The rigorous, independent evaluation of our aid spending promoted by the Bill should not just ensure best value for taxpayers&#039; money&#151;by securing the best possible poverty reduction outcomes&#151;but strengthen and sustain public support for our aid. Over the past year, a huge number of people have invested their time, resources and energy in campaigning for an end to the obscene levels of poverty in the developing world. They are not just looking for warm rhetoric from this place or even for grand announcements that focus on the funding for our aid programmes and other inputs. Instead, they want to see and understand the outputs&#151;the real, tangible difference being made by our international aid&#151;and to see how much further there is to go before poverty really is made history.

<p><a name="st_42"><a name="60328-10_spmin0"><b>The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry  (Alan Johnson): </b> 
 This year&#039;s Budget equips British business to meet the challenges of globalisation&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i>
</p>








<p><a name="st_43"><a name="60328-10_spmin1"><b>Mr. Deputy Speaker  (Sir Alan Haselhurst): </b> 
 Order. May I ask anyone who has a cell phone still switched on please to switch it off? It is causing disturbance.
</p>








<p><a name="st_44"><a name="60328-10_spnew0"><b> Alan Johnson: </b> 
 The Budget enhances Britain&#039;s strong economy, entrenches stability and widens opportunity. Today, there are 105,000&nbsp;more self-employed people, 575,000&nbsp;more businesses and 2.4&nbsp;million more people in work than there were in 1997. Crucial sectors such as the pharmaceutical, aerospace and financial services sectors are thriving. Our scientists are leading the way in areas such as stem cell research and nanotechnology. Last year, our economy grew faster than those of France, Germany and the eurozone as a whole. The Budget builds on that success while meeting the growing challenges of globalisation, including, in particular, the phenomenal growth of China and India.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-10_para0">
<a name="stpa_44">Raising productivity is central to meeting the challenge. We are now in the longest period of sustained productivity growth since the 1960s. We have closed the productivity gap with Germany, overtaken Japan and halved the gap with France. Britain is the only G7&nbsp;country to have kept up with US rates of productivity growth, in stark contrast with France and Germany.

</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-10_para1">
<a name="stpa_45">Our success is all the more remarkable for having been achieved at the same time as an increase of 2.3&nbsp;million in&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;jobs. Achieving productivity growth and high employment at once is not an easy trick because one often rises at the expense of the other, but it is the formula for 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>28 Mar 2006 : Column 696</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>national wealth. We know that we still have further to go to raise Britain&#039;s productivity. The Budget enhances the drivers of productivity&#151;innovation, investment, skills, competition, enterprise and investment.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-10_para2">
<a name="stpa_46">Since 1997, we have invested unprecedented sums in Britain&#039;s science base. Funding levels are now double what they were. We also introduced the research and development tax credit and put in place a target to increase the share of national income that we spend on R and D from 1.8&nbsp;per cent. to 2.5&nbsp;per cent. by 2014. Today, there are 750,000&nbsp;more science, engineering and technology graduates than there were in 1997, and the share of firms bringing new products to market is up by 50&nbsp;per cent. Our world-beating proportion of scientific papers and citations has increased. In addition, the number of university spin-outs has trebled, and they now run at an average of 200&nbsp;a year. In the past two years, 18&nbsp;spin-out companies&#151;with a combined value of more than &#163;600&nbsp;million today&#151;gained listing on the London stock exchange.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-10_para3">
<a name="stpa_47">The Budget builds on that record and advances the goals of the 10-year science and innovation framework to ensure that we maximise the impact of science funding. Raising levels of business R and D is key to raising productivity. Since 1997, business R and D investment has increased by 20&nbsp;per cent. in real terms, and the R and D tax credit is driving the new investment that we need. So far, &#163;1.5&nbsp;billion of support has been claimed, and Deloitte has assessed the UK&#039;s R and D tax credit as being among the world&#039;s most attractive regimes.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-10_para4">
<a name="stpa_48">The Budget sets out our intention to extend the higher rate of the R and D tax credit to companies with between 250&nbsp;and 500&nbsp;employees. Business lobbied for such a measure and Sir George Cox recommended it in his review of creativity in business. We will also widen the remit of the technology strategy board to stimulate innovation in the areas that offer the greatest scope for productivity improvements. I am delighted to announce today the latest &#163;80&nbsp;million competition for the collaboration R and D fund under the technology programme. It will help to fund new collaborative research in vital areas underpinning our technology strategy, such as low-carbon energy technologies and innovative manufacturing processes.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-10_para5">
<a name="stpa_49">To improve productivity, the links between science and innovation are crucial. We have set out plans for a radically simplified allocation of the &#163;1.5&nbsp;billion a year that we invest in scientific discovery to make the best use of that investment.
</p>








<p><a name="st_45"><a name="60328-10_spnew1"><b> Mr. Henry Bellingham  (North-West Norfolk) (Con):</b> 
 Am I right in saying that business investment has fallen to its lowest level for the past 10&nbsp;years? Does it worry the right hon. Gentleman, as a former higher education Minister, that various university science and chemistry departments have closed recently?
</p>








<p><a name="st_46"><a name="60328-10_spnew2"><b> Alan Johnson: </b> 
 Business investment has grown on average by 5&nbsp;per cent. a year since 1997, compared with a growth of 3.4&nbsp;per cent. in the previous 10&nbsp;years. It was worth &#163;77&nbsp;billion in 1996, but is now worth &#163;113&nbsp;billion, and it will rise to &#163;126&nbsp;billion by 2008. Yes, I am concerned about the closure of chemistry departments&#151;I think that that happened at Sussex&#151;but the hon. Gentleman and 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>28 Mar 2006 : Column 697</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;know that universities are independent. If he looks around the university world, he will see good stories from other universities throughout the country.
</p>








<p><a name="st_47"><a name="60328-10_spnew3"><b> Mr. Phil Willis  (Harrogate and Knaresborough) (LD):</b> 
 I apologise for arriving just after the right hon. Gentleman started his speech. On research and development and, especially, pulling what I call the basic research out of universities and into wealth creation, why did the Chancellor not examine in his Budget statement putting solid third-stream funding into the research councils and making that available to industry? Without that, surely we will start robbing Peter to pay Paul by taking out basic research money and applying it to knowledge-transfer and third-stream funding systems.
</p>








<p><a name="st_48"><a name="60328-10_spnew4"><b> Alan Johnson: </b> 
 I am coming on to announcements in the Budget on R and D, particularly in the health service, but in terms of our total science base, doubling the amount of money available for science, operating through both the Higher Education Funding Council and the research councils, is the right way forward. We are always willing to consider more investment. It is crucial to get science and innovation into the same place.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-10_para6">
<a name="stpa_50">The Budget also announced the creation of a single budget&#151;this is pertinent to the hon. Gentleman&#039;s comments&#151;for the Medical Research Council and NHS health research, worth at least &#163;1&nbsp;billion a year. That will ensure a more coherent framework for health research and development. We will now look at the best institutional arrangements to achieve that. We have also decided that the Harwell site, which includes the Rutherford Appleton laboratory, and the Daresbury site should become the Harwell and Daresbury science and innovation campuses respectively. We will develop those campuses to ensure that their facilities are internationally competitive, support world-class science and maximise opportunities for knowledge transfer.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-10_para7">
<a name="stpa_51">As well as a strong science base, we need to invest in the scientists of tomorrow. Since 1997, the number of new science teachers has increased by 30&nbsp;per cent., but we must do more, and the Budget includes incentives for more physics and chemistry graduates to move into teaching. We are also giving pupils a right to study three separate sciences at GCSE and increasing funding for after-school science clubs.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-10_para8">
<a name="stpa_52">We need to improve mechanisms to turn our great science base into greater wealth. Over the next two years, we will put &#163;100&nbsp;million into the enterprise capital funds scheme to help high-risk, high-growth companies bridge the equity gap&#151;the funding problem that they experience when they are too big to finance from their own resources, but too small to be of interest to venture capitalists. We will also launch a scholarship scheme to help UK science, engineering and technology graduates develop entrepreneurial skills by spending six months in the US with leading universities and enterprises. The scheme will be administered by the National Council for Graduate Entrepreneurship and the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation in the United States.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-10_para9">
<a name="stpa_53">Tackling regulation is vital to the success of enterprise&#151;another key driver of productivity. At the Department of Trade and Industry, we have 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>28 Mar 2006 : Column 698</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>demonstrated that we are serious, with our &#163;1&nbsp;billion regulatory simplification plan, which will produce a significant cut in business burdens. The Budget includes further measures, with a commitment to cut the time business spends filling in tax forms and returns, as well as cutting the administrative burdens of tax audits and inspections. We are also putting the recommendations of the Hampton review into law, as well as ensuring more risk-based targeted enforcement at local authority level. That will release the vast majority of honest and compliant businesses from unnecessary and time-consuming interventions.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-10_para10">
<a name="stpa_54">A number of schemes are in place to support enterprise. We need to ensure that they are accessible, focused and well targeted. At the DTI, we have already reduced more than 100&nbsp;business support products to fewer than 10, so they are better tailored to customer needs. The Budget extends that principle and aims to reduce the number of business support schemes from 3,000&nbsp;to 100&nbsp;by 2010. More than &#163;2&nbsp;billion a year is spent on business support. The review will ensure that we get value for money.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-10_para11">
<a name="stpa_55">It is also vital that we examine the effectiveness and efficiency of our regional structures. The regional development agencies were created as a response to global pressures, where local action is often the right response. Our review will ensure that the RDAs have the links, incentive and powers they need to drive economic growth regionally.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-10_para12">
<a name="stpa_56">We must also improve the way in which we market our strengths abroad and help British business to meet the challenges of globalisation. The new chief executive of UK Trade and Investment, Andrew Cahn, shares that ambition. Before the summer, we will publish a new five-year strategy for UKTI. It will aim to deliver maximum value for business and the taxpayer. We are intensifying our efforts to expand UK trade into India and China. We are also putting &#163;9&nbsp;million of new investment into a global R and D strategy to attract more business R and D to the UK, and to promote Britain&#039;s innovative firms abroad.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-10_para13">
<a name="stpa_57">Another major challenge identified in the Budget is gender inequality at work, which, according to the women and work commission, costs Britain &#163;23&nbsp;billion a year in lost gross domestic product and prevents the economy from reaching its full productive potential. Since 1997, a combination of tax credits, the minimum wage and the new deal has made work pay and boosted employment, particularly among women, so that a record 70&nbsp;per cent. of women are in work and our overall employment rate of nearly 75&nbsp;per cent. is among the highest in the world. Our aim is to increase it to 80&nbsp;per cent.&#151;higher than any major economy has ever achieved&#151;so helping more women back to work will play a vital role. The Work and Families Bill, which is proceeding through the House, will help everyone better to balance their work and family responsibilities.

 I thank the Secretary of State for giving way. I am sure that my hon. Friends have much better questions than I have, and that he will give way to them shortly. Given the Secretary of State&#039;s welcome statement on microgeneration, what is the cost of Budget resolution 47, which is entitled, &quot;Corporation tax (nuclear decommissioning)&quot;? Is it designed to help the proposed sell-off of British Nuclear Fuels Ltd., and why was a press notice not issued giving the details of the tax change?

 I do not know whether all three Members wished to ask the same question but, on that resolution, we are the first Government to tackle seriously the problem of nuclear decommissioning. It is an horrendous task, and it is split between various agencies that have such a complicated connection to one another that it almost impossible to explain it on a grid. We must rationalise the issue and ensure that elements in public ownership that do not need to be in public ownership to meet our objectives on decommissioning are put into the private sector. We must ensure, too, that the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority has the right resources to carry out its important task.

A colleague who is much more deeply involved in microgeneration in his own home than I am has to pay &#163;8&nbsp;a therm to buy back the energy that he sells to the national grid.

The hon. Gentleman asks what steps I have taken. At the&nbsp;EU-China summit last year when the UK had the presidency, one of the important objectives of our trip to China was to begin to share with China some of the clean coal technology, such as carbon capture and carbon storage. It is crucial that we do not use the emerging carbon sequestration technologies only in Europe, and that we share our scientific lead with China and India.

The Budget announced that from next year the climate change levy will increase in line with inflation. Even after taking into account these increased rates, business will still benefit from the overall climate change levy package. The 0.3&nbsp;per cent. reduction in national insurance contributions brought in at the same time as the levy saves business &#163;900&nbsp;million a year, whereas the levy costs about &#163;600&nbsp;million a year. The Conservative party remains opposed to that progressive measure.

 I have watched all 10&nbsp;of the Budgets delivered by the Chancellor, and none of us who has watched him doubts that they are always skilfully honed. He is a master of propaganda rather than enlightenment. We have long since learned that what is in the Budget on the day is not what matters and that most of the pain lies in the small print that is not announced on the day.

<a name="60328-11_para6">
<a name="stpa_66">All Budgets need time to settle for everyone to digest them. This Budget does not involve great drama, because there is no fundamental restructuring or revolutionary changes of gear. There is no real point in engaging in an auction of hyperbole in which one side says that the Budget is all fabulous and the other says that it is all disastrous. This Budget needs a more dispassionate assessment of the context in which it has been designed. <i>[Interruption.]</i> Even in this House, there are moments to stand back and consider the long-term trends, which is exactly what I want to do today.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-11_para7">
<a name="stpa_67">I shall admit something else to enliven the House. Some say that the two sides of this House have so converged that one can no longer tell us apart, but they are totally wrong. Labour has had to prove over the years that it understands and embraces market economics, while we have had to reassert our belief in social justice, but what divides us is tax and the power of the state. The Chancellor is inclined to tax anything that moves and do anything that he can get away with; we believe in lowering taxes wherever possible and that any new tax must be justified. The Chancellor believes that state action and centrally directed initiatives are the solution to most national problems; we believe that the creativity and aspiration of the individual, free from state interference, is the greatest engine of progress and improvement. We appreciate more than the Chancellor that only private prosperity can pay for public services&#151;when we think of wealth, profit and prosperity, we say, &quot;Go make it&quot;, while he says, &quot;Go take it&quot;.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-11_para8">
<a name="stpa_68">The Chancellor makes much of his fiscal rules: first, that he should balance the budget over the economic cycle, and secondly, that he should borrow for investment, not merely for spending. However, he took some pride in rejecting what he called a third fiscal rule, namely that spending should rise more slowly than growth. Perhaps that policy marks the difference between us, because it contains both a grave admission and the seeds of its own destruction. If spending increases more slowly than growth, then the state takes a smaller proportion of GDP. If spending increases ever faster than growth, which is the opposite of the fiscal rule that he has rejected, then the state takes an ever-larger proportion of GDP, which leads to more spending, higher taxes and greater borrowing&#151;what was 40&nbsp;per cent. can become 50, 60, 70, 80&nbsp;or 90&nbsp;per cent. The effect is a bit like flesh-eating bacteria: it is so self-consuming that if one were to carry the Chancellor&#039;s course to its logical outcome, the British economy would disappear up its own origins. But fortunately the people can stop it.

We do not have a perfect national health service: we have deficits, closures and lay-offs.

<a name="stpa_76">Competition in the modern world is becoming more and more ferocious. Comparative weakness can be seized on, with the swift transfer of capital to better options.

Mature economies such as ours, with higher welfare costs and high social standards, carry those costs while having at the same time to compete with the likes of India, China and eastern Europe&#151;all at a different stage of development. Our fortunes will not be shaped in any sudden way by the contents of one Budget. They will be determined by the gradual and continuing force of global competition.

He caved in to the unions over central Government pensions and has thereby enraged those who work in local government. Those in the private sector are working longer and have less pension security, and today we have seen the biggest strike since 1926. One estimate puts the total liabilities in unfunded public sector pensions at nearly &#163;1&nbsp;trillion.

</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-13_para2">
<a name="stpa_98">It is always a huge pleasure to follow the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton (Mr. Duncan), although his speech was somewhat less dispassionate than he had promised. He was obviously in Tiggerish mood, and somewhat less gracious than usual. I would have thought that any right hon. or hon. Member would recognise that to be able to deliver 10&nbsp;Budgets in a row is a pretty remarkable achievement on the part of any Chancellor of the Exchequer. For those Budgets to have coincided with, and contributed to, our remarkably successful economic climate is without parallel in modern times. So perhaps the shadow Chancellor, the hon. Member for Tatton (Mr. Osborne), will offer a bit less criticism and a bit more credit to my right hon. Friend when he rises to speak later.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-13_para3">
<a name="stpa_99">The test of whether a modern Budget works consists of three things. First, we must determine whether it provides for sound economic management. Here, my right hon. Friend has again confounded the prophets of doom, including many Conservative Members, who seem to take perverse pleasure in predicting the imminent decline either of the British economy or of the public finances. I have heard much the same speech from the Conservative Front Bench over the past nine years. In the real world, however, I have yet to see any such decline. Who nowadays talks of mass unemployment, sky-high interest rates or out-of-control inflation?

<p>
<a name="60328-13_para6">
<a name="stpa_102">Secondly, however, successful Budgets must look beyond today&#039;s achievements and face tomorrow&#039;s challenges. In the end, politics is about the future, not the past. Political parties that are wedded to the past tend to remain stuck in it, which is precisely why the Conservatives remain in opposition. Success goes to those who have the strongest claim on the future. Again, in that regard, this Budget has much to commend it&#151;above all, as my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry has just said, its commitment to increased funding of education and science as recognition that our country&#039;s future competitiveness will rely increasingly on access to skills and technology.

</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-13_para7">
<a name="stpa_103">That brings me to the third test of success for any Budget&#151;whether it works politically as well as economically. Here, my right hon. Friend the Chancellor laid down a dividing line in his Budget that caused the Conservative party&#151;I notice that the shadow Chief Secretary has departed&#151;some discomfort, to put it politely. The Conservatives&#039; adoption of a third fiscal rule might have seemed a good wheeze when it was dreamt up, but the Budget has exposed it for what it is. Going into the next election promising cuts in public expenditure, particularly in education, will leave the Conservative party no further forward than it has been at the two previous elections.

<a name="60328-13_para8">
<a name="stpa_104">I speak with some feeling on that. My party had to learn the hard way during the 1980s that when one gets the fundamentals of tax and spend wrong, one pays a very high political price. Conservative Members might note that former President Clinton is in town today, and we all welcome him. The Conservative party would do well to heed the advice of President Clinton&#039;s famous election campaign slogan&#151;it is the economy, stupid, not stupid economics, that wins elections.

<a name="60328-13_para9">
<a name="stpa_105">When Labour won office a decade ago, the key policy question that faced Britain was how to end the stop-go economic cycle and how to modernise public services. In both regards, although, of course, there is more to do, there is much progress to report. There are new questions today, however, which are different from the old ones. They boil down to this: how can we ensure that our response to globalisation, including increased competitive pressure from India and China, is characterised by the building of a genuinely inclusive society when there are huge pressures going in the opposite direction?
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-13_para10">
<a name="stpa_106">As my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry indicated in his speech, globalisation demands many policy responses from Government&#151;fiscal discipline, economic stability, open markets not economic protectionism, a limit on regulation. It also requires investment in skills, technology and infrastructure. In the end, however, important though each of those policies are, the most important policy response is none of those&#151;instead, it is the building of a society in which every citizen gets the chance to contribute and to progress. We now live in a highly competitive world, in which every talent wasted is not just a loss to the individual but a huge economic drag on the country. Britain can succeed economically only if we are mobile socially. Here, bluntly, we have no reason for complacency and much to concern us.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-13_para11">
<a name="stpa_107">As my right hon. Friend the Chancellor reported, it is true that life is steadily getting better for most people&#151;living standards are rising. We all know, however, that in recent decades birth not worth has become more and more a key determinant of life chances in our country. Social mobility has slowed down when it ought to have been speeding up.

<p><a name="st_79"><a name="60328-13_spnew6"><b> Mr. Stewart Jackson  (Peterborough) (Con):</b> 
 I am listening with interest to the right hon. Gentleman&#039;s homily to the future. Can he explain how, after nine years of Labour Government, the gap between the richest 10&nbsp;per cent. and the poorest 10&nbsp;per cent. in our country is wider than it has ever been?
</p>








<p><a name="st_80"><a name="60328-13_spnew7"><b> Mr. Milburn: </b> 
 I will come to precisely that. The hon. Gentleman might have read, I think, the most authoritative study on inequality, mobility and poverty by Professor Hills of the London School of Economics. He says that it is likely that in the last two years for which figures are available, the widening of the inequality gap, which widened massively during the 1980s, has been halted. What we know for sure is that poverty has been reduced, particularly among children and pensioners. The truth is, however&#151;we see it in the hon. Gentleman&#039;s constituency as much as in mine&#151;that the gap remains stubbornly and persistently wide. 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>28 Mar 2006 : Column 710</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>While more people are better off, poverty has become more entrenched. There is a glass ceiling on opportunity in our country. We have raised it, but we have not yet broken through it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-13_para12">
<a name="stpa_108">There are many welcome measures in the Budget that will help the position. Increasing the value of tax credits is one; yesterday&#039;s White Paper, with its focus on skills, is another. But as Amartya Sen, winner of the Nobel prize for economics, has noted, social inequality is best tackled and mobility best advanced if we tackle the root causes, not the symptoms. That must mean moving beyond simply correcting low wages and family poverty after the event, towards policies that spread opportunity and help people to realise their own aspirations for progress.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-13_para13">
<a name="stpa_109">The biggest inequity today in our country is not between income groups, but between those who own shares, pensions and housing and those who rely purely on wages and benefits. That is why I believe, in common with my right hon. Friend the Chancellor, that the biggest contribution to enhancing social mobility is to establish Britain as an asset-owning democracy. After all, people rarely spend their way out of poverty. It is far better to encourage people to own assets, so that they have a real stake in the future. I therefore welcome the Budget announcement about the child trust fund. I also welcome the extension of home ownership: indeed, I want it to go further. Just as we are extending home ownership, we should seek to extend employee share ownership to give people a greater stake in economic success.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-13_para14">
<a name="stpa_110">My party won by becoming a party of aspiration. Our means of beating poverty should involve unleashing aspiration. That brings me to another area in which more reform is needed to combine the values that the Labour party, at least, has always supported&#151;social justice and fairness for all&#151;with the modern ambition that people rightly have to progress. I refer to the sensitive issue of taxation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-13_para15">
<a name="stpa_111">The Chancellor told the House that he had had scope for tax cuts, but had chosen not to make them. He rightly announced, however, that he was uprating tax credits in line with earnings. In effect he was announcing a tax subsidy for working households, and I welcome that. Tax credits have made a real difference in raising living standards and incentivising people into work. Before their introduction, thousands of low-income families faced marginal tax rates in excess of 70&nbsp;per cent. Some were even clobbered by rates of over 100&nbsp;per cent. That meant that for every &#163;1&nbsp;earned in wages, more than &#163;1&nbsp;was taken off in tax.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-13_para16">
<a name="stpa_112">Today, over half a million fewer low-income households face such insanely high marginal tax rates than was the case in 1997. However, as the Red Book itself confirms, the number facing marginal tax rates of 60&nbsp;per cent. or more has increased by nearly 1&nbsp;million, largely as a consequence of the workings of the tax credit system. The Institute for Fiscal Studies has warned that, without remedial action, that could worsen work incentives.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-13_para17">
<a name="stpa_113">I was brought up to believe that hard work and endeavour would be rewarded, not penalised. The tax system needs to reflect those values. On fairness grounds, it surely cannot be right for people towards the bottom of the income scale to face higher marginal taxes 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>28 Mar 2006 : Column 711</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>than those at the top. It is for that reason that I welcome the Chancellor&#039;s plan for a review of the feasibility of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;aligning income tax and national insurance contributions for low-income families. I believe that the review should consider additional ways of making direct, targeted cuts in the tax burden on low-income families, building on our introduction of the 10p starting rate of tax in 1999, so that we can spring more people from the poverty trap. Such radical action is needed if we are to unfreeze social mobility in our country.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-13_para18">
<a name="stpa_114">Of course, there is much that this Labour Government have already done of which we can be proud. No Conservative Government would ever have introduced a national minimum wage, made universal child care a new arm of the welfare state, or helped millions of pensioners out of poverty. The Budget is a further step in the right direction, but we need to do more to help more people through that glass ceiling. An 80&#150;20&nbsp;society, in which 80&nbsp;per cent. do OK but 20&nbsp;per cent. are left behind, might be good enough for the Conservatives, but it should not be good enough for us. That is why I urge my right hon. and hon. Friends to keep moving forward with reform. The longer that we are in government, the greater the need to keep on changing to keep pace with the times in which we live.

One of the Government&#039;s great achievements in health has been the roll-out of cancer screening&#151;a major challenge to which there has been a huge response.

Stories have been reported in the press and to me by a leading charity in the field that, at the very last moment, the programme has been pulled because of financial difficulties in the Department of Health.

<a name="stpa_116">I congratulate the Conservative spokesman, the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton (Mr. Duncan), on his emollient and consensual approach&#151;at least, he started like that. He is someone who describes himself, like some of his colleagues, as a fellow liberal. I am not sure how far up the Back Benches that view is to be found, but it is a good start, and perhaps we saw a new style of debate today, which has been characterised by one wag as the debate between new Labour and blue Labour, although I do not know how the hon. Gentleman positions himself.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-14_para2">
<a name="stpa_117">The overall Budget debate has been somewhat frustrating, because we are essentially dealing with two different issues, one of which is the Government&#039;s overall economic performance and the other is the Budget, which has become a somewhat ritualised event. Most of the decisions have been made in the spending review and the pre-Budget report. The sum total of what is proposed amounts to 45&nbsp;measures, costing &#163;380&nbsp;million. That is less than one tenth of 1&nbsp;per cent. of all Government spending&#151;well within the margin of error of any Government forecast. We are talking about a series of changes&#151;some of which are very welcome and sensible, such as the spending on schools and science&#151;that have absolutely no impact whatever on the overall macro-economy.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-14_para3">
<a name="stpa_118">On the macro-economic picture, the view that I have taken ever since I took on my current role is to acknowledge the positives, and it is certainly still true that we have steady growth, low inflation, rising employment and fairly low unemployment, although unemployment has now risen for 12&nbsp;of the past 13&nbsp;months, which may be the beginning of an ominous trend. However, the Government tend to spoil their own very positive narrative with endless spin, hype and exaggeration. One little phrase always creeps into the Budget statement that reveals a lot: it is a lovely line about how they have the best period of steady growth, going back to 1700, or the Tudors&#151;or the Normans, I am not sure. That nice line is true in one sense, but it is produced by a sleight of hand by using quarterly data.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-14_para4">
<a name="stpa_119">If we use annual data, we could argue that after 1949, for example, there were 25&nbsp;years of steady growth. It is worth reflecting back on that period, because many of the strengths and weaknesses of the current long boom were apparent then. As some of us dimly remember from our childhood, it was a period of steady growth and rising living standards. Many of our parents were for the first time enjoying consumer durables bought on hire purchase. It was also a period of low unemployment, low inflation and general optimism; however, there was a fundamental problem that we see reproduced today.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-14_para5">
<a name="stpa_120">Back then, the structure of the economy and of demand was very unbalanced&#151;it was led by consumption. Of course, in those days such imbalance appeared in the form of crises, because consumption spread over into imports and produced balance of payments crises. That no longer happens because of the liberalisation of capital markets; nevertheless, we have the same problem today. Consumption has grown by 3&nbsp;to 3.4&nbsp;per cent. a year since the mid-1990s, while the economy as a whole has grown by about 2.8&nbsp;per cent. As a result, household savings ratios have fallen from 10&nbsp;per cent. to less than 5&nbsp;per cent., and the end product is a growing problem of personal debt. The Minister will

<br>&nbsp;<br>have seen this morning&#039;s report from the Financial Services Authority&#151;a very conservative regulatory body not given to hype or outrage&#151;which points out that some 2&nbsp;million families, over and above the 500,000&nbsp;who have already defaulted on debt, are on the edge and in considerable difficulties in terms of managing domestic debt problems.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-14_para6">
<a name="stpa_121">Figures published by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development a few weeks ago point out that the comfort that we derive from low interest rates is illusory. Because of low interest rates, people are borrowing very heavily, which means that principal repayments are growing much more than they did in earlier generations. People are also taking on credit card debt, which has to be serviced monthly. The OECD concluded that the share of household income being spent on debt servicing is approaching 20&nbsp;per cent. The same was true in the early 1990s, when the last economic boom crashed disastrously under the previous Conservative Government. In many respects, the conditions today are very similar, and we can expect a painful correction in the years to come.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-14_para7">
<a name="stpa_122">The other parallel with that period is also very striking. Throughout the 1950s and certainly in the 1960s, as we moved into the Wilson era, politicians talked endlessly about productivity growth and science, because in comparative terms there was an underlying weakness in the UK economy. That weakness was very apparent, because Germany, Italy, France and Japan were recovering from the wartime period. It is less apparent now because the real breakthroughs are occurring in non-G7&nbsp;countries, but the problems are still very real.

</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-14_para8">
<a name="stpa_123">As quite a few economic analysts have pointed out, in the past few years the British economy&#039;s productivity growth has fallen. A report published this morning by the Economist Intelligence Unit shows, for example, that Britain is now the seventh biggest recipient of inward foreign investment; last year, it was the fourth biggest. That is very strange and difficult to explain. Britain has a very open economy&#151;unlike France, Italy and Spain, we have no problem with foreign acquisitions and mergers&#151;yet foreign investors are very reluctant to come here. According to the EIU&#039;s analysis, a combination of very complex business taxation&#151;incidentally, the corporation tax threshold was not raised this year, so more companies have been dragged into the higher rates&#151;regulation and poor infrastructure is having a cumulatively damaging effect on the Chancellor&#039;s claim that he is overcoming problems of low productivity.

I acknowledge that the Government propose to take the big and positive step of introducing legislation to make the Office for National Statistics more independent, but there is another part to all this that is not happening.

<a name="stpa_127">Items on the spending side need to be questioned, too.

However, although I and other people have searched through the Red Book, there is no reference to that sum anywhere. Shared ownership is difficult to operate, but it appears that the figure simply reflects commitments made last year and the year before, so it is not a new commitment at all. Can the Government confirm that?

<a name="stpa_128">Various other spending items need some explanation. Perhaps the Chief Secretary can advance it.

I am all in favour of tightening up discipline in spending Departments, especially if they can reduce headquarters overheads&#151;the principle is splendid.

<a name="stpa_138">The main taxation measures that the Government introduced were in relation to the environment. The Liberal Democrats certainly support the principle of environmental taxation and would like to see more active use made of it. However, it was striking that on the day before the Budget, the Environmental Audit Committee, which is an all-party Committee, criticised the Government for allowing environmental taxation to fall as a share of gross domestic product. That is at a time when, as we were reminded this morning, carbon emissions targets are not being met.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-15_para2">
<a name="stpa_139">Of the specific measures, we support the very modest increase in the taxation of what are called Chelsea tractors. Frankly, the research of the RAC, for example, suggests that, in order to have an impact and to change behaviour, the differential needs to be about &#163;1,000&nbsp;rather than &#163;200. None the less, the measure is a move in the right direction. We welcome, in principle, the increase in the climate change levy. It is a clumsy tax, based simply on the manufacturing sector. We have argued for a more broadly based carbon taxation system, but since we support the principle of environmental taxation, we do not disagree with what the Government are trying to do.

There are many ways in which the Government could do something, through environmental taxation, to curb emissions in the aviation sector, but they have done absolutely nothing. The question is, why?
</p>

<p>

<a name="stpa_141">The major weakness of the Budget relates to the big opportunities that were missed. One question&#151;this is a slightly technical point that I raised with the Chancellor in Treasury questions&#151;is why the Chancellor missed the opportunity of the lowest real interest rates for 300&nbsp;years to refinance large parts of the Government debt. The Government have rolled out a programme&#151;they describe it in the Budget&#151;for more active use of the gilts markets, but reputable economic advisers and former members of the Monetary Policy Committee have pointed out that billions could have been saved if the Treasury had been quicker off the mark in taking advantage of the market opportunities.

<a name="60328-15_para5">
<a name="stpa_142">A more fundamental point is that there is absolutely no indication of where the Government are heading in terms of the long-term reform of local government finance. That is important because, as we all know, council tax is highly regressive. That completely undermines the basic objective that the Chancellor is trying to achieve: greater fairness and equity throughout the tax system. There is a lot of anger among pensioners about the loss of the &#163;200&nbsp;rebate, but that, in itself, is a symptom of a bigger problem. The tax is not perceived as fair or legitimate, and it needs to be reformed so that it is linked to people&#039;s ability to pay. Moreover, the local government tax system produces only 25&nbsp;per cent. of local revenue, which is not consistent with the approach of local decentralisation of which the Government claim to be in favour. We have had no indication of where the Government are heading.

I do not believe everything that I read in newspapers, but the article seemed singularly plausible because it argued that the Prime Minister had asked the Chancellor what he was doing about the Turner report. The Turner report&#039;s key recommendation was on how to create a system with a decent level of state pension to get away from mass means-testing, which has all the disincentive effects at which the right hon. Member for Darlington hinted. Turner offered a way forward, but we know that the Chancellor is passionately opposed to it. There is a fundamental division in the Government on not just pensions policy, but the fundamental question of the best way of dealing with poverty and redistribution. There is a question whether we should use complex benefits, or general measures such as those proposed by Turner on pensions.

We could only dream of such figures during the years of the Conservative Government. However, even unemployment statistics can mask the personal misery endured by families torn apart and left with no dignity or future, as we saw when unemployment continued in an upward spiral and grew substantially in the &#039;80s. Unemployment has been tackled most successfully, and the Government are now addressing the issue of incapacity benefit claimants.

There can be no quarrel with that considered approach, provided that the principles are maintained and advisers treat incapacity benefit claimants with respect and dignity.

The Red Book forecasts that by 2010, compared with the present, another 1&nbsp;per cent. of national gross domestic product will be taken by income tax and national insurance.

<a name="stpa_164">As has already been pointed out, corporation tax thresholds have not been raised at all&#151;not in line with inflation, not at all&#151;so corporation tax take increases as well. The Chancellor is raising his revenue rapidly. He needs to; I shall return to that. He has put off&#151;I do not regret it&#151;the comprehensive spending review a little. I do not know why. It will be completed by mid-2007. He gave us hints of the beginning of that with what has already been described for Her Majesty&#039;s Revenue and Customs, the Treasury, the Department for Work and Pensions and the Cabinet Office. Their baseline will be taken down by 5&nbsp;per cent. per annum in real terms, compared with their baseline for 2007&#150;08. I imagine that the Ministers responsible will think of nothing else, because we have been given no idea how it will be achieved.

<a name="stpa_165">The Chancellor forecasts that public spending as a whole will increase by 1.9&nbsp;per cent. each year between 2008&nbsp;and 2010, which is less than half the level of recent growth and less than the likely growth rate of the economy. We have no idea where those cuts will be made, and we have no idea how the public services will cope when some of them are in crisis even following the ridiculous largesse since 2000. Unless reform is initiated, this will be a tight public spending round.

 I realise that spending is not usually a matter for the Budget, although I used to include it. However, when one considers fiscal policy, spending is still relevant to the debate. The Government are raising tax and are about to cut spending growth drastically&#151;they argued that we were being draconian when we urged such measures in the past. There are no longer any fiscal rules by which to judge the matter. The golden rule has been discredited since the ridiculous change to the timetable for the cycle. The sustainable investment rule would be sensible, if the accounting devices for Network Rail, unfunded pension commitments and the private finance initiative made any sense. The Chancellor is flying by the seat of his pants on fiscal rules. In its annual country report, the International Monetary Fund recommends that he should start putting in some fresh fiscal rules to correct those discrepancies.

<p>
<a name="60328-16_para13">
<a name="stpa_166">Although the Budget does not contain a Budget judgment, we should know what it is. Chancellors usually loosen policy, tighten policy, try to redress the public finances or feel that they can be expansive. This Chancellor is tightening policy, and he has only just started. He must do so because of many factors that we warned him about, given his years of irresponsibility since 2000.

<a name="stpa_167">The real economy is in the doldrums at the moment. Let us not start the fancy swapping of statistics, which involves real-terms figures, cash figures and choosing particular funny years. Everybody knows that the economy is going through a period of marked slowdown, because the 1.8&nbsp;per cent. gross domestic product growth in 2005&nbsp;was the lowest since 1992. Why is GDP growth slowing down? It has been based&#151;I refer hon. Members to my previous Budget speeches&#151;on a sea of household debt, and public debt and borrowing, for the past six years. That was not sustainable, and what is not sustainable always stops, which is why GDP growth has started to slow down. There has been a drop in consumer demand and a drop in public investment and spending. Those trends will continue, and will not pick up rapidly.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-16_para15">
<a name="stpa_168">Last year consumer demand grew by 1.9&nbsp;per cent.&#151;the lowest growth since 1995. It will not pick up, and I shall briefly explain why. First, household debt is about 150&nbsp;per cent. of household incomes. People will not add much to absolute debt, so they are not going to spend above their incomes any more. The disposable income of the average household in this country has gone up by only 1&nbsp;per cent. in each of the past two years. Furthermore, I have referred to the tax burden, and the Governor of the Bank of England mentioned it when he discussed falling demand.

<a name="stpa_171">The economy is slowing down markedly and I cannot see any reason why it should bounce back in a hurry. I think that we could be in for several years of lacklustre performance, and I think that we have got there because the Government took too short-term a view and disregarded the warnings when the Chancellor went in for tax and spend. Since 2000, the Chancellor has made the economy ever more dependent on shoving in demand, either by encouraging consumers to borrow too heavily or having the Government spend too highly. Now, the economy will slow down. I have not even touched on global influences such as oil prices and commodity prices, which still have not had their full effect on our growth potential. There will be no quick bounce back.

It has become fashionable to talk about the challenge from India and China, and one can add to that Brazil and the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;entirety of south-east Asia.

 The right hon. and learned Gentleman is discussing business investment, which is one way to rebalance the economy. The conditions for business investment could not be better, because the stock exchange is going up and interest rates are low, yet business investment is not happening.

<a name="stpa_182">Government support is not, in itself, enough. We need a long-term transformation in the business environment in poorer communities, and to achieve that the private sector has to play a part. The Budget included a very useful paper entitled &quot;Financial services in London&quot;, which I read with great interest. It rightly focused on the City&#039;s internationalism&#151;it was sub-titled &quot;Global opportunities and challenges&quot;&#151;which is, after all, the reason for its past pre-eminence and its continued success and prosperity.

<a name="stpa_185">There are, of course, significant differences between the UK and the US banking systems, but we can learn lessons from the US. A vibrant CDFI sector in the UK could help to fill the funding gap that is left by a lack of access to mainstream finance and could act as a bridge between deprived communities and the more successful mainstream economies. It could also improve the sustainability of regeneration funding through increased loan financing, as compared to grant funding.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-17_para12">
<a name="stpa_186">There has already been some analysis of the need for such organisations in the UK. Bristol city council commissioned some research in 2002&nbsp;that looked at the support available for local business start-ups. In particular, it looked at Barton Hill, an estate in my constituency that is in a ward ranked 133rd on the national index of deprivation. The estate benefits already from &#163;50&nbsp;million regeneration funding under the new deal for communities scheme, but that alone is not enough to turn round its fortunes.

<p>
<a name="60328-17_para13">
<a name="stpa_187">The study found that there was no lack of agencies providing enterprise support in Bristol. In fact, there was an over-provision of agencies and an under-utilisation of funds. In some cases, the resources were overlapping, or poorly targeted, or the agencies did not fully understand or meet the needs of micro-entrepreneurs. I very much welcome the decision, highlighted by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry today, to cut the number of business support services from 3,000&nbsp;to 100&nbsp;by 2010. Streamlining the support will make accessing it much easier for small businesses.

<a name="60328-17_para14">
<a name="stpa_188">The Bristol study noted that there was a raft of community finance initiatives, such as a loan guarantee scheme provided in partnership with a mainstream financial institution. But application processes were complex, and they had not been drawn together or developed in the context of an integrated strategy. The study also found that barriers to personal finance, such as the lack of a bank account or the absence of any savings or assets, were also significant barriers to entrepreneurship. We know, however, that mainstream financial institutions are increasingly deserting such communities, to the extent that they no longer even provide cashpoint machines, let alone set up branches.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-17_para15">
<a name="stpa_189">The Bristol study recommended the creation of a broad-based CDFI, which would bring together existing loan funds; encourage closer partnerships with, and between, credit unions; link in advice services, such as the excellent Bristol debt advice centre in my constituency; and bridge the gap between access to personal banking facilities and enterprise finance. A CDFI in Bristol could also, as in the United States, have a role to play in supporting voluntary sector and not-for-profit groups, of which there are many in my constituency, doing immensely valuable work. They all too often struggle to access funding, can secure only short-term funds, or are hit by cash flow problems as they get caught out by the complexities of endless bidding rounds. A community bank could help them negotiate their way through the maze, by providing loan finance, cash-flowing shortfalls and offering business advice and support.

<a name="stpa_190">The Government have already taken some important steps to promote the development of CDFIs in the UK. They have established a trade association for CDFIs&#151;the Community Development Finance Association&#151;and the Bridges community development venture fund has invested &#163;20&nbsp;million in our most deprived areas. Most importantly, the Government have introduced the community investment tax credit, which gives a tax incentive to investors in accredited CDFIs, and requires them to make onward investments. So far, that has enabled CDFIs to raise some &#163;35&nbsp;million of new capital for onward lending to small businesses and social enterprises in disadvantaged communities. CDFIs have financed more than 9,500&nbsp;businesses and individuals, sustained more than 85,000&nbsp;jobs, created more than 10,000&nbsp;jobs and leveraged another &#163;160&nbsp;million in additional funds, on top of the &#163;400&nbsp;million they already have available to lend and invest.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-17_para17">
<a name="stpa_191">That represents real progress, but there is still a long way to go before the sector is as vibrant and as much a part of the local economy as it is in the USA. There are three possible ways to encourage our financial institutions to do more to lend and invest in disadvantaged areas, and to support the development of CDFIs. The first is to offer a reward or incentive for investment, through measures like the community investment tax credit, which the Government have already done. The second, which was recommended by the social investment task force in 2000&nbsp;but has not yet been implemented, is to force disclosure by the banks of the extent of their investment in, and provision of services to, disadvantaged communities. Only one bank, Barclays, does that voluntarily, and I suggest that the time has come to encourage&#151;or perhaps do more than encourage&#151;other banks to follow suit. The third and more radical approach would be to adopt the US approach and legislate to require banks to invest in deprived communities. In the USA, under the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977, deposit-taking financial institutions can choose whether to provide banking services directly to under-served communities, or to invest in CDFIs that do, but they have to do one or the other. That activity is monitored by federal regulators, and taken into account when banks are applying for charters, or for approval of bank mergers, acquisitions and branch openings. At the last audit, only 5&nbsp;per cent. of banks were judged to have failed to comply with their obligations under the CRA, which has led to a huge growth in the CDFI industry and greatly increased access to capital for low-income communities. The bank that we visited in Washington said that without that legislation they would not exist, and neither would the businesses set up for their customers.

<p>
<a name="60328-17_para19">

<a name="60328-18_para0">
<a name="stpa_194">I want to deal with a matter that is at the heart of the work that I do in Parliament&#151;efficiency savings. As the parties move closer and closer together ideologically, the debate will increasingly centre on which party can achieve such efficiency savings. The Chancellor claims that through the Gershon review he can save &#163;21&nbsp;billion. I support that target, which approaches 5&nbsp;per cent. of Government spending&#151;a worthy aim.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-18_para1">
<a name="stpa_195">However, there are various problems, the first of which concerns baselines. In our ordinary life, if we are given a utility bill, compare it with last year&#039;s and see that we have saved &#163;20&nbsp;having spent &#163;200, it is clear that we have made a 10&nbsp;per cent. saving. Unbelievably, in most Government Departments that clear baseline on individual projects is not available. For instance, the National Audit Office found that out of 300&nbsp;projects that it looked into under the review, 180&nbsp;had no baseline. How can one make accurate claims if one does not know one&#039;s starting point? That is surely the first essential in any walk of life. The situation is not surprising, because although it has been a requirement on local government to have a professionally qualified finance director since 1988, there is no such requirement on Whitehall Departments. As far as I know, no permanent secretary has ever run a project, although they are highly intelligent people.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-18_para2">
<a name="stpa_196">In the 2005&nbsp;Budget, the Chancellor claimed that he had already achieved &#163;2&nbsp;billion-worth of efficiency savings. If one looks in the detail of the Budget report, though, one finds that only &#163;1.2&nbsp;billion of efficiency savings is listed. So where has the rest gone? The devil is in the detail. To this day, there is still no full NAO access to the Office of Government Commerce breakdown of the &#163;2&nbsp;billion claim. The NAO has therefore had to conclude that Departments are not sufficiently subject to OGC challenge. The first problem, therefore, is that we do not know the baseline&#151;the starting point&#151;for these efficiency savings.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-18_para3">
<a name="stpa_197">The second big problem is that of double counting. The vast majority of efficiency savings, which are now the bedrock of successive Budgets, were already under way before the efficiency programme began. In the NAO sample of 20&nbsp;projects, 17&nbsp;were initiated before publication of the Gershon review in July 2004. Many efficiency savings are simply added on to existing programmes rather than being new programmes.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-18_para4">
<a name="stpa_198">The third problem sounds quite technical but is very significant&#151;it is the inclusion of non-cash-releasing schemes. Perhaps the former Chancellor, my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke), will understand what I am talking about, but I will try to explain. The &#163;21&nbsp;billion saving includes non-cashable elements. That is where I would claim, as Chancellor of the Exchequer, that I am putting the same inputs into a particular programme&#151;it may be number of cancer operations&#151;but getting significantly enhanced outputs.

<br>&nbsp;<br>&#163;21&nbsp;billion saved is based on cashable savings, but the pre-Budget report shows that in fact the figure is only 48&nbsp;per cent.&#151;so where has the rest gone?
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-18_para5">
<a name="stpa_199">I bring those three problems to the House to try to get a more rigorous discussion of what is now a central element of the Budget debate. Let me turn to why they occur. Unbelievably, the accounts of the Department for Work and Pensions have been qualified by the Comptroller and Auditor General for 16&nbsp;successive years. An army of 115,000&nbsp;staff is employed by that one Department, most of whom are not delivering money to the poor but working out entitlements. We are buried in a system that is increasingly based on means-testing, complexity and bureaucracy, and riddled by fraud and error. We now see that the Inland Revenue, which has been the most successful and efficient Government department, is being sucked into this vortex. Previously, it very efficiently took money from the middle classes. It is not expert at delivering money back to poorer people, and its reputation has suffered from it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-18_para6">
<a name="stpa_200">The Comptroller and Auditor General already audits Budget assumptions. I propose a much clearer audit trail throughout its forecasts and claims, all of which should be independently validated. I say this to my hon. Friend the shadow Chancellor, although perhaps it is too radical a suggestion: why should not the Opposition parties, when they initiate the equivalent of the James review, offer to have their forecasts and proposed efficiency savings audited by the National Audit Office so that we can have an honest debate? I think that that is an interesting idea&#151;I dreamed it up in my bath last night&#151;and I will suggest it to the Comptroller and Auditor General.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-18_para7">
<a name="stpa_201">As the hon. Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable) suggested in his excellent speech, we increasingly have to replace complex, means-tested benefits and tax credits with raising tax thresholds. That is the key, because it can be argued for by compassionate Conservatives who are worried about the fact that as people on lower incomes increase their income, they are paying marginal rates of 60&nbsp;per cent. tax&#151;far higher than the rich. At the same time, middle class people will work out that as tax thresholds are raised their tax will start to go down. It is a canny thing to do politically&#151;after all, we are politicians&#151;as well as being the right thing to do for the economy and for the poor.

 Does my hon. Friend recognise the huge cost inefficiencies in laundering taxpayers&#039; money back to them? Would not it be simpler if we just raised the tax thresholds at which people start paying tax, and would not that help a huge number of the least-well-off families in our society?

 I am most grateful to the hon. Gentleman. I do not think that he was paying attention to the Budget speech last week when the Chancellor said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_22">&quot;One option would be to raise that personal tax allowance further. But spending &#163;500&nbsp;million on a family tax cut in this way would give a two-child family on median earnings .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. &#163;22&nbsp;a year more, or 40p a week. However, using the same resources to raise the child tax credit will give that same family a tax cut worth &#163;140&nbsp;a year more, over six times as much&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 22&nbsp;March 2006; Vol. 444, c. 295.]</p>

<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-18_para8">
<a name="stpa_202">Can the hon. Gentleman explain how his proposal would be in line with compassionate Conservatism?
</p>








<p><a name="st_112"><a name="60328-18_spnew6"><b> Mr. Leigh: </b> 
 I just tried to explain it. We can argue back and forth about statistics, but I shall not do that. I simply make the perfectly good point that, in every Budget, tax thresholds should relate to the real world where there is growth and inflation. In a fair Budget, tax thresholds should do that, leaving aside the debate on tax credits.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-18_para9">
<a name="stpa_203">If we are to have an honest debate and achieve the &#163;21&nbsp;billion of savings, which is achievable&#151;after all, the private sector regularly makes 5&nbsp;per cent. efficiency savings&#151;on what could we spend the money? The number of people who pay inheritance tax is rising rapidly. This year, 37,000&nbsp;people were paying it, whereas in 1996&#150;97, the figure was15,000. The amount paid has doubled since 1997, from &#163;1.6&nbsp;billion to &#163;2.9&nbsp;billion. If one is spending &#163;550&nbsp;billion, one can address that tax. I hope that my hon. Friends on the shadow Treasury Bench will view the matter as a priority. It has a massive impact on behaviour and is not good for the way in which families plan inheritance. It often causes disputes, it raises only &#163;2.9&nbsp;billion and it should be a priority for a future Government.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-18_para10">
<a name="stpa_204">We could increase efficiency in so many ways. For example, the Chancellor makes a great song and dance about spending &#163;7.5&nbsp;billion or more on the skills learning sector. The private sector already spends &#163;20&nbsp;billion because it reckons that too much public sector investment is academically based and not based on what is useful to business.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-18_para11">
<a name="stpa_205">A sea change in public opinion may be occurring. New Labour&#039;s success was its realisation that it needed to marry its belief in social justice with economic efficiency. That was the headline claim. However, buried in that message was a clear realisation that, however compassionate one wants to be, one cannot win elections in this country if one hammers middle class people. I am afraid that, increasingly, middle class people, who are faced with the largest tax burden ever, are beginning to wake up to the fact that they are being hammered. The inheritance tax that I mentioned increasingly bites into ordinary middle class homes.

One cannot achieve one&#039;s aims simply by setting new targets and more central direction. In 1999, there were 24,000&nbsp;managers in the NHS. In 2004, there were 37,000&#151;an increase of 55&nbsp;per cent. We have reached the limit of what we can achieve through central targeting and Government diktat. In health, funding, directed by the GP, should follow the patient into any hospital in the private and public sector. In education, funding should follow the pupil into any school in the public and private sector. That is my personal view and not yet the view of my hon.

Member for Darlington (Mr. Milburn) described as an asset-owning democracy. He has left his place, but that aspect of his speech was wonderful. Why do we believe in an asset-owning and property-owning democracy&#151;the great crusade of the 1950s&#151;if we do not apply that to health, education and pensions? The challenge that faces my party is devising realistic policies to achieve that asset-owning democracy.

<a name="60328-19_para4">
<a name="stpa_210">The Budget comes at the same stage of the political cycle&#151;when the Government are nine years into office and the Opposition are, I hope, destined to lose another two general elections&#151;as the 1988&nbsp;Budget delivered by Lord Lawson. I believe that this year&#039;s Budget avoids the macro-economic mistakes of Lord Lawson&#039;s 1988&nbsp;Budget, and we can draw an interesting contrast between them.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-19_para5">
<a name="stpa_211">The 1988&nbsp;Budget was based on three underlying assumptions: tax cuts were the best route to economic success; poverty, which was not even mentioned, could be solved by economic growth&#151;the rising tide would lift all boats&#151;and neglect of the public realm was an inevitable price that would have to be paid for private affluence.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-19_para6">
<a name="stpa_212">In place of those assumptions, the 2006&nbsp;Budget proposes three alternatives. First, public investment is not a drain on the good economy but a pre-condition of it. Secondly, Government have a specific responsibility to use the proceeds of growth to tackle poverty and not simply let the distribution of wealth and income fall where it may. Thirdly, public splendour, not public squalor should be the counterpart of private affluence in the fourth richest country in the world.
</p>

<p><a name="st_119"><a name="60328-19_spnew6"><b> Edward Miliband: </b> 
 I shall give way later, but I want to make some progress first.

</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-19_para7">
<a name="stpa_213">I want to say a little about each premise. First, there is a genuinely interesting argument about the right response to globalisation and the balance between tax cuts and public investment. The question is simple: should it be a rule of economic policy that public spending must fall as a proportion of national income to provide room for a falling tax burden? The Budget, with its emphasis on the Chancellor&#039;s long-term ambition for education, rejects that premise because Labour Members believe that the right sort of public spending can contribute to economic growth and will not hinder it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-19_para8">
<a name="stpa_214">To put the problem in the context of today&#039;s global economy, there is what might be called a &quot;race to the bottom&quot; model of economic development, whereby we should try to cut taxes as much as we can to be competitive. The problem with that model is that it cannot answer some basic questions about our country and our economy. For example, business makes representations about transport investment at every Budget. A skilled work force&#151;not only in higher education and schools but level 2&nbsp;and 3&nbsp;work force skills&#151;is important, and I welcome the extra money for schools in the Budget. The science base is an essential driver of innovation and enterprise. Again, I welcome the extra resources for science teaching in the Budget. The right policies for welfare to work, as well as child care and parental leave, are vital. I believe that there is now cross-party consensus that the good economy must be about gender equality, too, and that those policies are important.

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-19_para9">
<a name="stpa_215">We do not need to gaze into a crystal ball to see the effects of saying that public spending must fall as a proportion of national income, because that is precisely what we saw in the late 1980s and early 1990s, including under the stewardship of the right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe. By 1996&#150;97, net public investment was just 0.7&nbsp;per cent. of gross domestic product&#151;&#163;6.9&nbsp;billion at today&#039;s prices, compared with the &#163;27.5&nbsp;billion proposed for next year. That is the lesson of British economic history. It is public investment that gets cut when a squeeze in public spending happens, because that is where the easy and less noticeable cuts can be made. We end up paying for that in our economy, which will do badly in public infrastructure and basic education, as ours has done for many years. It is completely unclear to me how a small country such as ours&#151;as opposed to the United States&#151;can compete on that basis. That is why the right kind of public investment must be at the heart of our remaining competitive in the years ahead.
</p>








<p><a name="st_122"><a name="60328-19_spnew9"><b> Mr. Jackson: </b> 
 The debate seems to be coalescing around how we can achieve social justice. As we are getting into a history lesson, has the hon. Gentleman ever pondered the fact that his party voted against the greatest transfers of capital to working people in modern times, namely privatisation and the sale of council houses? Has he ever thought that one through?
</p>








<p><a name="st_123"><a name="60328-19_spnew10"><b> Edward Miliband: </b> 
 I personally think that that was a mistake, yes, although there was a legitimate issue about the replacement of council and social housing stock, and it remains an issue today.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-19_para10">
<a name="stpa_216">The second premise set out in my right hon. Friend&#039;s Budget was that poverty will not be solved simply by economic growth, and that it needs specific action. Given the increasing returns to skills and qualifications, the global economy has tendencies towards greater inequality. Our choice is either to accept this or to take action. The child poverty figures got a lot of publicity a couple of weeks ago because the Government missed their target of taking 1&nbsp;million children out of poverty. That is true and it is a matter of regret. It is why we must do more. That is why I welcome the new measures announced in the Budget last week, including the decision to index the child tax credit to earnings.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-19_para11">
<a name="stpa_217">I appeal for candour, particularly to the shadow Chancellor when he winds up the debate, if we are genuinely to tackle child poverty. The only reason why we have achieved what we have is because, in Budget after Budget, my right hon. Friend has taken specific measures to tackle child poverty. How do I know that? Because the figures show that by relying solely on the proceeds of economic growth and without his measures on tax credits, the number of children in poverty would have gone up by 1.5&nbsp;million. Instead, as a result of the measures that we have taken, the figure has gone down by 700,000. Child poverty is at it lowest point for nearly 20&nbsp;years. But hon. Members need not take my word for that. In a recent document published after the latest figures came out, the Institute for Fiscal Studies concluded:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_23">&quot;Child poverty has now fallen in every year since 1998/99, which is the longest period of sustained falls in child poverty since consistent data on relative poverty rate started to be available [in 1961]&quot;.</p>

 I commend the hon. Gentleman on his very thoughtful speech, but is he aware that that same report from the IFS makes it clear that, on the Government&#039;s present spending plans, they will not only miss their child poverty targets but slip even further behind them? So why has the Chancellor not committed more resources, if this is so central to his ambitions?
</p>








<p><a name="st_125"><a name="60328-20_spnew1"><b> Edward Miliband: </b> 
 If the hon. Gentleman is saying that we should make it a priority to put money into tackling child poverty as resources become available in the years ahead, I completely agree with him, and I am sure that the shadow Chancellor will have heard his representations.

<a name="60328-20_para0">
<a name="stpa_219">But where are the Opposition on this issue? The policy chief of the Conservative party, the right hon.

</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_24">&quot;Of course inequality matters. Of course it should be an aim to narrow the gap between rich and poor&quot;.</p>
</ul>

</ul>
<p>



</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-20_para2">
<a name="stpa_221">So presumably the Conservatives support the measures that we have taken. In fact, the shadow Chancellor has never, to my knowledge, said anything positive about tax credits. Indeed, he has spent most of his time saying we should cut tax credits. Of course, tax credits alone will not solve the problem. Active labour market policies, Sure Start and greater educational opportunities matter as well. It is fine to have a policy review, as the Conservatives are doing, but I do not see how anyone who genuinely cares about poverty can say in advance&#151;before their policy review concludes&#151;that public spending must fall as a share of national income. How can they make that decision before the conclusion of their policy review, if they care about poverty?
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-20_para3">
<a name="stpa_222">Finally, I want to talk about how we can match growing private affluence with a strong public realm. In 1958, in &quot;The Affluent Society&quot;, J.K. Galbraith wrote about the coexistence of private affluence with public squalor. It surely must be an aim of one of the richest countries in the world to show that this is not inevitable, and to create a public realm of which we can be proud.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-20_para4">
<a name="stpa_223">The figures on schools investment given last week by my right hon. Friend the Chancellor are striking in that regard. Capital investment in schools was about &#163;600&nbsp;million in 1996&#150;97, when the right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe was Chancellor; it has risen to &#163;6&nbsp;billion today, and it will rise to &#163;8&nbsp;billion by 2010&#150;11. Let us be honest: that &#163;600&nbsp;million was nowhere near what was required to prevent the condition of our schools from getting worse, let alone to improve them. I believe that we can see the difference that higher capital spending is making in all our constituencies.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-20_para5">
<a name="stpa_224">This Budget opens important new fronts in the Government&#039;s mission to rebuild the public realm. For example, I care a lot about the long-neglected issue of

<br>&nbsp;<br>youth spaces, youth clubs and youth institutions. We will never succeed in our campaign for respect among young people unless we give them decent spaces to which they can go. That is why I very much welcome the plan for a 10-year strategy for youth services. Of course that strategy must involve the voluntary sector&#151;something that the Conservatives care a lot about these days. It must also reform the youth service, and draw in resources from the private sector. However, it is simply folly to pretend that these services can be built without public investment. I give the Opposition credit for saying that they care about these issues, but I say in all honesty that if they will the ends, they must also will the means.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-20_para6">
<a name="stpa_225">Is not the Conservatives&#039; problem that, in 2006, their heads tell them that the philosophy of the Lawson Budget of 1988&nbsp;is no longer what the public want, and that they must bury it, while their hearts tells them that they must not? Fifteen years after Margaret Thatcher went, they still do not know whether to bury Thatcherism or to praise it. These are the contradictions that we now see exposed in their response to the Budget.

 It is a pleasure to follow the hon. Member for Doncaster, North (Edward Miliband), who made a thoughtful speech emphasising the steps being taken to alleviate child poverty. He took us back to the Lawson Budget. I remember that Budget: the top rate of income tax was reduced to 40&nbsp;per cent., and I think that I am right in saying that there was some movement in the House when that announcement was made.

But I also agree with those like my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke) and the hon. Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable), who say that if one looks behind that, there are some worrying signs. For example, much of the current growth is funded by either private borrowing or high public spending, neither of which is sustainable in the longer term. One would have hoped for measures in the Budget to replace those engines of growth with other more sustainable ones, promoting an export-led recovery, private sector investment and an increase in private disposable incomes through productivity. When the hon. Member for Twickenham spoke about an adjustment in a few years&#039; time, when the current engines of growth prove to be unsustainable, he put his finger on one of the more worrying long-term trends in the economy, which, in my view, the Budget did not address adequately.

<a name="stpa_229">I agree with the comment of my hon. Friend the Member for Rutland and Melton (Mr. Duncan) that if one wants to understand the overall impact of the Budget, the best thing to do is not to listen to it but to read the economic press about two days later, which gives a much better picture of what is going on. Any Chancellor must make a balanced decision between two imperatives: on the one hand, a pulverising if partial interpretation of the Budget to satisfy the audience in the Chamber, and on the other, a calmer more balanced interpretation from the wider world. We have moved too far towards the former. The selective presentation in Budget speeches is one contributory cause of the public&#039;s growing cynicism towards politicians, about which we are all concerned.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-20_para11">
<a name="stpa_230">Yesterday, that point was well made to the Treasury Committee by Robert Chote of the Institute for Fiscal Studies. He rightly identified 45&nbsp;policy decisions listed in the Red Book on pages 188&nbsp;and 189. Seventeen of those were listed in the Chancellor&#039;s speech. Those 17&nbsp;total &#163;553&nbsp;million, either in spending increases or tax reductions&#151;good news. Twenty-eight, however, were either not mentioned or mentioned in passing, and those, totalling &#163;780&nbsp;million, were the bad news. I want to return to one or two things that the Chancellor did not mention.

<a name="stpa_231">When my hon. Friend the Member for Tatton (Mr.&nbsp;Osborne) winds up, I hope that he will say that my party will vote against resolution 26&nbsp;on income tax and computer equipment, which withdraws the tax allowance to encourage employees to work from home. In the Red Book, that change appears under &quot;modernising the tax system&quot;. I am not sure why it appears in that category. If one wanted a justification of the accusation that the Chancellor was an analogue politician in a digital age, the withdrawal of that form of relief would be it. The relief was introduced only three

It promotes a better work-life balance, reduces the need to commute and travel into the office, and promotes a wider understanding of IT through having more equipment in the home. I cannot understand why, at two weeks&#039; notice, against a background of the Department of Trade and Industry promoting the scheme on its website, it is suddenly to be withdrawn. I hope that there might be second thoughts, and perhaps a postponement of the scheme for two years to allow the benefit to filter through.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-20_para13">
<a name="stpa_232">I want to focus on one of the items not mentioned by the Chancellor in his speech&#151;the cancellation of the pensioner council tax rebate. That has saved the Government &#163;1&nbsp;billion, but one will not find that figure in the Chancellor&#039;s speech or the Red Book. In the section, &quot;Fairness for Pensioners&quot;, I read:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_26">&quot;The Government is committed to tackling pensioner poverty and rewarding saving, and to enabling people to meet their retirement income aspirations in an ageing society.&quot;</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-20_para14">
<a name="stpa_233">There is no mention of the cancellation of the rebate in that section, but it does mention the continuation of the winter fuel payments, which are of roughly the same value, and highlights free bus travel. I find it amazing that the Budget decision that perhaps has the greatest impact on the highest number of people was mentioned neither in the Budget speech nor in the Red Book. It seemed to me that the withdrawal of &#163;200&nbsp;from every pensioner household not on benefit might be worth just a passing reference under &quot;Budget measures and their impact on households&quot;, on page 11&nbsp;of the Red Book, but it is not there. It is glossed over in paragraph 1.36, which looks back to 1997&nbsp;to give a slightly different perspective of what has happened to pensioners, in contrast to an earlier paragraph on families with children, which compares the position this year as against the previous year.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-20_para15">
<a name="stpa_234">What has happened since last year for the Government to change their view on the pensioner rebate? In the pre-Budget report before the last election, the Chancellor said:

</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-20_para21">
<a name="stpa_240">Last year, council tax had increased by &#163;525&nbsp;since 1997, when the Government took office. Against that background, it was worth introducing additional help of &#163;200. This year, the council tax has increased by &#163;579&nbsp;since 1997, but that extra help is suddenly no longer available. The Government boast that the average council tax has gone up by &#163;54, but not if one is a pensioner&#151;for a pensioner, it has gone up by &#163;254. That wipes out the increase in the state retirement pension for a large number of people. People wonder why there is any cynicism in politics. The most cynical decision that the Government have taken is to spend &#163;800&nbsp;million last year, just before a general election, on a &#163;200&nbsp;pensioner rebate, and a year later, when the council tax is even higher, to withdraw it and not even announce it in the Budget and the Red Book.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-20_para22">
<a name="stpa_241">Will the Chief Secretary answer two questions? First, when the Deputy Prime Minister agreed with the Chancellor the sum for block grant for local authorities last December, did the Chancellor tell the Deputy Prime Minister that he planned to withdraw the &#163;200&nbsp;rebate and therefore make the presentation of the council tax even more difficult? Secondly, was it not the case that, if the council tax was about to be replaced, the Treasury might have been able to afford the rebate for another year or two? It has now realised that the council tax will not be replaced, probably for the lifetime of this Parliament, and for that reason has decided that it simply cannot afford to carry on with the &#163;800&nbsp;million or &#163;1&nbsp;billion cost of the scheme.

<a name="stpa_242">When the Chancellor gives his next Budget&#151;I think that he will give another one&#151;I hope that it will include a measure to deal with the issue that I have talked about, and to deal with the more strategic issue of what will replace the council tax in the longer term, and how we will come up with a fairer system of funding local government.

<p><a name="st_129"><a name="60328-21_spnew0"><b> Mr. Michael Meacher  (Oldham, West and Royton) (Lab):</b> 
 The main Opposition speech today came not from their Front Bench but from the former Chancellor, the right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe (Mr.&nbsp;Clarke). He was at his most recklessly expansive, making Cassandra-like prophecies of doom. Many of his comments, however, were a bit rich coming from him. He said that the reduction in the growth of spending in future had not been made clear. In fact, it has been announced repeatedly that, after 2008, there will be a slowdown in the growth of spending after an unprecedented surge of spending over many years. He talked of fiscal drag, but fiscal drag has been used by all Chancellors, not least the right hon. and learned Gentleman.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-21_para0">
<a name="stpa_243">The right hon. and learned Gentleman said that spending Departments would have to make significant cuts in future years without knowing where the money would come from, but efficiency savings were imposed year after year after year by Tory Governments without Departments having any idea of where the savings were to be made. He referred to low growth of 1.8&nbsp;per cent. What he did not say, of course, is that that follows an unprecedented and unbroken run of high growth for

<br>&nbsp;<br>eight years previously. He made several comparisons with 1992, saying that the level of this or that was lower than it had been then. I remind the House that 1992&nbsp;is a very significant date: during that year, the Tory Government was unceremoniously pitched out of the exchange rate mechanism.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-21_para1">
<a name="stpa_244">The right hon. and learned Gentleman said that he did not know how the economy would bounce back. None of us can know, but we have heard the same thing time and again, and on each occasion the pessimism has turned out to be unjustified.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-21_para2">
<a name="stpa_245">After all that rumbustious, knockabout criticism, which I suppose we are meant to enjoy, the only remedy that the right hon. and learned Gentleman could come up with was his proposition that we did indeed need improvements in productivity and investment. Of course we all agree on that, but it is exactly what this Government have been doing for years, not least in the Budget.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-21_para3">
<a name="stpa_246">Let me now turn to a slightly more sober assessment of the Budget&#151;
</p>








<p><a name="st_130"><a name="60328-21_spnew1"><b> Mr. Kenneth Clarke: </b> 
 Of course there are years in which growth in spending must be constrained below the growth of the economy, and the beginning of the 14&nbsp;years of growth that we have enjoyed was accompanied by a long period of that kind, for which I was responsible. What I do not understand is why the Government put that in the Red Book and then deny that it is what they are doing, and why they attack the Conservative party vigorously every time we suggest that there is an urgent need to restrain the growth of public spending, as if we were doing horrendous damage to public services. The Chancellor is actually preparing to reduce growth in public spending below the likely rate of growth in GDP for several years following 2008, to remedy the problems that he has got into and the damage that has been done to the public finances since 2000.
</p>








<p><a name="st_131"><a name="60328-21_spnew2"><b> Mr. Meacher: </b> 
 We should certainly see what happens after 2008, but I do not think that we need any lessons from the Tory party about the level of public expenditure. If the right hon. and learned Gentleman could give the Government credit for achieving a much higher run of public expenditure over many years than we have had before, his prophecies of doom might carry rather more credibility.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-21_para4">
<a name="stpa_247">The Budget contained many excellent provisions, not least on education, but, surprisingly, one foundation of our national prosperity was not much mentioned. I refer to the state of our manufacturing industry. Prominent attention was given to knowledge-based services, but they account for only a fraction of total export earnings&#151;less than a third of the earnings from the export of manufactured goods. They pay for only a quarter of the expenditure on manufactured goods that we want to buy. Yet our manufacturing base, which is the lifeblood of the country, is in long-term decline, and that continues. Output continues to fall and we are losing 100,000&nbsp;jobs a year, without any prospect that the services sector will ever be large enough to compensate for the weakness of manufacturing. The facts are stark, and not just one Government are responsible. The position dates back over many decades. The share of manufacturing in total UK output has almost halved since 1979.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>28 Mar 2006 : Column 740</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-21_para5">
<a name="stpa_248">That is serious enough, but in recent years it has been accelerating. In 1970, fewer than 10&nbsp;per cent. of manufactured goods sold in the UK were imported; now the proportion is 60&nbsp;per cent. Whereas in other developed countries manufacturing output has been growing&#151;although, admittedly, less than the services sector&#151;the key point is that in Britain there has been not just a relative but an absolute fall in manufacturing in recent years. I do not think it an exaggeration to say that if those trends continued, manufacturing in Britain could almost face extinction within 30&nbsp;years or so.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-21_para6">
<a name="stpa_249">I am well aware that the decline in manufacturing jobs is seen in some circles as a sign of healthy efficiency rather than failure. Despite the avalanche of Chinese-made goods that is hitting western shops, the free trade lobby draws attention to the continuing expansion of manufacturing output in most developed countries. It recognises that jobs have been lost, but claims that that is because workers are replaced by new technology to boost productivity, while labour-intensive sectors such as the textile sector have given way to higher-tech ones such as IT and pharmaceuticals. Low-skilled jobs, they say, have moved offshore, while higher-value-added research and development, design and marketing have prospered at home.

</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-21_para7">
<a name="stpa_250">There are several things wrong with that argument. First, China and India are not dominant merely in low-tech sectors. They are turning out a third of a million new engineers each year, and are rapidly entering high-tech and service areas such as design, software and digital technologies. Moving upstream&#151;the current conventional wisdom&#151;will not escape Asian competition at cut-price rates.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-21_para8">
<a name="stpa_251">Secondly, where new jobs have been created in Britain over the past decade they have been largely low-paid, low-skilled and often part-time jobs in retail, catering, entertainment and care services.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-21_para9">
<a name="stpa_252">Thirdly, there is a regional mismatch. Manufacturing jobs have been lost largely in the north, while the expansion of business and financial services has been skewed to the south. There is a danger that continuing manufacturing losses, combined with the lack of any effective regional industrial strategy&#151;which we have seen in this country for about 30&nbsp;years&#151;will leave large swathes of the country outside the south and the south-east increasingly denuded of highly paid and attractive jobs.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-21_para10">
<a name="stpa_253">It is also worrying that Britain has been hit harder than other developed economies. After the oil shock of 1973, US manufacturing output has grown by about 120&nbsp;per cent. Ours has grown by 15&nbsp;per cent. US companies now achieve more than twice the production level since then with the same number of workers, while British companies produce about the same as they did before with almost half as many workers. Productivity here has been almost exclusively at the expense of labour-shedding, and I think that that is perhaps the biggest failing of the British economy over the past quarter of a century.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-21_para11">
<a name="stpa_254">How can that endemic failure be addressed, and how can de-industrialisation be halted, as I believe it must be? I think that the Government were absolutely right to identify the key problem as the well-documented gap between the productivity of the UK and that of its major competitors such as France, Germany and the United 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>28 Mar 2006 : Column 741</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>States. They have genuinely tried to raise Britain&#039;s traditionally low levels of skill, investment, research and development and innovation. Statistics show that over the past quarter of a century the UK seems to have closed the skills gap between us and the US, but there is still a significant skills gap between us and European countries such as France and Germany. Interestingly, in higher skills&#151;at university levels&#151;we just about match those countries, but we are still far behind when it comes to intermediate skills, by which I mean technical qualifications such as higher national diplomas. Many experts say that those represent the hinges of economic performance, and I think that they require more attention.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-21_para12">
<a name="stpa_255">Another area of chronic UK weakness that still remains is investment. Despite all the Government&#039;s efforts&#151;they have put in a great deal of effort&#151;Britain has performed significantly worse than all its main competitors in terms of capital investment per worker hour. A recent cross-national study found that German, French, US and Japanese levels were no less than one third to two thirds higher than the UK level. That is a massive gap.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-21_para13">
<a name="stpa_256">I accept that the UK record has strengthened markedly in the last decade. The quality of capital has also improved, which is important, and the impressive growth in information and communications technology investment has begun to have an impact on output growth. However, getting UK plc to invest adequately is still a big problem.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-21_para14">
<a name="stpa_257">Britain also continues to lag badly in R and D expenditure. Again, many studies have shown that such expenditure contributes significantly to productivity growth. Despite the Government&#039;s welcome and substantial encouragement of business R and D, not least in the Budget, Britain still spends far less of its GDP on R and D&#151;as much as 45&nbsp;per cent. less than Japan and the US. Moreover, it is a serious weakness that British R and D, such as it is, has been much too heavily concentrated on two industries&#151;defence and pharmaceuticals&#151;instead of being cascaded across industrial sectors, where technological capability is now more important than price competitiveness.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-21_para15">
<a name="stpa_258">Another factor is almost wholly ignored, which the Government should take on board. As the London McKinsey strategy consultancy recently commented, many UK manufacturers fail to implement management methods, including involving shop-floor workers in improving production, that rivals abroad have recognised produce results and have therefore taken on. Improving people management and working practices should be central to the Government agenda, rather than being treated as subsidiary to investment, innovation, skills and competitive labour and product markets.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-21_para16">
<a name="stpa_259">Another worrying point is particularly disturbing at present: Britain&#039;s current manufacturing weakness, combined with the Government&#039;s neo-liberal ideology, has exposed some of Britain&#039;s most prized industrial assets&#151;P&O, BAA, Standard Chartered Bank, Centrica, BOC and Pilkington&#151;to foreign takeover. There is absolutely nothing wrong with the occasional foreign takeover, but industrial jewels such as those have been auctioned off&#151;thus gaining, in effect, 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>28 Mar 2006 : Column 742</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>subcontractor status&#151;to pay off very large deficits. Losses of that scale at the highest reaches of industry need to be stemmed if Britain&#039;s overall national manufacturing capability is not to be irredeemably mortgaged beyond democratic control.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-21_para17">
<a name="stpa_260">Above all, if we think that market forces are paramount, let us look at the US. The US record has been built on not only unalloyed market forces, but on heavy R and D expenditure, channelled through the universities; on military Keynesianism; on Government procurement, as a protagonist for US industry; on a resort to protectionism, where foreign pressures become too great; and on a low dollar exchange rate to assist exports. If that is market ideology, we need more of it here.

 It is always a pleasure to follow the right hon. Member for Oldham, West and Royton (Mr. Meacher) and to hear in his speech echoes of what, in my youth, we used to call the alternative economic strategy, which is much needed even today.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-22_para0">
<a name="stpa_261">I was struck by something said by the right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke). Of course, it is true that economic policy has become slightly boring under this Government, although that could be to the Chancellor&#039;s credit. Balance of payments crises were enlivening, but that was of little cheer to the people who suffered as a result. Not even the Chancellor, with his considerable reserves of self-belief, would argue that he has abolished the business cycle. Crises may not be as cyclical as they were under previous Governments, but they are structural, sectoral and spatial.
</p>

<a name="60328-22_para1">
<a name="stpa_262">I want to talk about the pensions crisis, future and present, the manufacturing crisis, past and present&#151;it may not have much of a future, as the right hon. Gentleman has argued&#151;and the energy crisis that is looming on the horizon. I also want to talk about the north-south divide, which can hardly be called a crisis because it has been with us so long. Certainly, in Wales, we can trace it as far back as the collapse in coal prices in 1924. Despite its long pedigree, it is no less serious, and it has worsened under the Government&#039;s charge.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-22_para2">
<a name="stpa_263">Let me take pensions first. I am not referring to the looming deficit in the public sector pensions, which is obviously very much in the forefront of our minds today; I am talking particularly about the problem of deficits in the corporate sector that have clearly caused 85,000&nbsp;workers to lose their pensions over the past few years. Sadly, they have not been recompensed in full by the Government. There is a huge problem with pension liabilities in the private sector, and more and more companies are being pushed into bankruptcy, which is causing massive job losses. As a result, companies are increasingly diverting some of the money that would have been available for capital investment&#151;we have heard about the downward pressure on business investment&#151;to their pension schemes because of those liabilities.
</p>

<a name="60328-22_para3">
<a name="stpa_264">A large part of the problem is of the Government&#039;s making&#151;it is within their control&#151;and I am talking about gilt yields, which have reached absurdly low levels under this Government. Of course, the lower the yield with gilts, the bigger the pension fund deficit. Long-term 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>28 Mar 2006 : Column 743</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>index-linked bond yields are now at 0.75&nbsp;per cent. Although that is ridiculously low, it is, of course, very good news for the Government&#039;s Debt Management Office, but bad news for virtually everyone else: bad news for pensioners and for the companies that are facing huge problems.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-22_para4">
<a name="stpa_265">Of course, the Government argue that there is no clear evidence that increased pension contributions have significantly affected business investment in aggregate, according to the Budget statement. They argue that there is record profitability in the corporate sector, so it should have the resources even to cope with those higher demands. The problem is that profitability is uneven in the corporate sector. Many of the companies, particularly in the manufacturing sector, that have final salary schemes and are therefore coming under the greatest pressure do not have the profitability that is evident in, for example, the banking sector. That argument simply does not hold.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-22_para5">
<a name="stpa_266">The reasons for the problems with gilt yields relate to the fact that the Financial Services Authority has changed the rules on solvency for insurers, forcing them to hold more gilts, as a result of its interpretation of the bear market, and particularly to the introduction of the Pension Protection Fund, which, given the risk-based levy, is creating a huge incentive for pension funds to take on more long-term bonds, which are lower earning but lower risk. As a result, we have the bizarre position that the pensions industry is driving up the price of gilts, thus leading to lower yields.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-22_para6">
<a name="stpa_267">Of course, the pensions industry will suffer more than any other because of falling yields. We have a vicious cycle. The Government are not issuing enough bonds. Promises were made. The industry was expecting &#163;70&nbsp;billion in extra bonds, but got only &#163;63&nbsp;billion. The analysis of most independent observers is that there is a structural deficit of long-term bonds running into hundreds of billions of pounds, given the need of pension funds to take on Government securities.

<a name="stpa_268">There is an insatiable demand, which will drive down gilt yields even further&#151;thus driving more companies out of business, causing more pension fund deficits and possibly overloading the Pension Protection Fund, behind which the Government have so far refused to stand in the event of a major crisis. I hope that the Chancellor is not doing that because it is a source of long-term cheap finance. That would be an incredibility short-term policy, especially as the current position is not sustainable.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-22_para8">
<a name="stpa_269">The manufacturing position has been well outlined by the right hon. Gentleman, and I need not support his comments further. We have experienced a serious fall in the growth of business investment, as well as in spending on R and D. The Government have said that one of the key long-term determinants of productivity growth is the amount of capital investment per worker. As has been argued, there has been a sustained, long-term failure on the part of the UK business sector to invest capital. I was interested to hear in the Budget statement the figures on business investment, which now include private finance initiative capital investment. Previously, expenditure on the health and education infrastructure would have been included under Government investment; now, it is included under business investment. If one removes that element from the figures, it is clear that business investment growth is even

<br>&nbsp;<br>worse. We need to be absolutely clear that the &#163;10&nbsp;billion extra that is being included next year will distort the business investment figures.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-22_para9">
<a name="stpa_270">In addition to problems with manufacturing and the poor record on business investment, the transport infrastructure is very poor. Incredibly, this week&#039;s official figures show that on average&#151;I do not exaggerate&#151;roads in Wales are resurfaced every 97&nbsp;years. That is incredible. I can think of no other country in western Europe, let alone one in eastern Europe, that is in such a position. Moreover, there is the ongoing tale of UK workers with very low skills levels, problems with basic literacy and numeracy, and the problem of rising energy costs.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-22_para10">
<a name="stpa_271">All of that feeds into the growing north-south divide. The hon. Member for Bristol, East (Kerry McCarthy) referred to the Government study on English cities, published at the time of the Budget, which itself pointed out that the &quot;industrial powerhouses&quot; of the past&#151;Liverpool, Sheffield, Newcastle&#151;have found that


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_32">&quot;the transition to a knowledge-led service-based economy has not been easy&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-22_para11">
<a name="stpa_272">That is an understatement, if ever there was one. The report goes on to show that the problem is the &quot;over-dominance of London&quot; in the UK economy. We have been making that point ad nauseam for many years. Cambridge Econometrics&#039; figures, published this week, show that the situation is getting worse under this Government. According to its report, growth in the past nine years has been slowest in Scotland and in the north of England, where gross domestic product rose by 6&nbsp;per cent., rather than by the UK average of 24&nbsp;per cent., over the same period. That is a huge divergence in economic performance. It is only because of the downturn in the London financial services sector in the past three years that the divergence has not worsened.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-22_para12">
<a name="stpa_273">So what do we get? Because of recent problems with London&#039;s financial services sector, we get a report on the problems of London&#039;s financial services sector. Where was Government leadership on the problems of the manufacturing-based economies of the west and the north of these islands? We in Wales have experienced a net loss of 72,000&nbsp;manufacturing jobs since this Labour Government took office. Indeed, under their policies there has been a net loss of 7,000&nbsp;manufacturing jobs in the past year alone. They should not be sanguine about unemployment. Unemployment in Wales is rising twice as fast as in the rest of the UK&#151;a pattern that we will begin to see in all the regions in which manufacturing is still the economic base. Of course, the intermediate business services that serve that sector are also vital to our economies.

</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-22_para13">
<a name="stpa_274">Under this Labour Government, there are even 11&nbsp;UK localities that have seen a real-terms decrease in gross value added per person. That is incredible: 11&nbsp;localities are actually going backwards in real terms under a supposedly socialist, redistributionist Government. Four of the five localities at the bottom of that list are in Scotland and Wales. The stark message is that we will have less of the policy-based evidence-making that we have seen too much of under this Government. The UK&#039;s regional, local and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;national economies have become more divergent, more quickly, than even under the Government of Mrs.&nbsp;Thatcher.

<p><a name="st_133"><a name="60328-23_spnew0"><b> Mr. Iain Wright  (Hartlepool) (Lab):</b> 
 It is a pleasure to follow the hon. Member for Carmarthen, East and Dinefwr (Adam Price), whose technical expertise in these matters is obviously very great. I want also to pay tribute to the speech from my hon. Friend the Member for Doncaster, North (Edward Miliband), who unfortunately is no longer in his place. He took us back to the year 1988, which I remember very well. That year, I did my GCSEs, left school and met my future wife&#151;so it was not all good.

</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-23_para0">
<a name="stpa_275">I want to concentrate on how the broad macro-economic factors mentioned in the Budget will impact on my region of the north-east. With that in mind, I was particularly pleased that my right hon. Friend the Member for Darlington (Mr. Milburn) contributed to this debate, and I believe that my hon. Friend the Member for Bishop Auckland (Helen Goodman) is also hoping to catch your eye, Mr. Deputy Speaker.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-23_para1">
<a name="stpa_276">I warmly welcome the Budget&#039;s emphasis on addressing the drivers of productivity: improving competition, promoting enterprise, supporting science and innovation, raising skills levels and encouraging investment. Addressing these issues is a prime concern in my region. We in the north-east have reason to be optimistic, and given that it is my right hon. Friend the Chancellor&#039;s 10th Budget, it may be worth pointing out that in the past 10&nbsp;years we have seen a 10&nbsp;per cent. increase in the number of jobs in the region. The number of business start-ups is increasing and more young businesses are surviving&#151;at a better rate, in fact, than in any other region. However, we need to address the long-term structural weaknesses in the north-east&#039;s economy and our economic performance in relation to the rest of the country.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-23_para2">
<a name="stpa_277">Despite improvements, far too few people in our region are in employment. For example, unemployment in my constituency has fallen from 9.9&nbsp;per cent. in 1996&nbsp;to 4.6&nbsp;per cent. now, but that is still too high. Although the north-east has broadly the same ratio of working people to the total population as the national average, some 11&nbsp;per cent. fewer are economically active. It has been estimated that if the north-east raised the proportion of people in work to 80&nbsp;per cent.&#151;the Government&#039;s medium-term target&#151;its output would increase by some &#163;12&nbsp;billion. That would have a tremendous impact on the UK economy, but more importantly, it would transform the lives of the people of the north-east.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-23_para3">
<a name="stpa_278">Our skills profile is also relatively low. Despite real improvements since 1997, our region still suffers from appalling disadvantages at the lower end of the skills sector. More than a third of the working population have either no qualification or are qualified below level 2&#151;four to five percentage points below the rest of the country. As my right hon. Friend the Chancellor has rightly identified, globalisation and intense competition from the likes of China and India will make it increasingly difficult for those with low skills to be part of our economy. For economic reasons, but also for social and moral ones, we as a country need to move away from low-paid, low-skilled work. On reading yesterday&#039;s <i>Hansard,</i> I was particularly struck by the comments of my hon. Friends the Members for Coventry, South (Mr. Cunningham) and for Burnley 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>28 Mar 2006 : Column 746</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>(Kitty Ussher). I agreed with everything that they said in promoting manufacturing in the north-west and the midlands.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-23_para4">
<a name="stpa_279">The north-east still has a relatively high proportion of manufacturing industries and jobs. Speaking as a Member who wants the north-east to retain and build on its reputation as an area of excellence in manufacturing, I believe that the threat from China and India means that we will have to be even more innovative, and provide the world with higher value-added manufacturing goods. The region therefore has to be even more determined to improve its skills base, and to do so faster than other parts of the country.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-23_para5">
<a name="stpa_280">The third structural weakness is that our region&#039;s culture suffers from a relative lack of enterprise. Despite recent success, our region has significantly lower business start-up rates than other parts of the country. Both public-funded and privately funded research and development is disproportionately concentrated in the south of England. However, I hope that the expansion of R and D tax credits for small and medium-sized enterprises announced in the Budget will help matters.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-23_para6">
<a name="stpa_281">The culture to which I refer goes back decades. The north-east has suffered greatly from the legacy of heavy manufacturing decline. In the 20th century, towns such as Hartlepool did not have the cultural identity to encourage enterprise. Men such as my grandfather were part of a mass work force in the shipyards, steelworks and factories. Tens of tens of thousands of men&#151;they were predominantly men&#151;were employed to do the same thing, often for years at a time. Innovation, enterprise and creativity were not encouraged because they were not considered necessary.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-23_para7">
<a name="stpa_282">When decline came in the 1970s and 1980s, exacerbated by the policy decisions of the last Conservative Government, we saw mass unemployment and the subsequent social problems that accompany it. Culturally, the collective psyche of Hartlepool and the north-east found it understandably difficult to move on from the safe, risk-averse feeling of being part of a large work force to being risk-aware, innovative and ambitious, so I welcome the Budget announcements to encourage enterprise and instil a culture of entrepreneurialism. I agree with the excellent points in a similar vein made earlier by my hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, East (Kerry McCarthy).

</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-23_para8">
<a name="stpa_283">A local enterprise growth initiative&#151;or LEGI&#151;was announced in last year&#039;s Budget, to provide substantial sums to the most deprived areas to stimulate economic activity and productivity. The first round of successful applicants was announced recently and I was disappointed that Hartlepool was not included, although as my speech is about the north-east economy, I congratulate my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister and the Minister of Communities and Local Government, my right hon. Friend the Member for South Shields (Mr. Miliband), who secured LEGI funding. I hope that Hartlepool will be more successful in the second round of LEGI funding in 2007&#150;08, because I genuinely believe that my constituency, which has some of the most deprived areas in the country, requires that investment to boost activity, performance and productivity.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-23_para9">
<a name="stpa_284">I welcome the moves in the Budget towards enterprise education: the creation of the schools enterprise education network, the establishment of enterprise summer school 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>28 Mar 2006 : Column 747</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>pathfinders and the launch of the United States enterprise scholarship scheme for undergraduates. The argument that enterprise can be learned in a classroom may be sneered at in some quarters, but such schemes play a large role in embedding a can-do attitude and fostering an enterprise culture that provides young people with the confidence to start their own business or to suggest innovations in the workplace. In the long term, that must be good for the productivity of our economy.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-23_para10">
<a name="stpa_285">Closely linked to the enterprise culture is the need for high skills in the workplace. The Chancellor&#039;s emphasis on education in his Budget statement was absolutely right. Education is the route out of poverty and the real way to transform lives. The opportunity to receive a good education should not be based on who a child&#039;s parents are or how much money they have. My right hon. Friend was right to point out that increased investment in education makes a real difference. We need only look at my constituency to see that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-23_para11">
<a name="stpa_286">In Hartlepool, we have doubled spending per pupil since 1997. We have increased the number of teachers and doubled the number of classroom assistants. As a result, Hartlepool has achieved the fastest improving education results in the country over the last few years. The percentage of 11-year-olds achieving the accepted level or above in English has risen from 48&nbsp;to 79&nbsp;per cent. The percentage of 14-year-olds achieving the accepted level or above in maths has risen from 47&nbsp;to 75&nbsp;per cent. In 1997, only 30&nbsp;per cent. of children left school with five GCSEs at grades A to C; now, the figure is 53&nbsp;per cent. More students than ever are going on to study A-levels and going to university. So it is quite insulting that on the day of the Budget the shadow Chief Secretary said, on &quot;BBC News 24&quot;, that increasing state school spending was &quot;not the answer&quot;.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-23_para12">
<a name="stpa_287">My concern about those real improvements in education is that well-educated young people are moving away to university and being sucked into the economic powerhouses of London, the south-east and other cities, which means that towns such as Hartlepool are losing their foundation for ongoing economic success. A sense of place is vital to boost productivity and prosperity in deprived areas such as mine, and I hope that the initiatives announced in the Budget will do more to encourage people to stay in the north-east and grow businesses.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-23_para13">
<a name="stpa_288">Obviously, there is more to do, but I am encouraged by the progress made so far and feel passionately that the Chancellor&#039;s announcements last Wednesday will improve matters still further.

 During the general election campaign, quite a few senior citizens in Shrewsbury told me that they were tempted to vote Conservative but would actually vote Labour because of the &#163;200&nbsp;grant that they would receive towards their council tax.

<p>
<a name="60328-24_para0">
<a name="stpa_289">It now transpires that the &#163;200&nbsp;grant will be taken away. In Shrewsbury, council tax is due to rise by about 4&nbsp;per cent. this year, which will add &#163;50&nbsp;to the bill for an average band D property, so senior citizens in Shrewsbury will have to find an extra &#163;250&nbsp;towards their council tax bills compared to last year. That is a disgrace. How does the Chancellor expect senior citizens in Shrewsbury miraculously to find an extra &#163;250?
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-24_para1">
<a name="stpa_290">The Chancellor said a great deal about how he will help with concessionary travel, but Shrewsbury council officers say that the Government are not giving them enough money to provide it&#151;there will be a shortfall of at least &#163;200,000. That will have to come from the local council, which will have to raise taxes to meet it. On the one hand the Government take great credit for providing incentives, yet on the other, they shove the responsibility and cost of providing the services on to local authorities.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-24_para2">
<a name="stpa_291">I feel passionately about the Royal Shrewsbury hospital, which I have described in the past as my beloved hospital. It is &#163;30&nbsp;million in debt, with a strong possibility of 300&nbsp;job cuts there and at neighbouring Telford hospital in the coming year. I find that absolutely petrifying, as do my constituents. There are also threats to services.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-24_para3">
<a name="stpa_292">There was nothing about health in the Budget and the Chancellor has let the problem of NHS deficits go to the wall. He does not seem to want to take responsibility for them. In March 2005, when I was a Conservative parliamentary candidate, a delegation from the hospital visited me. It included senior consultants, doctors and medical practitioners, who told me, &quot;We are extremely concerned about the forthcoming financial deficits, but we are not allowed to raise our concerns publicly. We have been told that in the run-up to a general election we are to keep our mouths shut.&quot;
</p>

<a name="stpa_293">We managed to highlight the problem in the local papers in March 2005, but a year later nothing has been done to address it. I am about to say something controversial&#151;nobody has said this so far: we are all passionate about our country and we all want our Olympic contestants to do extremely well in the games, but when the Royal Shrewsbury hospital is &#163;30&nbsp;million in debt, my doctors and nurses face the sack and we have a crisis in the national health service, the Chancellor should not be giving &#163;200&nbsp;million to the Olympic team. Controversial. But that is how passionately I feel about the Royal Shrewsbury hospital.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-24_para5">
<a name="stpa_294">My second point is about carbon dioxide emissions. I am a member of the Select Committee on Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, which is looking into our obligations on CO <sub>2</sub>  emissions. The Chancellor has imposed a tax on 4x4&nbsp;vehicles and the Lib Dems have repeatedly campaigned about them, saying that they will tax 4x4s until the pips squeak. They fail to realise that many people in rural constituencies, living in villages such as Cardington, which is perched on top of a large hill, or running farms, need a 4x4&nbsp;to get around. 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>28 Mar 2006 : Column 749</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>So, the Chancellor is penalising hard-working farmers and families who live in rural areas. By imposing the tax, he is certainly not going to stop super-rich people in Westminster from buying those large vehicles.

<a name="stpa_297">The Chancellor of the Exchequer spoke about the moves that the Government are making to reduce CO <sub>2</sub>  emissions and meet our Kyoto targets.

I would have been far more impressed with the Chancellor if he had managed to bring to the House an agreement with the Chinese Finance Minister, Mr.&nbsp;Jin Renqing, and if he could convince him to take the matter seriously and to reduce China&#039;s CO <sub>2</sub>  emissions. If the Chancellor could present the House with a treaty that the Chinese had signed to reduce CO <sub>2</sub>  emissions, that would impress me. He is doing very little to make the Chinese more obliging on this matter.

<a name="60328-24_para9">
<a name="stpa_298">There was no help for public sector workers. As has been mentioned already, today we have had the largest strike since 1926. Many public sector workers in Shrewsbury are striking today and feel very concerned about the fact that their pensions are going to be changed. They believe that some of the things that are happening in relation to the pension changes are contrary to the law of the land. I am sure that those things will be tested through the courts. What a shame that that the Chancellor did absolutely nothing in the Budget to help those people. I recently saw a delegation of such people in Shrewsbury. Some of them are strong Labour voters, but they informed me that they will never vote Labour again, which greatly encouraged me.

<br>&nbsp;<br>farmers that I am setting up an all-party group on the issue. Some 70&nbsp;Members have joined from all sections of the House. I am glad that the Chancellor has just entered the Chamber. What a shame that he failed to say a single thing about our farmers and the crisis that British agriculture is facing. He is so obsessed with Labour strongholds that he fails to remember the crisis of our rural community. There was not a single extra penny for that, in a week when there have been calls for the resignation of Lord Bach, who has appallingly mismanaged the single farm payments scheme, which has had appalling ramifications for Shropshire and Shrewsbury dairy farmers. In fact, I know of only one farmer who has received his single farm payment so far. We were promised that the bulk of our farmers would receive their payments by the end of March. It is now the end of March and next to none of them have received their payments. Before the Chancellor leaves the Chamber, I hope that he takes on board my strong concern&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i> No, he is not taking it on board; he is leaving&#151;as usual.

I have many people coming to see me who have had to sell their parents&#039; home to pay for long-term care for them.

</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-25_para0">
<a name="stpa_301">Last November we held a conference in Bishop Auckland to examine the needs of the local economy, which is largely manufacturing based. We brought together small and large businesses, trade unionists, academics and policy makers to consider how to develop our manufacturing sector in an economy increasingly dominated by services and threatened by low-cost competition, and how we will ensure that workers have the skills needed to innovate and encourage entrepreneurship.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-25_para1">
<a name="stpa_302">I believe that active government can make a difference to local economic success. In the north-east we should resist the temptation to engage in special pleading based on relative economic weakness. Instead, we must focus on using the potential of local people, too many of whom are still workless and, as my hon. Friend described, lack the skills and confidence to succeed. We need to create a framework that encourages businesses to innovate, invest and grow. That cannot be achieved through a laissez-faire approach that assumes that the market will take care of everything. It requires active intervention by Government agencies to embed skills in the work force, develop transport and communications infrastructure, and strengthen business networks.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-25_para2">
<a name="stpa_303">At the conference, Professor Ian Stone of Durham university business school pointed out that 100&nbsp;years ago the north-east economy had all the qualities that we need now: leading edge sectors, a strong demand for products and services, high levels of innovation, dynamic industrial clusters, a skilled work force, high productivity and growth, and net inward migration of skills. Of course there are examples of that today, such as NETPark, on the border between my constituency and the Prime Minister&#039;s. It is a partnership between the local authority, the university and the private sector to promote new technology. None the less, we need to strengthen such qualities.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-25_para3">
<a name="stpa_304">George Cowcher of the North East chamber of commerce undertook an interesting survey of what manufacturing companies in my constituency wanted. Their priorities were work force skills, better transport infrastructure, less red tape, better business support and access to finance. Tommy Brennan of the GMB called for support for manufacturers and environmentally friendly technologies. I shall assess the Budget against those demands.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-25_para4">
<a name="stpa_305">First, on work force skills, the Chancellor of the Exchequer is surely right to increase resources in our schools. There has been a tenfold rise in schools investment since 1997, and the 50&nbsp;per cent. rise in schools investment next year will make a huge difference. For example, there will be a completely new school in the village of Byers Green, where teachers and pupils are now struggling in a 1915&nbsp;building. The extra money for science teachers and new science clubs will be welcomed both in the Glaxo plant in Barnard Castle in my constituency and in Bishop Barrington school, which I visited recently. The school has had one new lab, but needs another one. The Chancellor&#039;s approach will 

<br>&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>build on collaborations such as that in the north-east process industry cluster, which provides visits and science training for local schools.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-25_para5">
<a name="stpa_306">The new entitlement to, and grants for, further education for people up to 25&nbsp;will have a significant impact in my constituency. Bishop Auckland college is now getting a completely new building to accommodate the 60&nbsp;per cent. rise in students in the past five years.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-25_para6">
<a name="stpa_307">On transport infrastructure, County Durham needs better roads going south and north. The extra &#163;800&nbsp;million outlined in the Red Book is enabling the A66&nbsp;between North Yorkshire and County Durham to be dualled, which will both improve safety and cut business costs.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-25_para7">
<a name="stpa_308">As someone who used to run a small voluntary organisation, which is a sort of small business, I am sympathetic to calls from business for less red tape. I am sure that business will benefit from the new code for risk-based regulation and the proposals to introduce that in Europe, too.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-25_para8">
<a name="stpa_309">Manufacturers in my constituency said that they wanted business support and more streamlined one-stop shops. The growing role of the manufacturing advisory service, and a smaller number of business services offering more targeted support, represent the right way to go. There are young entrepreneurs in the north-east who will benefit from the national enterprise network of 200&nbsp;summer schools. Accessing finance for small and growing businesses can be hard, so the proposal to expand the R and D tax credit, the new tax relief for investment in venture capital trusts and the &#163;100&nbsp;million of new money to double enterprise capital funds are all welcome.

</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-25_para9">
<a name="stpa_310">The Chancellor of the Exchequer&#039;s proposals to support our renewables and energy efficiency industry will achieve three objectives&#151;our climate change targets, our obligations to the developing world, and the sustainable development of our manufacturing base. The new environmental research institute and the seed-corn finance for the first enterprise capital fund for the environment demonstrate the Government&#039;s commitment to action, which contrasts sharply with the position of Opposition Members. In addition to the 5&nbsp;per cent. biofuels quota, the increase in the duty differential for biofuels will be of particular benefit to Farmway&#151;a farmers co-op in my constituency engaged in its manufacture.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-25_para10">
<a name="stpa_311">As my hon. Friend the Member for Hartlepool said, in the north-east, labour market participation is below the national average. Sue Stirling of the Institute for Public Policy Research north believes that if we could get recipients of incapacity benefit into work, we would close the gap. There is already a successful pilot at the Bishopgate medical centre to support people back into work, so the proposals to reform the linking rules for incapacity benefit, which discourage some people from experimenting with taking jobs, are very welcome.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-25_para11">
<a name="stpa_312">Before the Budget, I met members of the Wear Valley pensioners association. One of the things that they most wanted to see was the extension of free bus passes nationwide, so I am sure that they welcome the &#163;250&nbsp;million that the Chancellor is providing for free bus travel nationwide next year. Such travel will be available to all 17,600&nbsp;pensioners in my constituency.
</p>

<p>

<a name="stpa_313">In February I visited Mr. and Mrs. Hodgson, who had benefited from a Warm Front grant. Improving energy efficiency is the best way of tackling fuel poverty

<br>&nbsp;<br>and meeting our climate change objectives, so I am especially pleased that the Chancellor has increased the number of households that will benefit by 250,000&nbsp;over the next two years.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-25_para13">
<a name="stpa_314">The people of Bishop Auckland are not focused on their own interests alone, however. During Fairtrade fortnight, many of them signed a petition calling for the Government to keep their promise to raise aid to 0.7&nbsp;per cent. of GDP, so they will be pleased by the increase in development aid set out by the Chancellor.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-25_para14">
<a name="stpa_315">Opposition Members simply fail to understand the significance of the Government&#039;s successes and long-term strategy for the British economy. Since 1997&nbsp;unemployment in my constituency has fallen by 41&nbsp;per cent., and it has fallen by 11&nbsp;per cent. in the country as a whole. Prudent fiscal and monetary frameworks have brought new stability to the British economy, and low inflation and interest rates enable businesses to plan and invest. That has allowed a steady programme of investment in public services. The Conservative party is committed to cutting public spending as a percentage of GDP, irrespective of need or circumstances. However, it will not tell voters which services it would cut. People need to know, because those public services not only improve our quality of life, but provide the skills and infrastructure for our long-term economic success.

<p><a name="st_146"><a name="60328-26_spnew0"><b> Mr. Stewart Jackson  (Peterborough) (Con):</b> 
 As I rise to challenge the received wisdom that we are living in a land of milk and honey, I confess that I am gatecrashing the Chancellor&#039;s glee club on the other side of the Chamber. I have unashamedly looked at the Budget through the prism of the way in which it will affect my constituents and my constituency. There is a chasm between the Chancellor&#039;s rhetoric and the situation in the real world for business and the public services, which I shall touch on later in my speech. Such rhetoric includes:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_34">&quot;Britain is better placed than ever to be the global economy&#039;s success story&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60328-26_para0">
<a name="stpa_316">and


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_35">&quot;Preparing Britain for 21st Century&#151;Challenge of Globalisation&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-26_para1">
<a name="stpa_317">I find it hard to reconcile those comments with a Chancellor who is imposing a social market model on this country and squandering the golden economic legacy that was left by my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke).
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-26_para2">
<a name="stpa_318">People have eschewed facts today, but facts are important, so let us consider the statistics. The tax take this year is &#163;490&nbsp;billion. Public expenditure is up by &#163;207&nbsp;billion since 1997. If one adds tax credits, as de facto welfare payments, into expenditure, 39&nbsp;per cent. of our GDP is going on public expenditure. There will be &#163;73&nbsp;billion of public borrowing over the next two years, and tax will be up to 41&nbsp;per cent. of GDP by 2011, or the equivalent of more than &#163;7,000&nbsp;a family.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-26_para3">
<a name="stpa_319">Businesses have been much lauded by the Chancellor, but business investment is at its lowest for 41&nbsp;years in cash terms. This country is 5&nbsp;per cent. worse off for capital equipment than Germany and the United States. 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>28 Mar 2006 : Column 754</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Output per worker has gone up by just 1.6&nbsp;per cent. in the past nine years, which is well behind the figure for the United States of America. We know that the Chancellor has had to downgrade his growth forecast constantly, but we should also remember that he has got the tax-take projections wrong in the last six financial years. As my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Rushcliffe pointed out, growth per output since 1995&nbsp;has, according to the university of Groningen, fallen behind France and Germany. We are something like fourth or fifth in the list of output and productivity in the G7.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-26_para4">
<a name="stpa_320">The Budget is also marked by a sleight of hand. We have heard nothing about the private finance initiative and the &#163;60&nbsp;billion that is off-balance-sheet debt. As my right hon. Friend the Member for North-West Hampshire (Sir George Young) said, we have heard nothing about the council tax bribe of &#163;200&#151;an urgent issue in 2005&nbsp;before the general election, which is suddenly less urgent this year. We are constantly told by Labour Members that this is a Budget for the future that tackles the big issues, yet we have heard nothing about the Turner report or the structural reform of pensions. We have heard nothing except briefing in a turf war by the Treasury against Lord Turner and others.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-26_para5">
<a name="stpa_321">Let me give one simple example of how the Government have done nothing for the most needy people in our society. The Alzheimer&#039;s Society has written that carers save the Exchequer &#163;57&nbsp;billion, but there is nothing for them except a slap in the face. They have been ignored.
</p>








<p><a name="st_147"><a name="60328-26_spnew1"><b> Martin Horwood: </b> 
 Does the hon. Gentleman agree with the policy of the Alzheimer&#039;s Society, and of the Liberal Democrats, to implement the recommendations of the royal commission on long-term care?
</p>








<p><a name="st_148"><a name="60328-26_spnew2"><b> Mr. Jackson: </b> 
 A policy review is being undertaken by my party. We have a realistic chance of being elected to government, unlike the hon. Gentleman and his colleagues.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-26_para6">
<a name="stpa_322">There are other gimmicks, too. The planning gain tax will be organised on a regional basis. Does that mean that my constituents in Peterborough, where there is high growth and lots of house building, will suddenly find that tax going to Thurrock, Great Yarmouth or other Labour-voting areas?
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-26_para7">
<a name="stpa_323">There was nothing about manufacturing in the Budget. I pay tribute to the right hon. Member for Oldham, West and Royton (Mr. Meacher), who has 30&nbsp;years&#039; experience in this place, and the hon. Member for Bishop Auckland (Helen Goodman) for talking about manufacturing. In my constituency, in a city famous for its railways and engineering, 4,500&nbsp;people have lost their jobs. Employment is down by 28.7&nbsp;per cent. Under this Labour Government, whose members constantly attacked the Conservatives throughout the 1980s for their record on manufacturing jobs, we have seen a reduction from 15&nbsp;per cent. of the economy to 12&nbsp;per cent. of the economy. That is not a record to be proud of.

</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-26_para9">
<a name="stpa_325">Reference was made to the impact of tax credits on the poorest in our society. There still is a 60&nbsp;per cent. marginal tax rate. If someone on the minimum wage has the tax credits taken away when he works, the basic rate of income tax and the tax credit removal, combined with national insurance contributions, will mean that he pays a 60&nbsp;or 70&nbsp;per cent. real marginal rate of taxation. That is not good enough.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-26_para10">
<a name="stpa_326">Yes, I pay tribute to the Government for at least trying to do something about child poverty, but the Chancellor should not forget the overall tax burden that falls on ordinary working families, not just the rich people in Chelsea tractors. I notice that the Chancellor paid tribute to the class war, keeping the &quot;red in tooth and claw&quot; leftist battalions on the Back Benches happy, but it was meaningless. It was student union gimmick politics&#151;I am not referring to the hon. Member for Leyton and Wanstead (Harry Cohen).
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-26_para11">
<a name="stpa_327">I shall concentrate on two areas. We hear a lot about health and how health spending is the great panacea that will solve the problem of the NHS and the infinite demand for health care, but there was not a word about health in the Budget. Health is now embarrassing. The Secretary of State for Health said just two months ago that the deficit was unlikely to be more than &#163;200&nbsp;million. That is typical of this Labour Government: they are only out by a factor of five, because by the end of the financial year the figure is more likely to be &#163;1&nbsp;billion.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-26_para12">
<a name="stpa_328">After nine years of the stewardship of the Chancellor, my constituency is losing 185&nbsp;NHS jobs. Decent, hard-working and professional people are being thrown on the scrapheap. We have a cumulative budget deficit of &#163;10&nbsp;million over two years. Three wards are closing. That does not take account of the crisis in NHS dentistry in my city. Older people, children and young families are all being denied preventive dental treatment. We know that the Chancellor is keen on dentistry. He can get his teeth fixed at extremely high cost as part of his Trinny and Susannah-style makeover in preparation for moving next door to No. 10, but unfortunately my constituents cannot.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-26_para13">
<a name="stpa_329">It is no good talking about gimmicks, such as paying consultants only a 1&nbsp;per cent. increase in salary. The Chancellor knows full well that there are only 34,000&nbsp;consultants, which is a drop in the ocean compared with the increase that he is paying to other health care workers. Together with things like the working time directive, &quot;Agenda for Change&quot; and the botched GP and consultant contracts, which overran by &#163;390&nbsp;million, that has brought a structural deficit to a majority of trusts. We need not even mention manipulation of the national tariff. I, and probably other hon. Members, cannot remember the last time the NHS so mismanaged the national tariff that it had to withdraw it and bring it out again.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-26_para14">
<a name="stpa_330">The hon. Member for Cambridge (David Howarth) will no doubt speak eloquently about the cuts in mental health services in Peterborough and Cambridgeshire. 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>28 Mar 2006 : Column 756</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Those are the most destructive cuts. Many of the young people affected by the cuts are vulnerable and need help. Their services are being cut hugely.
</p>








<p><a name="st_149"><a name="60328-26_spmin0"><b>The Economic Secretary to the Treasury  (Mr. Ivan Lewis): </b> 
 Will the hon. Gentleman give us a comparison of the year-on-year increases in NHS expenditure under the Government whom he loyally supported with the year-on-year increases that we have seen in the NHS?

<p><a name="st_150"><a name="60328-26_spnew3"><b> Mr. Jackson: </b> 
 Delighted to; obviously the hon. Gentleman has not been reading <i>Hansard</i>. For every year of the Conservative Administration, between 1979&nbsp;and 1997&nbsp;we spent 64&nbsp;per cent. above the rate of inflation, and for every week that we were in power we spent &#163;1&nbsp;million on a new capital project. He will have to ask a trickier trick question next time. <i>[Interruption.]</i> Those are the figures, if he wants to check them.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-26_para15">
<a name="stpa_331">On crime and policing, the Chancellor talks about police community support officers, but those are not fully trained policemen and women. They are decent civic-minded people who will do their best, but they are not policemen. We also hear about the regional forces that are being forced on our constituencies, allegedly costing more than &#163;550&nbsp;million, according to the Association of Police Authorities. The Government are going to fund that policy, possibly to the tune of &#163;150&nbsp;million, although no one wants it. It is a top-down approach. The police and local people are against it, but the Government have an arrogant disdain for local views and will go ahead with it anyway. As a result, we have to find &#163;400&nbsp;million from the council tax in my area and throughout the country&#151;&#163;400&nbsp;million that is not being spent on crime fighting or tackling drugs, violent crime or antisocial behaviour, because it is being spent instead on new badges, new buildings and new management structures. That matters.

<a name="stpa_332">Let me give the detection rates for my basic command unit, the northern division of Cambridgeshire. Some 53&nbsp;per cent. of sexual offences are detected, which means that 47&nbsp;per cent. are not solved; 15&nbsp;per cent. of burglary cases are detected, so 85&nbsp;per cent. are not solved; and 20&nbsp;per cent. of vehicle thefts are detected, which means that 80&nbsp;per cent. are not solved. That is after nine years of a Government who came to power saying that they were tough on crime and tough on the causes of crime.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-26_para17">
<a name="stpa_333">The Chancellor of the Exchequer is an old man in a hurry. Last week&#039;s Budget was a &quot;cones hotline&quot; Budget. It had no vision, it was full of bombast and hyperbole, and it was empty and vacuous. I note that the Prime Minister, even 12,000&nbsp;miles away, has got his betrayal in first, so the Chancellor may not move next door very quickly. The Budget is full of gimmicks, and although it does not have any price tags or time lines, it includes the much vaunted reannouncement of education spending. It fails the people of my constituency and, above all, it fails the country.

<a name="stpa_334">I am pleased that the Budget contains measures to tackle climate change, including an increase in line with inflation of the climate change levy from April 2007, the introduction of a new zero rate of vehicle excise duty for the small number of cars with the lowest carbon emissions, and a new top band for the most polluting new cars. It is incredible that the Conservative party, given its talk of consensus and its desire for green credentials, cannot embrace the levy, which is one of the biggest efforts in this country to tackle climate change. If the Conservatives think that a voluntary agreement would work, they are living in cloud cuckoo land. I urge them to get real and support the climate change levy.

 The gist of my speech is the measures needed to tackle climate change. At least the Chancellor has moved in the right direction, given the measures that I have already mentioned.

<a name="stpa_335">Aviation tax could be even more important than the levy. Figures from 2003&nbsp;on carbon dioxide emissions from fuel combustion show that international aviation and marine bunkers were responsible for 3&nbsp;per cent. of the world&#039;s total carbon emissions, or 223&nbsp;million tonnes. That figure has since increased substantially. I shall return to aviation tax later, but I wish to deal with the taxation of oil companies, which is a complex issue and is not often raised unless the Chancellor refers to it or it is mentioned in the Treasury Committee. My perspective, however, is different. One of the Chancellor&#039;s greatest achievements was the introduction in 1997&nbsp;of a windfall tax on oil companies that raised &#163;5.2&nbsp;billion, which was invested in the new deal&#151;an employment strategy that put many young people into work.

Their profits went up from &#163;14&nbsp;billion in 1997, which was a good year, to &#163;21&nbsp;billion per annum. We could have used the extra tax on their profits to improve skills training.

Secondly, the Budget refers to the continental shelf oil companies and the taxation regime is directed at them, but all oil companies are making huge profits on all their activities. An excess profits tax could be imposed on them without the petrol price having to be raised. If we do nothing with regard to aviation, we should do more in respect of individual travellers, based on the price of a ticket so that the rich pay more.

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>28 Mar 2006 : Column 760</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Twickenham (Dr. Cable) pointed out, there were disgraceful omissions from the Budget in those respects and also in respect of the NHS. I shall take each of those in turn.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-28_para0">
<a name="stpa_352">Education takes many forms, including the learning of IT skills. I am pleased that in the debate many hon. Members have mentioned the home computing initiative. There is a long history of using computers in my family and my constituency. My father, Don Horwood, helped to build the very first programmable digital computer, Colossus, during the 1940s at Bletchley Park. Bletchley Park became GCHQ and moved ultimately to Cheltenham, so there is a good connection.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-28_para1">
<a name="stpa_353">Many families are excluded from the IT revolution that took place during my father&#039;s lifetime, sometimes because of their low incomes and sometimes simply because of inexperience in IT. The home computing initiative was a valuable programme not only because it gave access to IT equipment, but because it improved the employment prospects of those on low incomes and their families, and increased the overall set of IT skills of the nation, thereby increasing our productivity&#151;another Budget theme.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-28_para2">
<a name="stpa_354">It is disgraceful that the home computing initiative was abolished in the Budget. That was not flagged up in the Budget statement, of course, but was buried in the small print. The home computing industry was not consulted or informed beforehand, despite the existence of an industry body, the home computing industry alliance. I have had angry e-mails from constituents who are in the industry and who are appalled that that was done at such short notice and in such a sneaky back-door way. It is a very unfortunate cancellation of a valuable scheme.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-28_para3">
<a name="stpa_355">Support for the NHS has been identified by other hon. Members as a subject that was not mentioned in the Budget speech. It is an outrage that it did not rate even a mention at a time when the NHS is in financial crisis. I do not represent one of those legendary 6&nbsp;per cent. of areas that are in deep financial crisis. I speak for an area represented by Cheltenham and Tewkesbury primary care trust, which, as my neighbour, the hon. Member for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown) knows, has been in financial balance. It is a three-star primary care trust. We have an acute trust, Gloucestershire Hospitals Trust, which is a relatively low cost provider of services, doing exactly as the Government wanted it to do. We even have a mental health partnership trust, which is a three-star trust hoping to apply to be one of the first partnership trusts to gain the much-vaunted foundation status. That is precisely the kind of area that should not be in crisis.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-28_para4">
<a name="stpa_356">Why, in that case, was it announced today that Battledown children&#039;s ward in my constituency will close as a 24-hour in-patient facility, despite pledges from all three primary care trusts and the acute trust last year that it would stay open? Why will St. Paul&#039;s maternity wing close in due course, and why will the Delancey rehabilitation hospital probably close? Why are adult mental health services to be rationalised, and a range of other services that were provided in both Cheltenham and Gloucester to be provided in only one place? I suspect that my neighbour, the hon. Member for

<br>&nbsp;<br>Cotswold, will be considering community hospitals and local NHS services in his constituency with some trepidation given the overall package.

</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-28_para5">
<a name="stpa_357">Why has that devastating news been delivered to the people of Cheltenham today? The answer is that the Department of Health got its sums wrong. Initiative after initiative, contract after contract and target after target have been inadequately funded by the Department of Health. The result has been the requirement for some &#163;29&nbsp;million of savings across the three PCTs in Gloucestershire and &#163;10&nbsp;million lost to Gloucester Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, even if it stands still on its current activity. That is an unacceptable attack on front-line services, and I agree with my hon. Friends that it could cost lives.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-28_para6">
<a name="stpa_358">I am grateful to you, Madam Deputy Speaker, for allowing me to leave the debate to meet the Secretary of State for Health tonight. I asked her why a PCT that is in balance and that has a low-cost acute trust provider is facing such cuts. She said, &quot;We can&#039;t take funds other than from the NHS to bail out the overspending PCTs.&quot; &quot;Can&#039;t&quot;? The Chancellor keeps telling us that he has 10&nbsp;years&#039; experience. Why &quot;can&#039;t&quot; the political will be found to protect services, even in the areas of the NHS that have been in balance and that have done everything that the Government have asked of them? Furthermore, those events are taking place while the threat of pandemic flu hangs over the NHS&#151;this is the very time when we should be looking at increasing capacity in the NHS, not cutting it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-28_para7">
<a name="stpa_359">Finally, the Chancellor claims to have produced a green Budget, but it is a very pale green. For all the Government&#039;s protestations, the simple fact remains that CO <sub>2</sub>  emissions are going up, not down. Today&#039;s conveniently delayed climate change review&#151;it is a shame that there was not enough time to produce it just before the Budget speech&#151;makes it clear that the climate change levy has been frozen since its creation and that it will be increased only in line with inflation from 2007. Let us hope that climate change itself proceeds only at the rate of inflation with six-year pauses, although that is unlikely because, as the evidence shows, while the Government are slowing down, climate change is speeding up.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-28_para8">
<a name="stpa_360">It is also disappointing that the Chancellor has only partially implemented Liberal Democrat policy by placing higher vehicle excise duty on the most gas-guzzling vehicles and introducing a zero rate for those vehicles that are the lowest consumers. However, the rate is feeble, and, as Conservative Members have pointed out, there is no protection for rural farmers who genuinely need such vehicles. Instead, the owner of a Porsche Cayenne, which the Environmental Transport Association lists as one of the worst offenders and which costs between &#163;30,000&nbsp;and &#163;50,000, now faces an extra bill per annum of &#163;30, which is rather less than the cost of one Porsche Cayenne windscreen wiper.

</p>

<a name="60328-28_para9">
<a name="stpa_361">At this point in my speech, I must declare an interest because, like the right hon. Member for Witney (Mr.&nbsp;Cameron), I have got the builders in to plan an extension to my house. I plan to install a mini-wind turbine, a combined heat and power boiler and solar panels, but I was surprised to discover that some of the grants that I was hoping to take advantage of under the

On an MP&#039;s salary, I may be able to afford to go ahead, but many others will not. Earlier in the debate, the Minister gave me a disingenuous answer on that point, because, although he discussed supporting microgeneration for the Government&#039;s own buildings, he&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;made no firm commitment on householder microgeneration. Microgeneration has huge potential to reduce emissions and fuel poverty, to lower fuel bills for a wide section of the population and to more than fill the gap left by the nuclear industry were we to decide&#151;rightly&#151;to decommission it completely.

<a name="stpa_363">I want to make a plea to the Treasury, the Chancellor and the Department of Trade and Industry to deliver a cross-cutting Budget. We should examine how the different measures in the Budget can be joined up across Departments and linked to partners on the ground. We have heard so much about issues such as social justice and child poverty, but we need the capacity on the ground to make the measures in the Budget a reality. That is my plea to Ministers tonight.

<a name="stpa_364">It is a privilege to take part in this debate. This is my right hon. Friend&#039;s 10th Budget and many other hon. Members have commented about how the public finances are now on a level playing field. It is so important to take that forward. I am a member of the Environmental Audit Committee which has examined the pre-Budget report and other Budgets for their green capacity. The Committee&#039;s reports always seem to conclude that the Government should do more, but that is true no matter how much Governments do. However, we should give the Government credit for the real step change in the Budget, especially in the chapter on protecting the environment.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-28_para13">
<a name="stpa_365">I welcome the progress on environmental issues. As the climate change review published today shows, there is still so much more that could be done. It is up to all of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;us to work collaboratively, whether through environmental improvements to our own homes, informing our constituents or getting our local authorities to adopt a leadership role on environmental issues. The Budget provides the foundations for real progress on environmental issues, not least in respect of microgeneration, at work, in schools and in all the public finance undertakings.

<a name="stpa_367">I was interested in the remarks by my right hon. Friend the Member for Oldham, West and Royton (Mr.&nbsp;Meacher) about the loss of manufacturing jobs. I wish to flag up our heartlands, especially north Staffordshire, where heavy industry is bearing the brunt of the globalisation that many other hon. Members have mentioned. It is vital that we do everything in our power to create new jobs, to support those who have already lost their jobs and to retrain and give new skills to those in low-paid jobs and who wish to move on. It is important that the review of Advantage West Midlands and the other regional development agencies that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry mentioned earlier looks at what manufacturing needs. We have the wonderful example of the Ceramic Industry Forum, which is looking in an innovative way at what needs to be done. The education maintenance allowance, which was piloted in Stoke-on-Trent, is another wonderful example, and it has now been rolled out across the country. I hope that other schemes can be piloted in Stoke-on-Trent and used to maximum effect across the country.

<a name="stpa_368">This is a Budget for the regeneration of the UK&#039;s towns and cities. I declare an interest because my constituency includes Burslem, the mother town of the Potteries. The &#163;65.5&nbsp;million announced this week by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister for Renew North Staffordshire will give us unprecedented levels of investment in housing, and I hope that it will unlock many different opportunities for jobs and retraining. It will give us an opportunity to have sustainable methods of construction and to implement on the ground the warm homes policy that was again mentioned in this Budget. If the Government take a cross-cutting approach, this will all add up to a complete transformation of homes and jobs in our area.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-28_para17">
<a name="stpa_369">I am pleased that the Lyons review was mentioned in paragraph 6.15&nbsp;of the Budget. Some 7,800&nbsp;jobs of the 20,000&nbsp;proposed have already been moved out of London and the south-east, so there are still 12,000&nbsp;to go. We have a site in north Staffordshire that could be used for relocation purposes under the Lyons review. It is a stone&#039;s throw away from the priority housing market renewal area, which would link up to Burslem. If the Government have the will, we can make it happen on the ground. The job losses that we face in north Staffordshire could give rise to opportunities for the innovative relocation of public services that would allow us to be a true engine of growth. That is the agenda that north Staffordshire wishes to convey to Ministers.

<a name="stpa_370">We have a wonderful resource centre that was originally launched by the Ceramic and Allied Trades union&#151;now Unity. It has a proud record of upskilling and retraining the work force in north Staffordshire, and has had European funding. The education maintenance allowance offers the Government a model for ways of dealing with those in the traditional manufacturing areas who are losing jobs. They need only look at this gem to see how such projects can be rolled out still further.

<p>
<a name="60328-29_para2">
<a name="stpa_376">On the first test, there are things to welcome, including more investment in reassurance policing, increased focus on youth services and increased investment in child care. There are local concerns about the long-term funding behind that package, but there are things to welcome. However, they are overwhelmed by two key omissions.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-29_para3">
<a name="stpa_377">First, there is bafflement in the local community at the silence about the national health service. Our local context is that we have two, much-admired hospitals, which have performed extraordinary feats at the cutting edge of cardiac care and cancer treatment. They are Harefield hospital and Mount Vernon hospital. Both face genuine uncertainty about their long-term future against the background of an overriding strategic imperative to cut beds in north-west London. Our primary care trust has a deficit of &#163;30&nbsp;million and the community is braced for announcements about real labour cuts that will cut deep into the local health community. Hillingdon residents are gradually realising that they can no longer rely on NHS dentistry, with the news that seven out of 10&nbsp;Ruislip dentists intend to quit the NHS.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-29_para4">
<a name="stpa_378">Financial crisis in the NHS underlies that theme, at a time of unprecedented investment. My constituents ask where the money has gone, who is responsible for the mess, who will sort it out and how that will be done. Was it unreasonable of them to expect the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the man with his hands on the levers of power, who expects to become Prime Minister, to explain at the Dispatch Box how the problems will be solved? He was quick to take the credit but reluctant to step up to the plate when the going gets tough. It is a test of leadership for a man who aspires to be Prime Minister, and he failed it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-29_para5">
<a name="stpa_379">A second concern is a failure to tackle a growing sense of insecurity in the community, especially among elderly people. Anxiety about the value of pensions is wrapped up in that but it is linked with concern about the rising costs of living, especially those associated with people&#039;s houses. Much has been made of the council tax, which is biting deeply, but rising utility bills and the costs of energy in the home are being talked about more loudly. Linked to that is confusion about the signals that the Government send about the need to set aside money for long-term savings. There is no more guilty agent of confusion in that mess than the Government&#039;s system of pension credit.

<a name="stpa_380">I am genuinely surprised at the Government&#039;s complacency in the face of the collapse of the savings ratio. I have even heard Treasury Ministers argue that that is a symptom of economic success. My concern arose when I visited the local headquarters of one of our main high street banks to find out what consumer attitudes were to pensions and savings products, and I was told, quite calmly, &quot;We no longer bother to sell them. The public don&#039;t want them. They aren&#039;t interested, and we don&#039;t make any money out of selling them.&quot; That is where we have got to. That is the culture, the language and the atmosphere around savings in this country, and I would suggest that it represents a structural problem in the economy that requires more attention than simply chucking some money into child trust funds, however welcome that might be. It is in the

<a name="stpa_381">The second test is to determine whether the Budget recognises what is needed to shore up the competitiveness of the British economy. It is generally accepted that that competitiveness has in the past been based on low levels of tax and flexible labour markets. It is becoming increasingly clear, however, that the management of the economy is now resulting in significant risks being taken with those advantages, the effects of which we might have to live with for some time.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-29_para8">
<a name="stpa_382">Other speakers have been more eloquent than I can be in pointing out the fault lines that are becoming increasingly evident: in terms of growth, we are at the bottom of the EU pack; our productivity growth rates are at their lowest levels since 1990; and our business investment is down to 9&nbsp;per cent. of gross domestic product.

<p><a name="st_161"><a name="60328-29_spnew1"><b> Mr. Love: </b> 
 Does the hon. Gentleman accept that the biggest factor in the competitiveness of the economy is the exchange rate?

<a name="60328-29_para9">
<a name="stpa_383">When the hon. Gentleman intervened on me, I was going through a checklist of the fault lines in the economy. We must recognise the indisputable fact that we are now living with the highest burden of taxation for 20&nbsp;years. It is not only the scale of the taxation but its incredible complexity that concerns my constituents. I understand&#151;my Front-Bench colleagues may correct me on this&#151;that some 3,500&nbsp;pages have been added to the Yellow Book since 1997, which is the clearest possible evidence of the instinct to tinker and to add to complexity. The bottom line is that, when I hear the Chancellor speak, I do not believe that I am listening to someone with any real understanding of what it is like to run a business or to take risks in the pursuit of prosperity and the creation of wealth. That is also the growing view of businesses in my constituency. Another test failed.

This ought not to be in doubt, because I do not think that anyone doubts the Chancellor&#039;s sincerity in his mission to reduce poverty in Africa. He must therefore be aware that the biggest risk to that agenda will be the impact of climate change on the poorer regions of this earth. As I have said, the Environmental Audit Committee is concerned about the institutional inertia and lack of momentum at the Treasury, particularly in recent years.

The problem with that incredibly complex process is that it is going too slowly, and that it is being held back by concerns about the cost of mitigating climate change. In order to accelerate that dialogue, progress and momentum, we need proof that we can grow our economy and reduce carbon emissions at the same time&#151;that we can green and grow.

We get incompetent management of key processes such as the definition of the national allocation plan in the first phase of the European emissions trading system. We get tolerance of inefficient taxation such as air passenger duty and a drift from the impressive momentum that the Government showed in terms of developing environmental taxation in their first Parliament between 1997&nbsp;and 2001.

They work extremely hard for a great deal less money than I earn, put in a huge number of hours and are a credit to their schools and the community that they serve. On that point, I welcome the additional funding going directly to head teachers to spend on the things that really matter to them&#151;IT, books and additional teaching resources. That money is very welcome, and I have to say that things have improved since Labour came to power nine years ago. Admittedly they should have improved, as Labour has spent a lot of money. When I visit my schools I see whiteboards and projectors, all of which have added to the educational experience of young people in my constituency.

<p><a name="st_171"><a name="60328-30_spnew8"><b> Mr. Walker: </b> 
 Of course I welcome additional investment in my constituency, if indeed it turns up. It is interesting that the Chief Secretary mentioned community support officers.

I would welcome any measures introduced by the Government&#151;or by our Government, when we win the next general election&#151;that reduced class sizes and gave children from some of the most deprived parts of my constituency an even greater chance of achieving success. I do not believe that that wish is party political; I believe that it is shared by all the parties. We want the very best for our young people.

<a name="stpa_395">Having got that off my chest, however, I would like to be party political. Like many other Members&#151;again, across the Chamber&#151;I was extremely disappointed that the health service did not get a mention in the Chancellor&#039;s Budget statement. We have huge funding shortfalls in Hertfordshire, caused by and large by Government mismanagement. There is, for instance, the mismanagement of GP and consultant contracts, as a result of which too much money has been given in return for too little. Of course I want GPs and consultants to be paid properly, but the money should have been based on an increase in output and productivity.

Of course, I want outcomes for breast cancer and heart disease to improve, but people with mental health problems need a strong voice as well, and it is incumbent on hon. Members to give them that voice. I urge the Chief Secretary to look at NHS funding. I appreciate that there is no bottomless pit, but the &#163;800&nbsp;million shortfall is damaging the most vulnerable people in our society. They are not responsible for the problem, but they will pay the price. That causes me great concern.

<a name="stpa_399">So I come to a solution. May we perhaps consider clawing back some of the money that we will give to the European Union in the years ahead? I understand that we will make additional contributions to fund the lifestyle of French farmers. I love France; I love French markets, but given the fact that our health service is in financial crisis, is it really justifiable to give more money to the EU and to some of the richest countries in Europe? That is a hard sell in my constituency, and I imagine that it might be quite a hard sell in other hon. Member&#039;s constituencies.

<a name="stpa_401">I should like to concentrate my brief remarks on science. This was a Budget for science. Whatever we might think of other bits of the Budget, science came out of it very well indeed. The additional supply of science teachers, the offering of pure sciences to more young people, new support for carbon capture and storage, replacing the research assessment exercise system and extending R and D tax credits were all things that I support, and my Committee&#151;the Science and Technology Committee&#151;was very supportive of those things, too.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-31_para2">
<a name="stpa_402">This was a somewhat unusual Budget. I, for one, was surprised by the extent of the changes in the Budget, and the associated &quot;Science and innovation investment framework 2004&#150;2014: next steps&quot; reads more like a science White Paper than a Budget document. I do not think that I was the only person who was surprised by the announcements. They came as news, for instance, to organisations that will be affected by them. It appears that the Particle Physics and Astronomy Research Council, the Medical Research Council and even some parts of the Office of Science and Technology were informed of the changes announced in the Budget only the day before. It seems that the Chancellor cannot wait to put his plans for science and technology into action and that he has even taken responsibility for reorganising the research councils. So if the Chancellor is now running science policy, I wonder what the Minister for Science and Innovation and the Office of Science and Technology have left to do.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-31_para3">
<a name="stpa_403">However, the real issue behind some of the changes announced in the Budget is: who in the Government is monitoring the UK&#039;s science capacity, and where and how? In the past couple of weeks, we have been debating the closure of the chemistry department at the university of Sussex and the loss in the past two years of four major chemistry departments, which produced the very chemistry graduates who will be among the 3,000&nbsp;such teachers in our schools in a few years&#039; time. I wonder who is monitoring the situation. It certainly is not the Higher Education Funding Council, which told my Committee last night that it had absolutely no plans to intervene in what is clearly a dire situation.

<a name="stpa_404">We recognise the huge investment that has been made in science&#151;the &#163;10&nbsp;billion provided in this comprehensive spending review is massive additional funding&#151;but although the money is going in, there remains a Luddite approach to many of our world-class science facilities. The Silsoe research institute, which has world-class expertise in agricultural engineering, and the Hannah research institute, which deals with nutrition, will close this Friday. Four Centre for Ecology and Hydrology institutions will close next year, at a time when environmental science should be at the heart of our agenda, instead of being trimmed at the margins. In the past 10&nbsp;years, one in three science posts in publicly funded institutions have gone. I hope that the

<a name="stpa_405">I do not dispute the right of research councils to say that we do not need a particular element of science in this or that institute; nor do I question the fact that at times institutes will have to close.

<a name="60328-31_para6">
<a name="stpa_406">The replacement of the RAE system was a welcome announcement. It was handled well and I compliment the Government not only on getting rid, eventually, of the RAE system, but on introducing the new metric system and running the two systems side by side. However, what our universities do not want&#151;I hope that the Minister will take this point on board&#151;is to be running a full RAE system in 2008&nbsp;and a full new metric system at the same time. Frankly, that would simply undermine much of what has to be done.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-31_para7">
<a name="stpa_407">The really interesting announcement in the Budget was the reorganisation of research institutes. We Liberal Democrats and my Committee are pleased that the wealth of information in the NHS database will be used for research purposes, but where did the announcement on combining the Medical Research Council and the NHS database come from? Who will lead the organisation? Will it be Sir Colin Blakemore, or somebody brought in through open competition? What resources will the organisation have? The Chancellor mentioned a figure of approximately &#163;1&nbsp;billion, but the amount spent on the MRC and on the NHS database combined comes to &#163;1.3&nbsp;billion. So does this constitute a cut in medical research funding? It would be interesting to have an answer to that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-31_para8">
<a name="stpa_408">Finally, will the Minister say what is happening with the restructuring of this country&#039;s eight research councils? It seems that the Treasury is doing something that nobody else knows about. It is proposing that the Particle Physics and Astronomy Research Council surrender its grant-giving duties to the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, and that it then merge its facilities with the Council for the Central Laboratory of the Research Councils, creating a new &quot;large facilities council&quot;. Whatever the proposal&#039;s merits&#151;I accept that there are some&#151;surely Research Councils UK should be doing such planning, not the Chancellor sat in the Treasury. Perhaps the Minister can reassure us on this issue.

The latest announcement about anti-TNF drugs is a life-saving decision for many sufferers of rheumatoid arthritis, which is a crippling disease. We need ring-fenced funding for those drugs, so that no one who needs them loses out in future. In the past, people have been denied them simply because of where they happened to live.

The news is welcome to the various women&#039;s groups throughout Northern Ireland, which will now be in a position, at last, to try to draw down that much-needed funding. The women&#039;s centres have been the sticking plaster of local communities throughout the years of the troubles. They do an amazing job in relation to education, preparing women to go back into the workplace, providing cr&#232;che facilities and so on. I pay particular tribute to the Ballybeen women&#039;s centre, which has done such sterling work over 20-odd years. I am glad that it will not have to go cap in hand looking for funding from various sources, but can avail itself of that much needed money to secure the work that it does in my constituency and throughout the Province.

 Since there appear to be no more Labour Back Benchers waiting to speak&#151;indeed, the Chancellor has not been praised for the past half an hour or so&#151;I suppose that I should start by giving some praise to the Chancellor for the work that has been done over the years. It would be churlish not to say that, in Northern Ireland, we now have the lowest rate of unemployment and are the fourth fastest growing region in the United Kingdom, and that there have been economic successes. I am not looking for a job, so I can say that without anybody saying that I have an ulterior motive.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-32_para0">
<a name="stpa_419">I fear, however, that the tightening that is hidden behind the Budget will affect that situation. Already we see the fiscal grip tightening on Northern Ireland. Regional rates have gone up, water charges are to be introduced and we are to have a charge for policing. Much of the economic success will be badly affected by the hidden tightening in the Budget. The Budget shows that the Government will face difficulties in the years ahead.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-32_para1">
<a name="stpa_420">Let us consider the meaning of the Budget for the United Kingdom as a whole. Perhaps the clue was in the give-away line when the Chancellor compared himself to Nicholas Vansittart. He may well have been looking back longingly to the days when that Chancellor was able to get 39&nbsp;resolutions through without any opposition. There were no Back-Bench revolts and there was nobody on the other side opposing the resolutions. On the other hand, Nicholas Vansittart was known for increasing the tax burden, complicated financial schemes for hiding the size of the national debt, paying considerable attention to affecting supposed economies and, of course, privatising naval and military pensions. Perhaps that is the real picture that we get from the Budget and the real picture of the current Chancellor.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>28 Mar 2006 : Column 775</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-32_para2">
<a name="stpa_421">I want to make three brief observations. Amid the financial machine-gun effect, with &#163;100&nbsp;million here, &#163;20&nbsp;million elsewhere, &#163;15&nbsp;million for microgeneration of energy, new boards for technology, and enterprise networks&#151;those things will be rolled out&#151;there are a number of worrying messages in the Budget.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-32_para3">
<a name="stpa_422">The first message is that when the Chancellor says that he gives, it does not necessarily mean that we receive. He announced that there will be more direct payments to schools, with the money for primary schools going up by &#163;13,000&nbsp;a school and money for secondary schools increasing from &#163;98,000&nbsp;to &#163;152,000. He said that the same increases would be announced for schools in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, but when the Secretary of State made the announcement for Northern Ireland, we found that a sum of &#163;16&nbsp;million would be spread among nearly 1,000&nbsp;schools, but that does not work out at &#163;13,000&nbsp;a primary school and &#163;54,000&nbsp;a secondary school. I suspect that there is a lot of spin in the Budget and many initiatives that are simply regurgitations of money that has already been spent, and I could give further examples of that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-32_para4">
<a name="stpa_423">Secondly, more money does not mean better services. I heard Labour Members taunting Opposition Members who wanted tax cuts by asking how they could have tax cuts without cutting services. The fact of the matter is that since the Government came to power in 1997, with &quot;education, education, education&quot; as their agenda, there has been a 47&nbsp;per cent. real increase in education spending, yet the Chancellor lamented in the Budget that there are still underachieving schools, people leaving school who need a second chance to get further education and A-levels and schools in which there are insufficient science teachers. Spending money has thus not necessarily improved services. In many cases, spending money has simply bloated bureaucracy. If the structures are right, it is of course possible not to take more in tax, yet still improve services. We had this debate on education the other week. If the right structures are in place, improvements can be made to services, even with less money.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-32_para5">
<a name="stpa_424">Thirdly, if problems are identified, it does not mean that answers are given. The Chancellor talks about the need for enterprise and a competitive economy. We know that in Northern Ireland because we are heavily reliant on the public sector. We have an open and small economy that does not have internal economies of scale, so we have to export and thus must be competitive. During the years of the troubles, entrepreneurs were forced out by gangsters and so on, so we lost the enterprise culture. The problems have been identified, but I do not see much in the Budget to address them. If anything, the enterprise culture will not be stimulated, and let me give one example to explain why. The tax burden on local companies will increase. The Chancellor could have considered reducing corporation tax&#151;we have seen the success of that elsewhere&#151;but he did not, even though there was consensus about it and evidence that it could have led to an improvement.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-32_para6">
<a name="stpa_425">I know that my time is nearly up, so I will conclude by saying that the Budget is not expansionary and will not address the problems that the Chancellor identified. Other hon. Members have pointed out that he has walked away from the great problems that face us, such as pensions and health. Many of the burning problems that the Government should be addressing have not 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>28 Mar 2006 : Column 776</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>been dealt with in the Budget, so although I accept that there have been successes, I have no hesitation in saying that this is not the Chancellor&#039;s best Budget. The Budget will not address the problems that face us.

 The right hon. Member for Darlington (Mr. Milburn) urged me to be generous to the Chancellor, even if he is not here.

He has beaten a record set by Lloyd George in a week in which the Prime Minister has returned us to the politics of Lloyd George.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-32_para7">
<a name="stpa_426">We have had a good final day&#039;s debate, although I am sorry that Labour ran out of speakers about halfway through. The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, who is not here now either, trotted out the Chancellor&#039;s litany of bogus statistics on investment, research and development, and productivity, and my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke) and my hon. Friend the Member for Rutland and Melton (Mr. Duncan) comprehensively demolished each one of them in their robust contributions.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-32_para8">
<a name="stpa_427">How on earth can the Chancellor claim that research and development is going up when the day after the Budget figures are produced showing that R and D levels are down? How on earth can he claim that business investment is up when his own Red Book revises down the forecasts for business investment and when business investment levels are at a record low? How on earth can the Government claim seriously that productivity growth is up when everyone knows that it has slumped?
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-32_para9">
<a name="stpa_428">There was an argument about which measure we should use for productivity growth. I am happy to use the one that the Chancellor himself used in 1998, based on output per worker, when he said that it was the

He described how impossible it is to measure the Government&#039;s claims on Gershon, and the National Audit Office report on that is striking. My hon.

I am happy to consider the idea, although I suspect that Sir John has his work cut out trying to get to the bottom of the Government&#039;s efficiency plans.

Friend the Member for Ruislip-Northwood (Mr. Hurd) gave an excellent speech on the Government&#039;s failure to address the seriousness of the environmental challenge that we face. Of course, when we look in the Red Book we see that the proportion of taxes raised through environmental taxation will fall as a result of the measures introduced by the Chancellor. My hon.

<a name="stpa_434">The right hon. Member for Darlington is a practised assassin. He began by covering his tracks by lavishing praise on the record of the Chancellor, then he stuck the knife in.

He knows that his speech will be seen alongside that of his colleague, the right hon. Member for North Tyneside (Mr. Byers), who attacked the Chancellor&#039;s extension of means-testing in yesterday&#039;s Budget debate. He hopes that his speech will be reported in the press tomorrow, because he was circulating it to the press lobby before he delivered it in the House.

<br>&nbsp;<br>history. It is higher than the last time we had a Labour Government, when half the country was on strike. Instead of following the advice of the right hon. Member for Darlington and reducing taxes, the Budget increases taxes still further. Some &#163;4&nbsp;billion of taxes on businesses and North sea oil were pre-announced in the pre-Budget report, the zero per cent. corporation tax rate that the Chancellor himself trumpeted in his 2002&nbsp;Budget has been abolished, and there are iniquitous retrospective changes to inheritance tax.

He confirmed that he is set to borrow &#163;175&nbsp;billion over the next six years. He has mortgaged not just today&#039;s taxpayers but tomorrow&#039;s, too.

On the same day as he delivered the Budget, the Royal Free hospital announced 500&nbsp;job losses; the day after, Darlington hospitals announced another 700&nbsp;job losses. A total of 4,000&nbsp;NHS job cuts have been announced in just three weeks.

How much more dishonest can one get than announcing before an election that pensioners will get a &#163;200&nbsp;cheque, then withdrawing it without a word of explanation after the election?

The Chancellor never told us that the Prime Minister made exactly the same pledge five years ago.

The new chairman is a Mr. Rod Aldridge&#151;a well-connected individual. In fact, he is so keen to get on with the job that he resigned from Capita the very next day.

<a name="stpa_447">Six years ago, the Chancellor embarked on his great experiment of abandoning prudence. He decided to increase public sector spending hugely, while blocking the reforms that were necessary to make sure that the money got to the front line. Six years later, if you want to see the result of what has happened, Mr. Deputy Speaker, listen to the Prime Minister&#039;s own special adviser on public services, who has worked at the heart of No. 10. When he was on &quot;Panorama&quot; two weeks ago, he said this:

<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_54">&quot;We&#039;re pouring money into the health service. We&#039;re pouring money into the education system. But we are not getting the quality of services that we expect. I think we&#039;re in a pretty disastrous situation&quot;.</p>

<a name="stpa_449">This is a battle over who is in charge of Labour&#039;s sinking ship. We have a Prime Minister on the other side of the world who admits that he was wrong to say that he was going, and we have a Chancellor who hardly dares leave the country in case he misses his chance again. So the Chancellor sits there reannouncing old promises on education, taxing more and spending more, painfully aware that so much money has been wasted.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-33_para13">
<a name="stpa_450">We are told that, unlike the Prime Minister, the Chancellor and his cabal are keen on establishing clear dividing lines with their opponents. Well, those dividing lines are emerging. We have a Chancellor who is addicted to taxation, and a growing consensus&#151;which includes the right hon. Member for Darlington (Mr.&nbsp;Milburn)&#151;that higher taxes undermine aspiration and damage Britain&#039;s ability to compete. We have a Chancellor whose answer to everything is to spend, and a growing consensus that money alone is not the answer. We have a Chancellor who opposes reform, and an alliance in this House that will vote reform through. We have a Chancellor who describes himself as &quot;a socialist&quot;, and a country that knows that a return to tax and spend socialism would bring this country to its knees. This Budget should have prepared Britain for the new global economy. Instead, we have a Chancellor who is stuck in the thinking of the past, when the country needs a modern, compassionate Conservative party, changing to meet the challenges of the future.

<a name="stpa_458">However, I wish to be fair. The Opposition have one economic policy that we know of, and that is their third fiscal rule. It is that over the economic cycle, and regardless of the needs of the economy or the country, public spending and investment must, as a matter of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;principle, always rise slower than growth. Indeed, today the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton (Mr.&nbsp;Duncan) described our rejection of the third fiscal rule as the dividing line between us. He is correct about that, because it would mean public spending &#163;17&nbsp;billion lower in the coming year and &#163;16&nbsp;billion lower in the year after. It would mean cutting spending in schools, cutting it in hospitals for doctors and nurses, cutting it in our transport system, and cutting our ability to invest in science and innovation.

 Of course, the hon. Gentleman, like many of his hon. Friends, made a bid for more money. I have to say that those bids for more investment were completely ignored by his Front Benchers.

<a name="stpa_469">A number of Conservative Members have alleged that the tax burden is now the highest in history.

The tax burden is actually lower now than it was for the entire period between 1981&nbsp;and 1988&nbsp;under Margaret Thatcher, and well below the peak tax burden in 1984. According to the experts at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the net tax burden on the average working family is half what it was when we came to power. As a result of all the tax and benefit changes that we have introduced, the average household will, from next month, be &#163;950&nbsp;a year better off in real terms than it was in 1997. According to Ernst and Young, the effective rate of corporation tax on British businesses is well below historic highs, down from 14&nbsp;per cent. in 1997&nbsp;to below 10&nbsp;per cent. today.

 Thomas Archer died in his father&#039;s arms on 30&nbsp;October 2005. Thomas, who lived a few streets away from me in Rugby, was a little over two years old, and died of a brain tumour.

</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-46_para5">
<a name="stpa_728">In July last year, Thomas became ill and displayed several symptoms that caused his parents concern, including substantial loss of balance. Twice during that month they took him to their local general practitioner&#039;s surgery, and twice an ear infection was diagnosed. Antibiotics were prescribed, but Thomas did not get better. Just before the family left for a holiday in France, Thomas was taken to an out-of-hours GP&#039;s surgery because his parents were still worried. Again, they were told that there was nothing to worry about. By that point three doctors had diagnosed mild illness, and all three were wrong.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-46_para6">
<a name="stpa_729">A few days after arriving in France, Thomas was taken to see a French doctor who recommended further tests. Scans revealed a life-threatening medullablastoma in his brain, which was removed the following day. Thomas returned home, but although he appeared to be making a good recovery while subject to chemotherapy, his parents were told on 14&nbsp;October that his cancer had spread throughout his brain and spinal cord. Thomas died just over two weeks later, some three months after the brain tumour had been diagnosed.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-46_para7">
<a name="stpa_730">Thomas&#039;s parents, George and Karen Archer, who are sitting in the Public Gallery, are determined that some good should come of their son&#039;s death, and it is due primarily to their courage and determination that I sought this debate. Karen and George have already managed to raise over &#163;15,000&nbsp;for the children&#039;s brain tumour research centre at Nottingham university. I pay tribute to them for that, and for what they have already done to raise awareness of this terrible condition. I also pay tribute to their friends and neighbours who did so much to make Thomas&#039;s last weeks special, even bringing forward Christmas when it became clear that he would not live to see it, putting up decorations early and arranging for artificial snow to cover the street where Thomas lived.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-46_para8">
<a name="stpa_731">Thomas was not, of course, the only child to die of a brain tumour last year. Approximately 100&nbsp;do so every year, and such cancers are now the cause of more childhood deaths than any other disease. The House has debated this important issue before, to the credit of my hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham (John Bercow), who, I am pleased to say, is in his place this evening. He secured an Adjournment debate on the subject on 26&nbsp;April 2004. I am indebted to him for the speech that he made on that occasion, and also to other hon. Members whose contributions highlighted the many aspects of treatment and support that children with brain tumours, and their parents and carers, so desperately need.

<p>
<a name="60328-46_para14">
<a name="stpa_737">I regret to say that there have been no such opportunities for childhood brain cancers to be debated until tonight.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-46_para15">
<a name="stpa_738">I do not seek to suggest that no progress has been made in the treatment of cancer generally, or that this debate should be used to condemn the NHS for failing Thomas Archer. I do, however, wish to mention two respects in which I believe that improvements may be made in terms of this highly distressing condition.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-46_para16">
<a name="stpa_739">First, there is the need to identify childhood brain tumours at an early stage more often. I recognise the great difficulty of diagnosing such conditions, the symptoms of which may be almost indistinguishable from those of other much less serious illnesses, and I cannot judge the general practitioners who failed to do so in the case of Thomas Archer. The fact remains, however, that a French doctor detected brain cancer where three British doctors did not, and, regardless of blame, we should investigate the reasons for that. I hope the Minister will be spurred by this case to think again about what enhancements to the education and awareness of, in particular, family doctors may be necessary.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-46_para17">
<a name="stpa_740">Secondly, on the importance of effective research, the Minister will know that the NHS spends less on brain cancers than on other cancers, leaving a gap to be filled by the voluntary sector. That, too, is a problem. I understand that national cancer charities spend less than 4&nbsp;per cent. of their annual research budgets on all forms of childhood cancer. Of course, I understand that the NHS in its current financial state cannot provide limitless resources for the funding of research into childhood brain cancers or, indeed, anything else. We must hope that some of the health research fund that the Chancellor announced in the Budget finds its way to such research. I understand too that, given the relatively small number of childhood cancers compared with adult&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cancers, there is bound to be a discrepancy in funding, although that compounds the problem, as pharmaceutical companies are also reluctant to invest for the same reason.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-46_para18">
<a name="stpa_741">There is, however, something practical that the Government can do to help without the need for substantial extra resources. If we look to medical science to provide new treatments for brain cancer in children, the worst thing that we can do is to put obstacles in the path of medical scientists. The strong view of the consultant who treated Thomas Archer is that the implementation of the European clinical trials directive has damaged such medical research.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>28 Mar 2006 : Column 827</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-46_para19">
<a name="stpa_742">I readily concede that the serious injuries recently caused to one group of volunteers shows the need for some regulation of clinical trials, but it is vital that regulation does not become counter-productive. A recent editorial in the <i>British Medical Journal</i> by two Finnish researchers, discussing the impact of the directive Europe-wide, said:
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-46_para20">
<a name="stpa_743">

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_254">&quot;at the outset many investigators were worried that the labour-intensive, bureaucratic and expensive endeavour of running a clinical trial would become worse. In particular, academic researchers funded by grants, who have so far performed most oncology trials, were worried that their resources might no longer suffice to meet the requirements of the new directive. A recent analysis of research since the directive suggests that many of those fears have been realised&quot;.</p>

<a name="stpa_744">The authors were referring to a report by the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer, which showed that clinical trial costs increased by 85&nbsp;per cent. and that insurance costs doubled, following the coming into force of the directive, resulting in a 63&nbsp;per cent. reduction in the number of new trials between 2004&nbsp;and 2005.

<a name="stpa_745">Those who suffer from childhood brain cancers cannot afford a reduction in research&#151;they need more of it to be done&#151;so I hope that the Minister will look again at the effect in the UK of the clinical trials directive and cut back on the paperwork, which is costing researchers too many precious hours that could be so much better spent. If those researchers can save more time, they can save more lives.

We all share that objective, and I ask the Minister to do all that she can to bring it about.

<a name="stpa_752">If I may digress for a moment, one thing is for certain: removing, or causing the removal of, excellent cancer centres that are working well, such as that in Southend-on-Sea, is part of the problem and will not be part of the solution.

I must first praise the children&#039;s hospice movement and the work of the Association of Children&#039;s Hospices and its wonderful chief executive, Barbara Gelb. Although I acknowledge that many parents want their children to be at home with them during what is a very difficult time, the children&#039;s hospice movement provides excellent respite care and support and enables families to go through this terribly difficult process with some dignity.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-47_para7">
<a name="stpa_754">The Prime Minister said two weeks ago in this House that the Government are looking at ways to improve the funding of palliative care. Children&#039;s hospices in particular need help urgently. They get so little, and many get no NHS funding at all. Their lottery money is running out, and beds will be lost and wonderful care and assets wasted unless the Government act now. Will the Minister write to me explaining how the children&#039;s hospice movement&#039;s loss of lottery funds will be replaced in the short term, and what longer-term funding structures for hospices the Department of Health is considering? I know that she cares deeply about these matters and will want fair play for these very poorly little angels.

<p><a name="st_468"><a name="60328-47_spnew1"><b> Mr. Bob Blizzard  (Waveney) (Lab):</b> 
 I rise to congratulate the hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth (Jeremy Wright) on securing this debate this evening, following as it does the debate initiated just under two years ago by the hon. Member for Buckingham (John Bercow), through which this important issue was brought before the House for the first time.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-47_para8">
<a name="stpa_755">I want to draw to my hon. Friend the Minister&#039;s attention the continuing work of the Ellie Savage memorial trust in my part of the country. Ellie Savage was a young girl, a constituent of mine, who sadly died from a brain tumour. In her memory, her family formed this charity. To date, it has raised more than &#163;150,000&nbsp;and it is using that money to fund a three-year research project into new ways of treating glioblastoma multiform, a most aggressive form of brain cancer from which Ellie sadly died. The trust is also piloting a rehabilitation programme in partnership with Addenbrooke&#039;s hospital. It is the first to recognise that although children who are recovering from brain tumours may have overcome the tumour itself, they can be left with devastating deficits. The trust wants to educate the schools and families of those children, so that they are best able to support them.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-47_para9">
<a name="stpa_756">The trust exists primarily to give financial support to families who suffer this tragedy. It is a question not only of caring for the suffering child, but of the unpaid leave that is sometimes involved in caring for siblings. The trust supports those families, including with travelling expenses.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-47_para10">
<a name="stpa_757">What the Ellie Savage memorial trust is asking for from the Government is more support for the research to which the hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth

<br>&nbsp;<br>referred, and that they also encourage primary care trusts to work in partnership with such voluntary organisations, particularly on rehabilitation. PCTs should be embracing these voluntary bodies and supporting them; that way, together, we can give these families some hope.

<p><a name="st_469"><a name="60328-47_spnew2"><b> John Bercow: </b> 
 I follow colleagues in congratulating my hon. Friend the Member for Rugby and Kenilworth (Jeremy Wright) on raising this issue in terms that were measured, responsible and dignified, yet at the same time quietly passionate.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-47_para11">
<a name="stpa_758">I should like, if I may, briefly to make a number of other points. First, there is now a substantial body of serious research that suggests that a combination of radiotherapy and the use of temozolomide can significantly enhance survival rates for patients newly diagnosed with glioblastoma. Ministers need to take account of that fact, to which they need to respond.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-47_para12">
<a name="stpa_759">Secondly, Roy Rampling, professor of neuro-oncology at the Western Infirmary in Glasgow is one of 36&nbsp;consultants and specialists who have written to the Secretary of State for Health to argue that the use of temozolomide and carmustine implants is effective and represents value for money. They are challenging the judgment of the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, which has made a preliminary recommendation against the use of such treatments. They, with their expertise, believe that is wrong.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-47_para13">
<a name="stpa_760">Thirdly, and finally, we have to take account of the views of those experts. Professor Rampling believes that the treatments to which I referred represent the biggest breakthroughs in the treatment of brain tumours in 30&nbsp;years. We are entitled to ask the Minister, in the most sincere terms, why between two and three times as many people are being treated with temozolomide in Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Spain. Their doctors obviously think it makes sense.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-47_para14">
<a name="stpa_761">My appeal to the Minister is that she will consider the possibility that a wrong judgment has been made, keep an open mind, and listen to the evidence. Could there be a better way for her to do so than to come before a meeting of the all-party group on brain tumours, of which I am privileged to be chairman, where she could hear the arguments from those infinitely more expert than I will ever be and be offered the opportunity to respond?

<p><a name="st_470"><a name="60328-47_spmin0"><b>The Minister of State, Department of Health  (Ms&nbsp;Rosie Winterton): </b> 
 I congratulate the hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth (Jeremy Wright) on securing the debate, which has highlighted the tragic case of Thomas Archer and the courage and determination of his parents. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will allow me to express my deepest sympathy to them. The fact that we have quite a crowded Adjournment debate shows the importance attached to the issue.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-47_para15">
<a name="stpa_762">Before I turn to the some of the specific points that the hon. Gentleman made, I shall provide some background information about cancers among children. In the difficult circumstances of the debate, this is difficult to 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>28 Mar 2006 : Column 830</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>say but, thankfully, cancer in children is rare and there have been remarkable improvements in survival rates over the past 30&nbsp;years. Some of that improvement has been due to technical advances and the centralisation of care in specialist centres, as well as the hard work of clinicians and researchers. Seventy-five per cent. of children with cancer can now be cured, but I recognise that although survival rates for children diagnosed with brain tumours have improved in recent years, they are not, as the hon. Gentleman said, as high as for some other childhood cancers.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-47_para16">
<a name="stpa_763">The hon. Gentleman gave an extremely moving account of what happened to Thomas Archer. I hope he will understand that it is extremely difficult for me to talk about individual cases, but I can assure him that I certainly recognise the need to ensure that the signs and symptoms of cancer are picked up as soon as possible so that a quick and accurate diagnosis can be made. To put that in context, a GP will see on average only one child under 15&nbsp;with cancer every 20&nbsp;years, yet they will see many children each week with a wide variety of symptoms that could be cancer. It is important to recognise that they have a difficult job to do. In April 2000, we tried to support GPs in that respect by issuing &quot;Referral guidelines for suspected cancer&quot;, which aimed to help them to identify patients, including children, who were likely to have cancer and so required urgent assessment.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-47_para17">
<a name="stpa_764">After the debate in 2004&#151;I pay tribute to the hon. Member for Buckingham (John Bercow) for initiating it&#151;the guidelines were updated by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence and reissued in June 2005. That had been raised during the debate. The guidelines include a section on cancers in children and young people and specifically try to address the signs and symptoms of brain tumours. The Healthcare Commission is currently consulting on how to ensure that those standards are implemented across the country, so that there is consistency. I fully appreciate that that will not be of comfort to Thomas&#039;s parents at this point, but I hope that it shows that action is in hand to ensure that GPs are alert to possible symptoms of cancer in children and are able to act accordingly.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-47_para18">
<a name="stpa_765">The hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth also raised the issue of research into brain tumours. Again, that issue was raised in the 2004&nbsp;debate. My Department has established the national cancer research network, which considers specialist research work on paediatric oncology. The network has a dedicated brain tumour group, which is currently running a range of studies on the diagnosis and treatment of brain tumours in children. Separately, my Department funds the childhood cancer research group at Oxford university, which maintains the national registry of childhood tumours. That is the largest population-based childhood cancer registry in the world. The Department also supports a senior clinical research fellow at Birmingham university to study a comparison of magnetic resonance spectroscopy and tumour genetics in childhood brain tumours.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-47_para19">
<a name="stpa_766">I know that we can always argue for more research into particular cancers, but I hope that I have been able to give some reassurance that particular research into childhood brain tumours is being carried out. Research into other childhood tumours can help our understanding in this area, too. I assure the hon. 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>28 Mar 2006 : Column 831</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Gentleman that I will ensure that the National Cancer Research Institute is aware of the points that hon. Members have made.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-47_para20">
<a name="stpa_767">In addition, the hon. Gentleman raised some concerns about the clinical trials directive. As he acknowledged, it is important that we have in place proper protection for those participating in clinical trials, because of the risk that the trials may pose to individuals. I can assure him that we will assess the effects of implementing the directive, including a consideration of whether it is over-bureaucratic, as soon as reliable evidence is available. I will certainly take up his offer to meet the doctors he mentioned.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-47_para21">
<a name="stpa_768">The hon. Member for Buckingham expressed concern about NICE&#039;s preliminary recommendations, in December, on the use of carmustine implants and Temodal in the treatment of newly diagnosed high-grade glioma. Those recommendations were subject to a period of consultation, which ended on 1&nbsp;February, and NICE&#039;s final recommendations are, as he said, expected to be published in August 2006. Those final recommendations can be appealed. NICE is an independent body, which we rely on to produce clinical and cost-effective guidance to the NHS&#151;based on the latest available evidence and having considered the comments that it receives during consultation. It is difficult for Ministers to comment on some of these issues, but I will certainly take up his offer to meet the&nbsp;group that he talked about. As I have said, the recommendation is not the final one and, in the meantime, primary care trusts have the discretion to fund the treatments outwith the final recommendations.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-47_para22">
<a name="stpa_769">Points have been raised in the debate about the way in which services for children with brain cancer are organised and staffed. Again, those points built on some of the issues raised in the 2004&nbsp;debate. In August 2005, NICE produced service guidance on how the NHS could improve services for children and young people

<br>&nbsp;<br>with cancer, including those with brain tumours. The national cancer director has established a group, which he co-chairs with the national children&#039;s director, to help to implement the guidance. The group will certainly consider several of the issues raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Waveney (Mr. Blizzard), especially the need for members of the voluntary and charitable sector, such as the Ellie Savage memorial trust, to work with the NHS. I assure my hon. Friend that I will ensure that the two co-chairs of the group are aware of the ideas that he put forward in the debate so that they can examine them closely.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-47_para23">
<a name="stpa_770">The hon. Member for Castle Point (Bob Spink) raised the issue of children&#039;s hospices. I am sure that he is aware that we made a number of commitments in our manifesto on how to increase palliative care, and we will make further announcements on the matter, including on children&#039;s hospices. I am well aware of the point that he raised and certainly undertake to write to him about it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328-47_para24">
<a name="stpa_771">I hope that I have been able to give some reassurance to hon. Members who have spoken in the debate and, indeed, to Thomas&#039;s parents, who, as the hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth said, have been campaigning, raising money and trying to raise awareness. It is tribute to everyone who has spoken in the debate that they have added to that awareness campaign. There is certainly still more than we need to do to improve services for children with brain tumours, but we have set in train several actions, which have arisen because of points that hon. Members have made in the House previously. I hope that those actions will bring about change in an area that anyone who has heard the debate will realise is extremely important and something that still tragically affects too many children and, of course, their parents.
