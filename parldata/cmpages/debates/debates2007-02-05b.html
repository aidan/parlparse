 The Government have ignored both the parliamentary ombudsman and the House&#146;s Public Administration Committee. Now the European Court of Justice has ruled that the UK pension rules offer inadequate protection for workers such as those formerly employed by Scarborough coach builder Henlys.

 No, that is not true. This is a serious issue, and I do not think that the hon. Gentleman&#146;s latter point was a serious contribution to the proceedings. We have put nearly &#163;2.5 billion into the financial assistance scheme to provide taxpayers&#146; money to compensate those who have lost the most when their occupational pension schemes have collapsed owing to employer insolvency. That is not an insignificant response; it is an extremely positive response. It is worth bearing in mind that there were no such public funds available to support people who were caught up in these terrible situations before 2004. In relation to the Henlys scheme, in which I understand the hon. Gentleman has a constituency interest, I can tell him and the House that 38 members of the Henlys scheme have been assessed for support by the financial assistance scheme, and 32 of them are now in payment.</p>

 I am aware of my hon. Friend&#146;s role on the Select Committee, and I remember clearly the day that I gave evidence to it. We have already published the estimates of the cost of a full compensation scheme, which we have made available to the House and outside. It would cost significantly more than the &#163;2.5 billion that we have pledged to it. The Government have tried hard to be supportive of those who have lost the most, but we must also be mindful that we are using public resources in a compensation scheme, so we have to balance what is fair to the taxpayer with what is fair to those who have lost the most. We have tried hard to strike the right balance.</p>

 So far the Government have, as we have heard, ignored the conclusions of the ombudsman and the recommendations of the Select Committee, and they have now been criticised by the European Court of Justice. Can the Secretary of State give us a promise that if, in the upcoming judicial review, the courts in this country find that the Government have acted unlawfully in rejecting the recommendations and the findings of the ombudsman, it will be time for the Government to do the decent thing and bring forward a fair compensation package for the individuals in question?

 Of course the Government&#151;any Government&#151;will follow the obligations imposed on them by the courts and the due legal process. There is no question of our doing otherwise. On Wednesday in the High Court we will argue our case very strongly with regard to the way in which we have responded to the ombudsman&#146;s report. In relation to the European Court of Justice case, it is worth reminding ourselves that the case is still continuing before the High Court in England.

Will he confirm, however, that the Government&#146;s commitment under that scheme is in fact to pay, without limit, top-ups to a defined benefit level, and that as yet, they know neither the total value of the assets nor the liabilities of the schemes? Does he therefore acknowledge that the total cost could be much higher&#151;or, indeed, much lower&#151;than the figure that he has cited?</p>

 I can assure my hon. Friend that I am monitoring the situation carefully. I now see monthly reports on the performance of Waveney council, because there is clearly a problem there. The council had &#163;1 million from us via the performance standards fund, and as a result it got its housing benefit administration up to about the national average in the early part of 2006. Since then, however, its performance has deteriorated sharply, which is having exactly the effects that my hon. Friend described. The council is now taking 64 days to process new claims, compared with the national average of 34 days. Officials in my Department met officials from the council last week, and made it clear that the council&#146;s performance was unacceptable and improvement was urgently needed. We cannot see any reason why its performance should be so bad, and it is about time that Conservative-run council got its act together.</p>

The biggest increase in error is down to customer error. I should point out that last year we recovered &#163;300 million from the overpayment figure that he mentioned. My Department and the local authorities are together aiming to improve performance in respect of error in housing benefit, and I shall be launching our part of the strategy with the local authorities this week. This is part of the broad counter-error strategy, which I launched last month, designed to reduce error losses across the whole benefit system by &#163;1 billion over five years.</p>

Additionally, pathways support for incapacity benefit customers will roll out across the city by the end of next year.

 A week last Friday, I was invited to speak at the launch of the roll-out of pathways to work in the Aberdeen area. It was an extremely good and positive event. People were very happy that pathways to work was coming to Aberdeen. However, as usual at such events, although some employers were present, there were not enough of them. What are the Government going to do to get employers involved in the whole process?

 My hon. Friend is correct. There are three elements to our welfare reform strategy. One is obviously the legislation. Another is how we have reformed the way in which we work, through Jobcentre Plus and various other programmes, especially in relation to disability employment. The third element, however, is the expectation of employers, which we are making a priority through our employers panels and by engaging with local employers and local employers&#146; associations, particularly in the small and medium-sized enterprises sector, where there are a great number of jobs to be had.</p>

Fraud is at its lowest ever recorded level, and it is half the 1997 level. It was cut by a further &#163;100 million just last year, and error was reduced last year by &#163;100 million.

We are not going to write off that debt, but it will be revalued, which is the sensible thing to do. I hope that we can recover about &#163;500 million, and we will actively pursue that. I agree with the right hon.

We have a stark and simple choice: we can either pursue what we think is recoverable and go at it hammer and tongs, or we can spend a lot of time and, I am afraid, a lot of public money, pursuing debt that we know is never going to be recoverable. That is the choice that confronts us. We have decided not to take the general power to write off debt, which is what Sir David Henshaw recommended, and we are going to give the CSA and its successor a range of tough, new enforcement powers that are unprecedented in civil debt recovery to break the culture of non-payment of maintenance which, I am afraid, has become widespread in our society.</p>

 Yes it will, and I think that we have to be clear, honest and straight with people about that. It is accumulating at that amount a month because of the accumulated legacy of debt over the past 15 years, which, with the best will in the world, neither the hon. Lady nor anyone else in this place or outside has a magic wand to deal with. We are strengthening the powers of recovery. We have taken legislation through the House to remove the six-year limit that restricts our ability to pursue debt. We are taking a number of steps to enforce debt recovery more successfully and intelligently. My understanding is that the hon. Lady and her party support our reforms of the CSA to make sure that we make further progress, and I am grateful to her and her hon. Friends for that support.</p>

We are tackling age discrimination through our &#147;Age Positive&#148; campaign, which promotes good practice and the benefits of an age-diverse work force to employers.

 That is absolutely right and it is exactly why the age discrimination regulations are so important. We try to communicate to people the benefits of having a work force with a range of ages because older workers bring all sorts of benefits, such as expertise and job loyalty. It is also worth noting that more than half the increase in employment overall has come from people aged between 50 and 69, and that more than a third has come from those over the state pension age. So real progress is being made in helping people to work for longer when they are older.</p>

 In tackling the problems of age-related discrimination in employment in the welcome way that the Minister describes, will he also pay particular attention to the need to tackle disability discrimination in employment?

That seems to be a potential statutory basis for the proposals that the Leader of the House is suggesting.</p>

 I have great regard for Lord Lester of Herne Hill&#151;I am very happy to revisit what he said&#151;but this is an issue on which senior officers and others in the Ministry of Defence are anxious, not because they want to bypass Parliament&#146;s decisions, but because they do not want to get into the situation that other European countries have got into and which I have seen, where there is amendment to the rules of engagement by the elected Parliament. That can lead to risible circumstances&#151;for example, some members of the NATO international security assistance force cannot do their job&#151;so we must be careful. When we are asking our armed forces to put their lives in harm&#146;s way in a number of theatres, we must be very careful to ensure that we take them with us, and that is something that my right hon.

<h3 align="center">Avian Influenza Outbreak</h3>
<a name="ordayhd_0"><a name="70205-0004.htm_ordayhd0"><a name="0702053000441"><h5 align="left">3.32 pm</h5>

 With your permission, Mr. Speaker, I should like to make a statement about the outbreak of avian influenza in Suffolk. Just after 5 pm on Thursday 1 February, the state veterinary service was contacted by a private vet who suspected an avian notifiable disease at a poultry farm in Suffolk. The farm near Upper Holton held 159,000 turkeys housed in 22 sheds. The vet raised concerns because deaths were taking place in one shed, containing 7,000 birds, beyond the normal frequency and rate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o6"><a name="70205-0004.htm_para0"><a name="0702053000157">My Department promptly enforced legal restrictions on the farm, so that no birds, people or equipment could move off those premises, preventing any possible spread of the disease. Arrangements were quickly made for a veterinary officer from the local animal health office to inspect the premises and take samples for testing by the Veterinary Laboratories Agency in Weybridge, Surrey.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o7"><a name="70205-0004.htm_para1"><a name="0702053000158">Preliminary results were received late Friday evening indicating the presence of avian influenza of the H5 strain. At that stage, the pathogenicity of the virus was not known. My Department issued a press notice and alerted the poultry industry, stakeholders and the European Commission. In line with contingency planning arrangements, local and national disease control centres were established.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o8"><a name="70205-0004.htm_para2"><a name="0702053000159">Further tests were carried out overnight, and based on the results received on Saturday morning, Fred Landeg, the deputy chief veterinary officer, confirmed the presence of H5N1 avian influenza. We imposed a 3 km protection zone and 10 km surveillance zone around the infected premises, to restrict movements of poultry and require their isolation from wild birds in those areas. In addition, we banned all bird gatherings&#151;including fairs, markets, shows and races&#151;across England, Scotland and Wales. The Great Britain poultry register was used to issue text alerts to all those registered.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o9"><a name="70205-0004.htm_para3"><a name="0702053000160">By Saturday afternoon, the Veterinary Laboratories Agency had completed further tests and were able to confirm that this was the highly pathogenic H5N1 Asian strain, which has spread widely in recent years. My officials had been working closely with our established group of ornithological experts to establish what a proportionate and risk-based response would be to such a finding. Based on their advice, my Department imposed a wider restricted zone covering east Suffolk and south-east Norfolk, an area of about 2,090 sq km. Within that zone, we are requiring poultry and other captive birds to be housed or, if that is not possible, to be isolated from contact with wild birds. The Opposition and local MPs were kept informed by my hon. Friend the Minister for Local Environment, Marine and Animal Welfare.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o10"><a name="70205-0004.htm_para4"><a name="0702053000161">On the infected premises, the humane slaughter of all the remaining birds began on Saturday under the supervision of the state veterinary service&#151;once the Health Protection Agency had taken all necessary steps, through medication and protective clothing, to assure the health and safety of those carrying out that work. I attended a meeting of the civil contingencies committee&#151;known as Cobra&#151;this morning and can  <br>

report to the House that we expect the culling to be completed today. Once the birds are slaughtered, the carcases are being transported under escort in sealed leak-proof lorries to a plant in Staffordshire where they are being rendered. Rendering involves the crushing and grinding of carcases, followed by heat treatment in a sealed vessel to reduce the moisture content and to kill micro-organisms. The leftover product from the rendering of the birds is then incinerated to ensure total destruction. There is full protection for workers at the site and the general public in the surrounding area.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o11"><a name="70205-0004.htm_para5"><a name="0702053000162">The Department of Health and the Health Protection Agency have been fully involved in our response throughout. All the people involved have been issued with personal protection equipment and are being offered the antiviral drug Tamiflu and seasonal human flu vaccination. In addition, seasonal flu vaccination has been available for poultry workers since early January. The risk to the general public is judged by health experts to be negligible. In particular, the Food Standards Agency advises that there is no risk in eating any sort of properly cooked poultry, including turkey, and eggs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o12"><a name="70205-0004.htm_para6"><a name="0702053000163">At this stage, we do not know how the disease arrived in Suffolk. A full epidemiological report will be produced by our experts as soon as possible and made publicly available. The state veterinary service is carrying out rapid and urgent investigations both on the infected premises themselves and by testing poultry farms and collecting dead wild birds in the protection and surveillance zones. Outside the restricted zones, our programme of wild bird surveillance continues, with 4,000 birds having been tested in the last five months alone. I urge keepers of birds to be vigilant and to exercise good biosecurity. In particular, it is important that they act quickly and contact their local animal health office if they suspect disease.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o13"><a name="70205-0004.htm_para7"><a name="0702053000164">From Friday afternoon, we have been working with the European Commission and leaders of the poultry industry and retail organisations, consulting them on the decisions that we have been taking and jointly tackling practical issues as they arise. That is in addition to my Department&#146;s regular communications with the wider poultry stakeholder community through e-mail, telephone conferencing and the website. We have also been in direct contact with poultry keepers using the text messaging system of the Great Britain poultry register. Further written communication will be issued today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o14"><a name="70205-0004.htm_para8"><a name="0702053000165">Experience from previous outbreaks in Europe, and in this country in the past, has shown that in all cases where disease was found in domestic poultry, the rapid action taken to restrict movements, to house birds and, above all, to cull all the birds on the infected premises, has eradicated the disease without further spread. I am satisfied that the response in this case has been rapid, well co-ordinated and appropriate. Contingency planning arrangements have been developed over the last five years in an open way. The first avian influenza-specific plan was published in March 2004. These plans are updated on a regular basis&#151;most recently in the updated plan that was published last December and which is available on the web&#151;and thus far they have proven their worth. Our goals in this case are clear: to stamp out the disease, to protect public health, to protect animal health and welfare, and to regain disease-free  <br>

 I thank the Secretary of State for the statement and for advance sight of it. I also thank him for the open and responsible way in which he and his Ministers have kept the Opposition informed of progress and have kept in touch with local Members. Clearly, this is a blow to the poultry industry, but it is vital that it does not become a crisis. I agree with the Secretary of State&#146;s four goals, set out at the end of his statement, and I suggest one more: to reassure the public that eating poultry is entirely safe. Is he in touch with retailers, for example, about that?</p>

Bernard Matthews has also said that it works to the highest levels of biosecurity. Does that not make the causes of the outbreak all the more puzzling? Does not the Secretary of State share my concern that one of his Ministers has already said that we may never know the exact cause? Does it not make it extremely difficult to know whether the Government are taking appropriate action to prevent further outbreaks if we do not know how the disease got here in the first place? </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o17"><a name="70205-0004.htm_para11"><a name="0702053000169">It has been suggested that the outbreak may be related to wild birds, but has there been any increase in the number of dead birds being reported in the last five months? What plans does the Secretary of State have to step up the surveillance efforts? Does he think it purely a coincidence that a Bernard Matthews-owned farm in Hungary should recently have been hit by H5NI? What steps is he taking to eliminate the Hungarian connection from the inquiries?</p>

What proportion of the total number of UK poultry owners does he believe is on the Great Britain poultry register? What stocks of H5N1 vaccination for humans do the Government currently possess?

<p><a name="stpa_o20"><a name="70205-0004.htm_para14"><a name="0702053000172">We all hope that the market for poultry products will not be affected by these events, but in the case of adverse market impacts, will the Secretary of State draw down the UK&#146;s entitlement to EU support funding&#151;something of great importance to an already beleaguered industry? What measures is the right hon. Gentleman taking to ensure that UK poultry exports will not be adversely affected? I have already seen a report that Japan has imposed a temporary ban on imports of UK poultry products.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o21"><a name="70205-0004.htm_para15"><a name="0702053000173">Thus far, we support the Government and their agencies, the police and local authorities who are working so hard to tackle this outbreak. We extend our sympathy to poultry workers, who naturally voice concerns about their jobs and their welfare. Above all, we need an answer to the question: how exactly did this disease get here?</p>

<p><a name="st_o109"><a name="0702053000174"><a name="70205-0004.htm_spnew1"><a name="0702053000568"><b>David Miliband:</b>
 I very much appreciate the tone of the hon. Member&#146;s remarks. His questions are wholly legitimate, and I shall try to go through them carefully.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o22"><a name="70205-0004.htm_para16"><a name="0702053000175">The question of reassurance for the public is obviously an important one. We are conscious that messages have to be clear, and we have been trying to work with the retail industry and the poultry sector to give clear and consistent messages. Fortunately, we live in an age when information is widely available through the internet and other sources. I fully endorse the hon. Gentleman&#146;s thanks to the long list of public servants who have been involved at all levels, and to people in private industry who have worked very hard with us in this effort.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o23"><a name="70205-0004.htm_para17"><a name="0702053000176">One of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s main points was about the causes of the outbreak, and he is absolutely right to say that getting to the root of it is a high priority. That is one reason why we have not dismissed any suggestions; we are pursuing all possible avenues of inquiry. It remains most likely that at the root of the problem there is a link with the wild bird population, but that does not mean that we should not pursue other avenues in a serious way, with the greatest of speed, and we are doing so. I will be happy to keep the hon. Gentleman and the House informed as the investigations by officials continue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o24"><a name="70205-0004.htm_para18"><a name="0702053000177">The hon. Gentleman asked whether &#147;quickly&#148; meant the following day. It certainly did not; as I said in my statement, as soon as the state veterinary service was informed of the difficulties, restrictions were immediately imposed, and the contingency plan went into action. He asked about the poultry register, and I am pleased to have this opportunity to tell the House, and hopefully through the House people more widely, that although there is a requirement on all those who own more than 50 poultry birds to register on the GB poultry register, it is open to all those with a smaller number of poultry birds to do so. If they do, they can avail themselves of the information that is quickly sent to all those on the register, and that would certainly be excellent. I do not have the figure that the hon. Gentleman asked for on the percentage of poultry owners who are registered, because, almost by definition, if they are not registered, we do not know whether they are there. We are confident   <br>

that at least 95 per cent. of British poultry is on the register. However, I understand his point, and from my point of view, the more people who register the better.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o25"><a name="70205-0004.htm_para19"><a name="0702053000178">I think that the hon. Gentleman may have missed something in my statement; I thought that I had made it absolutely clear that the Tamiflu vaccine was already available for poultry workers. We believe that that is the right approach, when combined with the wearing of protective clothing, which all our experts say is the most important measure, and the first line of defence. I am pleased to say that we are working with the trade unions on that, too. On compensation, I hope that he will understand when I say that our first priority has been to clamp down on the current outbreak, but of course we are keeping all options open in respect of future compensation arrangements.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o26"><a name="70205-0004.htm_para20"><a name="0702053000179">On exports, the most important thing that we can do is act in accordance with our plan, which is widely recognised as being of a very high standard. The hon. Gentleman mentioned the Japanese example, which I have heard about. I think that I am right in saying that the industry&#146;s export value is about &#163;375 million to &#163;377 million a year. The EU content of that is about &#163;280 million to &#163;290 million a year, so our first priority has been to ensure a secure line with the European Commission, and that has been done. Obviously we are working with those in Foreign and Commonwealth Office posts around the world to ensure that the message goes out clearly that we have very high standards, that we take the issue extremely seriously, and that we will stamp out the problem.</p>

Finally, if there are no further outbreaks, within what time scale does my right hon.

 I am grateful to my hon. Friend for making his points.

On Tuesday, the figure was 1 per cent., on Wednesday 3.6 per cent., and on Thursday 16 per cent. It was the leap to 16 per cent. that led the local vet, quite professionally and properly, to alert the state veterinary service. I am nervous of saying that there should be one figure below which everything is fine, and above which we would trigger full battle plans. In this case, the evidence presented   <br>

Any British Cabinet Minister must be somewhat wary of committing to French levels of largesse in public compensation. I am happy to debate that with those on the Opposition Front Bench, who have snorted at that prospect. I am encouraged by their new-found interest in seeking examples across the channel.

A test is carried out on the lorry before it enters the Suffolk area. It is then sealed after the carcases have been put inside, and a further test is carried out. The load is then transported to my hon. Friend&#146;s constituency with an escort. I can therefore assure her not only that every effort has been made, but that a foolproof system has been established.

I would not want to say that I foresaw rising numbers of incidents, not least because extensive measures have been taken by the Government and by farmers to improve biosecurity, to try to clamp down on that possibility. Equally, there are incidents around the world, so there are risks. It would be wrong for me to come here and say that there will not be any future incidents.

As I understand it, this outbreak occurred in a closed poultry unit. If that is the case, will the Secretary of State carry out a thorough review of biosecurity measures&#151;once lessons have been learned&#151;given that Bernard Matthews claims to operate to the highest standards in that area?</p>

Since last July, the Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department, my hon. Friend the Member for Enfield, North (Joan Ryan), and I have travelled the length and breadth of the UK discussing with front-line staff, as well as local business communities and public services, the way in which they think things should change in the years to come.

Secondly, we will provide new resources to help double the budget for enforcement and for the removal of individuals who break our immigration laws. Thirdly, we will introduce new technology to count everybody in and out of Britain. Fourthly, we will establish stronger international partnerships because, in an era of global migration, it has become impossible for nation states to manage the issue on their own. Fifthly, the Bill will provide new powers for the border and immigration agency, which will go live in shadow form on 1 April this year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o51"><a name="70205-0006.htm_para9"><a name="0702053000263">I addressed the matter with an open mind, but at a time when the terrorist threat to the country is so severe, I cannot justify a wholesale reorganisation&#151;and disruption&#151;of those agencies that are currently charged with securing our border. I recently visited the United States of America, which has embarked on such a reorganisation. Five years later, it is still not complete. Of course, when border agencies are reorganised, that simply creates another set of touch-points with agencies in-country. I think that one of the arguments that will emerge over the coming months is that, in our modern era of global migration and mass movement, it is difficult to separate the work of organisations that operate at the border from that of organisations that are responsible for in-country enforcement&#151;or, indeed, from that of agencies such as the Serious Organised Crime Agency, which are responsible for helping secure our borders overseas.</p>

It is part of an ambitious plan of reform that has been co-authored by many immigration and nationality directorate front-line staff. I do not believe&#151;and nor do our officers and other staff&#151;that we can secure our borders in this world of global migration without three measures: first, greater powers for front-line officers to help them secure the border; secondly, a concerted attack on organised crime, which might account for as much as three quarters of illegal entry into Britain; and, thirdly, a much more robust approach not only to detecting and removing those who are in the country illegally, but to attacking the causes of illegal immigration, which are the exploitation of vulnerable illegal labour by racketeers.</p>

I sent to him last week an example of the lack of such joined-up administration. Some people who were illegally coming into the country were stopped by the Port of Tilbury police. The immigration officials at the port of Tilbury said that it was a matter for Stansted, and when Stansted was communicated with by my Port of Tilbury police, it said, &#147;Let them go.&#148; That scenario powerfully demonstrates the need for one joined-up co-ordinated border police force.

 One theme that runs through the Bill is the giving of a wide range of increased powers to immigration officers. We are giving them more and more powers that are quasi-police powers, yet there are not the same sort of remedies for complaints against, and supervision of, immigration officers as there are for police officers. Should that not be considered in the Bill so that it is understood what someone can do if an immigration officer uses the new powers, because if a police officer were using them there would be a clear route for complaint and supervision?</p>

 My hon. Friend makes an excellent point. I shall come to precisely some of the protections that it is important to put in place in the next few months and in the years to come. However, there is a broader point that I hope he will welcome. If the IND is to become a stronger agency, it must become more open and accountable not only to this place but to the public. We propose to change the structure and pattern of regulation and inspection that the IND currently enjoys because I do not believe that 11 different regulators and inspectors are big enough and strong enough on their own to hold it to account.</p>

 I recently provided a parliamentary answer on that matter, and I will happily dig out the <i> Hansard</i> reference for the right hon. Gentleman. As he knows, in an island nation, there will always be ports that do not warrant 24-hour, seven-day-a-week cover. At the last election, I remember listening on the radio to the right hon. Member for West Dorset (Mr. Letwin), who is not in his place, as John Humphrys was interrogating him remorselessly on the plans for precisely how a ring of steel might operate. The conclusion that the right hon. Gentleman reached was, I think, the same as mine: that patrols of entry and of exit will have to be conducted on an intelligence basis, to a degree. Systems such as e-borders, which, through access to advanced passenger information, will assist us in counting people in and out, will help, but there will not be much of a substitute in the near future for intelligence-led controls.</p>

 As my hon. Friend knows, the Select Committee on Home Affairs, under successive Chairmen, has supported the broad principle of a border force. He has set out the reasons why he does not want to do that now, but would it not be sensible to use the Bill at least to align the powers of immigration and customs officers, so that our front-line staff at the borders have the same sets of powers and can be used interchangeably on different operations? Short of a border force, that would allow much more flexible use of our vital front-line staff.</p>

 It is possible, under the existing measures in the border management programme, to undertake a degree of alignment in operational capability, but the measures that we propose are a start towards introducing such alignment.

At the border, for the first time, we propose that immigration officers should have the power to detain individuals who are the subject of an arrest warrant or who may be liable to arrest by a police constable. The Bill recognises that the role of the immigration officer is changing and is increasingly important in the wider battle for security.</p>

Friend the Member for Walthamstow (Mr. Gerrard) asked about some of the measures on oversight that will become important in the months to come. We will need to modernise some of the guidance that is provided for immigration officers, at present set out in chapters 31 and 38 of their instructions. We will also have to develop statutory rules for short-term holding facilities, including for holding rooms. All immigration detention facilities are subject to independent oversight by Her Majesty&#146;s chief inspector of prisons. In addition, we have asked independent monitoring boards to set up mechanisms so that they may provide oversight too.</p>

Through this Bill, foreign nationals helping people to enter the UK illegally, for whatever reason, will no longer be able to hide behind the fact that they perpetrated their crime abroad. They now stand to be arrested should they come to the UK or to be extradited from abroad to face prosecution here.</p>

The issue of smuggling and trafficking is fundamental to the future of immigration control and I am glad that, over the past few months, right hon. and hon. Members on both sides of the House have made that argument. It is a field of work that demands international solutions. In the IND review that my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary launched last July, we committed to working jointly with European and international partners to tackle the challenges of global migration, including cross-border criminality. The Bill is, therefore, important in helping us to deliver some of those commitments because facilitation is often carried out by those involved in organised crime, including networks involved in smuggling other items, such as drugs, weapons or worse.</p>

 I welcome the provisions in the Bill to tackle those people who seek to make profit out of human misery or people trafficking. My hon.

They can return to their countries of origin only to fall into the hands of a different set of traffickers. Does his Department propose any measures that will prevent that cycle of repeat abuse?</p>

Other measures are part of our reform programme, whether that is the work that we are undertaking on the convention, which my hon.

that we seek to make in the IND and the border and immigration agency is not centralisation, but devolution. That is why we will produce proposals to regionalise the IND in the months to come.

He will have to give away some of his resources for the Prison Service to be managed.

 It will no doubt have occurred to my hon.

Will we have a situation in which somebody in Gravesend says, &#147;I can&#146;t come over because it&#146;s another region&#148;? Will a person in Rainham be unable to go down to Purfleet? The Minister&#146;s proposal fills me with horror. While he is at it, can he deal with the West Lothian question? Why do clauses 1 to 4 exclude Scotland? Surely the issue is not devolved.</p>

 Let me deal with my hon. Friend&#146;s second question first. The advice of the Attorney-General and of Scottish advocates is that the powers that we propose relate to devolved matters and would therefore require a Sewel motion. As there are only seven international ports in Scotland, compared with 44 in England, Scottish Executive colleagues have proposed an operational solution to the problem, which they have talked through with the Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland and with which I am satisfied.</p>

doing so. The Bill extends existing powers of search and arrest to the new offence of knowingly employing an illegal worker. It introduces new powers for immigration officers to seize cash suspected of being gained during the commission of an offence under immigration law. We ask, too, for the power to sell assets once we have seized them as part of a criminal investigation, following the forfeiture of such property to the Secretary of State by the courts.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o60"><a name="70205-0007.htm_para4"><a name="0702053000295">As we toughen the regime for businesses that break the rules, we must make it easier for employers to double-check who is who and who has the right to work. At present, that is too complicated. Up to 60 different documents could be proffered as evidence of entitlement to be in this country and to work, so clauses 5 to 15 would change that situation by phasing out insecure 20th-century forms of identification and phasing in a single biometric identity card for foreign nationals. The Bill therefore introduces powers to make regulations requiring those subject to immigration control to apply for a biometric immigration document. We will start to issue those documents in 2008 and roll them out incrementally thereafter.</p>

In fact, we will seek to phase them in over a number of years, beginning from 2008.

 The Minister made the point that the cards will be used in certain circumstances. Of course, the briefing notes and the research document suggest that the cards will be used in relation to nationality or immigration issues, but that could involve employment, access to benefits, health care, education, following arrest and on imprisonment.

 That is the foundation that the Bill will put into place. Obviously, the rules that govern the way that services are accessed are set out in different kinds of regulations and laws, which different parts of the Government have in place, but there are a number of services that require public servants to check whether someone has an entitlement to them&#151;good examples are the issuing of a national insurance number, secondary health care and certain local authority services provided under other immigration laws&#151;so we are seeking to put in place the power for both employers and public services to validate and verify whether the document belongs to the person who presents it and whether it is current and in force. The Bill provides an important platform, but it does not provide everything.

The Bill takes those measures forward in one significant way, by providing a statutory framework for triggering mandatory removal. With the Bill, subject to certain exceptions, a non-EEA foreign national who commits a serious offence as set out in an order made under section 72 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 and receives a custodial sentence will automatically be presumed to be subject to deportation, unless that would breach our international obligations. The same applies where a sentence of 12 months or longer is imposed for any other offence. I give way to the hon. Member for North Thanet (Mr. Gale).</p>

 The Minister will appreciate that this matter is of particular importance to Kent, as a front-line county. It was said earlier that 14 per cent. of the population of our prisons come from overseas. Clause 28 exempts anybody subject to a prison sentence of less than 12 months. Why? Why, in any event, are these people not deported immediately on conviction? I do not think that my constituents will begin to understand the Government&#146;s methods.</p>

 There is a balance to be struck. We have sought to approach the question in four ways in the Bill. We are ensuring that these procedures apply, first, to anyone who commits an offence that is listed in an order made under section 72 of the 2002 Act, and, secondly, to anybody who commits an offence that results in a 12-month sentence. The House needs to remember that there are then two further provisions available under the Immigration Act 1971 which are not being removed and which remain extant. First, a court may make a recommendation, and secondly, the Home Secretary may remove somebody he deems non-conducive to the public good. I give way to the hon. Member for Rayleigh (Mr. Francois).</p>

 I thank the Minister for his courtesy in giving way yet again. Bullwood Hall prison in my constituency is now used to detain foreign national prisoners awaiting deportation, but many of those people have been held beyond the expiration of their original sentence because of severe bureaucratic delays in processing the deportation paperwork. Will the Minister agree to review that process, not just the provisions in the Bill but the day-to-day working between his staff in the IND and their colleagues in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office who liaise with the receiving Governments, as it were? There is a bottleneck in the system, and it has to be cleared if we are to deport these people more swiftly, which is what everybody wants, including in some cases the internees themselves.</p>

 We are holding these people because the Home Secretary said that we would. If there are particular bottlenecks that the hon. Gentleman wants to bring to my attention, I will of course look at them in detail. Let me tell him, however, the cause of one of those bottlenecks. It is the current provision for a foreign national prisoner to appeal against the deportation order once it has been served. About 72 per cent. of foreign national prisoners who are served with a deportation order go on to exercise their right to appeal to the immigration appeal tribunal&#151;a process that is bureaucratic and cumbersome.</p>

Gentleman will support, is that the appeal must be heard from overseas. Where there are objections on human rights grounds, where someone challenges the Home Secretary&#146;s determination that they are not a British national, or where someone challenges the fact that they have been given a 12-month sentence, we will now be able to certify those claims as clearly unfounded, so that we maximise the number of appeals that are heard not in this country but abroad.</p>

 I take the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point, but I refer him back to my earlier remarks. There are four ways in which the automatic deportation provisions may be triggered. The first is by a section 72 offence; the second is by a 12-month sentence; the third is by a court recommendation; and the fourth is by behaviour that the Home Secretary deems non-conducive. There are a number of ways in which a criminal who is a foreign national may become subject to the automatic deportation provisions proposed in the clause.</p>

grips with the real problems. They do it because it gives Ministers a sense of usefulness, purpose and forward momentum&#151;a sense that they might well lose if they stopped to contemplate the reality of Britain&#146;s immigration and asylum system today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o75"><a name="70205-0008.htm_para8"><a name="0702053000345">Let us look at the reality. The second perspective in which the Bill needs to be seen is the impact of all the Bills passed by the Government on the real world. Let us consider the current efficiency of the Home Office and its immigration system. Let us look at what has happened in the past few months: the Harmondsworth riot, when, owing to rioting by inmates, 150 immigration detainees were bailed or freed from the immigration estate; the statement by the head of removals at the IND that he did not have &#147;the faintest idea&#148; how many people were currently living in the UK illegally; the admission by the Home Secretary that there are as many as 450,000 failed asylum seekers resident in the UK; the accusations of corruption at Lunar house at the IND&#146;s office, where senior workers were demanding sex from an 18-year-old girl in return for granting asylum; the discovery, also at Lunar house, that a member of an extremist Islamist group was working there unchecked by the Home Office; and perhaps most notorious of all, the fact that the Home Office itself was employing illegal workers.</p>

We need to measure the Bill against the scale of the current crisis. The Bill contains some measures that might be useful, some that might be damaging and some that will have no practical effect whatsoever. It has, as I think the Minister would admit in his private moments, no central purpose or theme. It is a rag-bag of largely unconnected measures.</p>

 Although I share some of the concerns that the hon.

It is the part dealing with the deportation of criminals, starting with clause 28, which is headed &#147;Automatic deportation&#148;. I assume that this is an attempt to justify the Prime Minister&#146;s promise on the subject, when he said in the House on 3 May 2006 that</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o79"><a name="70205-0008.htm_para12"><a name="0702053000362">Having read the Bill, I believe that the honest title of this clause should be &#147;Automatic deportation, except when it isn&#146;t&#148;. This section is a result of the Home Office having one of its tabloid moments, hoping that if it talks tough, it will not matter that nothing much is actually going to change.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o80"><a name="70205-0008.htm_para13"><a name="0702053000363">Let us investigate the reality. The Lord Chancellor has already blown the gaff. He has admitted that the Prime Minister&#146;s claims that there would be automatic deportation were false. He said on the &#147;Dimbleby&#148; programme last year:</p>
<a name="70205-0008.htm_brev2"><a name="0702053000429"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;There are obviously offences where it&#146;s imprisonable but sometimes a very, very minor offence is committed which wouldn&#146;t remotely justify deportation in every circumstance&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o82"><a name="70205-0008.htm_para15"><a name="0702053000365">Let us look at a practical example. The Minister has discussed the foreign prisoners in our prisons, who represent 14 per cent. of the total prison population. Problems with the 10,000 or so foreign prisoners who were in our prisons at the end of 2005 were the cause of the sacking of the previous Home Secretary, and I am sure that the present Home Secretary would be keen to ease the prison overcrowding crisis by getting them out of our jails. Perhaps the Minister can tell us how many of the 10,000 would be automatically deported under the Bill.</p>

 Our estimates for this year, for example, are that those who might be affected by the 12-month sentence clause might total 2,200, and those who might have committed an offence that is eligible under a section 72 order might total 2,100. I think that the hon. Gentleman would admit that, together, that amounts to a considerable number.</p>

 My hon. Friend&#146;s constituents&#151;and those of all right hon. and hon. Members on both sides of the House&#151;will have a huge amount of sympathy with that point. It is impossible to explain why that should so often be the case. It is important to consider, when we look at this part of the Bill, that when the Government claim that they are doing something radical, different and tough, they simply are not. More than half the prisoners in jail in Britain at the moment will not be affected by this measure.</p>

 That is not the case. Some will be serving a sentence that is not coming to its conclusion. In addition, there will be those who have been recommended for deportation by a court. On top of that, there will be those who, under guidance, the Home Secretary can deem non-conducive. So actually the number will be significantly higher.</p>

 Nothing that the Minister has said alters his first answer, which was tremendously clear and honest. Perhaps he would like to address the point made by the Immigration Advisory Service&#151;that this part of the Bill does not give the Home Secretary any powers that he does not already have. Its briefing on the Bill makes the point that all the relevant factors</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o83"><a name="70205-0009.htm_para0"><a name="0702053000372">These measures are just rhetoric. They do not provide a proper change in the law.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o84"><a name="70205-0009.htm_para1"><a name="0702053000373">Ministers should also be aware of the possible unintended consequences of this part of the Bill. Article 8 of the European convention on human rights provides protection of the right to privacy and family life. In its briefing on the Bill, the pressure group Liberty has pointed out a potentially perverse consequence when considering the relative positions of two offenders in our jails: one who is in prison for a long time for a violent offence, and another who is serving a shorter sentence for something like burglary. As Liberty says:</p>
<a name="70205-0009.htm_brev1"><a name="0702053000431"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The protections offered by article 8 relate to the impact upon family life rather than the severity of the offence...This means that the person receiving the short custodial sentence for theft, whose children have grown up, is likely to be less well protected than the person committing the more serious offence but who has younger, more dependent children.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o85"><a name="70205-0009.htm_para2"><a name="0702053000374">That, surely, is a perverse effect. It also means that a sentencing judge or magistrate might be inclined to avoid imposing a custodial sentence for an offence that carries a sentence of less than 12 months, because even if they believed that custody was justified, they would know that deportation was almost certain to follow. Some magistrates and judges would be concerned that that would be an unfair and disproportionate consequence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o86"><a name="70205-0009.htm_para3"><a name="0702053000375">One can agree or disagree with Liberty&#146;s analysis of the effects of the clause, but it seems perfectly clear that Ministers have not thought the issue through and that the net effect will be, first, that the Home Secretary&#146;s powers will not change very much and, secondly, that fewer people might receive sentences that would lead to deportation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o87"><a name="70205-0009.htm_para4"><a name="0702053000376">It is easy to see how the Bill could become yet another in the long line of Home Office Bills that promise more than they deliver. I hope that it avoids that fate.</p>

We support the extension of powers given to immigration officers, but it is inadequate to meet the scale of the problems faced at our ports and airports. The Minister had a difficult time from hon. Members on both sides of the House about that set of proposals, and rightly so. It seems a small gesture in the direction of toughening up the current regime and nothing like enough to meet the scale of the crisis. There are obvious questions about the Government&#146;s proposal itself, such as whether three hours is long enough, and what happens if there are multiple incidents and it is impossible to get a police officer there in time. One can imagine serious multiple incidents happening at a busy port and the officer not being able to get there within three hours. Presumably, people will be let go.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o92"><a name="70205-0009.htm_para9"><a name="0702053000396">There is a wider point, which the Minister did not address, made by hon.

He will have heard in the course of the debate that that is not just Conservative party policy; it is also Liberal Democrat policy, and has been recommended by the Select Committee on Home Affairs and by distinguished Labour Members, like the hon.

 One of the things that strikes travellers when they arrive at Britain&#146;s regional airports, such as Newcastle, is often the complete absence of any immigration officer being visible in the arrivals lounge.

 I agree. People from around the country, whether with relatively small airports&#151; although Newcastle is not that small&#151;or with small ports, as those of us who live in Kent know well, accept that there is a large hole.

 My hon. Friend&#146;s point is correct, but it does not simply apply to small ports? Holyhead, for example, is the third-largest passenger port in the United Kingdom, and yet there is no permanent immigration officer presence there. That puts tremendous additional stress on the police. Does he agree that it is all very well to confer a panoply of additional powers on immigration officers, but that if there are no immigration officers to enforce them, it is a pretty fatuous exercise?</p>

 My hon. Friend makes the point perfectly. If immigration officers, border police or whatever they are, are not present, they are not doing any good.

 This morning I visited the immigration service&#146;s enforcement unit at East Midlands airport. It is not necessarily true that there is a significant disconnection between local police and immigration service staff at regional airports. The East Midlands airport unit has a police command team consisting of six officers, two being provided from each of the Leicestershire, Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire forces.

 There is a calumny in the Bill. It states that people can be held for three hours before a police officer comes.

The fact is that the Essex and Kent police forces&#151;<i> [Interruption.] </i>I am addressing the House of Commons, if the Minister does not mind. This is a very serious point, and the Minister does not listen to some of our hon. Friends who are in the front line.

Those problems have been identified by Liberty and the Immigration Law Practitioners Association. If the Minister followed the almost universal advice to bring the various bodies together under a border police force, they would be given the appropriate training and oversight that we apply to our police. That in itself would reassure those&#151;clearly represented in the House&#151;who feel that the proposals give too much power to immigration officers.</p>

 The Minister said that he hoped that there would be a lengthy debate on the biometric issue in Committee. The timetable motion is not debatable but by my calculation we have roughly 12 sittings in Committee. There are 48 clauses in the Bill&#151;that is four clauses per sitting. I do not think that he has enough time. Does my hon. Friend agree?</p>

 I agree with my hon. Friend. The Bill gives rise to a large number of issues and I suspect that there will not be time to discuss them all fully in Committee, but that is a common problem with the Government, who have never taken parliamentary scrutiny seriously. As a result, every year, they pass laws that are worse than they were when they were leaving the Minister, as it were. The problem has come back to bite them.</p>

We have no objections in principle to the changes in support for asylum seekers. We will have questions at Committee stage about the removal of the right to present new evidence at the appeal stage of an immigration hearing. The Minister will be aware that strong arguments have been advanced by lobby groups against the reduction of appeal rights. Indeed, the House should hear a point that was made in the House in 1992:</p>
<a name="70205-0010.htm_brev0"><a name="0702053000440"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The immigration officer who knows that his decision may be subject to appeal is likely to be a good deal more circumspect, careful and even-handed than the officer who knows that his power of decision is absolute.

We are pleased that the Government listened to us and to the many groups that called on them to sign up to the European convention against human trafficking, and we urge them to use the Bill to put into effect some of other suggestions for fighting that vile crime. It was clear from the Minister&#146;s speech that he has read all my speeches and press reports avidly, so he will be aware that we recommended separate interviews at all airports for women and children travelling with an adult who is not a parent, guardian or husband. Every police force and local government department should have a strategy for dealing with suspected victims of trafficking, and the Government should set up a helpline to provide information for women who have been trafficked and for people who suspect that exploitation has taken place. We will try to help the Minister to go as fast as he wants to go in that part of the Bill, because the UK should take the lead in combating people trafficking, which is modern-day slavery. The 200th anniversary of the abolition of the slave trade is a good year for us to take significant steps forward in fighting the modern slave trade.</p>

Britain&#146;s borders are not secure, and they have not been made any more secure by recent decisions at the Home Office. The Government have made some gestures towards better security in the Bill, and it is our duty as a responsible Opposition to help with that. It is vital for the country that we develop safe and secure borders, and an immigration system that is once again fit for purpose. Our party will play its part in making that happen.</p>

 I broadly welcome the Bill, and the Government&#146;s response to the Home Affairs Committee report that was published last summer. Shortly afterwards, the Government introduced their proposals, many of which are reflected in the detail of the Bill and the thinking behind it. There have been significant changes in immigration policy in the past six months. The hon. Member for Ashford (Damian Green), who made a very clear speech, was rather dismissive of the Government&#146;s decision to end primary immigration from outside the EU by low-skilled workers, but that is a major policy change that gives the lie to consistent claims that there is a system of uncontrolled immigration. It reflects the reality of the labour market and the expansion of the European Union, as it enables migration policy from outside the EU to concentrate on the contribution from highly skilled workers if there is a clear need for such workers in the economy. That is a massive shift in migration policy, compared with the policy of a few years ago, and it should be welcomed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o109"><a name="70205-0010.htm_para4"><a name="07020516000002">I should like to make a few general points about the Bill&#146;s context before making some more detailed ones. May I draw attention to a couple of conclusions in the report that the Home Affairs Committee published last July? The UK Borders Bill is primarily about borders, and we emphasised that in a world where there is mass movement for many different purposes it is impossible to control migration purely through the security of borders. We said that illegal migration would increasingly have to be dealt with by internal measures, rather than at borders themselves. We concluded:</p>
<a name="70205-0010.htm_brev1"><a name="07020516000085"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;This represents one of the more fundamental changes to the purpose of the immigration system in the twenty-first century. The focus can no longer remain so heavily weighted towards initial entry and border control. While these controls must be sustained and indeed improved, far greater effort will in future have to go into the enforcement of the Immigration Rules within the UK.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o110"><a name="70205-0010.htm_para5"><a name="07020516000003">The Committee concluded:</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o111"><a name="70205-0010.htm_para6"><a name="07020516000004">That was an important conclusion. The Government&#151;and the proposal under discussion&#151;rightly want to strengthen and improve border controls. However, an illusion is about in public debate that border controls alone can deal with illegal migration. That is simply untrue, because such a large group of people moves in and out of our country, and we want that to happen. That group includes ourselves; we travel for business, to visit families and so forth. A major part of dealing with illegal migration must happen internally. Some of the  <br>

measures in the Bill, particularly those to do with biometric ID cards, are clearly aimed at achieving that, as are the measures to do with sharing information between the immigration system and the tax and revenue system.</p>

 I agree that it is important that data and information are shared. Does the right hon. Gentleman agree with the Government&#146;s decision of last May not to take part in the sharing of criminal records data between seven EU countries, and why does he think that that decision was made?</p>

 The Select Committee is currently looking at the evolution of such matters within the European Union. I think that the hon. Gentleman is referring to the Prum treaty and to countries generally towards the eastern part of the EU and central Europe. There is a major issue in that. I do not want to anticipate the Committee&#146;s conclusion, but my feeling is that it would be better if data sharing took place by agreement of the EU as a whole, rather than by small groups in the EU breaking away and coming to their own arrangements. However, I must say to the hon. Gentleman that that is a matter of some debate in the Committee, and we shall have to see what conclusion we come to on it. The Government had a reasonable case for not simply leaping into signing up to something that had been decided by a small number of EU member states.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o112"><a name="70205-0010.htm_para7"><a name="07020516000007">Let me return to the point about internal measures against illegal migration. The clear conclusion of the Committee was that:</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o114"><a name="70205-0010.htm_para9"><a name="07020516000009">We found that evidence suggested that past strategies of trying to focus on certain groups of illegal workers in specific workplaces and of removing them from the country was missing the point. The fundamental problem is employers who are abusive and exploitative&#151;and who abuse and exploit illegal workers and many other workers, too. The problem employers we should be most worried about do not just employ illegal workers: they do not pay their tax and national insurance; they do not comply with the minimum wage; they do not follow health and safety requirements; and they do not follow employment legislation. If we had a cross-Government drive against abusive and exploitative employers and agencies, we would certainly deal with illegal migration, but in the course of doing that, we would also deal with a lot of other abuse and exploitation.</p>

 Is there not a danger that those who are here illegally and are working on the fringes of illegality will, when faced with biometric checks for something or other, be forced deeper into the illegal economy and further out of sight of the authorities that can provide help and assistance&#151;and out of sight of the law enforcement agencies that are looking for them?

 The hon. Gentleman makes an important point. Some have responded to it by saying, &#147;Let&#146;s have an amnesty.&#148; The Committee considered that and came to the conclusion that it would be the wrong approach to take. Until we have a secure regime in place at the very least, an amnesty would merely be an advertising brochure for the people traffickers.

Of course my right hon.

 Let me make two points in response to that. First, in the past few months there has been a strengthening of cross-government systems and organisation for dealing with such matters. The Minister has, I think, indicated that more on that will come into the public domain in the next few weeks, so we will have better structures in place. Secondly, Members need to be very clear that it cannot always be the Home Office&#146;s responsibility to deal with all such issues. We need to put pressure on the Treasury, the Department for Work and Pensions, the Department of Trade and Industry and other Departments that have an interest in this area.</p>

 My hon. Friend is right that there will be a major public policy issue, but I see no way of avoiding that now. We might have to put in place measures that enable people to return home, if they wish to do so. Also, there will at least be a better knowledge of what our labour market genuinely needs if people are paid a proper rate of pay, rather than the poverty pay that is paid at present. I do not pretend that I have all the answers. I have raised this issue with the Minister. There must be a strategy for dealing with such a situation. However, I say to my hon. Friend that the alternative, which is simply to regularise everybody&#146;s position, would lead to another 320,000 people turning up within the space of a few months or a few years in the expectation that the same would happen to them.</p>

Select Committee members went to Poland last week to visit Frontex, the border agency charged with co-ordinating European border activity both across the land border in eastern Europe and in the Mediterranean and the Atlantic. We were interested to hear about the work that it was doing, but the fact is that the same issues arise time and again. Trying to strengthen border patrols along the Mediterranean will not work as long as there is massive use of very poorly paid and exploited labour&#151;in the agricultural sector, for instance, as is the case in Italy. It is not possible to police a border if behind that border there are many opportunities to work&#151;albeit in very bad conditions, but ones that, to refer to the example I have just given, are better for the many African people employed than are those in the countries from which they have come. The Government need to raise this issue in the EU, so that there is effective labour market enforcement across the EU and not only in the UK, because ultimately what happens along the European borders affects the pressure on our own borders. That is of relevance to some of the issues in the Bill.</p>

 I did not have the privilege of being on the Select Committee at that time, but I commend my right hon. Friend on bringing this issue to our attention. On visiting Ukraine, it became apparent that borders throughout eastern Europe are very transparent and, therefore, any approach that purports to be border control is, as he said, entirely permeable. As the Ukrainian authorities said, they are dealing with Russian immigrants coming into that country and perhaps purporting to be Poles. So we cannot possibly win with the Opposition&#146;s strategy, which is to provide greater and greater walls to imaginary castles. That strategy will not sustain a proper immigration policy.</p>

Let us imagine that a car arrives with one British citizen, one foreign national, a quantity of cigarettes and some money. The reality is that if there is an immigration officer and a customs officer, one will be able to detain one of those citizens, and the other will be able to detain the other. One will have the power to confiscate the car and the cigarettes, and the other will not, and an assumption about where the money came from will determine which of them is able to confiscate the money. That is a slightly fatuous example, but all sorts of practical problems will arise.</p>

 The strategy in the Bill, which the Minister outlined today, is targeted at another group of people. The compulsion will come in for those outside the EEA first. We will arrive&#151;soon, I hope&#151;at the point where everyone has a biometric ID card. That is clearly the ideal situation, which, in my view, we should work towards as quickly as possible. However, starting with selected groups of people outside the EEA will create a period during which there will be some premium on having identity documents from other EU states, as a way for those who are clearly not British to establish a right to be here. I hope that the Government and the Opposition can explore in Committee whether there are sufficient powers and penalties regarding the fraudulent use of identity documents from elsewhere within the EU. Someone who fraudulently uses such documents should face a penalty sufficient to give rise to a presumption that any other claims to immigration status will be removed.</p>

 There is indeed no end of material for fruitful discussion in Committee, and I am sure that those issues will be raised. I wanted to draw attention to the position regarding EU documentation, because, as my hon. Friend the Member for Luton, South (Margaret Moran) said, there are reasons to be concerned about the practice in that respect.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o120"><a name="70205-0010.htm_para15"><a name="07020516000029">I have two other brief points. I welcome the proposal to remove the presentation of new evidence at appeal for decisions made according to the points-based system regarding work-related visas. However, I should point out that the Select Committee, which first came up with the proposal, did not want that power to be limited to the points-based system. We wanted it to cover all appeals, including family visits, which we observed a number of times at appeal tribunals. The problem is that at the moment, the entry clearance officer takes a decision based on one set of information, and then wholly new information is presented on appeal and a different conclusion is reached. It is not really an appeal, but a re-hearing of the same issues. On occasion, that happens simply because information that could have been provided at the initial stage was not, such as authentic information about the sponsor&#146;s bank account or financial circumstances.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o121"><a name="70205-0010.htm_para16"><a name="07020516000030">We suggested that the simplest thing would be to have a proper stage in the decision-making procedure at which entry clearance officers say that they are minded to refuse an application for lack of clear evidence or proof in a particular case. So if someone said, &#147;I am going to turn this down because I am not satisfied about the financial documentation&#148;, or &#147;I am not satisfied that you have no family members living in the country that would lead you to return&#148;, there would be a period of time in which those facts could be established and the case re-examined by the entry clearance officer. That would prevent the enormous waste of time and money that occurs when cases are transferred to the appeal tribunal here. There is a lengthy delay while documents are put together and sent halfway around the world, and the appeal is one of a long listing of appeals. I urge Ministers to consider the idea of a &#147;minded to refuse&#148; stage.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o122"><a name="70205-0010.htm_para17"><a name="07020516000031">It is true, as many of us know from our casework, that on occasion, writing to an entry clearance officer with new information leads them to exercise their discretion and to change the decision. However, we also know that that often does not happen, and that new information is rejected on the basis that it was not presented at the same time. Ministers have gone part of the way towards a more rational and streamlined system, but they could have gone much further, in line with the Select Committee&#146;s proposals.</p>

There is a compelling argument for having prisons where the regime concentrates on such prisoners, the issues that they will face on returning to their country of origin, and their rehabilitation and reintegration needs when they return home. At the moment, most prisons have a significant minority of foreign prisoners, and, by and large, they follow a regime that is designed to return  <br>

people to communities and labour markets in this country that are inappropriate for the prisoners we are serving. Ministers should look at this issue. The Government&#146;s new approach, whatever the legal niceties regarding the powers in the Bill, raises the question of what sort of prison estate we should have for foreign prisoners who will not remain in this country when they finish their sentence. I hope that that issue can be addressed.</p>

 We all want an immigration system that works. We want a system that is fair to everyone, firm where it needs to be firm, properly resourced, and conducted in a measured political climate where judgments are made in the interests of the nation, not in response to fevered headlines. It is therefore deeply worrying that the Bill&#146;s contents have led Liberty to describe it as</p>
<a name="70205-0011.htm_brev0"><a name="07020516000089"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;one of the worst examples of cynical legislation&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o125"><a name="70205-0011.htm_para2"><a name="07020516000035">that it has seen.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o126"><a name="70205-0011.htm_para3"><a name="07020516000036">This is the Government&#146;s third immigration Bill in as many years and their fifth since they were first elected. It is their fifth attempt to get a handle on the system by making extra laws, but by also providing limited enactment and enforcement of existing legislation and rules. The real problems with immigration are administrative, not legislative, and can be blamed on the Government&#146;s use of migration as a political football. Gimmicks, headlines and targets have destroyed any semblance of a managed migration system, and yet another law will not solve it. The introduction of automatic deportation is emblematic of the Government&#146;s whole approach to home affairs. Headline-driven targets and gimmicks push the system to breaking point. Administrative breakdown causes a scandal&#151;in this case, more than 1,000 foreign prisoners being released after completion of their sentences without being considered for deportation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o127"><a name="70205-0011.htm_para4"><a name="07020516000037">The Government overreact with &#147;tough&#148; new laws and offences and &#147;tough&#148; new targets that, instead of solving the problem, put even greater burdens on the administrators. The Department is in crisis and Ministers who think that legislation is a substitute for real action are not living in the real world. The issues that affect our constituents are not dealt with by this Bill. For example, I have written to the Minister about the failure in my constituency to remove five husbands whose arranged marriages have broken down. All the information has been provided, but the men have not been removed and continue to harass and harangue their former wives. The Bill does not even begin to address such problems. Nor does it address the length of time taken by the IND to process applications for the right to remain. There is no need for additional powers, but there is a real need for administrative systems to be made to work&#151;to become, in the Home Secretary&#146;s words, &#147;fit for purpose&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o128"><a name="70205-0011.htm_para5"><a name="07020516000038">Nonetheless, some elements of the Bill have merit, including turning the immigration and nationality directorate into an independent agency. We will seek to amend some of the proposals in the Bill in Committee,  <br>

but we must not pretend that extra powers alone will be enough. Immigration chaos will end only when the Government start doing less to do it better.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o129"><a name="70205-0011.htm_para6"><a name="07020516000039">The first four clauses give immigration officers at ports new powers to detain people suspected of non-immigration offences. They do not contain any suggestion for an integrated border force. Instead, it is intended to allow the existing border control authorities to work more closely together. A truly integrated force would require new, not just redeployed, resources. It is not enough simply to shift police officers away from their current duties or put existing customs officials in new uniforms. We believe that there should be a unified border force and that the level of integration in the Bill is not enough. For example, at Heathrow airport, four police forces operate in addition to immigration officers, revenue and customs officers and security forces. A unified force would secure our borders more effectively and efficiently. The Government have stated that 24-hour security at all ports of entry would cost only &#163;105 million a year, but they are spending nearly &#163;100,000 a day on unworkable, illiberal ID cards.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o130"><a name="70205-0011.htm_para7"><a name="07020516000040">The powers seem generally appropriate, though we want to ensure that comprehensive training will be given to immigration officers who are designated in that way. As other hon. Members have said, the powers need also to be exercised in accordance with the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 codes of practice, which provide the framework within which the police operate. Were children to be detained, for example, the immigration officer should have a duty to request the attendance of an appropriate adult.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o131"><a name="70205-0011.htm_para8"><a name="07020516000041">The proposals for biometric registration seem driven by the need for a dry run for ID cards rather than being solely for the purpose of better immigration management. While the increased use of biometrics on visas and immigration documents has clear advantages, we have serious concerns about the practicalities of the proposals. First, issuing documents to the 3.9 million people already in the UK, many of whom have indefinite leave to remain and therefore no contact with immigration services, will be an administrative nightmare. There is no indication of how much that will cost, where the processing will happen and what provision will be made for those who cannot travel. I could list many more such concerns.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o132"><a name="70205-0011.htm_para9"><a name="07020516000042">For those coming into the country for the first time, there will be a major problem in processing the extra information at our struggling consulates. What additional resources will be provided at, say, the high commission in Islamabad to cope with the extra work? At the moment, the high commission there is issuing visas for appeals granted last September. One can only imagine what additional delays will be caused to applications for visas for normal and ordinary events such as family weddings.</p>

It is clear that the problem is not in finding those who are working or living illegally in the UK, but in enforcing action against them. For  <br>

example, in 2004-05, raids found nearly 4,000 illegal workers, but only eight employers were taken to court and found guilty. That is the problem with many of the proposals in the Bill. There are already plenty of powers, but we are not seeing any action.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o134"><a name="70205-0011.htm_para11"><a name="07020516000044">The Bill also states that the use of BIDs can be specified not just for immigration purposes, but in employment, access to benefits and NHS funding. Can the Minister explain why, for example, the requirement for employers to check biometric information is being introduced without the public consultation that the Department promised last year? Why has there been no published assessment of the financial impact on the public or private sectors of compulsory checking of BIDs?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o135"><a name="70205-0011.htm_para12"><a name="07020516000045">The proposals on conditional leave to remain pick up on suggestions made by the Liberal Democrats for handling the difficult situation of people who have been ordered by a court to be deported, but who cannot actually be deported for human rights reasons. It is wholly right that people should not be deported to places where they face torture. We suggested developing a way to better monitor those few individuals in the UK who cannot be detained or deported. The proposals in the Bill seem a workable solution, although appropriate protections of proportionality should be built in, especially where they are used for children.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o136"><a name="70205-0011.htm_para13"><a name="07020516000046">We welcome clause 17, which will ensure that an asylum seeker can continue to be supported at all stages up to an appeal being determined. However, the Bill does not address what happens when asylum seekers go underground and a local authority has to put their children into care.</p>

They will have powers to dispose of seized property. They already have the power to seize it; apparently it is sitting in warehouses. They want to be able to extradite people who are committing UK immigration offences from abroad. Those powers are all welcome, although again we warn that the real problem is enforcement, not a lack of powers. There have been only 15 successful prosecutions of employers of illegal migrants in the last five years. It is also a measure of how badly the Government&#146;s rushed approach to legislation serves us that they took powers to seize goods but not to dispose of them, so that they have warehouses full of things that they cannot dispose of. If matters were more considered, perhaps such holes would not appear.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman is making a reasonably cogent argument, but there does seem to be naivety and a lack of reality. Far be it from me to support the Government, but we are talking about 9,700 people or thereabouts who have committed criminal offences. We must have a degree of reality about that.

 The reality is that the judge already has the power to order a deportation. However, a deportation should follow consideration of the case; it should not be automatic. Let me give the hon. Gentleman a few examples to illustrate my point. My hon. Friend the Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Carmichael) dealt with the case of Sakchai Makao, a Thai national who had lived on Shetland for 10 years. He went off the rails after the death of his stepfather and set fire to a car. He served eight months. He committed the crime four years ago, but was rounded up last year. He no longer spoke Thai or had any real family connections in Thailand, yet he was threatened with deportation. Only the strength of feeling among the people of Shetland and their campaign prevented him from being removed.</p>

 I shall have to get back to the hon. Gentleman about that. Those are real cases, involving people whom the judge could have ordered to be deported.

 I thank the hon. and learned Gentleman for that intervention, but I would be interested to know what the Conservative policy is. We agree with the provision whereby a decision to deport will automatically become deportation, but in fact there has always been a presumption of that happening.

 I would not say that I was enthusiastic about seeing the Bill, because over the past few years there has been so much legislation on immigration and asylum that I sometimes think the Home Office should be banned from introducing any more legislation for three or four years&#151;Ministers might enjoy that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o144"><a name="70205-0011.htm_para21"><a name="07020516000063">I can understand the reasoning behind many parts of the Bill, but I have a real problem with the lack of detail in it about what will happen and how it will work.

too many Bills such an enormous amount is left to regulations that we end up relying on assurances from Ministers about how a Bill will work, despite what appear to be wide powers in the measure. I am not casting aspersions on the good faith of Ministers, but that does mean that there are no guarantees for the future. In addition, of course, regulations cannot be amended. We might think that 90 per cent. of a regulation is acceptable but 10 per cent. is a problem, and there will be no way to amend it as we can amend the primary legislation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o146"><a name="70205-0011.htm_para23"><a name="07020516000065">All the way through the Bill, it is the lack of detail and what will come along when we see the regulations that concerns me. I can understand the reasoning for the first few clauses on immigration officers&#146; powers of detention. Let us say that a British citizen was trying to leave the country and there is a warrant for that person&#146;s arrest or that person was known to have committed a crime. If an immigration officer was the only person at the port and no police were there, he could not stop and detain that person. I understand that a loophole exists, but I am concerned that the rules must be clear on immigration officers&#146; accountability and the routes for complaint or challenge against the use of their powers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o147"><a name="70205-0011.htm_para24"><a name="07020516000066">The suggestion that PACE&#151;the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984&#151;should apply has been made already. What happens when the immigration officer tries to detain someone? Does he have the power to question that person? If so, would that happen under caution? How would that relate to PACE? It is important that we get this right, because the Bill includes a criminal offence of obstructing the immigration officer in the carrying out of that function. In effect, there is a criminal offence of not co-operating with the immigration officer, so it is important that we know exactly what the rules are, what the powers are, what the limitations on them are and how they can be challenged if they are used inappropriately.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o148"><a name="70205-0011.htm_para25"><a name="07020516000067">Clearly, the clauses on biometric registration are steps on the way to ID cards. We know from the debate on the Identity Cards Bill that it was always intended that one of the first groups of people to be subject to ID card legislation would be foreign nationals. There is no surprise in that, but some of the questions that now arise are similar to those that arose about the Identity Cards Act 2006.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o149"><a name="70205-0011.htm_para26"><a name="07020516000068">It is not clear to me from the Bill where the data that are collected will be stored. Will we have a card with a chip on which the information is stored, so that the information is carried around on the card? Or will we have, as we were promised with the Identity Cards Bill, a major database behind the card? That is important; some of us who have real problems with ID cards would feel less uncomfortable with a chip on the card, rather than one with a big database behind it.

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o152"><a name="70205-0012.htm_para0"><a name="07020516000071">That is a very wide power: the Secretary of State can impose a penalty on someone for not complying with the registration, but there is no indication of what that penalty might or might not be.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o153"><a name="70205-0012.htm_para1"><a name="07020516000072">A few days ago, I raised with the Minister the question of how the card will be used. For instance, could the police stop someone and ask them for their card? The Minister has assured me in writing&#151;&#151;and mentioned earlier today&#151;&#151;that that would not be the case. However, we would assume that an immigration officer could ask for the card and that it will be asked for in a variety of circumstances. Let us suppose that there was a raid on a factory where it was thought that a significant number of employees were working illegally&#151;the sort of thing that we know happens. People in that factory may require the card; others will not: people who are British citizens but who happen to have come to this country as migrants. We must be sure that the checking of such people, who might include British citizens, will be done with sensitivity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o154"><a name="70205-0012.htm_para2"><a name="07020516000073">I am not clear either, given the Bill&#146;s phrasing, exactly who in the end will have the biometric card. The Bill talks about people who are subject to immigration control. It appears that that will be interpreted to include people who have indefinite leave to remain, on the ground that it is possible for that person&#146;s indefinite leave to be revoked at some point. For instance, if someone with indefinite leave stays out the country for two years or more, the indefinite leave lapses. Is it the intention that everyone who has indefinite leave to remain but has not then acquired British citizenship will be brought into the ambit of the Bill? That is a very large number of people and it will include many family members of people who are British citizens. After living in this country for years and years and having indefinite leave to remain, they would feel some resentment if they were asked to sign up to a biometric card on the ground that they were foreign nationals.</p>

It may well be that a single secure document, rather than the vast number of documents that can be used now, would be a considerable help in that respect. I have certainly come across cases&#151;I am sure that other hon. Member have, too&#151;that involve people who find it difficult to convince an employer that they have the right to work, because they have a three-year-old status letter from the Home Office that is getting tatty and does not look like the genuine article. I have also dealt with constituents who have had problems proving to the Benefits Agency that they have a right to gain access to benefits. Responsible employers are reluctant to employ people whom they think might be subject to immigration control or perhaps do not have the right to work. I can understand that such things can be a two-way street and that people could benefit from being able to produce that secure document.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o156"><a name="70205-0012.htm_para4"><a name="07020516000075">I am also concerned about some points that were raised by my right hon. Friend the Member for Southampton, Itchen (Mr. Denham) about the consequences of a move towards cracking down on illegal working. I agree with absolutely everything that he said about the employers whom we should be targeting. Those people will not just be employing illegal workers; they will not be paying VAT, national insurance or tax properly, and so on. There is no question but that we should be targeting those people, but we will inevitably throw up conceivably very large numbers of people who are working illegally and people who have overstayed&#151;some of whom have been here a long time and have families, mortgages and children in school&#151;and we must have some way to deal with those people if were not going to create chaos. Chaos will certainly be caused in their lives if they are suddenly told after years of working that they are no longer able to do so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o157"><a name="70205-0012.htm_para5"><a name="07020516000076">My right hon. Friend said that he would rule out an amnesty because it would become a magnet. I have heard that sort of argument before, but it does not necessarily convince me, if the rules are made clear enough. For example, in recent years, there was effectively an amnesty for asylum seeker families with children who had been here a certain length of time and whose children had been born before a particular date. I do not see any evidence at all that that led to lots more people coming to this country with their families to seek asylum because they thought that there might be another amnesty in two or three years. I am not necessarily convinced that an amnesty has to act as a magnet if the rules are made clear.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman will surely appreciate that, in a country where the standard of living falls far below that in the United Kingdom, if people see that they can get into the UK and get an amnesty after a period of years, that is a good incentive to come here.</p>

 If we are moving to a system that involves points-based migration controls and better controls on illegal working&#151;something that we need to address through tackling employers&#151;we somehow have to deal with the people who are in the country here and now, some of whom have been here for a long time. I would not argue for an out-and-out amnesty. I am saying, let us have some rules that look at how long someone has been in the country and how long they have been working. Perhaps in the first place we could just give them a limited leave to remain&#151;in other words, the possibility of earning the right to stay here permanently. Whether we go down that road or not, I agree absolutely with my right hon. Friend the Member for Southampton, Itchen that the Government have to be prepared to deal with those people, and to do so systematically, if we are not going to cause a lot of problems for individuals.

low-skill and low-wage indigenous host community work forces, which is causing community cohesion problems&#151;something that the hon. Member for Dagenham (Jon Cruddas) has drawn attention to. The Government have to look at all those issues. I am sure that the hon. Member for Walthamstow (Mr. Gerrard) will not agree with me, but the Government have to look at the impact of both legal and illegal immigration on the local delivery of services.</p>

<p><a name="st_o302"><a name="07020516000080"><a name="70205-0012.htm_spnew3"><a name="07020516000124"><b>Mr. Gerrard:</b>
 Of course the Government have to look at the impact of migration on delivery of services, but where I am sure that the hon. Gentleman and I would part company is on the question of whether migration is good for the economy. I think that, in general, migration has been good for the economy. There is no question but that, when people are working illegally and being exploited, that affects many other people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o158"><a name="70205-0012.htm_para6"><a name="07020516000081">I will try to conclude my remarks, because I know that other hon. Members wish to speak. I shall refer quickly to a couple of other points in the Bill. Clause 16 allows conditions to be imposed on people with limited leave to remain in relation to reporting and residence. I can see the arguments in the specific cases that have been cited, but the drafting of that clause leaves the provision very wide. It could apparently be made to apply to far more people than were referred to in the debate earlier. That is another example of where more clarity is needed in the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o159"><a name="70205-0012.htm_para7"><a name="07020516000082">On new evidence and appealing, I understand the arguments, but I again agree with the comments of my right hon. Friend the Member for Southampton, Itchen: if all that happens is what is proposed in the Bill, that will lead to more clogging of the system. It will lead to people reapplying, paying again and going round and round. If we did have a &#147;minded to refuse&#148; stage, that would be a way of cutting through that and getting rid of some of the problems.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o160"><a name="70205-0012.htm_para8"><a name="07020516000083">The final issue that I want to mention is deportation. I am concerned about the threshold that is being suggested. It covers a wide range of offences. We need to be sure that the process will allow for proper consideration in relation to anybody who is making the claim on human rights grounds or in connection with the refugee convention. The issue is a bit like illegal working in that it has the potential to throw up cases of families who have been settled here for many years. We need to think about the impact on the family when we are looking at whether to deport someone. I do not have any problem whatsoever with deporting somebody who has been convicted of serious offences, but the list could include people who have not committed such a serious offence. We could be talking about a first-time offender who has done something stupid behind the wheel of a car and who ends up with a sentence of more than 12 months. That person could have been in the country for a long time and have a family. We need to get the balance right.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o161"><a name="70205-0012.htm_para9"><a name="07020516000084">I said initially that I could see the reasoning behind much of what is in the Bill. There are issues of principle that I do not have any problem with, but there is an enormous amount of detail that we need to go through in the later stages to get things right. Otherwise, I am afraid that we are going to end up with powers that are so wide that we will not be able to get things right in the regulation.</p>

 The history of Britain is one of immigration&#151;often coming from the south or the east. We are constantly reminded of that. It is a historical fact, but we are often reminded of it because it is seen by some as a reason to do absolutely nothing about the unparalleled levels of immigration at the moment. If one looks back in history at our experiences of immigration, one can draw certain lessons from them. For example, when immigration has been on a small scale and has taken place in a controlled fashion, and when there has been a willingness on the part of the immigrating community to integrate themselves, it has usually been a successful and happy experience. Off the top of my head, I can think of the Jews who came here under Oliver Cromwell, the Huguenots who came here after the edict of Fontainebleau and, more recently, the Ugandans who came here because of Idi Amin. Those are all good examples of immigration into this country where the host nation benefited, as did those who came here.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o162"><a name="70205-0012.htm_para10"><a name="07020518000002">Throughout our history, there have of course been many other examples that have not been so happy. Those who say that immigration is always a good thing ought to look at their history books a little more closely. Wherever it has taken place in an uncontrolled fashion and has involved very large numbers it has almost inevitably resulted in forms of conflict with the host community and in a lack of willingness on the part of those coming here to integrate themselves. I would not even begin to compare what is going on at the moment with things that happened in Britain&#146;s pre-history, but immigration is very much out of control.</p>

 I beg your pardon, Mr. Deputy Speaker. The hon.

into the country, which is putting severe strain on our social services and housing services, and, in some areas, on our schools and hospitals. It is certainly putting a strain on wages. The Welsh Affairs Committee is carrying out an inquiry into globalisation. One of the papers from the CBI rather gloatingly referred to the fact that the large number of immigrants has pushed down wages for lower-skilled workers. The CBI is absolutely delighted about that, of course. It said that that had kept down wage inflation, which it saw as a perfectly good thing. Many of those who work at the lower end of society&#151;although that is not a phrase that I like to use very much; I am talking about those who work on lower pay&#151;would not see that as a terribly good thing.

That is why we need controls. I thought that it was probably okay to allow Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic into the European Union because their standards of living, although below ours, are not so far below that huge numbers of people could have been expected to leave permanently. The standards of living in Bulgaria and Romania are so far below even those of that recent tranche of EU members that people will have a strong financial incentive to leave in very large numbers indeed.

 Does my hon.

 It is very shameful. A case recently came to my attention concerning a young lady from Poland who had been exploited in a shocking fashion, and that sort of thing is widespread. My hon. Friend makes an important point.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o165"><a name="70205-0012.htm_para13"><a name="07020518000015">A number of parts of the Bill are well worth supporting in themselves even though they will not change anything, but even those are not all that they are cracked up to be. I am sure that the provision relating to automatic deportation will play very well in the tabloids, and Ministers will be hoping that all sorts of left-wing pressure groups jump up and condemn them so that, paradoxically, the Government will look rather good in the pages of the <i> Daily Mail</i>, but as my Front-Bench colleagues have pointed out, the measure is not what it is cracked up to be.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o166"><a name="70205-0012.htm_para14"><a name="07020518000016">Why on earth should somebody have to be sentenced to 12 months in prison before they face the threat of automatic deportation? We all know that it is virtually impossible to get into a British prison these days. One has to do something very bad indeed as a first offence to be sentenced to more than 12 months in prison. I should be interested to know whether the 12 months relates to the sentence passed by the judge or the sentence that is actually served, which is of course usually a fraction of that passed by the judge.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o167"><a name="70205-0012.htm_para15"><a name="07020518000017">I put it to Labour Members that if somebody repeatedly breaks the law&#151;by breaking into houses or cars, or shoplifting, for example&#151;but does not get more than 12 months in prison, why on earth should they not face deportation? We heard earlier about the case of the Somali sex offender who had carried out one sex offence and been to prison, was released but not deported because somebody said that his human rights would be abused, and was then put back in prison having been convicted of another sexual offence. Presumably, the same people will be jumping up and down and bleating if there is any suggestion that he be sent back to Somalia, because of course it is a terribly dangerous place and he might come to some harm. Yet every single right-thinking person in this country is thinking to themselves that if it is a dangerous place and he will come to some harm there, that is the very reason he should be deported there as quickly as possible, instead of being left in the holiday camps that pass for prisons in this country these days.</p>

The message will go out to people involved in immigration cases that they can get away with assaulting immigration officers and, if they do so, they will not necessarily face the threat of deportation because they will not receive a prison sentence of more than one year.</p>

It is not the fact that immigration officers are getting extra powers. Clearly that needs to happen, although it would be much better if they were being given these powers along with members of different police forces and we had a unified border security force, which at least two of the major political parties in the House are calling for. What worries me is the fact that this is likely to lead to yet another series of spurious claims against the IND, in addition to those currently being made, all funded by taxpayers&#146; money.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o170"><a name="70205-0012.htm_para18"><a name="07020518000020">A year ago I was told that millions of pounds are being paid out by the IND as a result of spurious claims, and I refrained from making that statement because I thought that it would be best to try to check the facts. I tabled a written question last May and was told that I could not have an answer. I tabled another one in June and was told that somebody would write to me. Back in September or October somebody wrote to me and said that they would write to me with some details soon. I then tried the House of Commons Library, asking it how much money is being paid out in compensation claims to asylum seekers. I was told that the member of staff in the Library had been told by the IND that under no circumstances was it prepared to give those figures. I then started making freedom of information requests, and I was told that it would cost too much money to tell me how much money had been paid out in claims. I then made a freedom of information request to find out whether the Home Office had talked to the IND about any of my queries, and it looked as though it had, but it was not prepared to tell me about that either, for security reasons.</p>

I challenge the Minister, if that is not true, to tell us how much money has been paid out in claims to asylum seekers.

I remember that when I was dealing with the IND in a personal capacity, I went up to Birmingham one day with my wife, as I had done on a number of occasions, taking all my forms and the money in a brown envelope&#151;<i> [Interruption.]</i> I did not get into this place as a result of that. The case officer I was dealing with, who had no idea that I was a Member of the Welsh Assembly, looked at me in surprise and said, &#147;Do you know, I don&#146;t meet many people like you.&#148; <i> [Laughter.]</i> I walked into that. The case officer said that he had never met anyone who had gone so far out of their way to obey the rules. He said, &#147;You are very definitely in a minority.&#148; My fear is that people such as me, my wife and other immigrants to this country who obey the rules will continue to be in a minority and this Bill will change absolutely nothing.</p>

 I am not sure how to follow the speech made by the hon. Member for Monmouth (David T.C. Davies), but I found it thoroughly enjoyable, although he gave us a bit too much information, as Mrs. Davies might agree.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o173"><a name="70205-0013.htm_para0"><a name="07020518000024">Many of the ideas in the Bill are rational, as the Government are seeking to restore the integrity of the system, and many of the ideas come from the work of the Select Committee on Home Affairs. I welcome the comments made by my right hon. Friend the Member for Southampton, Itchen (Mr. Denham) and my hon. Friend the Member for Walthamstow (Mr. Gerrard), and agree with many of the points that they raised. I shall deal with a couple of aspects of the Bill, and particularly the consequences of clauses 23 and 24, which seek to clamp down on the employment of illegal workers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o174"><a name="70205-0013.htm_para1"><a name="07020518000025">At the outset, I should state that it is correct to clamp down on employers who abuse migrant labour, because shocking stories of such abuse abound in every constituency. Later I shall mention a couple of cases of such abuses that I have been told about in my constituency. However, like my hon. Friend the Member for Walthamstow, I am concerned about the effects of the clauses on some of the most vulnerable people in our society.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o175"><a name="70205-0013.htm_para2"><a name="07020518000026">Section 21 of the Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006 introduced a new offence of knowingly employing an illegal worker, and it provided associated powers to obtain a warrant to enter and search premises to arrest an individual. Clause 23 introduces an express power of arrest, and clause 24 puts in place a new regime of penalties for knowingly employing an illegal worker. It also introduces an express power to search a firm&#146;s personnel records. On the face of it, the clauses might help to stop the abuse of people at work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o176"><a name="70205-0013.htm_para3"><a name="07020518000027">Overall, the Government&#146;s strategy is pretty clear: there is the general &#147;fit for purpose&#148; review of the Home Office, the introduction of the points-based migration system and the introduction of ID cards; also, the tough language of clampdowns is used when migration is discussed. Now, the Government are bearing down ever more systematically on those employing unregularised migrants. In general, we are witnessing a total overhaul of the immigration system, not least because the subject tops people&#146;s concerns in poll after poll on their overall priorities for Government activity. The clauses are the next pieces to be put on the board in the overhaul of the Home Office.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o177"><a name="70205-0013.htm_para4"><a name="07020518000028">The obvious question is why the problem was not dealt with before. Presumably, the answer lies in the Home Office&#146;s history of chaos, but I posit that there might also be something to the idea that in the past a blind eye was turned to tacit illegal employment. That is partially accounted for by the fact that migrant labour is seen as a key element in building our north America-style flexible labour markets. I have travelled around the country a fair bit in the past couple of months, and I have seen case after case of appalling abuse of migrant labour. There is no doubt that the issue resonates and touches raw nerves in many communities. It is almost the outstanding issue for  <br>

public policy debate, so I welcome the initiatives in the Bill to regularise some of the employment of illegal workers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o178"><a name="70205-0013.htm_para5"><a name="07020518000029">In my community, I use the same three examples time and again to demonstrate the way in which illegal migrants have pushed down local pay rates, have been chronically abused by landlords, and are being employed at less than the minimum wage. I came across all three case studies on the same day. The first concerned one of a gang of Lithuanian migrants who were employed under a public contract for &#163;15 a day. The second case involved a roofer who came to see me, who said that his hourly pay rate had fallen by &#163;2.50 in the preceding six months. The third case concerned a bloke who had put an oven in his shed and hired it out, so that a gang of east European migrant workers could hot-bed it at the bottom of his garden. Those are little stories that resonate across the country, and everyone has their own local examples of such chronic abuses by employers of some of the most abused workers in the country. I therefore understand the Government&#146;s objectives in introducing the measures.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o179"><a name="70205-0013.htm_para6"><a name="07020518000030">However, it is difficult to get a clear, empirical picture of the patterns and the effects of migration in this country. The Office for National Statistics estimates that the total population was in the order of 60.2 million for 2005, and that has gone up by 375,000, net. Some 235,000 of that increase is made up by net migration. Alongside that, it is a commonly accepted statistic that there are about 600,000 A8 nationals. As was mentioned earlier, there were some 450,000 failed applications for asylum, and that figure does not include the dependants. In any analysis of the effects of illegal migration, we should add people who are trafficked, overstayers and students who are still in the system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o180"><a name="70205-0013.htm_para7"><a name="07020518000031">Earlier today, I referred to the Greater London authority&#146;s estimate that there are 320,000 unregularised migrants in London alone. That figure, too, does not include dependants. My borough in east London has a total population of 174,000, so if we accept the figure of 320,000, it means that there are enough people with no formal status in the city to make up a large London borough. Many of those people are the most exploited in our society. They are abused by employers, landlords&#151;every MP in the country will have countless stories of such abuses in their constituency&#151;and criminals. We have many local examples of crime in which no comeback is provided by the authorities, because the migrant&#146;s status is so ambiguous. They are therefore preyed on by criminal gangs. That is the right background against which to consider the consequences of clauses 23 and 24.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o181"><a name="70205-0013.htm_para8"><a name="07020518000032">In London, the obvious consequence of bearing down on employers who abuse migrant workers who have no status in this country will be to push tens of thousands of workers out of their illegal work. Many of those workers have been here for years, and many have dependants. One could argue that the city is dependent on migrant flows of labour. No one knows how many people would be affected, but arguably tens of thousands of people in London would be turfed out of work. How those people will survive remains a mystery to me. I see many cases involving people&#151;and their children&#151;who have no status in this country and who have been here for many years, just as my hon.  <br>

Friend said about his constituency of Walthamstow, which is down the road from mine. Those people may be barely surviving at subsistence level, because they work illegally at very low rates of pay.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o182"><a name="70205-0013.htm_para9"><a name="07020518000033">Will the Bill deal with just one part of the problem&#151;illegal working&#151;while creating another problem for councils and public policy makers, across the country but especially in poorer urban communities, which bear a disproportionate strain as a result of the migration of illegal groups? Many people do not have a visible work profile because of their illegality. Will a consequence of the Bill be to force people out of the shadows, through sheer destitution? Is it not time to address the issue of people who are already here, but who are undocumented? Deportation will not be a remedy if literally tens of thousands of people are to be turfed out of work, to appear on the radar of public policy makers.</p>

<p><a name="st_o315"><a name="07020518000034"><a name="70205-0013.htm_spnew1"><a name="07020518000052"><b>Mr. Stewart Jackson:</b>
 I agree with most of what the hon. Gentleman is saying, but I hope that that does not have too negative an effect on his deputy leadership campaign; I wish him well with that. Does he agree that the problem to which he alludes is partly caused by the great deal of time that it has taken the Government to look again at the Office for National Statistics and the measurement of legal and illegal immigration, if it is possible to measure the latter? Unfortunately, the burden of taking proactive action has fallen on a small number of local authorities, including the London borough of Barking and Dagenham, authorities in Slough, and Peterborough city council. They have pushed the Government into setting up, through the ONS, a migration work force study, but that should have been done many months, if not years, ago.</p>

<p><a name="st_o316"><a name="07020518000035"><a name="70205-0013.htm_spnew2"><a name="07020518000053"><b>Jon Cruddas:</b>
 I totally agree with that. That was an element of the Queen&#146;s Speech debate on the future of the ONS and the acceptance that it does not carry out a rigorous analysis of the population and the demographics of the country. That is especially the case in urban environments because of the sheer velocity of change in many communities&#151;change that has taken place off the radar of public policy makers because it has occurred since the census data of 2001. That is also especially true in communities such as mine, where we have the lowest-cost housing market in Greater London. That has served as a sort of magnetic pull to migrants into London and within London in search of low-cost housing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o183"><a name="70205-0013.htm_para10"><a name="07020518000036">I take the point made by the hon. Member for Peterborough (Mr. Jackson). My point is whether the Bill, as part of an overall overhaul of the Home Office, will simply serve to compound the exploitation of these groups of people who have been around the system for many years and who will not be taken out of the country, not least because the unit cost is so high and because there are thousands of them. If there are 320,000 such people in London and if the Bill does what it seeks to do, tens of thousands of people will turn up on the public radar in abject and desperate need of help. We will not remove them from the country; therefore we need an adequate public policy response in anticipation of those consequences of the Bill. Surely that is not too much to ask.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o184"><a name="70205-0013.htm_para11"><a name="07020518000037">The matter should be adequately addressed through a wider debate around the consequences of clauses 23 and 24. I fear that, if we do not do that, we might well  <br>

be building a major series of social problems for ourselves as, through sheer destitution, those who currently have no visibility are forced into the public realm. We should acknowledge the consequences of that as we discuss the Bill.</p>

 I am conscious as I begin my remarks that I am in the presence of the hon. Members for Keighley (Mrs. Cryer) and for Dagenham (Jon Cruddas), both of whom have had issues around the growth of the extremist and racist politics of the British National party. An unfortunate aspect of my election to Parliament on 5 May 2005 was that a candidate standing for &#147;National Front&#151;Britons Not Refugees&#148; polled 931 votes in the Peterborough constituency. None of us here should have any truck with the racists and extremists of the right or give them any credibility.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o185"><a name="70205-0013.htm_para12"><a name="07020523000002">The Bill is a sort of reverse curate&#146;s egg; it is generally quite good, but bad in parts. There are some aspects on which all Conservative Members could agree. We agree with the five-year plan established in 2005 that proposes a points-based scheme. I am delighted to see that the Government have adopted a Conservative policy, one which we expounded at the 2005 general election.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o186"><a name="70205-0013.htm_para13"><a name="07020523000003">I am disappointed in many aspects, such as ID cards and the fact that, as Conservative and Liberal Democrat Front-Bench spokesmen have said, we do not have a consolidated Bill to consolidate all six previous Bills of the last nine years. We do not have an integrated borders agency, and the Minister did not make the case as to why that was.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o187"><a name="70205-0013.htm_para14"><a name="07020523000004">I agree with much that the hon. Member for Dagenham said, which brought back an experience I had a few months ago when I went out with regulatory authorities, including the police and trading standards officers, in the central ward of my constituency, which is approximately 70 per cent Kashmiri. I went into a restaurant and in the basement was a room full of about 14 bunks, as well as rosaries and candles. They belonged to people on the very margins of society&#151; Polish immigrants who were being paid a pittance to be picked up in white vans and taken to pick vegetables in south Lincolnshire. Those exploited people are the by-products of a system that is not working, over which the Government have presided.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o188"><a name="70205-0013.htm_para15"><a name="07020523000005">The hon. Member for Walthamstow (Mr. Gerrard), who is not in his place, said that there was an element of overreaction to tabloid pressure in this Bill. It is reactive and hasty and driven by a media agenda, and essentially, it fails to protect our borders. Most importantly, it fails to meet the Home Secretary&#146;s undertakings, prior to the foreign prisoners debacle last May, that the system would be simplified, especially in the case of any new legislation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o189"><a name="70205-0013.htm_para16"><a name="07020523000006">The Bill does not do anything to rectify permanently the systemic failures in the Home Office, and ignores key challenges in existing legislation that will militate against the effectiveness of the legislation. I referred earlier to the Human Rights Act and to the European convention on human rights. I am afraid that I received an unsatisfactory reply from the Minister for Immigration, Citizenship and Nationality who, uncharacteristically,  <br>

made a partisan point about previous election campaigns. I was not talking about that; I was talking about the operation of the new Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o190"><a name="70205-0013.htm_para17"><a name="07020523000007">The Bill is complicated and smacks of authoritarian gimmickry. We must look at it in the context of the Government&#146;s record. Forgive me, Mr. Deputy Speaker, I will be partisan: it is a shambolic record, which has delivered the foreign prisoners debacle. One hundred and twenty-nine of the original 1,023 identified by the right hon. Member for Norwich, South (Mr. Clarke) in April last year have been deported, 79 of whom had committed serious offences.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o191"><a name="70205-0013.htm_para18"><a name="07020523000008">I have a personal interest in the issue. I have a category B prison in my constituency, HMP Peterborough. On 29 April, I asked a named-day written question to find out how many prisoners were released in the 12 months to 31 March 2006 from Peterborough prison. It was not a difficult question; it was not technical and would not require huge manpower or resources to find the answer. I got the answer eight months later after tackling the Prime Minister on 11 October at Prime Minister&#146;s questions, raising two points of order with the Speaker and tabling several more questions to Home Office Ministers. That is unacceptable. In pursuit of my proper business&#151;holding the Executive to account on something straightforward&#151;all I got was a blank wall and obfuscation from the Home Office about an issue of concern to my constituents.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o192"><a name="70205-0013.htm_para19"><a name="07020523000009">There is a postscript. We have now learnt that 55 prisoners were released and the Home Office is now refusing to tell me what they were convicted of, because to do so would incur disproportionate cost. Again, that is unacceptable. I do not blame the Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department, the hon. Member for Enfield, North (Joan Ryan), but I will be in correspondence with her colleagues on the issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o193"><a name="70205-0013.htm_para20"><a name="07020523000010">The specialist team that was set up to track down these foreign prisoners closed down last June for no reason. In the media, if not necessarily in this House, the Home Secretary said that prisoners from outside the EU should be bribed with &#163;2,500 of public money&#151;money that my hardworking families in Peterborough have contributed to the Exchequer&#151;to go home. What sort of system is that?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o194"><a name="70205-0013.htm_para21"><a name="07020523000011">The cost of the IND to the Exchequer went from &#163;300 million in 1999 to &#163;1.9 billion in 2004 and it is still projected that, within the next two fiscal years, the figure will be &#163;1.5 billion. It is a good thing that staff there are not getting performance-related pay, as it has been a shambles and a disaster.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o195"><a name="70205-0013.htm_para22"><a name="07020523000012">Since 1997 about 375,000 asylum seekers have entered the United Kingdom. We have confirmation that only 85,000 have left. Those figures are from the Home Office. Even as recently as the third quarter of last year, we learned that the number of removals of asylum seekers had dropped by 28 per cent. Despite the Government&#146;s rhetoric, the macho posturing of the Home Secretary and his undertaking to deal with the issue and to get tough&#151;he said that he stood shoulder to shoulder with the people&#151;that did not happen. Unfortunately, like many of the Prime Minister&#146;s promises, that promise was broken.</p>

the United Kingdom in the past eight years. That brings me to the point that I raised in an intervention with respect to EU migrants. I accept that that is not strictly covered by the Bill, but such wrong-headedness, a projection that was so way out, does not inspire one with confidence in Home Office projections. There has been a particularly negative effect on community cohesion issues in my constituency, not necessarily affecting white Anglo-Saxon Protestant residents, but affecting the established Kashmiri-Pakistani community which has been in Peterborough since the 1960s and 1970s.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o197"><a name="70205-0013.htm_para24"><a name="07020523000014">I am proud to be the Member of Parliament for a diverse constituency where we speak 93 languages and get on extremely well. Two years ago one of our councillors from Kashmir had the honour to be the city mayor. The fact that he was a Conservative was a bonus. The Central ward is represented by three Pakistani Conservative councillors. The reason I feel passionate about these matters is that I do not want to give an opening to the racists to foment trouble. The United Kingdom Independence party is in many respects on the fringes of that debate. It is the respectable side of the British National party.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o198"><a name="70205-0013.htm_para25"><a name="07020523000015">Intolerable stress has been placed on housing, with families of 14 or 16 living in a small terraced house. Unscrupulous landlords have been buying up almost entire streets in an established area in the city centre. Primary care services have been under massive pressure, and we have had huge problems at our local primary schools with children whose first language is not English. We have not had the funding to deal with those issues and reassure people that migration is controlled and that they need not worry about people with different languages and cultures. That is the problem.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o199"><a name="70205-0013.htm_para26"><a name="07020523000016">I am conscious that others want to speak, so I shall end with my two specific concerns about the Bill. Clauses 28 to 35 deal with deportation. I made the point to the Minister earlier about the Human Rights Act 1998, but he dismissed it. The clich&#233; about the elephant in the room seems appropriate. If we do not consider the interpretation and the ramifications of the Human Rights Act and realise that it will be used, or abused, by those who should not use it, we will not reach the objectives of the Bill in respect of deportation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o200"><a name="70205-0013.htm_para27"><a name="07020523000017">I understand that the provision derives from the Chahal decision of 1996 and the European convention on human rights, but it is foolish to include in the Bill clauses that solidify a legalistic loophole. That will lead to obfuscation, delay and frustration in the system. Even if the Bill becomes law, the powers will be too lax. I referred earlier to the operational enforcement manual, which concedes that judges can only be advised in respect of determination&#151;it is not part of the law at present. That is a mistake.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o201"><a name="70205-0013.htm_para28"><a name="07020523000018">There are 9,651 foreign prisoners in UK prisons, up from 4,677 in 1997. Against that background and the problems that we will have dealing with them in future, I asked the Minister some specific questions, which I hope the Under-Secretary will be able to answer. Why do we still not collect statistics on those who have been recommended for deportation and those who are actually deported? That, as far as I know, is the current situation. Members of Parliament are regularly told that that information is not collected centrally.</p>

Why is there not an automatic presumption in favour of deportation following serious criminal behaviour? People are not sentenced to 12 months&#146; imprisonment or more for not paying their TV licence. Violence, sexual offences and drug offences come to mind in relation to such a sentence. Why are central records not kept on the immigration status of all those in the prison estate who have been convicted? I do not see the point of another Bill if previous Acts are not adhered to. Why is the Home Secretary not able to use the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 to deport criminals? The Act allows the Government to do so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o203"><a name="70205-0013.htm_para30"><a name="07020523000020">The second issue of concern is biometric immigration documents. In a good intervention, the hon. Member for Walthamstow sought reassurance, as do I. The measure smacks of sleight of hand with regard to ID cards&#151;function creep, one might call it. It seeks to embed the concept of ID cards, which may be voluntary in a few years, in the public psyche, using immigration control and the so-called war against terror as the rationale. It is not right for the House to accept that rationale and the construction of an ID database under that cover. If the raison d&#146;être of the proposal and the clauses is to deal with illegal working, why have the Government not made more use of the relevant existing legislation&#151;the Asylum and Immigration Act 1996?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o204"><a name="70205-0013.htm_para31"><a name="07020523000021">Finally, the Bill contains much that I would support if it were enacted, but there is a long way to go to repair the damage done to the security of the country by the Government&#146;s open-door immigration policy over the past 10 years. The Bill is 10 years too late. The public, sadly, do not believe a word the Government say about immigration. That is a testament to the culture of spin and obfuscation. It all began back in 1997 with the decision to rescind the bilateral agreement with France. That was followed by Sangatte and the green light, and the process has continued ever since. I hope the Bill will go some way towards ameliorating the calamitous series of policy failures, but only a Conservative Government will have the political will and the nous to protect our borders and our people.</p>

 I welcome the Second Reading of the UK Borders Bill, especially the aspects of it that deal with illegal immigrants and with human trafficking. I also welcome the setting up of the new centre in Sheffield to deal with trafficking, and the changes in the law that will enable prosecutions to take place regardless of whether the act of human trafficking has taken place inside or outside the UK, and irrespective of the nationality of the person carrying out the act. I trust that those measures will lead to a marked reduction in the sum total of human misery perpetuated frequently on vulnerable women and children.</p>

As an old-fashioned socialist and a believer in a planned economy, I have never been able to understand the attraction of an open-door policy. To plan future provision in education, health and so on, we must have some idea of how many we are catering for at any given time. This is another good reason for the introduction of ID cards. They will not defeat terrorism, but they will give us a more accurate idea of how many citizens will need the different kinds of provision in the coming years, and even of how many will not be entitled to it.</p>

The forced marriages unit has confirmed that, to date, no one has been prosecuted under current legislation. Despite the increased awareness of forced marriage, the number of cases increases. This might be attributable to the demographics involved&#151;a relatively youthful population reaching marriageable age. Sending the right message&#151;that forced marriage is both illegal and un-Islamic&#151;would have a powerful deterrent effect.</p>

 My hon. Friend mentioned that the practice of forced marriage was un-Islamic. Does she agree that it is not only an issue for the Muslim community, and that forced marriage is just as much of a problem in other communities and faith groups?

We now have the forced marriages unit, which helps about 350 girls a year&#151;plus some men&#151;to avoid or to find their way round the practice of forced marriage. That work is carrying on apace. I am disappointed, however, that we do not have a specific criminal offence of forced marriage. A Member of the other place&#151;I am sorry, but I cannot remember his name&#151;introduced a private Member&#146;s Bill the other week to establish a civil offence of forcing to marry.

There are few, if any, prosecutions for not wearing a seat belt, but that does not detract from the usefulness and effectiveness of the legislation involved, which has altered behaviour. Could this apply to a criminal offence of forcing to marry? It is a crime against humanity, and therefore merits its own criminal offence.

 I pay tribute to the hon. Lady for her tenacity in dealing with this ongoing problem, not only in her constituency but nationwide. Does she accept, however, that, among many of the faith communities, arranged marriages are often very successful? In those circumstances, young people are introduced but there is no coercion to marry. It is left up to the young people to decide whether they could have a happy life together. Does she agree that that kind of halfway house might provide a way for us to make inroads into preventing forced marriages, by offering it as an acceptable cultural alternative?</p>

 There is absolutely nothing wrong with arranged marriages. I have many friends who have gone through that procedure very successfully. Dare I suggest that an arranged marriage is probably preferable to our own way of doing things: going down to a disco, picking up a girl or a boy and seeing what happens? However, I am not talking about arranged marriages here; I am talking about forced marriages, which are quite different. The many girls in my constituency whom I have helped can easily identify the difference between a forced marriage and an arranged marriage.</p>

Such a change would allow individuals to make a more mature choice and would permit young people to complete further and higher education without the threat of a marriage. Such an increase has been adopted in Denmark and, as far as we know, there has been no negative press, despite the increase being to the age of 24. The change might indirectly encourage more marriage within the settled community, as people might choose to marry someone they knew here rather than waiting for someone unknown and possibly unsuitable.</p>

This would give an extra meaning to citizenship. On arrival in this country, Commonwealth citizens are already allowed to vote, and they can claim benefits on receipt of indefinite leave to remain. Why, therefore, should they seek citizenship? This change would ensure that marriages being used as vehicles to get round the immigration rules would be challenged. At present, someone getting a divorce after obtaining ILR would be allowed a new settlement application from a new spouse. In theory, one person could marry  <br>

<p><a name="stpa_o211"><a name="70205-0014.htm_para6"><a name="07020523000035">May I also suggest that we encourage the learning of English prior to granting someone entry clearance as a spouse, for work or as a student? Applicants should be required to take a test in limited basic English before being granted entry. For example, English for Speakers of Other Languages&#151;ESOL&#151;Skills for Life level 1 offers a minimum standard. That should be followed by an undertaking to participate in English and citizenship classes during the two-year probationary period for ILR. The Dutch have a similar system, and insist on the speaking of Dutch as a prerequisite for ILR. Other countries are moving in a similar direction. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o212"><a name="70205-0014.htm_para7"><a name="07020523000036">Such a provision could be encouraged through international development, especially for girls. If people wanted their daughters to reap the economic benefits of the UK, they would need to ensure that they were sufficiently educated to speak English before they could obtain ILR. When a woman understands English, she also understands her rights. That is an important factor for many women in my constituency. Failure to reach the required standard of English must lead to the withholding of ILR and even deportation; otherwise, the condition will have no effect.</p>

I recognise that there will be a requirement for English prior to ILR from April. However, is my hon. Friend the Minister satisfied with the quality and quantity of ESOL teaching in areas such as Bradford, and with the testing of the applicants? I am not happy about that; a great hole needs to be filled through the teaching of English as a second language. We are falling well short at the moment.</p>

 I welcome a number of items in the Bill. When it was published, the Minister laid out in a press statement a number of additional proposed powers for immigration officers: to arrest people smugglers or traffickers, which is to be welcomed; to detain at ports those whom they suspect of having committed a crime; and to arrest those believed to have been fraudulently acquiring asylum support, which is also to be welcomed.</p>

I was surprised, as were many journalists, that the powers proposed were not already in place. It seemed extraordinary that immigration officers did not have the power to arrest people smugglers or even to detain those whom they believed may have committed a crime. It was even more extraordinary given that since Labour came to power in 1997 there have been immigration Acts plus various crime Acts and terrorism Acts almost every year&#151;the Special Immigration Appeals Commission Act 1997, the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999, the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 and the measures taken in 2004 and 2006.</p>

In June 2000, following the deaths of 58 people in the back of a refrigerated wagon, the then Home Secretary, the right hon. Member for Blackburn (Mr. Straw), said that discussions were ongoing about improving port security. In January 2002, another Home Secretary, the right hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett), announced that the maximum jail sentence for people traffickers would increase to 14 years. In 2002, during the Sangatte crisis, the Prime Minister said that Navy ships would intercept people traffickers, as long as they were not in the channel tunnel, when we would need submarines&#151;actually, he did not say that last bit. By 2003, the BBC reported that a senior Metropolitan police officer had warned of a growing threat, and by April last year, the Prime Minister announced that Serious Organised Crime Agency law enforcement officers would target people traffickers.</p>

I welcome those powers. However, the hon. Member for Thurrock (Andrew Mackinlay) mentioned an anomaly, which the Law Society of Scotland has laid out clearly. It asked why, notwithstanding the non-application of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 in Scotland, immigration officers should not have the power of detention. It went on to ask why clause 21, which relates to the forfeiture of detained property, applies only to England, Wales and Northern Ireland.</p>

Don&#146;t touch it!&#148;, although I am sure that it was slightly more detailed than that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o221"><a name="70205-0014.htm_para16"><a name="07020530000012">The Bill also includes the introduction of biometric identity cards for a class of people. Let me return for a moment to the debate on identity cards proper. The London School of Economics identity project report of June 2005 has been much quoted, particularly in respect of the costs and practicality of the Identity Cards Act 2006, to which I turn to emphasise a point about this Bill. Chapter 10 of the report, entitled &#147;Race, Discrimination, Immigration and Policing&#148;, stated:</p>
<a name="70205-0014.htm_brev0"><a name="07020530000087"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Throughout the world, identity cards are associated with discrimination ... individuals may be compelled to produce those cards ... In every country that grants this power to their police, questions inevitably arise as to whether this power is used ... disproportionately, against immigrants, minorities, or other selected groups.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o222"><a name="70205-0014.htm_para17"><a name="07020530000013">It states that the then Identity Cards Bill</p>
<a name="70205-0014.htm_brev1"><a name="07020530000088"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;does not grant police the power to compel production.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o223"><a name="70205-0014.htm_para18"><a name="07020530000014">However, there is a real concern that this Bill may grant powers not only to the police but to others, authorised and possibly non-authorised. Clause 5(1)(b) states that regulations&#151;not primary legislation&#151;could require</p>
<a name="70205-0014.htm_brev2"><a name="07020530000089"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;a biometric immigration document to be used...in specified circumstances, where a question arises about a person&#146;s status in relation to nationality or immigration&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o224"><a name="70205-0014.htm_para19"><a name="07020530000015">The Library briefing states:</p>
<a name="70205-0014.htm_brev3"><a name="07020530000090"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;This could potentially be very wide, covering for example: employment; access to benefits, NHS healthcare&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o225"><a name="70205-0014.htm_para20"><a name="07020530000016">and so on. Is that not a de facto requirement or compulsion? I look forward to what the Minister has to say about that. We could combine that information with the concerns raised in the Liberty briefing provided for this debate, which said:</p>
<a name="70205-0014.htm_brev4"><a name="07020530000091"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;In September 2004, <i> The Guardian</i>...ran a story claiming that in the previous 15 months, 235 operations had been conducted adding &#145;The figures showed that those arrested included 717 failed asylum seekers but thousands more people have been stopped and questioned by immigration staff using powers which the police are banned from using.&#146;...The creation of the biometric immigration document has the potential to be racially divisive.&#148;</p>

 The Minister is shaking his head, and I was pleased when he explained earlier that that was not the case. However, when one reads the words in the Bill, there appears to be the potential at least&#151;particularly if regulations are drafted widely rather than tightly&#151;for that to be a real fear.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o227"><a name="70205-0014.htm_para22"><a name="07020530000020">Perversely, the issue of a Government biometric ID card may be seen by some as validating a false identity. As I have said in previous debates, at present people arrive in the UK with fake, forged or stolen identities sufficiently robust to get in. That may well happen in future, but those fake, false or stolen identities will be turned into valid ones through the issue of a UK Government biometric card. We also know that many people who arrive here destroy their own, sometimes valid, documents and papers en route. I am concerned that the expectation of receiving a UK biometric identity card may encourage more people to do that, making the action of tracing people who are here legally or illegally all the more difficult.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o228"><a name="70205-0014.htm_para23"><a name="07020530000021">Finally, I have some anxiety about the implementation of the scheme, not least because although the Office for National Statistics says that 4 million non-EU citizens have migrated to the UK since 1995, the accurate figure of those who have stayed is almost certainly incalculable. Although clause 5(2)(a) envisages a gradual roll-out for those staying more than three months, and then only on application to extend their stay, we know that the re-application period depends on the type of visa and may not be complete until two, three or four years after people arrive. There is a danger that we will end up with a two-tier system, with those who are here legally re-applying and having the biometric document, and those who are here legally but who do not have the biometric document. We could have a three-tier system, because of the problem of dealing with those who are hiding or cannot be traced.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o229"><a name="70205-0014.htm_para24"><a name="07020530000022">I hope that the Minister can comment on the powers for immigration officers not being applicable to Scotland; on the reasons for the difference in forfeiture between Scotland and England; on the assurances given on the compulsory use of the biometric ID card; on the risk assessment of whether the biometric card can be seen as a validation of a fake ID for people who come here; and on the costs and time scales for the implementation of the system.</p>

In theory, they are waiting to be deported, but the practicality, in my constituency at least, is that because many hail from Somalia, there are problems with deporting them because of the difficult circumstances in that country. As such, many of them are likely to remain in this country for years to come.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o230"><a name="70205-0015.htm_para0"><a name="07020530000024">That is the context of my comments. My constituency in the city of Bristol, like the constituencies of many hon. Members in the Chamber, has seen the arrival of new migrant workers, but I want to talk about the impact of what are generically referred to as asylum seekers. Before I make more detailed points, however, I want to make it clear that it is my passionate belief that Bristol has benefited hugely from the contribution made by its various immigrant communities over the years, including those who have arrived here seeking asylum. I did not recognise the picture painted by the hon. Member for Monmouth (David T.C. Davies). He seemed to think that Huguenots, Jews and people from Uganda were okay. I would flag up the Irish community, people who have come down from Scotland, Afro-Caribbean communities, Somali communities, Pakistani-Kashmiri communities and Indian communities as communities that have all settled well in Bristol and contribute to life there. That is why I pressed him on the point and tried to get out of him exactly who was causing so much trouble in his area.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o231"><a name="70205-0015.htm_para1"><a name="07020530000025">Businesses in my constituency have told me that they would be unable to fill job vacancies were it not for the arrival of fairly significant numbers of people from Somalia and, more recently, eastern European migrant workers. Although unemployment in Bristol is low by recent historical standards, their comments raise interesting questions about the skills levels and the employability of the long-term unemployed who do not come from those groups, but that is probably a subject for another day.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o232"><a name="70205-0015.htm_para2"><a name="07020530000026">When I have visited schools in my constituency, I have met children from refugee and migrant communities, some of whom did not speak a word of English before they started school&#151;indeed, some had never set foot in a classroom before. I have seen how well they have adapted to life here and how fluent they have become in the English language after only a few months in the city. They are to be commended for that. It is indicative that the city academy in my constituency, which has a high proportion of refugees, asylum seekers and children of migrant workers among its pupils, recently made it into the top 100 schools in the country in the contextual value added tables. That shows just how much these children can overcome. Having gone through horrendous experiences in their countries, they can achieve a huge amount in a small time, given the right support.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o233"><a name="70205-0015.htm_para3"><a name="07020530000027">I am proud of the way in which Bristol and my constituency in particular, which contains the most diverse areas of the city, have coped with the changes over recent years.

I am listening with interest to how the hon. Lady&#146;s argument is developing. Is she saying that this country could cope with a much greater level of immigration than we have had in recent years?</p>

 It very much depends on how we would handle that. I accept that we need controls on immigration, but in some cases there is an economic need to allow in more migrant workers, particularly skilled migrant workers, on which the Government have already legislated. For those people who come here seeking asylum, we have a humanitarian duty to give them refuge. It is not a numbers game; it is a moral case.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o234"><a name="70205-0015.htm_para4"><a name="07020530000030">It would be foolish to present a completely rose-tinted picture of what community relations are like in Bristol. Although I believe that the vast majority of people in the city are sympathetic to the needs of genuine refugees and have given them great support, there is undeniably resentment and tension, especially in some of the white working-class areas of my constituency where a serious shortage of affordable housing, pressure on public services, and competition for regeneration funding and even for fairly small pots of money can cause tension. Some people in those communities feel that their needs have been overlooked. That is why I welcome the Bill. It is important that we reassure people that the asylum and immigration system is not a free-for-all and is based on genuine need, whether it be the need of asylum seekers for a safe haven from persecution or our economic need for migrant workers. It is in the interests of all the genuine asylum seekers in my constituency and the migrant workers who have filled the jobs that could not otherwise have been filled that we make it clear that Britain does not and will not tolerate abuse of its asylum and immigration system. I welcome the Bill as another step in tightening up our laws.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o235"><a name="70205-0015.htm_para5"><a name="07020530000031">I want to focus on a couple of measures. The introduction of biometric registration and identity cards will give us a means of identifying who a person is, what their immigration status is and whether they are entitled to work or to access state benefits. My hon. Friend the Member for Walthamstow (Mr. Gerrard) and others said that that will not only help us to identify those who are not entitled to be here or to claim benefits, but will also help those who are entitled to those things.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o236"><a name="70205-0015.htm_para6"><a name="07020530000032">I regularly deal with constituents who have leave to remain in this country and are entitled to work but who have a hard time convincing employers of that fact. The Royal Mail, for example, refuses to use the immigration and nationality directorate&#146;s employers hotline and insists that employees produce a new letter from the Home Office every 13 weeks, which harks back to the infamous 13-weeks letters that people used to get, telling them when their case would be dealt with. Every 13 weeks constituents come to me requiring another letter that they can show to the Royal Mail confirming their eligibility to work. I would welcome anything that makes life easier for them.</p>

For example, people at the tax credits office have confused constituents of mine with people with similar names and the same date of birth, and they have demanded the return of overpayments from them. Again, that could be solved if they had an identity card. It took the best part of a year to convince the office that it was pursuing the wrong person, so I very much welcome that aspect of the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o238"><a name="70205-0015.htm_para8"><a name="07020530000034">The other part of the Bill that I want to discuss deals with foreign prisoners, and introduces the assumption of automatic deportation for those who have been sentenced to 12 months or more in custody. It is with some trepidation that I raise the issue, given its sensitivity, but both the hon. Member for Bromsgrove (Miss Kirkbride) and the hon. Member for Monmouth mentioned the case of the Somali man who last week was convicted of a very serious sexual assault on a seven-year-old girl. He happens to be a constituent of mine, and the assault was made on another constituent of mine in the Barton Hill area of my constituency. The case raises a huge number of complex issues. I certainly would not say that I have the answer to the question of how we should deal with someone in that position, but it is worth airing some of the issues that it raises.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o239"><a name="70205-0015.htm_para9"><a name="07020530000035">The man in question, Sadiq Mohammed, is of Somali descent. He arrived in the United Kingdom in 1994, and after claiming asylum was given indefinite leave to remain. In 2000 he was convicted of several assaults on women, including one on a 14-year-old girl&#151;although I believe in that case the charge was only one of common assault, nowhere near as serious as the most recent assault. Deportation was recommended, but, although not all the facts have emerged, we know that it was not carried out. I suspect that that was either because Mohammed had already been given indefinite leave to remain, or because of the continuing instability in Somalia.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o240"><a name="70205-0015.htm_para10"><a name="07020530000036">Mohammed served two years of his four-year sentence. Several years after his release, he carried out the appalling attack on the seven-year-old. Thankfully he was caught and has now been given an indeterminate sentence, but the question of whether he should now be deported has been raised by many of my constituents. Although there is no doubt that he is of Somali descent, it is now being suggested that he may be a Kenyan national who has never set foot in Somalia, and who claimed asylum on false pretences. Before Opposition Members try to use that against us, I should say that I gather his original claim was made before Labour came to office. In any event, many of my constituents believe that even if he were returned to Somalia, whatever risk of persecution or torture he might run as a result of deportation, by carrying out that appalling attack he has surrendered any claim to our compassion. Quite simply, they do not care what happens to him in Somalia or any other country to which he might be sent. They just want to ensure that he is never again free to walk the streets of Barton Hill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o241"><a name="70205-0015.htm_para11"><a name="07020530000037">I should add that those who are calling most vociferously for Mohammed&#146;s deportation are members of the Somali community. That may be because the victim was a Somali child, but they have told me that, as refugees  <br>

<p><a name="stpa_o242"><a name="70205-0015.htm_para12"><a name="07020530000038">As I have said, the case is complex. As someone who has been accepted as a refugee, Mohammed has rights under the European convention on human rights and the Geneva convention, but I understand that even under current legislation, those rights can be overridden in the case of someone who has been convicted of a serious offence if he is considered to present a clear and grave danger to the community. Mohammed may therefore be eligible for deportation. I should welcome clarification of that point.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o243"><a name="70205-0015.htm_para13"><a name="07020530000039">I should also welcome clarification of what will happen to people who have been given indeterminate sentences. At what stage of their sentences will deportation be considered? The Minister has expressed the view that people should be deported as early in their sentences as possible, but there is a very high risk that Mohammed will reoffend&#151;he had already carried out a series of attacks before the most recent assault&#151;and the effects on any future victim would last a lifetime. How can we ensure that we do not merely export the problem?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o244"><a name="70205-0015.htm_para14"><a name="07020530000040">Obviously, as a constituency Member I feel that my priority is the welfare of the children living in my constituency, but if it is decided to deport Mohammed early in his sentence, who knows whether he will be allowed to walk the streets of Somalia, Kenya or wherever else he may be sent? Do we wash our hands of such people when they are deported, or do we still have a moral obligation to try to minimise the risk of their posing a risk to children elsewhere? People who had received lengthy prison sentences for, say, drug offences or serious violence would not be so obviously a risk to the community to which they were being sent. In cases in which children are the victims, we need to ask ourselves some serious questions.</p>

level of immigration that will benefit the country while taking account of the labour market, public services and environmental and infrastructure issues. Parliament should hold a proper debate about demographics&#151;population levels and distribution&#151;every year, because circumstances change. In one year, the number of people required to come into the country might be very low, while in another year it might be very high. That debate should also take account of issues such as the number of people leaving the country, the availability of houses and jobs, skills shortages, and the number of places available in our schools and on our GP lists. A range of issues feed into the number of new people we need in the country, and those should be the subject of open debate. I hope the Government will allow that.</p>

 I thank my hon. Friend for that intervention. I have not attended an equivalent ceremony in my town hall.

Often, they excel and outrun the indigenous children. There is a great lesson for us to learn there.

the environment of the port or airport, or will they be in the next town down the road? If they are in the nearest police station, suppose it takes them more than three hours to arrive. It is possible that there will not be a police officer available to attend within the three hours, so what then? Clearly, there will be serious doubt about the individual's right of entry. They cannot be detained any longer because the three hours have expired, so what happens next? They cannot leave the port or the airport. Do they just go to the back of the queue and start queuing again? We need clarification on what will happen. All those problems could be overcome with borders police, because they would have the skills and authority to deal with the issues at the same time.</p>

We must address those serious issues if we are to ensure that such draconian powers are used properly. Absconding from detention and/or assaulting an immigration officer attracts a &#163;5,000 fine, which is a huge sum. Obstruction attracts a &#163;1,000 fine. There is only a thin likelihood that offenders would have the means to pay such fines. If they do not have the means, the fines are pointless. All three offences are punishable with a prison sentence of up to 51 weeks, which is just one week short of the year that is required to trigger the automatic detention rules. Why make it necessary for a separate application to deport someone in such cases? The meaning of &#147;automatic&#148; is unclear in that context. Does it mean that there will not be a right of appeal? Of course not&#151;the use of &#147;automatic&#148; is rhetorical, because there is no such thing as automatic deportation.</p>

We all have the good will to try to move towards that end, and the new offence of dishonestly obtaining asylum support, the restriction on late evidence in appeals, the seizure of cash and property connected to crime, and new offences relating to the employment of illegal workers are all welcome. However, the use of biometric data, even under the special circumstances detailed in the Bill, must be approached with extreme caution. The same caveats apply to that narrow use as to the introduction of general identity cards, and the issue gives rise to many questions. For example, what information may be stored, and for how long? How secure is it, and to whom is it accessible? All those arguments emerged in the debate on ID cards and they apply just as much in this case as they do to the more general issue. It could be the thin end of a very large wedge, as it may be softening us up for the highly controversial introduction of compulsory ID cards for everyone.</p>

I understand that we have agreed to sign the 2005 Council of Europe convention on action against trafficking in human beings. As I served on the Council of Europe committee that introduced that proposal, I take a particularly close interest in the matter. We should establish a UK border police force with the expertise&#151;it is specific expertise, not just casual observation&#151;to intercept traffickers and their victims at our borders. We should ensure that separate interviews are given, at all points of entry, to women and children travelling with an adult who is not their parent, guardian or husband, so that we can identify potential victims. We must strengthen co-ordination between the relevant Government Departments and the Serious Organised Crime Agency to ensure a coherent, joined-up approach. We must ensure that every police force and local authority has a strategy to deal with the suspected victims of trafficking. We should set up a helpline to provide information for women who have been trafficked and for people who suspect that others are the victims or perpetrators of exploitation.</p>

 Does my hon. Friend agree that a basic reason for that problem is the introduction of the Human Rights Act 1998?

We are discussing exactly the sort of fear that the British National party is feeding on, particularly in areas of our country where there are very few immigrants. It appears to focus on areas where there are few immigrants and to frighten the people who live there by saying, &#147;If you don&#146;t do something, your area will end up like that area over there where there are large numbers of immigrants.&#148; They then paint the picture that none of those immigrants makes any contribution at all to the life of the country. We must bear in mind such strategies and guard against them. The way to do that is to be absolutely open with people and explain to them that we are putting in place a robust system that is fair to everybody&#151;to those wanting to come in and to those already here.</p>

If it will, an alternative solution must be found to deal robustly with foreign offenders from that category of country so that they are not free from the threat of deportation no matter how often they offend or how grave their offence.</p>

It is intolerable that this country should have to assume permanent responsibility for foreign offenders who cannot be sent back to their country of origin. There must be another answer. We cannot simply be responsible for them for the rest of their lives because it is unsafe for them to go back to their country of origin.</p>

That would deter both individuals such as those who come into our country every day in the backs of lorries or by other means and the professional traffickers who exploit both the people who pay them and every taxpayer in our country&#151;the host country. There would be every incentive for new arrivals who want to contribute to the life of the country to enter the country legally, and we would begin&#151;but only begin&#151;to regain control in respect of who is living here, how many there are, where they are and how they are occupied.</p>

 From my selfish point of view, I welcome the fact that Mr. Speaker did not impose time limits in the debate.

Does that show that this legislature has become weary of such piecemeal legislation dealing with the whole question of combating illegal immigration, ensuring the rights of people with genuine refugee problems and so forth? There is a need for a consolidation Act, but we should ensure that it is a good Act and that it undergoes full and rigorous parliamentary scrutiny if and when it appears before us in about a year&#146;s time.</p>

I hope that after one more push, people might come to see the compelling logic of having such a dedicated police force.</p>

If we had a highly mobile and dedicated force with all the available technology, it would be possible, and it does not happen at present. That is the compelling logic.</p>

If we had a dedicated borders police&#151;I prefer to call them police because people understand that term, but the terminology is not terribly important&#151;they could have all the powers that we are vesting in the various people referred to in the Bill. They could pursue and detect, and work with Home Office, Scots and Irish forces to ensure that wrongdoing such as people smuggling or the smuggling of illegal goods both in and out of the ports is combated; it has to be a two-way process. They would also be a great weapon against the potential for terrorism through our ports.</p>

for a national force. Those local port police do their best. On 23 January, the Port of Tilbury police detained three immigrants at the Tilbury-Gravesend ferry, which remains part of the port of Tilbury but is outside the customs boundary fence. The police believed that the three had entered the UK on the Ostend ferry, which arrives at Tilbury twice a day. The three were taken to the port police station, and the immigration officer for the port of Tilbury was contacted. Two immigration officers attended the port police station, but when the facts were relayed to them, they informed the police officers that it was outside their remit, as the immigrants had been found outside the port boundary. The matter would have to be dealt with by immigration at Stansted airport.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o285"><a name="70205-0016.htm_para24"><a name="07020535000010">The Port of Tilbury police tell me that in the past other illegal immigrants whom they have found within the curtilage of the port have been dealt with promptly. They have either been repatriated or allowed to remain in the UK, under controlled conditions, while their case was investigated. However, on the eve of the introduction of this legislation to the House of Commons it appears that the immigration service at Stansted&#151;which I find unsatisfactory in several respects&#151;is going the opposite way to what Ministers suggest. The Port of Tilbury police told me about an occasion on which nine immigrants were put on the ferry and sent back to Ostend, but that is not happening now.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o286"><a name="70205-0016.htm_para25"><a name="07020535000011">After the immigration people at the port of Tilbury said that the incident on 23 January was nothing to do with them, the understandably frustrated but diligent police officers contacted immigration at Stansted and informed it that three illegal immigrants had been taken into custody. After one and a half hours, the police were told that no immigration officers would attend and that the immigrants would have to be released. The Port of Tilbury police told me that they released the people following the receipt of a fax with those instructions.</p>

I conveyed this story to the Minister for Immigration, Citizenship and Nationality, who said, unreservedly, that it was unacceptable. The story buttresses my case for a border police who would deal with all such matters, so there would be no misunderstanding.</p>

The estuary of the River Thames covers three Government regions: Greater London, the south-east and the eastern region. For some reason, I am in the same patch as Cambridge and Peterborough. If the Minister does intend to take that approach, I hope that he will, exceptionally, break the existing boundaries and ensure that the Thames estuary is in one patch. Otherwise, the confusion will remain and we will see repeats of the incident of 23 January.</p>

 In fact, I wanted to refer to the example that the hon. Gentleman has just given. He calls for border police, but perhaps the issue is the location of immigration officers. I listened intently to his example, so perhaps he will comment on mine. For the seven years until 2004 there were twice as many immigration officers at Gatwick as in the whole of Scotland, yet in that period not one person entering the country illegally was apprehended at Gatwick, while there were 74 such cases in Scotland. Is not the problem simply that immigration officers are in the wrong place?</p>

 There is clearly a lack of leadership and proper management, too. The charge implicit in the hon. Gentleman&#146;s example is real. If there were a dedicated border police force with a proper chief constable, he or she would have command and control to deploy resources effectively around the United Kingdom. Such a force could carry out raids and then the bandits who exploit weak security at our ports would never be sure that a major exercise would not be mounted by a major police force. At present, we do not have the critical mass for that, so one of the attractions of a border police would be the ability to mount such operations.</p>

The explanatory notes give no clue apart from an unamplified reference to the Sewel convention. The convention rightly states that this place will not legislate for powers or competences that have been delegated to the Parliament in Edinburgh. I understand that, but I was surprised to find that these matters are devolved. Although I accept that my judgment was wrong and that apparently there are some devolved matters relating to the Bill, I none the less expected the Minister to tell us that he had reached agreement with the Scottish Executive, who would introduce comparable legislation within the same time frame. That would have been welcome, but instead the Minister constantly refers to discussions with ACPO Scotland and vague discussions with an unnamed member of the Scottish Executive. If the Bill is necessary in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, why is it, or comparable legislation, not necessary in Scotland?</p>

I want to see that information today, because a number of constitutional issues have been raised that it is our duty to understand. It is not sufficient to probe the Bill in Committee; it should be done on the Floor of the House, so I hope that the Minister will indicate either that the information is in the Library so that we can have a look at it or that he will clarify the position at the Dispatch Box.

 The hon.

train, there will be an awful lot of very bewildered and frightened people in abject poverty and alone, because they will have been smoked out. The remedy is not automatically to deport those people. Each case needs to be looked at sensitively.</p>

 My hon. Friend is making the very important point that some of the people who will be turned up will be simply unknown to the Home Office. For example, they might have come here perhaps a long time ago from countries without a visa regime, so they never had to apply for a visa, came here through a port and were given entry perhaps for six months. They will have simply stayed, and they will not appear on any Home Office record whatsoever.</p>

 When that happens, it will be incumbent on Members on both sides of the House to be sensitive. I understand that the role of Opposition is to criticise the Government, and as a Government Member, I am sensitive when the criticism has some validity, but one of the problems is that the immigration service, at Stansted in particular, has played the numbers game.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o294"><a name="70205-0017.htm_para5"><a name="07020535000035">I noticed that my hon. Friend the Member for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell) said a few days ago in <i> The Independent </i>how outraged he was about the way in which a very nice family had been treated by the immigration service. I know of similar circumstances caused by Stansted immigration service. At 6 o&#146;clock on a Sunday morning, the heavies of the immigration service turned up in a style not dissimilar from that which operated in central Europe in the 1930s, to get a family of nine. The Minister might not like that, but I can substantiate it: that is a fact. Some people get aggravated if they are woken up at 6.30 by Mr. Plod, but I am talking about a family.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o295"><a name="70205-0017.htm_para6"><a name="07020535000036">All hon. Members have an obligation to ensure that we do not go for the easy way of meeting targets and figures. Finding a family of nine helps with the figures. The single man is mobile, by definition, and much more difficult for Stansted immigration to track down. We in the House&#151;left and right&#151;have a common zeal to ensure that we combat illegal immigration and that there is the full application of the law, but we are all playing a numbers game in our different ways, and some of the most innocent people are often hit hardest, or even if they are not innocent, they are treated in a way that is, in my view, unacceptable. A family of nine do not abscond. They are in their beds at 6 o&#146;clock on a Sunday morning and it is wholly unacceptable for them to be subject to a raid at that time. I am pleased to have the opportunity of placing that view on the record in the House.</p>

When the Under-Secretary sums up, will she indicate whether there have been any discussions between the Government of the Irish Republic and the United Kingdom about how many people use the United Kingdom as a point of entry, coming here on visitors&#146; visas and entering illegally into the Irish Republic, and how many people go to Dublin to enter illegally into the United Kingdom? I imagine that the ratio is 50:50, but that does not make the situation any more acceptable. Is there sufficient scrutiny on our common land border and sufficient intelligence-gathering to see how people play having the two jurisdictions in the one common travel area? I hope that that has been looked at.</p>

We have all had experience of the rogues who rip off bewildered, frightened and almost penniless people. They pretend that they can get those people papers or some status in the United Kingdom. Not enough has been done to root those rogues out and bring them to court. If they are legally qualified, that should be pursued with the Law Society with a view to having them struck off. Whether they are legally qualified or not, there are too many of them committing criminal offences. I would have hoped that the immigration service or the Home Office, and the police service&#151;perhaps if we had the co-ordinated police service that we wanted&#151;could focus on that.

Member for Dundee, East and the bewilderment that we have not already got many of the powers in the Bill. One wonders why the provisions have not been brought before the House before. That probably is the fault not of successive Ministers, but of the civil servants, whose names I do not know, but who could and should have flagged up these deficiencies many Bills ago. We would be somewhat ahead of the issue if they had done so. On that note, I wish the Bill well.</p>

Back in 1997, there were no British National party councillors anywhere in the country; today, there are 50. The question we have to ask ourselves is: have people become more racist in the last 10 years? My view is that they have not, but I do think that they have become much more frustrated. One of the main issues that they have become frustrated about is the Government&#146;s lack of ability to deal with mass immigration. For a parliamentary democracy to work, everybody has  <br>

to feel that somebody is standing up for them and speaking about the things that concern them. Over the last 10 years&#151;largely due to the blight of political correctness&#151;people have felt that they have not been able to have their say and that these important issues have been neglected across both sides of the House. We neglect these issues at our peril, because extremists prosper in such a void. The solution to the problem of the growth of the BNP is in our hands. Most of the people who vote for the BNP these days are not racists; they are not nasty people. There will always been a hard core of racists in this country, but fortunately they will always be only a tiny number that will not make a great difference. The issue that we have to address is why many ordinary, decent people in this country added their votes to those of racists in such numbers that they allowed them to get a foothold in too many of our communities. The reason is that we have not been doing enough to tackle immigration.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o301"><a name="70205-0017.htm_para12"><a name="07020535000043">The scale of the problem is also part of the context. There is one migrant a minute coming into this country, which is equivalent to a city the size of Birmingham arriving every three years or so. Those are big numbers and this is a big problem. That is why people are crying out for mainstream parties to tackle the issue. Although I welcome many aspects of the Bill, it is a very inadequate response to the scale of the problem that we face.</p>

 What the hon. Gentleman is saying is getting dangerously close to justifying people voting for the BNP. People are right to be concerned about illegal immigration&#151;I am concerned about it, too&#151;but they are wrong to think that the BNP has the answer. The BNP believes that a person can never be British if they are black or Asian, even if they were born here and even if they have served their country in the armed forces. The hon. Gentleman would do well to condemn the BNP for its racist attitudes and say that there is no justification for voting for racists and fascists in Britain today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o302"><a name="70205-0017.htm_para13"><a name="07020535000048">The issue affects communities. For example, in Bradford the local authority has had to build four schools because of the growth of immigration into the area. An answer to a parliamentary question said that 31 per cent. of the new houses to be built would be required simply to deal with the levels of immigration into this country. Given that that is about the proportion that has to be built on green belt land, we could avoid building almost any houses on such land if immigration was not such a big issue. There is no doubt that immigration also places huge pressures on the national health service and social services.</p>

It is no good having levers to deal with problems if the Government do not know what the solution is. I venture that having a limit on the number of people coming into this country might be a good strategy that would work with the Bill. The Bill itself gives the Government no strategy whatsoever.</p>

Given that magistrates courts can impose a maximum sentence of only six months in prison, and the vast majority of offences are dealt with by magistrates courts, it seems that very few people will be automatically deported, contrary to what we were led to believe when the Bill first appeared.</p>

In a briefing to regional journalists the other week, the Home Secretary made a big point of saying that the Bill would deal with the issue of people escaping from this country disguised by a veil. It is difficult to see what element of the Bill would prevent that, unless it is the clause that says that an immigration officer</p>

I certainly support her call to raise the minimum age at which people can be brought into the country for the purpose of marriage from 18 to 21.

 Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. I will heed your advice. I wish briefly to touch on the issue of asylum. In terms of numbers, asylum is not a big issue in the immigration debate; there are much bigger issues. However, I share many people&#146;s concerns about the failure to remove failed asylum seekers from the country, and the way in which that has undermined the system of asylum. We in this country have a proud tradition of looking after people who are fleeing persecution, and I hope that it will continue for many years to come, but it can only do so if there is a robust system in which people have faith.</p>

Whatever the rights and wrongs of their claim, that is an obscene amount of time for which to leave them in limbo, wondering what will happen to them. Some have fled terrible persecution.

greater number of failed asylum seekers were to be removed than the number of people added to the pile of those who are in the country without justification? Did not that system, and the new asylum model used in its wake, produce the kind of cases that my hon. Friend the Member for Thurrock (Andrew Mackinlay) mentioned, in which immigration staff were required to go for soft targets, in order to meet the requirements of that particular model?

 The hon. Gentleman may have a point, and the hon. Member for Thurrock&#146;s point about soft targets is particularly relevant. In a case that had been going on for eight years, the person concerned had come to this country from France.

I know that he was not in the House then, but for the 10 years that I was in opposition, from 1987 to 1997, the situation in the Home Office was appalling. The backlog was twice or three times as great as it is now. There were sackfuls of unopened mail at IND.

 It is absolutely sustainable. I do not believe that immigration has caused this country any problems. The presence of the immigrant community has benefited Britain. There is an economic case for it. I am a product of that system, having come to this country as a first-generation immigrant. Legal and lawful immigration to Britain has created communities that have helped our country and made it, I believe, the best country in the world to live in. The recent arrival of the east European people, following the enlargement of the EU, has benefited our country enormously. It is therefore not right to say that immigration has caused problems.</p>

That just will not wash. We need sufficient resources to allow people of calibre and ability to be able to judge cases. There is nothing fundamentally wrong with the civil servants who administer immigration policy; they are just demoralised. There are some fantastic people working in IND, but they are working in very difficult circumstances and there is a lack of leadership from the top of the management board as to the way in which things operate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o322"><a name="70205-0018.htm_para13"><a name="07020547000016">I write at least 50 letters a week to a woman called Lin Homer. I have met her, and I am sure that she is a dedicated civil servant, just as she was a dedicated chief executive of Birmingham city council. The fact is, however, that Lin Homer and her colleagues&#151;her deputy directors and the higher management of IND&#151;are simply not solving the administrative problems that need to be solved. They should not write letters to our constituents telling them that it is the IND&#146;s ambition to address their problems and to give them a decision within 28 days, or that its target is that 70 per cent. of its cases are going to be solved within a 28-day period. Our constituents come to our surgeries clutching those pieces of paper, and they believe what they read. Many of those people have been waiting one or two years for a reply.</p>

We ask them to pay for a service that we would not be satisfied with if it were provided by the private sector. An application for a work permit now costs more than &#163;300. Do they get a decision quickly? On balance, if they apply from outside this country, no. The service inside the country is actually pretty good, but anyone who applies from abroad under the new scheme instituted by the previous Immigration Minister&#151;known as managed migration&#151;will have to wait a very long time.</p>

Friend the Minister, representing a seat such as his in Birmingham, has a big constituency case load. I say to him in friendship that the only way to solve the problem in IND is to get people of talent into the service. He is giving a shadow agency the powers to get things done&#151;not under the Bill&#151;and creating a completely new agency. Moving the problems from the desk of the Immigration Minister and putting them on the desk of the chief executive of a new agency will not solve the problems that we face.</p>

In my 20 years in the House, I have written to Ministers of all political persuasions to ask for such meetings and those meetings have been granted. We need that ministerial focus.

have a multiplier effect on the problems in the system? They cause intense human misery, but they also give an incentive to shoddy immigration advisers to encourage a minority of people to put in baseless claims.

 My hon. Friend is right. This situation has been made worse by the cuts in legal aid, which mean that good practitioners are coming out of legal aid, leaving citizens at the mercy of unscrupulous immigration advisers. People then come to our surgeries and expect us to sort out the problems.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o326"><a name="70205-0018.htm_para17"><a name="07020547000022">There are people of talent in the system. I urge the Minister to look at the way in which UK Visas is run. It has a better system than the Home Office: one writes a letter about a constituency case, which goes to the post abroad, and one gets a reply. One might not be happy with that reply but at least one gets a reply with information on which one can act As for the Home Office, one gets a reply from a deputy director saying that one must wait another six months or even longer for the case to be considered. For example, the family reunion cases, which the Minister&#146;s predecessor agreed to years ago, are still going through the system, and have not been dealt with.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o327"><a name="70205-0018.htm_para18"><a name="07020547000023">The Minister has the capacity, ability and personal charm to persuade people to make a difference in the way that they do their jobs. That takes resources, however, and it requires the right people. I urge him to consider some of the senior officials such as Carol Doughty in New Delhi or Mandy Ivemy in Bombay&#151;directors of visa services who must deal with thousands of visa cases, and who are able to sort out the problems that are put before them and make decisions immediately. When one is operating on the basis of a right of appeal, that is so much better.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o328"><a name="70205-0018.htm_para19"><a name="07020547000024">I will concede to the Minister all that he is doing on border controls. I do not know the answer&#151;I do not have a coastline surrounding Leicester, so I cannot say what that is like. He has done the research, and he tells me that we need the provisions. On customer service and the ability to deal with cases, however, he has lost me. To regain me, he must provide a better system that works.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o329"><a name="70205-0018.htm_para20"><a name="07020547000025">My next point is on liaison between Departments. In an Adjournment debate a few years ago, I raised the case of a constituent of mine who was killed by a foreign national who, before he went to court for the hearing, was given his passport back and allowed to return voluntarily to China. My constituent&#146;s parents were told about that after it had happened. They have therefore never had closure. The person who killed their son has never been tried in this country, and for all I know is back in this country as a visitor. The lack of liaison even between parts of the same Department is lamentable. If the Bill means better liaison, I support it. When my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary replies, I want her to assure me that the Bill will have that effect and that there is not another Bill coming to solve the problems that we have seen.</p>

 I think the Chairman of the Education and Skills Committee can go to the back of the class.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o340"><a name="70205-0019.htm_para6"><a name="07020547000042">The Minister gave a perfectly rational and reasonable explanation of the Government&#146;s policy, but no matter how good his motives are, the machinery with which he is trying to implement that policy is flawed, because the Government are unfit for purpose. We have here a Bill that is designed to sneak corrections to the Identity Cards Act 2006 through the back door. We have here a Bill that is designed to persuade us that, by introducing biometric passports and by introducing biometrics to immigrants&#146; residential status documents, the Government are about to achieve something wonderful. But we all know that the Government have changed their mind time after time on biometrics.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o341"><a name="70205-0019.htm_para7"><a name="07020547000043">We now know&#151;because the Minister admitted it in a written statement just before Christmas&#151;that instead of one great computer, which I dare say the Government now accept would be unsafe, open to hacking and incapable of providing the service that it was designed to provide, they propose to establish three separate vast computers, which will no doubt fail to communicate with each other, fail to be produced according to budget, and fail to perform the task that the Government think they have set them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o342"><a name="70205-0019.htm_para8"><a name="07020547000044">The Government have mishandled the whole issue of biometrics. There is not a Conservative Member, and I dare say there is not a Labour Member either, who disagrees with the notion that there should be biometric passports. That means that when we present our passports at the port of entry, an immigration officer can read the information contained in the chip and verify our identity. Where we&#151;Conservative Members, at least&#151;part company with the Government is on the use of the biometric system on the identity card as a key to that great national computer, the national identity register. Here we see the Government at sixes and sevens: they really do not understand what they wish to derive from identity cards and the biometric system.</p>

It is clear that, like the Identity Cards Act, the Bill is no more than a Christmas tree on which the Government will hang as yet undrafted, unseen regulations. The scope of the registration regulations is extremely broad, and the bulk of the detail will be in regulations made by the Secretary of State. We need only look at the Bill to see that the Secretary of State will have power to make regulations that may include open-ended obligations. For example, there will be regulations requiring the use of a document when a question arises about a person&#146;s status in relation to nationality or immigration. A person producing that document will be required to provide other information for comparison, and there is potentially unlimited scope in regard to the information that can be required. Regulations will make provision as to the content of documents that include non-biometric information and allow for the document to be combined with other documents. All those powers are handed over to the Secretary of State&#151;powers that are untrammelled by detailed knowledge of the wording of the regulations.</p>

 May I, too, express my gratitude for an informed and lively debate in the Chamber? Immigration is a subject that always attracts a great deal of attention, both in this Chamber and the other place, because of its bearing on the economy and on society as a whole. The Bill contains measures that are intended to help us control immigration from abroad better, at the border and in-country. Additional powers are needed to tackle the challenges posed by increasing global migration, which is part of globalisation. Those challenges include an increase in organised immigration crime, either from abroad through people trafficking or in-country through the illegal labour market.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o348"><a name="70205-0019.htm_para14"><a name="07020611000014">A greater number of people are coming here legally, too, so it is essential that we have the right powers and systems in place, as well as the right technology to manage them. When they are no longer entitled to be here, we must be able to ensure that they leave. The Bill therefore focuses on strengthening our borders. That is not simply a case of providing immigration officers at ports with extra powers, as it involves removing the incentives to enter the UK illegally in the first place. We have looked at specifically targeting people who abuse our hospitality as well as those who seek to profit from illegal immigration. The Bill includes tough measures to crack down on illegal working and to root out fraudulent claims for benefits through the introduction of biometric immigration documents for individuals subject to immigration control, as well as extra powers for immigration officers. We are improving cross-Government working with information-sharing powers that will help us to detect fraudsters and illegal workers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o349"><a name="70205-0019.htm_para15"><a name="07020611000019">We are living in an age in which the world is becoming smaller because of more accessible and affordable travel routes. In response, we need to step up our border controls to cope with increasing demands. We want to protect the public and their interests, so we must provide a fair and effective immigration system in which immigration is controlled and the immigration laws are enforced and therefore respected. We want to take advantage of the increase in global migration, but in a controlled way that is right for Britain. We want the right people to come here to work and study&#151;people who will contribute positively to our society and economy. Equally, we need to ensure that we stem the harmful effects of illegal migration, which is why the measures in the Bill are important.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o350"><a name="70205-0019.htm_para16"><a name="07020611000020">This piece of legislation is part of a wider package of measures. A great deal of work has already been done to bring the immigration system into the 21st century. We have moved our border controls to the continent, and we have introduced a global network of border advisers. We are introducing a points-based system to ensure that the right people come here to work and study. In July 2006, we undertook a comprehensive review of the immigration and nationality directorate, publishing proposals for the future of immigration management in the UK. We have consulted widely with the public, the police, our partners in local government, the NHS, the Department for Work and Pensions, and the business community. That has proved invaluable in identifying the powers needed by the border and immigration agency when it starts work in April to strengthen the border and enforce immigration laws better. I hope that that gives some comfort to my right hon. Friend the Member for Leicester, East (Keith Vaz), who was very concerned about whether there will be any more legislation. This Bill, in conjunction with moving to agency status and the enforcement strategy that will be introduced in the near future, should address the concerns that he raises. This is a package of measures.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o351"><a name="70205-0019.htm_para17"><a name="07020611000023">The hon. Member for Ashford (Damian Green) did not say anything very positive about the Bill, but he was positive towards the end of his comments about measures on trafficking and facilitation. I am pleased to have his support on that, and I believe that there is cross-party support for tackling that obnoxious, heinous and damaging crime. Overall however, the hon. Gentleman&#146;s comments were not terribly positive, and he certainly was not positive about measures that have already been taken. Annual asylum applications are at their lowest level since 1993. A majority of initial decisions are now taken within eight weeks. In 2005, 17,000 illegal immigrants were stopped crossing the channel and 30,000 at airports around the world. I am sure that he will remember that the measures were not supported by him or his party. Therefore, they should look carefully at the well-thought-through measures in the Bill, and they should support them if they truly believe what they say about strengthening our borders.</p>

Friend the Member for Walthamstow (Mr. Gerrard), expressed concerns about the possible consequences when enforcement takes place and the new powers bite. They are right to raise concerns about whether we will put strategies in place to deal with the consequences of increasing enforcement. I assure them that that enforcement and the advent of the biometric immigration document will be rolled out on an incremental basis, that we will ensure that we deal with the consequences of increasing enforcement&#151;which will be the turning up of people who are here illegally and working illegally&#151;and that we will address all the issues surrounding that.

My right hon. Friend also asked about the fraudulent use of EU documents. I am sure that he is aware that that is covered by the Identity Cards Act 2006, which makes it an offence to possess an illegal document or to intend to use a false immigration document, including EU identity cards.

year, which he will doubtless welcome as those are important provisions that will help us to bear down on illegal working. They will also make a significant difference as our cross-government enforcement strategy is introduced and starts to bite. As we move forward, it is essential that all these agencies work together, for the reasons that I outlined.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o357"><a name="70205-0020.htm_para1"><a name="07020611000031">The Bill also includes important measures to tackle facilitation and people trafficking, to which a number of Members have referred. Those profiting from the misery of others will no longer be able to hide abroad. As soon as a known trafficker comes to the United Kingdom, we will be able to arrest them. Alternatively, we will have the power to track them down abroad and to extradite them to face prosecution here. I am pleased that we have support throughout the Chamber for these measures. We are all conscious, as we move toward the 200th anniversary of the abolition of slavery, that this is slavery by any other name.</p>

Friend the Minister for Immigration, Citizenship and Nationality said about issuing biometric documents to people aged under 16, just to be absolutely sure that my hon. Friend the Member for Walthamstow, who asked about under-16s, understands the information therein. Biometric immigration documents will be issued to under-16s as proof of their immigration status, and they will contain a facial image. We are still considering at what age the requirement for fingerprints will apply. Discussions are under way in the EU regarding at what age children should have their fingerprints recorded; we currently record the fingerprints of asylum seekers from the age of five. I want to reassure my hon. Friend that these junior biometric immigration documents cannot then be designated as ID cards. He will know that the Identity Cards Act 2006 applies to people aged 16-plus. I hope that that clarification is helpful to him. </p>

The introduction of the biometric immigration document as an enforcement mechanism and the new powers for immigration officers will help us to tackle illegal working and immigration crime better. It is essential that front-line staff have the right powers to act swiftly when confronted with someone committing an immigration offence. Over recent years, this aim has progressed, and the measures in the Bill go one step further in allowing immigration investigations to be carried out independently of other agencies. The Bill is a key element in delivering these improvements, and I commend it to the House.</p>

 I am particularly grateful that you have allowed me the opportunity to hold an Adjournment debate on this subject, Mr. Speaker. I am grateful to the Minister of State, Department of Health, the right hon. Member for Doncaster, Central (Ms Winterton), for being present. She has worked for the local authority in Southwark and for the Royal College of Nursing and I hope that I will not embarrass her by saying that she is still a Southwark resident when she is in London. I know that she will be concerned and will understand the concern about these issues. I am particularly grateful to the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport for being present. She is one of five local MPs, of whom I am also one. The Minister of State, Department for Constitutional Affairs, the right hon. and learned Member for Camberwell and Peckham (Ms Harman) is another, as is the hon. Member for Vauxhall (Kate Hoey), who sends her apologies. She wished to be here, but cannot be for family reasons. The right hon. Member for Streatham (Keith Hill) is the other. All of us, across the party divide, are concerned about the issues that I have the privilege of raising and have raised them personally with the Secretary of State for Health and the Ministers of State. The Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport worked at the Maudsley hospital and therefore has direct experience, as well as constituency-relevant experience, as do we all.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o377"><a name="70205-0021.htm_para0"><a name="07020611000520">I want to pay tribute to three other groups of people. The first is all the staff who work in mental health services in south London, who do an amazingly courageous and professional job. Without them, many people who are alive today would be neither alive nor as well as they are. The second is all the campaigners who have risen up to take part in the democratic process, perfectly properly and lawfully, wanting to be sure that their voice has been heard. One of them, a friend of mine for many years, is Stan Hardy. He is over 85 and, feeling that this is something that he wanted to do, he has been given a new lease of life. I pay tribute to such people, who could have been sitting in their armchairs but have decided that mental health services are important enough for them to stir themselves. Some are service users, some are families or friends of users and some have never used mental health services. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o378"><a name="70205-0021.htm_para1"><a name="07020611000521">The third group, which is unusual&#151;I do not think that I have paid such a tribute recently&#151;is the staff of our local paper, the <i> South London Press</i>, which we share with other south London boroughs. Its editor clearly decided that this was an issue that she wanted to put on the agenda. As she told us tonight, at the meeting that we held before we came here, this is an issue that has had an unparalleled response from the public and on which the paper has continued to campaign strongly and determinedly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o379"><a name="70205-0021.htm_para2"><a name="07020611000522">I say to the Minister of State that we are here with all that support behind us.

case that those groups have made to us because it not only spans the NHS planning system, complicated statistics and a long history, but includes the personal experiences of people who have been very near the edge.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o380"><a name="70205-0021.htm_para3"><a name="07020611000523">This is about people, not systems, and I want to share with the House two personal reflections that I hope will help. Like any MP who does their job properly I find that many people come to me with mental health issues. Somebody came to see me a few months ago because he had got into terrible debt, and despite all the advice he had received, he had not been able to get out of it and the debts were piling up. He suffered from bipolar dysfunction. In the end, somebody suggested that he came to see his MP. I was able, with the help of the companies concerned, effectively to get rid of his financial problem. Of course, people who suffer from mental illness do not necessarily put it behind them for ever or even for a long time; it can come back again and again. Not long ago, that person presented again, to a doctor in our borough. The doctor could not at that moment deal with him herself, so she sent him to the Maudsley emergency clinic where, she knew, he would get immediate and appropriate treatment. I am here because people such as that man, and people whom we know in our families, our circle of friends and our communities, have terrible struggles with mental illness and we have in our part of London the national flagship service for dealing with mental illness.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o381"><a name="70205-0021.htm_para4"><a name="07020611000524">It is an odd coincidence&#151;I did not know this until a few days ago&#151;that it was 100 years ago this year that Henry Maudsley gave the money to London county council for the land for the Maudsley hospital. The war intervened, and it was not built until after the war. The hospital and, on the adjacent site, the Institute of Psychiatry, are national flagships&#151;that is the phrase that has been used&#151;in the treatment of and research into mental illness. My brother worked there for a while and, as I say, the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport worked there. Both institutions have fantastic reputations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o382"><a name="70205-0021.htm_para5"><a name="07020611000525">I am here because there is a real concern that at least one, if not two, of the elements of that set of services, the Maudsley emergency clinic and the Felix Post service for the elderly, which includes day care, could be lost when they need not be and when there is not an adequate alternative. I want to make the case for them. I hope that the Minister of State will be able to say to us that they will not, as is planned, close in a matter of weeks but that there will be a reappraisal to take into account the huge number of serious arguments that I, among others, keep hearing from the users, the doctors, the consultants, the nurses, the staff, the unions and many others with an interest. People have been willing to speak out, even though they risked their jobs by doing so, because they feel so strongly about the subject. I hope that the Minister will recognise the importance of what they are saying.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o383"><a name="70205-0021.htm_para6"><a name="07020611000526">I want to add two or three points to put the matter in context, but I am conscious that this is a short debate. The Minister will know the background figures, but the most recent parliamentary answers show that, in the last year for which we have figures, there were just short  <br>

of 200,000 admissions to national health service hospitals in England under mental illness specialties. I asked the Library for the figures, and according to the best estimate that it could give, 250,000&#151;a quarter of a million&#151;people a year in England and Wales are admitted to hospital because of mental illness. One in four people suffer from mental health problems at some stage in their life, but in Southwark the rates are higher than average, as the Minister knows. The London-wide suicide rate is about five people in 100,000, but the Southwark rate is nearly eight in 100,000.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o384"><a name="70205-0021.htm_para7"><a name="07020611000527">The Minister may not know this, but I have discovered that, according to all the expert evidence, Southwark and Lambeth have the highest level of psychosis in the country, and probably the world. I am no expert on such matters&#151;I am a layperson&#151;but people have shown me the evidence and the statistics, and the evidence is not just based on presentation and anecdote. A combination of factors is responsible. They have to do with the urban community, deprivation and poverty, and the introduction of large groups of immigrants over the decades and centuries, some of whom are from communities in which there is a particularly high prevalence of mental illness. It is the combination of those factors in communities such as ours that is responsible. We are here to argue for a service that caters not just for those people, but for people outside Lambeth and Southwark too.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o385"><a name="70205-0021.htm_para8"><a name="07020611000528">It is not usual to find a 24-hour mental health emergency clinic in this country; in fact, it is unusual&#151;it is the exception, not the rule. It is like those other unusual things, the beacons of excellence. The emergency clinic has been here for 50 years, and people from other parts of London and beyond are sometimes pointed in its direction by the police or friends. Homeless people who have heard of it are sent there, by doctors who cannot cope, or by family. The service is a bit like the Samaritans, but with a face. One of my parents has worked for the Samaritans for many years, and they did and do a fantastic job. The Maudsley has a telephone hotline, too, but it also has a dedicated space, open 24 hours a day and 365 days a year, where a person can be seen by doctors and nurses immediately, and where they are safe. It is a refuge. It has a waiting area, but it also has separate rooms, all of which are private and confidential, where people can be seen.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o386"><a name="70205-0021.htm_para9"><a name="07020611000529">Budget cuts have been forced on the South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust, which is a four-borough trust, including Lambeth, Southwark, Lewisham and Croydon. Some &#163;8 million is to be taken out of the trust&#146;s budget by Southwark and Lambeth, and as a result, the financial pressure is on, so the trust has to look for other services to cut. If it were not for that pressure, we might not be holding this debate today. It did not have to decide to cut the mental health service, but as a result of that pressure and other factors, it decided that the service should be cut.</p>

 I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving way, and will be very brief. I am pleased to support him in this debate because, after all, the Maudsley is a place not only of professional excellence, but of financial excellence, and it is a great shame that we had to turn to the Maudsley  <br>

to make reductions. I am keen to support him, because as a result of the financial pressures, there have been the first rumblings about service reductions in Croydon. I applaud him for bringing the issues to the House&#146;s attention.</p>

 I am very grateful to the hon. Gentleman.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o387"><a name="70205-0021.htm_para10"><a name="07020611000532">I will not lecture the Minister on the finances of the health service because although the Govt have greatly improved many parts of the health service, this is not about costs and budgets but about retaining the service. It is not even about the site as much as it is about the service. It is about making sure that there is somewhere to go when one needs it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o388"><a name="70205-0021.htm_para11"><a name="07020611000533">I have watched the huge improvement in the home treatment services and I understand that lots of people need someone who gives support during the four, five or six weeks of a crisis. Those involved do a brilliant job. However, there are some people who, in the middle of the night, at the weekend or on a bank holiday&#151;when at present there is no home treatment service&#151;cannot be dealt with at home. They do not want to stay at home and they need to leave; home is where they are imprisoned and they need to escape.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o389"><a name="70205-0021.htm_para12"><a name="07020611000534">At that moment, such people will in future be asked to go across the road to King&#146;s College hospital&#146;s accident and emergency service. King&#146;s has improved; it is a great hospital. The A &amp; E unit is greatly improved; I was there the other day. But it has already outgrown what it was planned to cater for, and I promise that it could not cope physically with both the physical ailments that come through the door and the mental health ailments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o390"><a name="70205-0021.htm_para13"><a name="07020611000535">If someone is coming in on the edge of suicide, terribly deranged, very violent and psychotic, will they be helped by being next to a person coming in from a car smash or a fireman with an axe in his head? Will that help to calm that person? There are only two rooms in King&#146;s A &amp; E with doors, not curtains. Is it appropriate for those people to be looked after literally under the same roof, however brilliant the staff are? If so, is it appropriate for the person to be shown to a corner for mental health patients? Is that not reinforcing the stereotypes that people have about mental health?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o391"><a name="70205-0021.htm_para14"><a name="07020611000536">The Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, her hon. Friends and mine are arguing that we need a dedicated space and refuge that is always available and that is, as it were, supported by the experts. All the evidence from nurses and doctors is that we cannot assume that we can bring in people who are not on site at the last minute, or that we can contain the violent people and then take them over the road, with security people, to the Maudsley. There are some inappropriate outcomes; on some occasions, people who cannot be treated when they need to be go off and either risk taking their own lives or, equally badly, risk taking the lives of others by their uncontrollable behaviour.</p>

 Politicians such as myself, the hon. Gentleman and the Minister are involved, but a lot of the people involved in the issue are not politicians, and people said at the meeting tonight that they had never been involved in party politics before but had been involved in community issues for 50 years. There is no party issue here; it is about how we can come together to take things forward.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o392"><a name="70205-0021.htm_para15"><a name="07020611000539">The letter from the Secretary of State on 12 January followed the decision by both Lambeth and Southwark councils that this was the wrong road to go down. The scrutiny committees of both councils and the joint council scrutiny committee looked into the matter and said that they wanted the service to be kept. The Members of Parliament have all made that view clear.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o393"><a name="70205-0021.htm_para16"><a name="07020611000540">The proposal is that there should be a transfer over a matter of weeks, with the Maudsley emergency clinic probably closing by the end of April. The poor manager and his staff who are running it are in a terrible position because they have to do the bidding of their NHS masters, but they know the pressure from the community. The idea is that their work will be picked up by the service over the road, which is not ready and will not be ready for at least a year. Even if the rebuilding took place, it still would not have the facilities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o394"><a name="70205-0021.htm_para17"><a name="07020611000541">The Minister may have been in the House last Wednesday when the hon. Member for Vauxhall put a question to the Prime Minister, who said that he would speak to the Secretary of State for Health about the matter. The Secretary of State for Health was in Southwark at another place the other day, and was asked by campaigners in support of the Maudsley whether she would review the issue, and she said she would be happy to reconsider the matter. After the debate I will be happy to let the Minister and the Department have all the representations that I have received from nurses and doctors, the Royal College of Nursing and so on.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o395"><a name="70205-0021.htm_para18"><a name="07020611000542">I ask the Minister to take back to the Secretary of State a request to stop the clock, so to speak. It is fair to say that the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, the other Members of Parliament and I ask for a moratorium&#151;a pause while we work out an acceptable way forward with the community, the users, their families, the clinicians and the practitioners.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o396"><a name="70205-0021.htm_para19"><a name="07020611000543">I end with this proposition: if a mental health service exists to stop people going over the edge, it must have the confidence of the public. If it has the confidence of the public, they will use it. Yes, numbers may go up, but that will be a sign of success because people are using the service. I have been in the House 24 years this month. I have been told that there is no more important subject than this. It is potentially a life and death issue. I know the Minister understands that, and I do not say it as blackmail or to be over-heavy.</p>

This is about saving lives, and it cannot be the best politics to press ahead with a decision that does not have the confidence of the community or any of their representatives, when we could have a better solution if we just sought to agree it in a way that gave confidence. I hope the Minister will respond positively, and I hope we can save a 24-hour clinic service on the Maudsley site or nearby to do the fantastic work in the future that it has done for the past 50 years, which has literally been the salvation of hundreds, if not thousands, of people.</p>

 I congratulate the hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey (Simon Hughes) on securing the debate. It is clearly a matter of great concern to him and his constituents, as I know it is to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport. I know that both Members have had meetings with the Secretary of State for Health about the matter.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o398"><a name="70205-0021.htm_para21"><a name="07020611000546">I join the hon. Gentleman in paying tribute to the many people who have worked so hard to make improvements to mental health services. Some have dedicated their lives to that work. I recognise the importance of the community wanting to improve those services, which is clearly an issue in the present case. Too often, mental health services are not considered part of the mainstream. The community is sending an important message that they want to see real improvements and to ensure that the best services are available.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o399"><a name="70205-0021.htm_para22"><a name="07020611000547">The hon. Gentleman was right to highlight the importance of early intervention services for people who are starting to experience the first symptoms of psychosis. Many such teams have been established across south London. They reduce the risk of people reaching crisis point and having to be admitted to hospital at a later stage. They can often help people to get back into work more quickly, if that is appropriate, and they can generally improve the quality of people&#146;s lives.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o400"><a name="70205-0021.htm_para23"><a name="07020611000548">A network of home treatment teams has also been established across London. An important part of the reform and modernisation of mental health services is that, if possible, we try to treat people at home who might otherwise be admitted, or who have been admitted but might have had to stay in hospital longer if the home treatment service were not available. We are trying to stop the revolving door syndrome, in which people are discharged from hospital, become unwell and have to be readmitted. That is the general direction of travel, and I am pleased that extra investment has gone into those services, which, together with the dedication and commitment of the staff, have made a real difference.</p>

statements in her reply to the Lambeth and Southwark joint health scrutiny committee about how she wanted the proposals to go forward. She tried to respond to the concerns set out by the committee in its referral letter.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o402"><a name="70205-0021.htm_para25"><a name="07020611000550">The Secretary of State obviously took views from the local NHS, from Department of Health officials and from the national clinical director for mental health, while acknowledging that the views of stakeholders and others had been put forward by the joint committee. She concluded that the closure of the emergency clinic would be in line with the mental health national service framework and other departmental policy, because it focused on meeting the needs of service users primarily through strengthened community provision and accident and emergency provision. The hon. Gentleman will know that that provision involves 24-hour access to emergency assessment and treatment, and that, as far as possible, there should be proper crisis teams in place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o403"><a name="70205-0021.htm_para26"><a name="07020611000551">I should also stress that the Secretary of State agreed with the committee that the other elements of the local mental health crisis system need to be sufficient to meet the needs of mental health service users in the absence of the emergency clinic. Local stakeholders need to be confident that this is the case, particularly in relation to local A and E services, which the committee and other local stakeholders highlighted as a specific concern. It has become absolutely clear that there is a commitment that, when the clinic closes, there will be 24/7 cover across Lambeth and Southwark.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o404"><a name="70205-0021.htm_para27"><a name="07020611000552">The Secretary of State has welcomed the fact that the local NHS has strengthened its proposals, after the referral by the joint scrutiny committee, to create a designated space at King&#146;s College hospital, adjacent to the A and E unit, which is across the road from the emergency clinic, to provide a safe and segregated area for mental health service users requiring assessment. I also understand that NHS London has agreed to provide capital funding of &#163;6 million to enable the proposed changes to be put in place. In addition, I am informed that the Southwark and Lambeth primary care trusts are going to commission a wide range of mental health and 24-hour crisis mental health services of a high standard. The Secretary of State wants those proposals to be tested and agreed locally through a robust implementation plan, as the hon. Gentleman said, with input from key stakeholders, to ensure a smooth transition following the closure of the emergency clinic.</p>

 The Minister of State must know, and the Secretary of State must be told, that the plan at the moment is that the emergency clinic will close in a matter of weeks. There cannot be the people, the capital, the revenue or the arrangements over the road to replicate&#151;or anything like replicate&#151;what the emergency clinic currently provides. At the moment, we have a closure planned but absolutely no guarantee of an emergency clinic facility continuing after that, which is simply not acceptable.</p>
