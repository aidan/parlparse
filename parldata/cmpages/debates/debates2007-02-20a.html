From her opening response, it sounds as though no such positive results were achieved. Are there any further plans for such visits by envoys to Syria in the coming months? Given that the Baker-Hamilton report called for a new diplomatic offensive by the United States to engage Syria in constructive policies, and that the Prime Minister appeared to endorse those calls in his speech at the Lord Mayor&#146;s banquet in November, is the United States now showing any signs of being prepared to engage with Syria in that way, if the intention were reciprocated?

Shortly thereafter, there followed a visit by the Syrian Foreign Minister to Iraq and further discussions between the two Governments. I believe also that it is not long since the President of Iraq went to Syria, and, as I mentioned to my hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, North (Mr. Henderson), Syria has now set up an embassy in Iraq. So, yes, there were positive results, and we continue to look for further signs of Syrian willingness to act more constructively in the region. We therefore continue to keep under consideration whether there would be merit in further contacts in the coming months, as does the European Union, where there is much discussion on whether and how it would be possible to encourage a more constructive relationship with Syria. The question of whether the United States should have more contact with Syria, if the willingness to do so were thought to be reciprocal, is a matter for the Government of the United States.</p>

However, there are regions, particularly in the south, where Government authority has yet to be firmly established. To address that, UK forces have recently engaged in a number of missions aimed at extending the authority of the Afghan Government across Helmand province.

The abilityof the Afghan security authorities to provide a measure of security in Afghanistan, which they are not capable of providing at the moment, would be one measure and a very important one. I know that the hon. Gentleman has considerable experience of Bosnia, for example. He knows as well as anyone in the House that, without that general level of security, it will be impossible for the economic reconstruction of Afghanistan to take place in the way that it should take place.

Any teachers who were found to be teaching females&#151;and, indeed, any teachers who are nowadays found to be teaching females in areas where the Taliban remain a strong presence&#151;were usually killed, and usually killed in front of the children.

It is a difficult border; it is one of the worst in the world to police, and they have made great efforts to do so.

Since then, the security situation remains very difficult, there has been very little infrastructure-building in the south in Helmand, and opium production has increased by more than 60 per cent. Does the Minister believe that the policy pursued by the British Government at that time is still correct, or is he considering revising that policy to meet the aims and timelines of the London compact?</p>

I do not think that anybody had poked a stick into that beehive up to that point; well, we now have.

It is not a simple fight involving just hearts and minds. For example, more than 3,000 men have been lost on the eastern border of Iran combating drug convoys armed with anti-aircraft missiles that are bringing heroin to Europe.

If we proposed a Bill on the Floor of the House of Commons that would make it illegal for the heir to the throne to marry a Muslim, a Methodist or a Mormon, that would be intolerable in a free society, yet the heir to the throne is still not allowed to marry a member of what is, on any Sunday, the largest worshipping community in this country. That is an insult to the Catholic community because it suggests that, somehow or other, being a Roman Catholic means being less of a citizen than someone belonging to any other religious denomination.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o8"><a name="70220-0003.htm_para5"><a name="07022050000156">I admit that I feel ashamed that I did not introduce the Bill before, when I was an Anglican. Since becoming a Catholic, I have recognised what the attitude towards this denomination means. For that reason, I am trying to make up for the history. It is not just a question of who the heir to the throne may marry or who the Queen or King may be. It is pretty ridiculous that the king could be a Scientologist, which is manifestly intellectually difficult and religiously rubbish, but cannot be a Catholic, which is intellectually difficult and religiously correct. This is wholly unacceptable, and I do not think that anybody believes otherwise.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o9"><a name="70220-0003.htm_para6"><a name="07022050000157">One discovers other things in the woodwork when one looks into the matter. For example, it used to be true that no Catholic diocese could have the same name as an Anglican diocese, even though those dioceses had, shall we say, been borrowed. In 1927 that measure was apparently removed, but it turns out that it was not removed. The Act says that naming a Catholic diocese the same as an Anglican diocese is no longer punishable&#151;it is just illegal. That is a peculiarity, and it is also insulting. The Catholics called the diocese&#151;now the archdiocese&#151;of Southwark that name because there was not an Anglican diocese there, so when the Anglicans decided that they wanted a diocese in Southwark, it was perfectly all right for them to call it Southwark, despite the fact that there was a Catholic diocese, so the measure is not there to make matters easier for people. The Catholic diocese of Newcastle, although the cathedral is in Newcastle, has to be called Hexham and Newcastle, even though the centre of the diocese is in Newcastle. The Catholic archdiocese of Liverpool happens to precede the Anglican bishopric of Liverpool. It was perfectly all right for the Church of England to use the same name, but it was not all right the other way round. I do not think that it is terribly important, but it is insulting.</p>

Bute, who later became a Catholic, happened to be appointed to that order. It is particularly odd when one realises that the order was created by King James II, who happened to be a Catholic. This is a peculiarity. There are all sorts of corners of our life that are as they are in discriminatory terms because this central matter remains.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o11"><a name="70220-0004.htm_para1"><a name="07022050000159">I do not believe that there can be any hon. Member who does not find it odd that the Prime Minister was unable to explain why in 10 years of anti-discriminatory legislation he did not find time to add on the bottom of any one of those Bills &#147;and Catholics&#148;. The Under-Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs, the hon. Member for Lewisham, East (Bridget Prentice), who is kind enough to be here on the Front Bench, gave a peculiar answer to&#151;in this case&#151;my hon. Friend the Member for Thurrock when she more or less suggested that there was not any real reason to bother about all this, and that really it was not important. It is important&#151;as you, Mr. Speaker, in your persona, as against your public office, know perfectly well&#151;because it says something about Catholics that was not true to start with and is not true today, and ought not to be part of our law. This is not a passing matter; it is very important.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o12"><a name="70220-0004.htm_para2"><a name="07022050000160">We must go back beyond that and consider what discrimination is about. Discrimination is about saying, &#147;I am better than you are because my views are right and your views are wrong.&#148; It is the opposite of toleration. In Elizabethan England&#151; and before that in Henrician England&#151;the King was divorced not just because he had the hots for Anne Boleyn, but, more importantly, so that he could say that he had a right to it and that it could have a moral justification. He invented that moral justification and he told people that they had to believe that if they were to be citizens.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o13"><a name="70220-0004.htm_para3"><a name="07022050000161">I hope that some people have thought rather carefully about our present parallel, because we are beginning to be the kind of state that is doing that again. It is saying that one has to hold certain views if one is to be a proper citizen. I want to give one example because I happen to disagree with my Church on it, so it is a good example to use. I think that it is right to remove the discrimination against same-sex couples in relation to adoption, but I also think that we should be tolerant of people who do not agree with that.</p>

That is a wonderful kind of toleration. It is the kind&#151;I do not think that I am leaving behind my socialist and Labour supporters when I say this&#151;that we have often seen from perhaps the most illiberal Government that we have had as regards civil liberties. I have always voted to the left of this Government on civil liberties matters, which is very embarrassing for me and for my constituents, who do not quite understand it.

understand the meaning of liberalism. Liberalism is about accepting the views of people whom one does not like and of people with whom one fundamentally disagrees. That is why I beg this House to recognise that we are going down the same route as Elizabeth and Henry VIII went down, which is to say: &#147;The state knows about these things, and if you disagree about the things that we think matter, then I am afraid that you become a criminal.&#148; That is the reality of such discrimination.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o15"><a name="70220-0004.htm_para5"><a name="07022050000163">The Bill brings together the two things that matter at this moment: a removal of historical discrimination, which defaces this nation today; and a statement that in future we will be the kind of country that allows people of any denomination to conduct their Churches, institutions, religious houses and what they do according to the faith of their fathers, and not to be told by other people that secular morality supervenes and that they must accept an alien orthodoxy. This is about what Henry started and what Elizabeth did, which was to say that orthodoxy was determinednot by the faith of the citizen but by the decisionof Parliament and the state. That way lies totalitarianism&#151;a refusal to accept that toleration means realising that people feel passionately about important things and that in a free society they ought to be able to uphold those things. My Bill would get rid of historical discrimination and guard against the insidious future discrimination that arises from political correctness, which is itself a kind of fascism.</p>

Those of us who have experienced the changes in the local government funding formula in the past few years know that when they say initially that they will provide 70 per cent., they introduce floors and ceilings or resource equalisation. We would therefore start in theory with 70 per cent., but the Government could perhaps then alter the amount of grant to local authorities in lieu of that.

Does he know whether the Scottish Executive have requested the resources that the new tax would give them?</p>

In the light of that, our new clause seeks to ensure that the Bill cannot effectively be implemented until the Treasury andthe Scottish Executive have worked out between them in detail how it will operate on the ground and, specifically, how the well-established Scottishsection 75 procedure will be affected as a result.</p>

From my experience in Edinburgh, and from observing other authorities in Scotland&#151;no doubt this is also the case in England and Wales&#151;local authorities often do not benefit from the section 75 process as they ought to. Some local authorities are good at negotiating with developers to ensure that they do benefit; others are not. There are certainly arguments for a more systematic approach, and I do not see any problem with trying to introduce such a system.

raised&#151;70 per cent.&#151;would go back to the local authorities concerned. There is no such provision for Scotland; indeed, it has been made absolutely clear that it is intended that the sums should go to the Scottish Executive to spend as it sees fit&#151;not necessarily to support infrastructure in any local authority, but to support any other project that it has in mind. The Scottish Executive may have expressed reservations about the proposal, but I suspect that were it to be given an additional financial windfall, it would not rush to hand it out to local authorities. The experience in my area is that the Scottish Executive has a more centralising approach to the redistribution of funds raised at local level than is the case south of the border. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o45"><a name="70220-0005.htm_para13"><a name="07022050000224">As Edinburgh has provided some attractive opportunities for development in the past&#151;and will no doubt do so in future&#151;the potential financial take from planning gain supplement tax could be substantial. My concern is therefore that sums might be recycled out of Edinburgh and perhaps spent in the constituency of the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Stewart Hosie), in Aberdeen or even further north, or on something entirely different. But that is not just a concern for a city such as Edinburgh; it was interesting that my hon. Friend the Member for Linlithgow and East Falkirk (Michael Connarty) raised such issues in Committee. Because of the way in which development has spilled out from Edinburgh, I suspect that areas such as his might have even greater potential for planning gain, and for money to be raised from planning gain supplement. Similar concerns have also been expressed in relation to Glasgow, and probably all cities. Inevitably, in cities and the areas around them, there will be more potential for sums to be raised and then centralised at the Scottish Executive level.</p>

Gentleman accept that it is much more desirable to do that over a period of time through a rate than on a one-off basis? His concerns go to the heart of the matter, as there must be a sense of transparency, which can only be at the most local level. In Edinburgh, as he knows, and in central London, as I know, there is often a desire for section 106 or section 75 expenditure to be dealt with on a ward-by-ward basis, let alone within a particular local authority. What are his views on that matter?</p>

I will try to avoid doing that. The hon. Gentleman gives an example of the wish to break down expenditure on a localised basis. That is perhaps an illustration of why there needs to be a more systematic approach to deal with the matter at a global level, rather than too local a level. There is always an attempt to break down the benefits and to benefit the local community most directly involved, but that does not allow that benefit to be expended on projects which will be required to make a development work properly and which cannot be immediately attributed to local communities. There is a strong case for having some centralised system, but that is a debate for another day, which we can have if a Bill on the substance of this matter is eventually introduced.</p>

That was the basis on which the Government sustained their argument, but we now discover that that argument will not necessarily apply in Scotland. The Government have a little explaining to do as to how they will extricate themselves from that difficult and anomalous situation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o50"><a name="70220-0005.htm_para18"><a name="07022050000234">Another question is raised. Devolution is an evolutionary process; it is not fixed, and powers change over time. I am struck by the fact that the Mayor of London has recently acquired planning powers that are not greatly dissimilar to those of the Scottish Executive. I raise the question&#151;and perhaps the Minister can answer it&#151;of whether Mayor Livingstone might seek to invoke the Scottish precedent in arguing that the receipts from the planning gain supplement should go to him, rather than to London local authorities. There might well be a simple legal answer to that, but it is a question that is prompted by this problem and I am sure that the Minister can give a clear answer to it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o51"><a name="70220-0005.htm_para19"><a name="07022050000235">The hon. Member for Rayleigh raised a second issue, which he put very well so I do not have a great deal to add to what he said. It is that an anomaly inthe devolutionary process is being created because there will be one instrument&#151;the planning gain supplement&#151;which will be a UK-level power, and a partly alternative and partly additional mechanism which is a section 106, or section 75, power, and which is devolved. In introducing the measure, the assumption has been that as planning gain supplement is introduced and expands, the section 106 role will contract; it will be confined to local infrastructure and affordable housing. However, it has never been clearly explained how that contraction will happen, and whether consequential legislation will be needed; it would presumably have to be introduced to limit the role of section 106 powers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o52"><a name="70220-0005.htm_para20"><a name="07022050000236">Again, we have an anomaly in terms of Scotland; as the hon. Member for Rayleigh has explained, the Scottish Executive might well take a totally different view and might wish to expand the role of section 75 to have enhanced, rather than reduced, planning gain. If that happens, there will be a clear conflict between United Kingdom and Scottish functions. It is not at all clear that the Government anticipated that problem, or that they have an answer to it. I await the Minister&#146;s reply with interest.</p>

My hon. Friend the Member for Rayleigh (Mr. Francois) was right to explain that, because of the awkwardness in the relationship between UK legislation and devolved legislation&#151;as the hon. Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable) pointed out&#151;the Scottish dimension shows up the fundamental awkwardness in the structure of the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="st_o142"><a name="07022050000238"><a name="70220-0005.htm_spnew10"><a name="07022050001041"><b>Stewart Hosie: </b>The right hon. Gentleman speaks about the fundamental awkwardness in terms of devolution. Is not the real issue the conflict between central Government, in this case the Treasury, and local government, in this case in Scotland, in that there is a determination and desire on the part of local authorities to advance development in their locales with a funding stream through section 75 planning gain, and there is a conflict between that sometimes good practice&#151;and sometimes less good&#151;and the demand for more tax revenue in the Treasury coming through the planning gain supplement?</p>

Gentleman that the problem has become even clearer since the Government have had to handle devolution, the Scottish Parliament and the Scottish Executive. In doing so, they have revealed that the fundamental problem is that they are a centralising Government who do not care about or trust local authorities at all. That is why I ask my hon. Friend the Member for Rayleigh to consider the question of the commitment not just to the 30 per cent. figure, but to the 70 per cent. figure. Of course, this issue is particularly relevant to Scotland, because nothing in the Bill enables us to be sure that any of this money will, in the end, get to Scottish local authorities. Nor do we understand, as the hon. Member for Twickenham said, what will happen in reality to a section 106, or section 75, agreement. Is this to be a new-found version of the withering away of the state? Is the provision just going to disappear? I can see nothing in the Bill to suggest that it will, which means that this fundamental contrast and conflict will remain.</p>

This planning gain supplement is of course nonsense. We have tried it at least three times before&#151;probably four&#151;and it has not worked. The only way in which the Government can justify its working in Scotland or in England is to say, &#147;If we have a very small tax, nobody will notice, so the reasons why it never worked before will cease to exist.&#148; As my right hon. Friend the Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood) says, that might be true; however, the inevitable answer is that the one way to ensure that nobody will notice is to have no tax at all. However, that cannot happen if the Government will not let us in on the secret of how much this tax will be. </p>

balloons and having the cake made&#151;we normally have a budget: we work out how much the birthday will cost and how we will raise the money. However, this is preparation without a budget, except for a sum that is related not to the &#147;birthday party&#148;, but to the preparations themselves. That sum will be yet more money for the Government to spend on the subject about which they are most expert: the failed computer system. It will doubtless be more money for the information technology companies, which they can spend showing the Government that they cannot do what they want them to do.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o55"><a name="70220-0006.htm_para1"><a name="07022050000242">I and the people of Scotland want to know how much money we are talking about. What would 70 per cent. of that sum be, and how do we know that it will really go to the local authorities? What, therefore, would 30 per cent. of that sum be, and how do we know that the Scottish Executive will use it in the way that the United Kingdom Government say that they will use such money in England and Wales? None of that information has come our way. We cannot even work out the equation by analogy, because the Government have not told us about the 30 per cent. that they will get into the Treasury anyway. That is why the new clause tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Rayleigh makes specific reference to a joint evaluation by Her Majesty&#146;s Treasury and the Scottish Executive. I want to know about that. I want to know what the Treasury intends to do not only with the money that goes to Scotland&#151;that is obviously a matter for discussion between the Treasury and the Scottish Executive&#151;but with the money that goes to England.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o56"><a name="70220-0006.htm_para2"><a name="07022050000243">It used to be said that such money will be used for regional projects. The hon.

That would be very difficult to justify, but when the Government talk of regions, that is what could happen. It could happen in Scotland too.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o57"><a name="70220-0006.htm_para3"><a name="07022050000244">The issue is important for the credibility of the system. The Minister will have some fair words&#151;or even some nasty words&#151;about it, but the truth is that most people are frightened of development. They would prefer it not to take place. One of the ways to get people to accept development is to suggest a direct connection between development and an improvement in their lives and the area in which they live. If we are to have a system in which 30 per cent. is removed and given to the Scottish Executive or the Government without any reference to what it will be used for, it will be more difficult to get people to accept that development.</p>

<i> Planning </i>and <i> Estates Gazette</i> and that has been my profession since I was 22, so I have a long history of trying to understand planning and development issues. My experience is that the vast majority of people are suspicious&#151;the French word is &#147;m&#233;fiant&#148;&#151;of development proposals. That is generally true and in such circumstances one needs to make them feelthat a development is proposed not just for the aggrandisement of the local council or the advantage of the developer, but that local people will gain something from it. That means some local injection of money, rather than the funds being spread about. That is especially true in Scotland&#151;as the hon. Member for Edinburgh, North and Leith (Mark Lazarowicz) pointed out&#151;which has a sad history of a centralising tendency. There is not quite the willingness to allow local authorities to make some of the decisions that one would hope that they might.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o58"><a name="70220-0006.htm_para4"><a name="07022050000247">We should wait to find out the facts before the provisions of the Bill take effect. The House is being asked to sign a blank cheque and the effect will be worse in Scotland. The Government are suggesting to the people of Scotland, and to the people of England and Wales, a process that is utterly alien to parliamentary democracy. The Government are asking for the right to spend people&#146;s money on something that they will not delineate, at a cost that they will not quantify and subject to a tax that they will not specify. The proposal will produce a sum that the Government will not name, that will be divided on a basis of which they are not certain and that will be spent in a way that they will not restrict. That is what the Government are asking people to vote for. That is an intolerable proposal.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o59"><a name="70220-0006.htm_para5"><a name="07022050000248">The only thing that is certain in the Bill is the bill for the preparation for something that may never happen. That makes this a very peculiar Bill. It is a mark of the seriousness of the state of governance of this country that we have got this far and most of the press have not noticed that peculiarity. If we are not careful, we will go on having such Bills, because they are very convenient for the Government. They do not have to tell anybody in Scotland anything about the issue. We have not been told how much will be raised in Scotland or how it will be divided. Nor have we been told whether the Treasury will get its hands on it. That is the most important thing for the discussion between the Treasury and the Scottish Executive. There is, of course, a significant financial subsidy for Scotland that comes from the rest of the British taxpayers. Does the Treasury have it in mind that, if the Scottish Executive get this money, it might revisit the Barnett formula? Might it have a look and see whether it could ante off this money?</p>

I have to tell Scottish Members of Parliament that the daily conversation on the lips of my constituents is about whether it is reasonable for them to ante up the money in circumstances in which they have no control over its spending. I would not be at all surprised if there were a little gleam in the Treasury&#146;s mind that perhaps this is one of the ways in which it can right that wrong. If so, the Treasury should come clean. We want to know about it. But, then, it has not come clean on anything else.</p>

We are allowing the Government to come to the House with a Bill that contains nothing. It is as empty as the ten-minute Bill that I moved earlier. Aficionados will know that when one moves a ten-minute Bill, it has only a title and a long title. Between the First and the Second Readings, one puts in the bit about which one has spoken.

I was pleased that he drew attention to the evidence of the Scottish Property Federation, which clearly believes that, if the measure went through, it would reduce the supply of development and development land in Scotland at a time when people feel that there needs to be more housing built in Scotland and when the great cities of Edinburgh, Glasgow and elsewhere may need more development opportunities for additional office, commercial or retail space. It would be a great pity if the House allowed something to go through in preparation for a tax that would make that position worse rather than better.</p>

recent opinion polls.

They are worried for good reason; their local authorities tell them that the tax would reduce their opportunities to take section 75 money, in the case of Scottish authorities, or section 106 money, in the case of English authorities, and thus reduce their ability to direct and control the element of the gain that a developer was prepared to share through a sensibly negotiated agreement.</p>

I understand how that might work, but I doubt that the Minister would be honest enough to say today that that is the Government&#146;s wicked plan. After watching Ministers and hearing their conversations with their Back Benchers, I fear that the Government do not even have a wicked plan. On this occasion, they have blundered into something that Labour Governments always do. They realise from historical research&#151;history is not the strong subject of this Administration&#151;that all the previous efforts have gone wrong, so they have come up with the silly idea that if there were a lower rate of tax, it might somehow not be so damaging.

Inevitably, if there is to be another layer of tax, the reaction of any sensible, commercially minded developer will be simply to sit on his or her hands.

One of the biggest concerns of us all, particularly those of us in relatively built-up constituencies, is the demand for more social or affordable housing. The reality in London, after six years of the Mayor of London&#146;s policy that there should be at least 50 per cent. social housing in large-scale developments, is precisely as I have pointed out; developers have decided to sit on their hands rather than go ahead with new developments and have watched as the value of their sites has risen yet higher. It has been the very worst news for the most vulnerable in our society, particularly in built-up areas. I think that we all appreciate that as our societies become ever more polarised between the extremely rich and the extremely badly off&#151;I am sure that that applies in the constituency of the hon.

It will be very bad for Scotland and for England. I am only sorry that, as a number of my colleagues have pointed out, there are not more Scottish Members present. One hopes that they would have been able to put the case even more robustly and defend their own interests.</p>

Councils looking at the wider benefits of encouraging business and its growth could see the impact of having new land available for business and office development, but at least in the days when business rates were collected and kept locally there was a straight local benefit that could be perceived. Similarly, the Government should recognise the benefits of section 75 agreements, which allow the local authority to assess its priorities in its own community for dealing with the impact of development.</p>

That means that although the tax will be UK wide, there is nevertheless an important interaction with planning obligations and responsibilities for infrastructure and development, which will rightly rest in Scotland and with Scotland.

Parliament and Scottish Executive. The hon. Gentleman asked me a specific question, so let megive him a specific answer. I mentioned earlier the consultation that we published on the principle and outline of a possible planning-gain supplement in December 2005. We had 39 responses from Scotland and other devolved areas.

Secondly, we have said that the devolved Administrations will have discretion over how PGS revenues from their country will be used to support infrastructure. That is not, as the right hon.

Thirdly, we have said that we will undertake detailed further work with the devolved Administrations and with interested parties in those countries to examine the introduction of a planning gain supplement as regards areas of devolved policy such as planning obligation agreements, including section 75 agreements in Scotland and article 40 agreements in Northern Ireland.</p>

said, we received several important contributions to the first consultation, which have had an important influence on the way in which we have developed proposals since. The views that came to us from Scotland have been decisive in helping us to come to the view that Scotland should keep 100 per cent. of PGS revenues that may be raised there and that Scotland should have full discretion over the use of those revenues for supporting infrastructure in Scotland&#151;commitments that have been welcomed by Scotland&#146;s First Minister. In addition, start notices, which are already a feature of the planning system in Scotland, could play a useful part in any PGS. On planning obligations, our proposal to use a common starting point from the negotiations on affordable housing also draws heavily on the approach that is already in place in Scotland.</p>

The determination of section 75 planning agreements would rightly remain the preserve of the Scottish Executive and the Scottish Parliament. Nothing in any proposed PGS policy, and certainly nothing in the Bill, would legally require changes to Scotland&#146;s planning policy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o83"><a name="70220-0007.htm_para8"><a name="07022050000310">As the PGS would be a national tax applying across the UK, decisions on whether it should be enacted, and if so how, will be the preserve of this Parliament.</p>

The only major matter of substance in the Bill relating to Scotland is that Scotland is not specified in it. That is because preparatory expenditure needing new powers under the Bill would not be incurred by the Scottish Executive. The Bill itself will place no additional burdens or requirements on Scotland. Any introduction of a PGS, together with its application across the UK, would be preceded by debate and substantive legislation on the wider policy. That would provide the opportunity to examine in detail any concerns about the design and operation of a PGS.</p>

The new planning permission that the Government recently proposed might be an example. Can the Minister give a firm commitment that the funds being requested by the Bill will be used solely for PGS-related work? I ask that partly because, following the hostile reaction that the proposed PGS has provoked so far, the Treasury appears to have been gradually backing away from its introduction in recent months. We were originally told that the Government planned to introduce the PGS in 2008, and the Treasury issued a consultation document in 2005 on how that might be achieved.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o103"><a name="70220-0008.htm_para5"><a name="07022050000332">To coincide with the delay announced in the pre-Budget report, the Treasury also announced a further three consultation documents on the proposed introduction of the PGS: &#147;Valuing planning gain&#148;, &#147;Paying PGS&#148; and, in co-operation with the Department for Communities and Local Government, &#147;Changes to Planning Obligations&#148;. The three consultations will not close until 28 February&#151;next week&#151;and presumably the Government will want to analyse the responses that it has received before deciding whether to proceed. The original consultation exercise produced some 700 responses, and we can assume that this exercise will produce quite a number as well. There is little point in seeking a wide range of opinions if the Government have already decided to plough on regardless, yet this evening they are still asking the House to vote for approval for preparatory spending before the consultations have even closed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o104"><a name="70220-0008.htm_para6"><a name="07022050000333">During the 30 January Committee sitting, atcolumn 11, the Financial Secretary assured me that if the Government did resolve eventually to press ahead with the PGS, they would do so by means of a separate Bill rather than including primary legislation in a Finance Bill. Given that, and on the assumption that there will be a Budget statement in March followed by a Finance Bill in April, the Government need not rush preparation of the necessary clauses so that they are ready less than two months from today. If the Government are now contemplating introducing a separate Bill to allow implementation in 2009 rather than 2008 as originally envisaged, they have further time in which to reflect on what to do, and therefore need not seek the approval of the House to begin spending public funds almost immediately. That is particularly important, as there is no expenditure limit in the Bill. The expenditure could be theoretically be open-ended, particularly if the Treasury continues to dither on whether or not ultimately to proceed withthe PGS.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o105"><a name="70220-0008.htm_para7"><a name="07022050000334">The explanatory notes that accompany the Bill provide an indicative figure of up to &#163;52 million for staffing in the procurement of an associated PGS IT system, but as the notes point out, they do not form a part of the Bill itself, so it is purely an estimate, not a cap. The actual figure could easily exceed the estimate, particularly if there are cost overruns on the associated computer system&#151;a point that we debated in some detail in Committee and in relation to which recent experiences in the Home Office and the NHS are hardly encouraging.</p>

Gentleman that a consultation is not simply a 12-week period in which the Treasury and the other Departments involved shut up shop and officials sit on their hands, followed bya period of frenetic reading and analysis of correspondence. On the contrary, it is a period of intense activity, particularly by officials who, during the consultation period, have been out meeting and discussing the issues with representatives of all sorts of interested groups right across the United Kingdom in order to determine their concerns about the matters under consultation. So, officials and others have been out there, explaining the proposals and listening to people&#146;s views on them. Many of the written responses to the consultation will formalise the views that we are already aware of and that have already been discussed, and which have been gathered during these meetings.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o119"><a name="70220-0009.htm_para1"><a name="07022061000003">This Bill is a short, straightforward measure. It is a one-page, three-clause paving Bill designed simply to ensure the regularity and propriety of Government expenditure in accordance with Government accounting rules&#151;no more, no less. As a narrow preparations measure, it obviously has nothing to say about the underlying policy, nature or operation of a planning gain supplement, although many Members have had much to say about such matters during our deliberations. In fact, I welcome that level of interest, along with the expertise demonstrated in all parts of the House, which has contributed and will continue to contribute to our thinking on the policy of a planning gain supplement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o120"><a name="70220-0009.htm_para2"><a name="07022061000004">We have approached the question of whether to introduce a planning gain supplement&#151;and if so, how best to design it&#151;with a degree of caution and a significant degree of consultation. We published a wide-ranging consultation document in December 2005 on the principle of a planning gain supplement, and on 6 December 2006 we published three further consultation documents. The consultation will closeon 28 February. The Treasury Select Committee commended the Government on our measured approach to these proposals. It said:</p>
<a name="70220-0009.htm_brev0"><a name="07022061000037"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;We welcome the measured way in which the Government is consulting on and taking forward proposals for a Planning-gain Supplement.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o121"><a name="70220-0009.htm_para3"><a name="07022061000005">That process and approach will continue, but the Bill authorises three parties&#151;Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs, the Secretary of State for Communitiesand Local Government, and the Northern Ireland Departments&#151;to incur preparatory expenditure. Nevertheless, the burden of, and the most significant responsibility for, building the administrative systems&#151;and, ultimately, for managing any planning gain supplement&#151;will rest with HMRC. Its expenditure before the introduction of any further legislation will include new information technologyfor the planning gain supplement and the adaptation of its existing system; designing the business systems necessary to administer the tax, and putting in place appropriately skilled staff to manage it; and equipping the evaluation office agency and the Valuation and Lands Agency in Northern Ireland with the necessary facilities to help administer a planning gain supplement, including staff, training, accommodation and IT equipment.</p>

<p><a name="st_o196"><a name="07022061000007"><a name="70220-0009.htm_spnew2"><a name="07022061000053"><b>John Healey:</b> The hon. Gentleman races ahead of the point that we have reached in speculative work on how a system might be designed, commissioned and developed. Authorisation for that next stage is required by this very paving Bill, but these administrative functions would have to be based on further substantive legislation, and properly tested and in place before the introduction of the planning gain supplement, which we have said will not take place before 2009.</p>

<p><a name="st_o197"><a name="07022061000008"><a name="70220-0009.htm_spnew3"><a name="07022061000054"><b>Mr. Gummer:</b> If the system is not to be populated by information, is it to be unpopulated? If so, how do we know that it will work? I find it very difficult to understand what we are spending IT system money on if there is no information to populate it. Can the Minister explain what the system will do?</p>

<p><a name="st_o198"><a name="07022061000009"><a name="70220-0009.htm_spnew4"><a name="07022061000055"><b>John Healey:</b> I did not say that it would not be populated by information. Clearly at some point any IT system would need to be populated by information. All I said was that the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Stewart Hosie) was asking specific questions that were taking us several stages ahead of where we are in the process at the moment. A final decision on whether to introduce a planning gain supplement awaits the conclusion of the current round of consultations. The passage of this Bill is needed in advance of that decision and that is the purpose of bringing it forward. If we decide that we should introduce a planning gain supplement, we can start to design, commission and build the IT administrative systems immediately to support that, and increase the chances of doing so successfully and in a timely and cost-effective way.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o122"><a name="70220-0009.htm_para4"><a name="07022061000010">The Bill is not exceptional, in that the House has approved paving measures for policies that have been far less developed than our proposals for a planning gain supplement are at this time. Paving Bills are not unusual and are introduced where there is a need to incur expenditure in advance of the main legislation. Examples include the British Coal and British Rail (Transfer Proposals) Act 1993 and the Tax Credits (Initial Expenditure) Act 1998. More recent examples include section 137 of the Finance Act 2002, which authorised preparatory expenditure on a lorry road user charge, and section 324 of the Finance Act 2004, which gave authorisation to the Treasury to incur expenditure if we were to adopt the single currency. Clearly it is in no one&#146;s interest&#151;certainly not the Government&#146;s&#151;to proceed with the implementation of a planning gain supplement unless or until such time as we are satisfied that the policy will be workable and effective.</p>

Can he tell us, as an example, how much has been spent by the Treasury in preparing for the implementation of the single currency in the United Kingdom?</p>

<p><a name="st_o201"><a name="07022061000013"><a name="70220-0009.htm_spnew7"><a name="07022061000058"><b>John Healey:</b> I am happy to take your guidance on that point, Mr. Deputy Speaker<i> .</i></p>

<p><a name="stpa_o123"><a name="70220-0009.htm_para5"><a name="07022061000014">The central question when considering whether to introduce a planning gain supplement is whether it would be workable and effective as a means of capturing the land value uplift that comes with planning permission to finance infrastructure and support growth. I reiterate to this House, as I have clearly stated before, that if the Government decide not to go ahead with a planning gain supplement, no further expenditure will be incurred under this legislation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o124"><a name="70220-0009.htm_para6"><a name="07022061000015">The explanatory notes we published with the Billset out the latest estimates of the possible cost of introduction. They are cautious, top-end estimates that are subject to change as the project is refined and the policy finalised. They also represent costs right the way through to full introduction and initial operation of a planning gain supplement, by which time of course there would have been full subsequent debate and legislation to authorise its administration.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o125"><a name="70220-0009.htm_para7"><a name="07022061000016">The Bill is simple and straightforward. It is a preparations Bill to allow the Government, pending further decisions on whether to introduce a planning gain supplement, to prepare adequately for the policy prior to its implementation. I commend it to the House.</p>
<a name="ordayhd_9"><a name="70220-0009.htm_ordayhd1"><a name="07022061000050"><h5 align="left">5.48 pm</h5>
<p><a name="st_o202"><a name="07022061000017"><a name="70220-0009.htm_spnew8"><a name="07022061000059"><b>Mr. Francois:</b> We now come to the Third Reading of this paving Bill, which is designed to help implement a planning gain supplement. This is not the first time the House of Commons has been asked to debate a tax on the increase in the value of land. The earliest specific example that I was able to find of such a measure was an Act in the reign of Henry VI, dated from 1427, which facilitated a tax on the improvement in land values based on the construction of sewers. For the record, a similar measure was apparently also attempted under Henry VIII in 1531. To leap forward some four centuries, something like this was tried five times in the 20th century, and on each occasion it foundered, principally over the issue of how to agree on the valuation to be taxed. In debating this matter again tonight we are following in the footsteps of our legislative predecessors&#151;with, I suspect, the same ultimate outcome at the end of the whole process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o126"><a name="70220-0009.htm_para8"><a name="07022061000018">Coming right up to the present, we opposed this paving Bill on Second Reading and in Committee, and we remain opposed to it tonight. We remain opposed to the related planning gain supplement in principle for a number of reasons, which I laid out in some detail on Second Reading on 15 January, but which might be briefly summarised as follows. First, although it is supposed to assist local communities, it is designed to be centrally collected and then redistributed according to Government fiat. Secondly, in England a significant element of the tax is intended to be regionally administered by undemocratic and unrepresentative regional bodies. Thirdly, it is likely to hinder, rather than help, the creation of affordable housing, asthe National Housing Federation has pointed out. Fourthly, it would be a highly complex tax to administer in practice, not least because of the likelihood&#151;based on all historical precedent&#151;of lengthy arguments over valuations.</p>

If they cannot even convince themselves, how do they expect to convince the House? This is a Bill, and indeed a tax, with few friends. For instance, the CBI said of the proposed planning gain supplement:</p>
<a name="70220-0009.htm_brev1"><a name="07022061000038"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;the Government&#146;s proposals to implement PGS are likely to lead to a number of unintended and negative consequences that would outweigh the potential benefits of PGS and we would strongly urge the Government to reconsider its proposals.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o128"><a name="70220-0009.htm_para10"><a name="07022061000020">Similarly, the British Property Federation, which has been staunchly opposed to the planning gain supplement throughout, said that it:</p>
<a name="70220-0009.htm_brev2"><a name="07022061000039"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Is not suited to brownfield or previously developed sites; removes the linkage between the developer, the developmentand direct community benefit; can provide uncertainly in the planning process; is unworkable on most commercial developments; will slow the rate of developments coming forward; will discourage regeneration schemes; will create a blockage in the planning system; could lead to lengthy disputes in the courts and does not give any certainty that the necessary infrastructure will be provided.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o129"><a name="70220-0009.htm_para11"><a name="07022061000021">Other than that, the British Property Federation thought that the planning gain supplement was a good idea.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o130"><a name="70220-0009.htm_para12"><a name="07022061000022">Meanwhile, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors said of the planning gain supplement:</p>
<a name="70220-0009.htm_brev3"><a name="07022061000040"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The proposals are based on a misunderstanding of how land is valued, how planning gains arise and how the property market operates&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o131"><a name="70220-0009.htm_para13"><a name="07022061000023">The Chartered Institute of Taxation was equally unimpressed and commented as follows:</p>
<a name="70220-0009.htm_brev4"><a name="07022061000041"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Not even a well thought out consultation document can save a bad idea and we think that the law of unintended consequences will apply, with the result that the proposals will not deliver the Government&#146;s policy objectives without a major element of compulsion being applied to local planning authorities, to allow developments that they do not wish to allow.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o132"><a name="70220-0009.htm_para14"><a name="07022061000024">The National Housing Federation, the umbrella body for housing associations, argued in 2006 in its evidence to the then Select Committee on the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister that the planning gain supplement would not assist the development of affordable housing. It is an expert in the area, and as it explained:</p>
<a name="70220-0009.htm_brev5"><a name="07022061000042"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;By charging PGS on affordable housing the Treasury will simply be pushing money around the public funding system....If PGS is levied on housing associations a proportion of housing association grant for social housing will effectively be paid back to the Treasury via PGS and fewer homes will be provided. Moving funds from one part of the public purse to another is not efficient.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o133"><a name="70220-0009.htm_para15"><a name="07022061000025">Similarly, there have been concerns about the effect on the charitable sector. The Charitable Properties Association&#151;the CPA&#151;argued on that point in evidence to the Communities and Local Government Committee. It stated:</p>
<a name="70220-0009.htm_brev6"><a name="07022061000043"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The CPA believes the PGS will have a seriously detrimental impact on the financial position of property owning charities.

increase in land value on which it is to be levied. As the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, which is a specialist in this area, has argued:</p>
<a name="70220-0009.htm_brev7"><a name="07022061000044"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The valuation of development sites comprises of making assumptions about different variables, six of which can have a big impact on the opinion of value. A change of around 5 per cent. in each of these variables can result in an overall change in the value of the site of over 25 per cent.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o135"><a name="70220-0009.htm_para17"><a name="07022061000027">It is not just representatives of business and the third sector who have voiced their public opposition to the planning gain supplement. A number of prominent Labour party members and organisations have done so too. A previous Labour Minister with responsibility for planning and housing, the right hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich (Mr. Raynsford), who is in his place this evening, is on the record as opposing the concept of the planning gain supplement. He reiterated his opposition during the Second Reading of the Bill on 15 January. If he will allow me, I will quote what he said:</p>
<a name="70220-0009.htm_brev8"><a name="07022061000045"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Although this is only a paving Bill, it begins a process that is inherently complex and risky and that could end badly. I urge my right hon. and hon. Friends to take stock and give careful thought to all the issues involved, as well as the considered views of the people and organisations who best know the minefield that they are approaching. If they do so, they may well conclude that the alternatives available can generate better outcomes and save them from repeating the mistakes of the past. When history has such good lessons to teach us, it is unwise&#151;to say the least&#151;to ignore them.&#148;&#151;[<i> Official Report</i>, 15 January 2007;Vol. 455, c. 582-3.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o136"><a name="70220-0009.htm_para18"><a name="07022061000028">Quite. When even well-respected Labour former Ministers are sounding warning bells it is little wonder that the Government have paused for thought, yet they want the approval of the House to spend the money nevertheless.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o137"><a name="70220-0009.htm_para19"><a name="07022061000029">That is not the only objection to the tax from a socialist quarter. As we have already heard this evening, the Labour-led Scottish Executive have expressed strong reservations about the implementation of the planning gain supplement. Despite our giving the Minister a good opportunity under new clause 1 to lay out in more detail how some of the aspects would operate in Scotland, he declined to do so. Moreover, a joint memorandum was submitted to the then Select Committee on the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister in March 2006 by the Labour Housing Group and the Labour Land Campaign, the former of which describes itself as</p>
<a name="70220-0009.htm_brev9"><a name="07022061000046"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;A socialist society affiliated to the Labour Party, who aim to promote affordable housing&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o138"><a name="70220-0009.htm_para20"><a name="07022061000030">It is reassuring to know that socialists are still allowed to be affiliated to the Labour party. The memorandum states:</p>
<a name="70220-0009.htm_brev10"><a name="07022061000047"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The PGS proposals combined with the package of reforms proposed for the planning system following the Barker Report will not address the problem of the shortage of affordable housing, a severe problem in the South West and many rural areas, including parts of Yorkshire, Derbyshire and Cumbria&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o139"><a name="70220-0009.htm_para21"><a name="07022061000031">On top of all that, the Library briefing note that accompanies the Bill points out that the &#147;closest precedent&#148; in terms of a similar paving Bill was the 1998 Tax Credits (Initial Expenditure) Bill, which led to the much troubled tax credits system, in which just under half of all the payments in the system each year are incorrect. In his Third Reading speech, the Minister cited that as a recent example of a paving Bill. The financial memorandum that accompanied that Bill  <br>

nine years ago explained that expenditure of between &#163;15 million and &#163;20 million was required to facilitate the introduction of tax credits. Even allowing for inflation since that time, are the Government seriously arguing to the House that the preparatory work for the introduction of the planning gain supplement is likely to cost twice what was required to help bring in the whole tax credits system, which now equates to some &#163;16 billion a year of public resources? If they are, that really tells us something about how complicatedand bureaucratic the planning gain supplement is likely to be.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o140"><a name="70220-0009.htm_para22"><a name="07022061000032">As we have argued throughout the course of theBill, most MPs across the House would accept that developers should make an adequate contribution to infrastructure costs in return for receiving permission to build, but the planning gain supplement is not the way to achieve that. As the <i> Estates Gazette</i> argued forcefully about the planning gain supplement in December 2006:</p>
<a name="70220-0009.htm_brev11"><a name="07022061000048"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Of course it won&#146;t work. It didn&#146;t work the five times it was tried in the past century and it won&#146;t work now.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o141"><a name="70220-0009.htm_para23"><a name="07022061000033">In advocating the Bill tonight, the Government are asking the House to commit an unlimited sum in preparation for an unpopular tax that does not itself guarantee that the full proceeds of any development will return to the area in question, and which in Scotland and Wales does not guarantee that anything at all will be returned to the affected locality.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o142"><a name="70220-0009.htm_para24"><a name="07022061000034">Perhaps that is part of the reason why so many organisations oppose the planning gain supplement. To remind the Minister, the Confederation of British Industry does not want it. The Institute of Directors does not want it. The British Property Federation does not want it. The Scottish Property Federation doesnot want it. The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors does not want it. The Royal Town Planning Institute does not want it. The Chartered Institute of Taxation does not want it. The House Builders Federation does not want it. The National Housing Federation wants it, but only if it does not apply to the federation. The Scottish Executive might want it, but only if it does not apply in Scotland. The Labour Housing Group does not want it if it applies to Cornwall, Cumbria, Derbyshire or Yorkshire. The right hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich does not want it to apply anywhere at all, and nor does my right hon. Friend the Member for Suffolk, Coastal (Mr. Gummer)&#151;he would not want it even if it applied only to Protestants. No one wants it except the Treasury, and even the Treasury is not sure whether it wants it at all.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o143"><a name="70220-0009.htm_para25"><a name="07022061000035">Despite that wall of opposition, the Government&#146;s hesitation and the fact that they have downgraded their proposal from a definite way forward to only a lead option, the Minister still had the neck to ask the Commons to vote Supply of more than &#163;50 million to prepare for the introduction of a tax with which the Treasury might never proceed. All that money might eventually be wasted, not least because the Minister assured us earlier that any IT procured would not be used for anything else.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o144"><a name="70220-0009.htm_para26"><a name="07022061000036">The Conservatives oppose the Bill, and the planning gain supplement to which it relates.

Friend the Financial Secretary that the reservations that I voiced on Second Reading remain real. I am speaking to express the hope that during the consideration that the Treasury will give to representations submitted during the course of the consultation, it will consider very carefully indeed reservations expressed by a wide range of authoritative commentators who believe that the Bill&#151;it is, admittedly, a short paving Bill, as my hon. Friend emphasised&#151;is taking us down a high-risk route and that it could well lead to an outcome that he, I and many hon. Members would deeply regret.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o145"><a name="70220-0010.htm_para0"><a name="07022066000002">I speak not from the point of view of someone who has any doubt about the merits of raising a significant contribution from the profits that accrue from development to fund necessary and desirable infrastructure and social provision that would enhance those developments. I wholeheartedly endorse the principle of ensuring that developers contribute towards a more sustainable and rounded development than would otherwise be possible and the principle that the community, as well as the developer, should receive a true gain from the process. The issue is not the principle of raising revenue from the profits of development to fund necessary infrastructure and social provision, but the mechanism by which those funds are raised.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o146"><a name="70220-0010.htm_para1"><a name="07022066000003">I know that the Government&#146;s argument is that the implementation of the existing system, which is largely based on the section 106 mechanism in Englandand the section 75 mechanism in Scotland, is patchy. I accept that entirely. However, I speak as someone who represents an area in which the mechanism has been used to good effect by a local authority that has been absolutely clear in its objectives and open in its relations with developers. It has wanted not only to ensure that there is a fair contribution&#151;often quite a significant one&#151;but to give the certainty that that contribution will go into the area concerned to deliver demonstrable and tangible benefits for the benefit of not only the wider community, but the developer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o147"><a name="70220-0010.htm_para2"><a name="07022066000004">I have seen that happen in a range of areas. The millennium village in the Greenwich peninsula is widely spoken of as an exemplar of sustainable new development and high-quality housing. It has achieved high environmental standards and has a mix oftenures, with owner-occupiers, tenants and people on intermediate tenures living together in a harmonious framework. The attractive ecology park makes the area a desirable place in which to live. A primary school was taken in one form of its existence on to the site so that there would be a school there as and when residents moved into the development. The school has the capacity to expand to two forms of entry so that it can absorb the additional pupil numbers that come as a result of the development. A health centre provides high-quality health care for people in the new development. All that, together with the transport  <br>

infrastructure, such as the Jubilee line and other transport facilities, makes the development highly sustainable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o148"><a name="70220-0010.htm_para3"><a name="07022066000005">The development has benefited hugely from developer contributions, and everyone has seen the benefit of that. The developer has received a benefit because the contributions have made the development more attractive. People want to come to live in the area&#151;they are moving not to a frontier town, but to somewhere with an attractive existing park, a school and a health centre that were in place from the early stages.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o149"><a name="70220-0010.htm_para4"><a name="07022066000006">The community has benefited from the contributions because it has such facilities, which was not the case for earlier developments that had far less good social infrastructure throughout their early stages. The development in the 1960s and 1970s in Thamesmead, in my neighbouring constituency, was often heavily criticised because it was predominantly residential and there was a shortage of the necessary facilities and infrastructure to allow a vibrant community to be in place right from the outset. A lot of work has been done subsequently to transform Thamesmead, but its start was not auspicious because of a lack of the extensive employment and social infrastructure that should have been in place at the beginning. We have learned lessons from history, and new developments in our area are being carried through in such a way as to ensure that developers make a significant contribution towards necessary infrastructure.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o150"><a name="70220-0010.htm_para5"><a name="07022066000007">As I have implied, developers are generally happy to pay the contribution, but there are few developerswho are keen to pay. They see the benefits of the contribution and appreciate the certainty that if they pay the contribution, they will get their planning permission and have a development of which their new residents, tenants and occupiers can all be proud. There is a win-win situation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o151"><a name="70220-0010.htm_para6"><a name="07022066000008">I can cite not only the single example of the Greenwich millennium village, although that is a fine example, because there are many others. Although the Meridian Delta Ltd. development on the same Greenwich peninsula has not yet begun, contributions have already started to be made towards improving road access to the site, which will be necessary to cope with the larger number of people living there. Although I am in favour of more sustainable forms of transport, some improvements to the road network were necessary. Those improvements are being funded in advance of the beginning of the development, but I am afraid that that would not be feasible under the formula proposed for the planning gain supplement, under which sums would be payable only at the start of the development. In addition, those funds would be payable to central Government, so it would probably take more time for them to come back to the locality. There is thus a question of timing. Developers are happy to make a contribution at the beginning of the process because they know that that is necessary to facilitate the development from an early stage.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o152"><a name="70220-0010.htm_para7"><a name="07022066000009">The question of valuation is the nub of the issue.

mid-19th century. There was an enormous residue of heavy metals and other pollution in the land, so there were vast remediation costs involved in making development possible on the land.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o153"><a name="70220-0010.htm_para8"><a name="07022066000010">Of course, any developer who was faced with the prospect of paying the planning gain supplement would have at its disposal a bank of well-qualified advisers and lawyers who could identify all such offsetting costs and would be able to demonstrate, with extraordinary skill and facility, that when account had been taken of the remediation costs and the other offsets necessary to secure a successful development, such as discounted commercial lettings in the early years to ensure that tenants are found for properties, the uplift in value associated with the grant of planning permission would be either very small indeed, or perhaps nothing at all. However small the percentage take of planning gain supplement, a very small percentage of a very small or even non-existent figure is of no great value or even nothing. Yet there may well be very considerable downstream development gains. These are big developments that will only really come into their own over 10, 15 or 20 years, at the end of which profits will be considerable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o154"><a name="70220-0010.htm_para9"><a name="07022066000011">The section 106 agreements being negotiated by my local council&#151;with MDL in relation to the peninsula, with Berkeley homes in relation to the Woolwich Arsenal, and on other very big sites&#151;take account of long-term profit and benefit, rather than simply the immediate uplift in value associated with the grant of planning permission.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o155"><a name="70220-0010.htm_para10"><a name="07022066000012">I therefore put it to my hon. Friend the Minister that in these examples there is a likelihood that a planning gain supplement introduced on the principles that the Government propose could well result in a reduced take overall, once the developers have demonstrated all the offsetting costs and the limitations on the increase in value attributable to the grant of planning permission. They will be able to minimise their potential contribution. There is a serious risk that on some of these sites the public sector take will be less than is being secured under the section 106 system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o156"><a name="70220-0010.htm_para11"><a name="07022066000013">That would be a tragedy and a disaster. First, it would involve the parties&#151;the local authority, the developers and the community&#151;no longer working together harmoniously to secure benefits to the community. There would be a separate process in which there would no longer be an incentive for the developer to work positively and constructively to get the best outcome. The incentive would be for it to minimise its liability for planning gain supplement&#151;that would be a natural reaction.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o157"><a name="70220-0010.htm_para12"><a name="07022066000014">Secondly, the local authority would be worried that it would not get sufficient money from its 70 per cent. share of the planning gain supplement to provide the infrastructure that it wanted to provide&#151;and was able to provide using the existing section 106 framework. Those are genuine fears coming not from the developers but from local authorities and other practitioners who have been involved in facilitating development and using section 106 to secure benefits to the community. They fear that the planning gain supplement could deliver less than the current arrangements.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o158"><a name="70220-0010.htm_para13"><a name="07022066000015">That brings me to the obvious question: why are the Government introducing this measure? There are a number of reasons. One is the recommendation from  <br>

<notus-date day="20" month="2" year="2007" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><b>20 Feb 2007 : Column 198</b><br>
the Barker report which suggested this option. If we look back at the context of that report, we may well feel that this is not one of the happiest of its recommendations. It was in many respects a trade-off because of other pressures on the planning system to deliver more houses. I am not sure that the mechanism will deliver, for reasons that I have already explained, or that it is entirely appropriate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o159"><a name="70220-0010.htm_para14"><a name="07022066000016">I certainly think that the Government have got themselves into a position where the planning gain supplement is becoming a totem, and there is a risk that it will proceed despite all the reservations that have been widely voiced about its potential downsides. That will be because it has got into the currency, because the Barker report recommended it, because in responding to the report the Government said that they would proceed with it, because they consulted and following that they said that it was a lead option, and because they then introduced a paving Bill allowing them to take further steps.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o160"><a name="70220-0010.htm_para15"><a name="07022066000017">In my most pessimistic moments, I see a remorseless process, with the juggernaut going down the road through various stages and reaching a point where it becomes unstoppable. I fear that if that happens, we will find ourselves, in two or three years, seeing the introduction of a tax which has serious disadvantages, including its possible impact on certain communities, such as mine, which has benefited from the existing section 106 framework, and which will end up proving to be a problem that the Government could well have avoided.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o161"><a name="70220-0010.htm_para16"><a name="07022066000018">I hope that, even at this late stage, my hon. Friend and his colleagues in the Treasury will reconsider. I do not believe that section 106 is incapable of delivering the benefits that should be delivered to facilitate development. I have accepted entirely that the performance is patchy. We should be looking much more closely at options for sharing expertise, for sharing the good practice of those who are doing things well and for assisting those local authorities that are not currently making the most of the section 106 system, to ensure greater benefits for their communities from the profits of development. That is not unfeasible. I am sure that there is scope for doing that, and I am sure that within the sums that have been allocated under the paving Bill it should be possible to provide expert advisory units to support local authorities to do the job better and to gain more from the section 106 process.</p>

Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, South-West (Dr. Starkey) is here and I know that she will be more expert in the matter than I. English Partnerships, the local authority and other development interests in Milton Keynes worked for some time to produce the concept that was called, perhaps inappropriately, a roof tax, although it is more a tariff system. The benefit is that it gives certainty to all parties that there will be proceeds from development and that those can be used to fund the necessary infrastructure and social provision.</p>

having, essentially, a single landowner in English Partnerships and in having, as a growth area, large development that is planned, so that we know where housing will be and can say precisely what infrastructure is needed over time as well as within an area, meaning that it can be costed in advance and a sum agreed per dwelling. That is applicable to other growth areas, but it is difficult to see how it could be generally applicable.</p>

I was not recommending that the roof tax be applied generally. As my hon. Friend rightly highlighted, it is an appropriate mechanism for areas with a greater than average concentration of land ownership, with greater than average uniformity of land values and where there is certainty in the development pipeline. It is precisely in such circumstances that that mechanism is one of the most effective tools to achieve the objectives thatwe all have. It would be wholly inappropriate in Greenwich, but as I have pointed out, I do not think that the planning gain supplement will be appropriate in Greenwich, and I would rather have a framework that allowed section 106 agreements, which have worked well there, to continue, allowing the developments to flow in the area.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o163"><a name="70220-0010.htm_para18"><a name="07022066000022">The argument that I have been advancing is that there should be more of a focus on existing mechanisms or new thinking about appropriate mechanisms that may be tailored to the needs of individual areas. We should allow those to succeed rather than focusing on the single, across-the-board mechanism of the planning gain supplement, which in my view will not deliver the promised benefits in certain areas. I have explained why I do not think that it will deliver in many development sites on my own patch. I agree with my hon. Friend, but the conclusion that I draw is that an across-the-board taxation system such as PGS is probably not the right way forward. Instead, we should be looking at how to develop the different mechanisms that exist at the moment or are being developed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o164"><a name="70220-0010.htm_para19"><a name="07022066000023">The last one that I want to refer to briefly is the concept of a strategic section 106 agreement. One of the greatest worries about section 106 is the uncertainty for developers as to what they are likely to be required to pay. I fully understand the worries that they have expressed about that element of uncertainty in the existing system. The idea of a strategic approach is to set out in advance a much clearer indication of the contribution that developers will be expected to make, so that when they go to explore a particular site, they can do so with greater certainty. That would be a good way to tackle one of the difficulties with section 106, and it would do it in a way that ensures that developers and local authorities have a common interest. That common interest would mean that development would happen, that the developer would know what they were expected to contribute, that there would be greater certainty, and that the contribution would be used for local benefit.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o165"><a name="70220-0010.htm_para20"><a name="07022066000024">There are a range of options; the planning gain supplement is not the only possibility open to the Government. I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister  <br>

will recognise that the alternatives merit further consideration. I hope that when the consultation is finally assessed, he will come to the conclusion that we should not take a highly risky route that may not provide all that was promised, and that there is considerable merit in exploring the scope for making existing mechanisms work better, and ensuring that the objective that we all share is achieved. That objective is greater success in capturing the profits of development to ensure more successful, sustainable developments that work well, and for the interests of the whole community.</p>

Member for Greenwich and Woolwich (Mr. Raynsford), who speaks with a great deal of experience and wisdom on the subject, and who has addressed it in a completely non-partisan way. He exposed the arguments very properly, and gave the strongest argument for not proceeding with the paving Bill. Of course, thatis partly a matter of public finance, as sums of&#163;50 million are by no means trivial, but the real argument was the one that he advanced. There is a juggernaut principle in Whitehall, and once contracts are signed, once the computer company is involved and once a Whitehall section is set up to promote a measure, it is very difficult to stop the juggernaut. That is why it is important to discuss issues of substance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o166"><a name="70220-0010.htm_para21"><a name="07022066000028">I shall briefly summarise the arguments for not proceeding with the Bill, which are of course based on wider arguments about the planning gain supplement principle. The first argument is that the Bill is precipitate, as there is no consensus on it. The hon. Member for Rayleigh (Mr. Francois) summarised the objections of various institutional bodies, and of local government, which is a crucial partner in the proposal. I add that there is need for party-political consensus, too. Certain policies need to span generations; pensions policy is one of them, and policy on the planning gain supplement is another. A lesson has been learned, because different parties have tried to introduce a similar measure, starting with Lloyd George and Winston Churchill in the 1906 Government. Attlee had a go at it; Wilson had a go at it twice; and even Mrs. Thatcher had a try, before abolishing the measure. Everybody has had a go at it, but it has been difficult to implement the measure, partly because of vested  <br>

interests, party-political opposition and technical problems. It is essential that a much stronger consensus is developed on the idea.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o167"><a name="70220-0010.htm_para22"><a name="07022066000029">It is the second objection that was behind the amendments that I tried to move in Committee, and which the right hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich dwelled on. It concerns the way in which the measure takes away from local autonomy, which is already limited in respect of planning matters, and weakens the scope for section 106 agreements. The right hon. Gentleman gave some very good examples from south-east London, showing how creative and experienced planners can extract value for their community, in a way that is appropriate to that community. There are many different ways in which communities seek offsets; it can be through local infrastructure, or through wider infrastructure, such as that relating to health and education. Some councils want cash, and others want affordable housing. The balance is different in each case.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o168"><a name="70220-0010.htm_para23"><a name="07022066000030">My constituency houses the mecca of rugby union, and the Rugby Football Union has just expanded one of its major stands. As a result of negotiation through the planning process, a planning gain agreement has been signed that provides for, among other things, improvements to the local town centre, a system of buses to take fans to local railway stations, and part-access to the conference centre for local performance arts bodies. Those are local concerns that local planners and their representatives understand, and an optimum mix has been obtained. In an area planning application, the Rugby Football Union made the concession of supporting a local residents&#146; parking scheme, intended to deal with the problems caused by fans on match days. That local input in the negotiating process will be missing once there is a national tax, which will simply become a revenue source.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o169"><a name="70220-0010.htm_para24"><a name="07022066000031">To take another example, I recently visited a rural district where there is intense pressure on affordable housing. It so happens that the local planners are sophisticated and use section 106. In fact, they use it in a very aggressive way, and they have gone beyond the normal de minimis limits. Normally, the Government suggest that affordable housing offset should be asked for once 12 residential units are to be built. The council in question was very aggressive, and said that for every new private residential home, one affordable home should be provided. That is quite a tough policy,but given the context&#151;there was a great deal of development uplift, and a great scarcity of affordable housing&#151;it worked, and the council obtained a lot of affordable houses. It is the council&#146;s judgment and its call; it understands the local balance. That is what section 106 agreements allow, and why use of it should be nourished, rather than stifled.</p>

I was struck by the comments of the Minister, who made the good point that many councils do not use section 106 at all. Clearly, there are many smaller developments for which use of section 106 may not be appropriate, but the Minister quite correctly asked why some councils do not pursue that route even for large projects. It is a good question, and I am not entirely sure what the answer is. I suspect that, in some cases, there is not very much development uplift. There may not be the same  <br>

pressures, and in many industrial parts of Britain, the land is contaminated and does not have a great deal of value to developers. It may well be that many councils are just not working with the system properly and have not got used to it. That gives us all the more reason to do a lot more to spread good practice, even if we do not proceed with the scheme. We should develop pilot schemes, whether they involve tariffs or take other forms, to make the existing system work much better.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o171"><a name="70220-0011.htm_para1"><a name="07022066000033">I have given two compelling arguments for not taking the Government&#146;s route&#151;the first was the lack of consensus, and the second was the draining away of local authority&#151;but there are others, too. The third point is that the scheme is unnecessary. There is, of course, a strong philosophical argument for obtaining planning gain for the community. Clearly, if there is an uplift through planning approval, and if that uplift is considerably in excess of the opportunity cost for the developer&#151;the risk-adjusted return, which obviously has to be considered&#151;there will be a gain to which the community might reasonably want access. However, discussions on that point have largely ignored the fact that there is already a mechanism to ensure such access: as well as the section 106 agreement, there is capital gains tax.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o172"><a name="70220-0011.htm_para2"><a name="07022066000034">As a result of the planning gain supplement, many developers will pay under section 106, and then pay up to 40 per cent. capital gains tax, and then pay the planning gain supplement, too. We are not told the planning gain supplement rate, but it is an open secret that it is 30 per cent. Section 106 plus 40 per cent. plus 30 per cent. would be quite a high rate of tax. Of course, the Government say that in practice they would not apply full capital gains tax, but would instead give a tax offset, and that in turn would reduce the revenue. The question of whether the measure is necessary, even in revenue terms, has to be posed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o173"><a name="70220-0011.htm_para3"><a name="07022066000035">Fourthly, there are basic issues of complexity. If the Government proceed with a substantive Bill, we will find out whether they would impose de minimis limits of some kind on small developments. That would greatly reduce the bureaucracy involved, but some things are inherently complex, and that includes big development projects. They often involve pieces of land with different owners, obtained at different times. Calculating the planning uplift for a big development is inherently a difficult and complicated process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o174"><a name="70220-0011.htm_para4"><a name="07022066000036">Planning itself is complicated. I have never heard a proper answer to the case that I cited on Second Reading. The external cladding of a building, for example, may well require planning permission.Does the valuation have to be calculated for tax purposes? There is enormous administrative complexity associated with the planning process that could well make it prohibitive.</p>

will be other cases of developers who have planning permission, have paid the tax and may therefore be discouraged from keeping the land in a land bank. They have already paid the levy, so why not develop it? There may be positive incentive effects, but it is much more likely that developers will be discouraged from making planning applications. Experience suggests that that is overwhelmingly the case.</p>

I remind Members that it is an all-party Committee, and the view of the Committee was that there were some potential benefits to the planning gain supplement, but that whether those benefits were realised would depend on the detail of the PGS.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o177"><a name="70220-0011.htm_para7"><a name="07022066000040">Evidence was given to the Select Committee by a wide variety of organisations, many of which had also responded directly to the Treasury&#146;s own consultation, on what they perceived to be the likely effects of the tax. Obviously, because that consultation was carried out without any of the details of the tax having been decided on or made clear, in their responses to the consultations many organisations looked at the worst possible case, so they were responding not to a PGS that might be levied at, for example, 20 per cent. or30 per cent., but to the possibility that it might be levied at 110 per cent., like one of its predecessors. Not surprisingly, at 110 per cent. it was a disaster.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o178"><a name="70220-0011.htm_para8"><a name="07022066000041">One of the Opposition Members pooh-poohed the argument about the rate. Income tax levied at 30 per cent. or 40 per cent. is reasonable. Income tax levied at 99 per cent. clearly would be unreasonable. The rate is therefore relevant to whether a tax is reasonable and operable. It is perfectly reasonable to point out that in all the predecessors to the planning gain supplement, the rate has varied from 52 per cent. to 110 per cent. As I said, at that rather extortionate level, it is not surprising that the tax did not work, but it cannot be logically argued from that that a more reasonable tax would not work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o179"><a name="70220-0011.htm_para9"><a name="07022066000042">There are merits to the PGS, but the issue is the detail. I welcome the fact that the Treasury responded to the Select Committee report by not rushing straight from the first consultation into firm proposals, but has launched three other consultations on further technical detail. Personally, I think it might be necessary to hold a further consultation once the Treasury has decided on some of the details of PGS. It is an extremely complicated tax, were it to be introduced, and it is important that the Treasury gets the detail right and that external stakeholders are given the opportunity to respond at every stage in the process of implementation of the tax. The more some details are firmed up, the clearer and easier it will be for those organisations to respond on the remaining detail.</p>

London. Those of us who represent areas in the south-east and in London know well the consequences of that shortage of housing at all levels, including affordable houses, for the lives of our constituents, particularly for the younger generation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o181"><a name="70220-0011.htm_para11"><a name="07022066000044">That shortage of housing has the potential to set up an unhelpful intergenerational conflict between those of us who are fortunate enough to have bought houses&#151;for example, my first house cost less than &#163;5,000, which is an unimaginably small sum for a three-bedroom house&#151;and those of the same generation as my own children who, even though their earnings in real terms are comparable to what my husband and I earned at the time that we bought our first house, are nowhere near being able to afford a comparable house. That is a generality across the south-east and London. Those of us who have been fortunate need to understand the consequences if younger people coming up cannot afford to buy their own house, even if both partners are in reasonably well paid employment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o182"><a name="70220-0011.htm_para12"><a name="07022066000045">It is important that we consider ways of funding the infrastructure, because everybody, developers included, is clear that it is not enough to build housing;the infrastructure must be provided in a timely wayto support that housing. Clearly, therefore, the infrastructure needs to be funded. The Committee was not wholly convinced that better use could not be made of section 106 powers. Many local authorities use section 106 very effectively, but there are unfortunately many others that do not.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o183"><a name="70220-0011.htm_para13"><a name="07022066000046">The Milton Keynes infrastructure tariff is a particularly imaginative use of section 106 powers, aided by the fact that the Treasury, through English Partnerships, is forward-funding it, which is a crucial part of making it a success. However, as I explained in an earlier intervention, I do not think the infrastructure tariff is generally applicable, though it is being taken up by a couple of other local authorities already&#151;Ashford and Reigate and Banstead&#151;so it is applicable in some cases.</p>

I cite again the example of Kent county council, an authority which, in its evidence to us in one of our other inquiries, made great play of the undeveloped land in Kent that had planning permission but was not being developed. When the witnesses were pressed, it became clear that the land was not being developed because of a lack of funding for the infrastructure that would unlock those sites. Given that Kent county council presumably wishes those sites to be developed, as it has granted planning permission and as Kent has a dire shortage of housing, and given that Kent county council is, on the whole, a fairly well run authority, if it were able to use existing section 106 powers to unlock the funding for the infrastructure that would unlock those sites, I assume it would do so. That in itself demonstrates that there are problems with relying on section 106 if we are to fund the infrastructure properly to provide for the housing that is needed.</p>

The Bill has been produced by Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs tax law rewrite project, which is working to rewrite our direct tax legislation so that it is clearer and easier to use. It is the third rewrite Bill to venture into the complex and extensive territory of income tax. Once enacted&#151;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o193"><a name="70220-0012.htm_para1"><a name="07022070000010">Once enacted, the Bill will complete the project&#146;s work on income tax. In particular, it deals with the basic provisions covering the charge to income tax, including income tax rates, various reliefs and the calculation of income tax liability.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o194"><a name="70220-0012.htm_para2"><a name="07022070000011">I am grateful to Opposition Members for the constructive way in which they have approached the proper scrutiny of the Bill, as they have with all previous tax law rewrite Bills. The cross-party support for the project and the distinguished and expert input that we get from within and outside Parliament are important features of the tax law rewrite project.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o195"><a name="70220-0012.htm_para3"><a name="07022070000012">The project was set up in 1996 by the right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke), and I am pleased to say that it has continued to have not only the support of his party in opposition but his personal commitment. I wish to place on record my appreciation of the way in which he chaired the proceedings of the Joint Committee on Tax Law Rewrite Bills last month. I also record my appreciation for the work of Lord Newton of Braintree in chairing the project&#146;s steering committee.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o196"><a name="70220-0012.htm_para4"><a name="07022070000013">The aim of the project is to rewrite the UK&#146;s direct tax code, the provisions of which have been enacted over more than two centuries. The principal aim of the rewritten legislation is that it should be accepted by all the main users as clearer, as easier to use, and as preserving the effect of the present law, apart from minor agreed changes. To that end, the project proceeds through careful consultation and consensus, overseen by its two external committees: the steering committee and the consultative committee.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o197"><a name="70220-0012.htm_para5"><a name="07022070000014">In between the three income tax Bills that have been enacted, the project has also rewritten pay-as-you-earn regulations in direct response to requests from users and representative bodies. Those Acts and regulations have been warmly welcomed by tax professionals and by other users.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o198"><a name="70220-0012.htm_para6"><a name="07022070000015">The Bill follows the same tradition. The Instituteof Chartered Accountants in England and Wales commented on it in a way that can be taken as representative of wider views of users of the measure. It stated:</p>
<a name="70220-0012.htm_brev0"><a name="07022070000080"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;We commend the Tax Law Rewrite team on having produced another excellent rewrite Bill.&#148;</p>

Does he accept that there is a contradiction between passing potentially beneficial changes to the tax regulations and removing the direct contact through local tax offices that would ensure their smooth application?</p>

<p><a name="st_o214"><a name="07022070000017"><a name="70220-0012.htm_spnew3"><a name="07022070000098"><b>John Healey:</b> I am sorry to say that rewriting tax legislation has nothing to do with the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o199"><a name="70220-0012.htm_para7"><a name="07022070000018">Making any change to the main tax policies isclearly beyond the remit of the rewrite project, but it can encompass minor changes when they improve legislation. Examples include new provisions to: clarify points in existing legislation, repeal obsolete material, and correct minor, unintended anomalies. The explanatory notes on the Bill and the notes on the new clauses, which were added at the Joint Committee stage, list 162 such minor changes. However, major changes will always be matters for a Finance Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o200"><a name="70220-0012.htm_para8"><a name="07022070000019">The Joint Committee noted the widespread public scrutiny of the Bill as a whole, especially of the minor changes, which were clearly flagged up at each stage of the consultation process. The Committee satisfied itself, and reported to the House, that all the proposed changes were within the project&#146;s remit. The House also heard that they all had the support of the project&#146;s external steering committee.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o201"><a name="70220-0012.htm_para9"><a name="07022070000021">The Joint Committee carefully considered the amendments to incorporate a new part into the Bill to rewrite the legislation about the accrued income scheme. The amendments were agreed. In reaching that view, the Committee heard that consultation had taken place on the rewritten provisions as part of the previous rewrite Bill and that the external steering committee supported the inclusion of the new material. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o202"><a name="70220-0012.htm_para10"><a name="07022070000022">The Joint Committee paid particular attention to clause 1029&#151;clause 962 in the original Bill&#151;which confers a new power on the Treasury to undo changes in the law made by the Bill and restore the law to what it was previously. That is similar to the power to make consequential amendments, which is included in the measure and previous tax law rewrite Bills, and allows amendments to be made to correct the Bill without having to use primary legislation. The new provision  <br>

will enable inadvertent changes that the Bill makes to the law to be corrected without the need for recourse to a Finance Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o203"><a name="70220-0012.htm_para11"><a name="07022070000023">I am happy to confirm to the House, as I did tothe Joint Committee, that it is our intention and undertaking to introduce orders under the new power only with the agreement of the tax law rewrite project&#146;s steering committee. The benefit of including the power in the Bill may soon become evident&#151;perhaps sooner than we had anticipated given that two minor errors of the sort that I described have already been identified. Both affect paragraph 38 of schedule 2. Subject to the views of the tax law rewrite committees, it is the Government&#146;s intention to correct them with effect from the date on which the Bill is enacted.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o204"><a name="70220-0012.htm_para12"><a name="07022070000024">I have explained that the Bill tackles the core provisions of income tax and the rewritten legislation for the basic provisions for the charge to income tax, income tax rates, the calculation of income tax liability and personal reliefs. It also includes rewritten legislation for specific reliefs, including loss relief, the enterprise investment scheme, venture capital trusts, community investment tax relief, relief for interest paid, gift aid and gifts of assets to charities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o205"><a name="70220-0012.htm_para13"><a name="07022070000025">The measure additionally contains specific rules about settlements and trustees, the deduction of tax at source, manufactured payments and repos, the accrued income scheme, tax avoidance and general income tax definitions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o206"><a name="70220-0012.htm_para14"><a name="07022070000026">I stress the management of the project and the consultation to underline the amount of expertise, scrutiny and, indeed, the extent of consensus about the Bill on Third Reading. It is right to pay tribute to not only those directly involved but the users who play such an important part in ensuring that the tax law rewrite project lives up to its original aims. All those involved in the consultation process have made and will, I hope, continue to make an invaluable contribution to its success. The Paymaster General and I greatly value their commitment and contribution to the work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o207"><a name="70220-0012.htm_para15"><a name="07022070000027">To sum up, the project is worth while, modernises our direct tax legislation and makes it clearer and easier to use. The third Income Tax Bill completes the rewrite project&#146;s work on income tax. It is a major milestone and I commend it to the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o209"><a name="70220-0012.htm_para17"><a name="07022070000030">The Joint Committee met on 24 January under the experienced chairmanship of my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke), a distinguished former Chancellor of the Exchequer. I am pleased to see him in his place. The Committee took evidence from experts, including the Financial Secretary, and key officials from the tax law rewrite team, led by its director, Mr. Mark Nellthorp.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o210"><a name="70220-0012.htm_para18"><a name="07022070000031">The Joint Committee subsequently produced a report, HC 268, which I have here, and was published just before the half-term recess. Hon. Members have had an opportunity to examine it during the break.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o211"><a name="70220-0012.htm_para19"><a name="07022070000032">Before we complete our consideration of the substantial measure, I have several comments to make about the Bill, the Joint Committee&#146;s examination of it and its subsequent report.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o212"><a name="70220-0012.htm_para20"><a name="07022070000033">The Bill centres on rewriting the tax code for income tax. Its main purpose, as set out in the explanatory notes, is</p>
<a name="70220-0012.htm_brev1"><a name="07022070000081"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;to rewrite the income tax legislation that has not so far been rewritten to make it clearer and easier to use.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o213"><a name="70220-0012.htm_para21"><a name="07022070000034">The Bill is massive in size. It comprises three volumes, with a total of 1,035 clauses and four large and detailed schedules. Given the mass of detail in the measure, itis important to stress that it has been through a considerable gestation period, including detailed consultation with interested parties, before appearing before the House this evening.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o214"><a name="70220-0012.htm_para22"><a name="07022070000035">During the proceedings of the Second Reading Committee, which was held Upstairs on 17 January, I went into some detail about the consultation process that took place before the Bill was published. I do not, therefore, intend to reprise that now. Suffice it to say that the measure is the product of extensive consultation with tax professionals for two years or more. It was drafted by a specially configured project team comprising officials from Her Majesty&#146;sRevenue and Customs, parliamentary counsel and public and private sector tax professionals, whose work was overseen by the steering committee, which was originally chaired by Lord Howe of Aberavon and more recently by Lord Newton of Braintree. Considerable effort goes into rewrite Bills before they are even published, and that was certainly the case in this instance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o215"><a name="70220-0012.htm_para23"><a name="07022070000036">The spirit of the process is intended to be bipartisan, and to clarify the law rather than introducing measures that are potentially controversial and might more properly be reserved for a Finance Bill. The Financial Secretary was keen to reiterate that this evening. However, I want to return to two issues that I raised in the Second Reading Committee, which were pursued by the Joint Committee when it met the following week, as well as commenting on the special powers in what is now clause 1029.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o216"><a name="70220-0012.htm_para24"><a name="07022070000037">The first of those issues concerns the draft clauses relating to the accrued income scheme, which clarify the details relating to the taxation of interest onthe sale of interest-bearing shares. The clauses were presented to the Second Reading Committee as a setof 66 separate additional draft clauses, which the Government sought permission to add comparatively late in the day. As I observed at the time, the Chartered Institute of Taxation said of the late change:</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o217"><a name="70220-0012.htm_para25"><a name="07022070000038">However, as the Financial Secretary explained to the Second Reading Committee, the clauses had originally been intended for an earlier rewrite Bill, but had been removed at that stage. It was decided to insert them in this Bill, as it would be the last scheduled to deal specifically with income tax. The Financial Secretary told the Committee</p>
<a name="70220-0012.htm_brev3"><a name="07022070000083"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The provisions did not come completely out of the blue from the tax law rewrite project; they had previously been proposed but were dropped during the later stages of the last rewrite Bill... Given that this is the last income tax Bill being handled by the tax law rewrite project, it seemed appropriate, given that the provisions are totally within the terms of the project, to include them in this rewrite Bill rather than deal with the matter in the Finance Bill.&#148; <i> &#151;&#151;[Official Report, Income Tax Second Reading Committee, </i>17 January 2007; c. 14.]</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o218"><a name="70220-0012.htm_para26"><a name="07022070000039">Owing to the slightly unusual nature of what happened, the Joint Committee nevertheless examined the issue of the late changes to the Bill and reached the following conclusion, which should give the House some comfort:</p>
<a name="70220-0012.htm_brev4"><a name="07022070000084"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The Committee accepts the Government&#146;s proposed new part: Accrued income profits. While substantive new clauses such as those forming the new part would normally be included in the Bill prior to its introduction, we recognise that there were exceptional circumstances in this case. We consider that these clauses have been subject to extensive consultation and should be included as part of the Bill.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o219"><a name="70220-0012.htm_para27"><a name="07022070000040">We are grateful for that reassurance, and given that the Joint Committee has scrutinised the matter, we are content to allow the changes to be made.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o220"><a name="70220-0012.htm_para28"><a name="07022070000041">The second issue that I want to raise relates to the definition of &#147;associated operation&#148; for the purpose of the transfer of assets in certain circumstances, which is contained in what is now clause 719. The proposed clause replaces the definition in section 742(1) of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988, which the tax law rewrite project had already described as &#147;ambiguous&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o221"><a name="70220-0012.htm_para29"><a name="07022070000042">I raised the issue in the Second Reading Committee following representations from the president and other members of the City of Westminster and Holborn Law Society. What concerned them was that the new definition, although undoubtedly clearer than the original, had changed the law by making the definition of &#147;associated operation&#148; far wider, rendering it beyond the scope of what would normally be expected in a tax law rewrite Bill and to the advantage of Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs rather than the ordinary taxpayer. I was pleased to note that the Joint Committee paid some attention to that point.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o222"><a name="70220-0012.htm_para30"><a name="07022070000043">The exchanges on the issue are on pages Ev 4 and 5 of the minutes of evidence that accompany the Joint Committee report. Some reassurance was given by Lord Newton of Braintree and Lady Cohen, and subsequently by the assistant director of the rewrite project, Mr. Brian Jones. Mr. Jones explained that the representations from the City of Westminster and Holborn Law Society had been re-examined by the consultative and the steering committees before the change was endorsed.

It is unusual in that it grants Ministers power, by order, to amend the Bill up to 5 April 2010 to restore the law to its previous position following the discovery of any inadvertent change in the law that it might make. In his evidence to the Joint Committee, the Financial Secretary described the power as &#147;novel&#148;. I congratulate him on his perspicacity in ensuring that it can be used to deal with two small lacunae in the Bill. We cannot accuse him of being slow off the mark in implementing the new power with which the House seems ready to provide him.</p>

In the explanatory memorandum, we have given an indication and a commitment that we would do so, discuss and agree with both committees before laying such an order, if we deemed it appropriate. I, as Minister responsible, would like to underline that commitment on the record for the Committee today.&#148;</p>

As he asks me, I would say that it is a constant feature of Finance Bills that we are dealing with ever-greater complexity. One of the reasonsfor that is that the Chancellor is a great fan of anti-avoidance legislation. Because it attempts to provide for all sorts of different contingencies, it tends to be very detailed. The Government would argue that they are protecting the revenue, but the way in which they have proceeded in recent years has certainly made the tax code more complicated.</p>

Peers with specialist knowledge in this area&#151;and certainly with a very specialist Chairman. We therefore believe that, despite its massive size of more than 1,000 clauses, the Bill has still received detailed scrutiny in the course of that two-year process.</p>

We note that the Joint Committee has subsequently provided some reassurance on each of those points in its report. Having looked into the Bill, the Joint Committee report concluded:</p>

Given the 1,035 additional clauses of this Bill and then the additional clauses of the Finance Bills of 2006 and 2007, it seems to us that the United Kingdom will almost certainly have the longest tax code in the entire developed world&#151;if, indeed, we do not already have it. Britain under this Chancellor will finally be a world-beater, but perhaps not in the way that the Chancellor would have wished. When the Minister responds to the debate, will he answer the question that he so artfully ducked in the Second Reading Committee? I am sure that he will welcome the entire rewrite project as I do, but will he now confirm whether, in terms of primary legislation, we have the longest tax code in the world?</p>

We broadly welcome this rewrite, because it is important to present our legislation in language that is simpler and easier to understand. That is the aim of the Bill, rather than to simplify the existing legislation, although there is an argument to be had about whether that needs to be done too. The Bill is about producing tax legislation in a language that is easier to understand. Anything that makes a long complicated tax code easier to understand is most welcome.

The Committee noted that in normal circumstances such substantive clauses should be introduced at the outset, but that in this case they could be added to the Bill because they had been the subject of extensive consultation, and had already been considered for a previous rewrite Bill.

further amendments tabled by the Government, which were mainly technical and consequential to the proposed new clauses.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o243"><a name="70220-0013.htm_para14"><a name="07022075000013">I also want to comment on clause 1029&#151;formerly clause 962&#151;which grants the Treasury the power by order to amend the Bill until 5 April 2010, in order to restore the law to its previous position in the case of any inadvertent change to the law having been made by the Bill. I welcome the Minister&#146;s clarification, in giving evidence to the Committee and when speaking to the House today, that that power would be exercised only after reference to the consultative committee and with the agreement of the steering committee. I smile somewhat ironically as I note that there are already two instances in which that power might need to be exercised.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o244"><a name="70220-0013.htm_para15"><a name="07022075000014">I have a couple of questions for the Minister on this point. What would happen if changes were put forward which the consultative committee or the steering committee did not agree were only minor changes? What would happen in the reverse of the example that the Minister gave earlier, when he said that if there was an unintended change in the sense of the legislation, the law could be changed back to what it was before? What would happen if there were an omission to which the provisions needed to be extended? I mention this because we recently debated a statutory instrument on civil partnerships that dealt with changes to income tax, in which definitions had not been applied in every case. How would the clause apply to such a situation? Would the problem have to be dealt with through a statutory instrument, or would clause 1029 be able to deal with it? I would appreciate the Minister&#146;s clarification of those matters.</p>

First, clause 1029 would be used only if we had consulted and received the agreement of the two external committees. If they did not agree, we would not use it. Secondly, it can be used only to revert to the original state of the law amendments made by a tax law rewrite Bill, as the right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke) made clear. The circumstances to which the hon. Lady is referring would not therefore be covered by the provisions of the clause.</p>

We should not lose sight of the intended aim of that labour of love, which is to simplify and codify tax law, not to create more. We should therefore ask whether that has been achieved through this process. It was pointed out by my hon.

Such a quantification would give a tangible sense of what the rewrite had achieved, not only for the practitioners to whom the Joint Committee report referred, but for the wider public.

The Joint Committee paid attention to all the points that we should have considered, including whether the consultation had been adequate, and whether any substantive changes were being slipped through that might alter the incidence of taxation in any significant way.

The leaders of the team gave evidence to the Joint Committee and impressed us with their clarity and almost instant recall of the most minute details of parts of the provision. The whole thing has obviously been embarked upon extremely conscientiously and very professionally by those people from the Inland Revenue and the office of the parliamentary draftsman.

<p><a name="stpa_o249"><a name="70220-0014.htm_para0"><a name="07022075000022">The whole process started as a result of some of the debates about my 1996 Budget. I was sensitive to the criticisms that came from the Labour Benches about the growing length of my Finance Bills. My hon. Friend the Member for Rayleigh has already pointed out that my successor, the present Chancellor, produces Finance Bills that are about twice the length of mine, which are having a substantial impact on the tax code. I was also sensitive to the growing criticisms from practitioners that I was producing legislation that was getting longer. Indeed, the experts themselves&#151;including members of the judiciary who found  <br>

themselves hearing tax cases, and practitioners who were meant to be giving advice to their clients&#151;were finding it increasingly difficult to understand the drafting of the legislation that was being applied. That led to a process of rewriting it in plain English. As my hon. Friend said, it is my successor and a succession of Labour Ministers&#151;the Financial Secretary to the Treasury is following the Paymaster General, who implemented many of these provisions&#151;who have carried the process through. I have merely chaired the Joint Committee for some years, and marvelled at the progress that we have made.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o250"><a name="70220-0014.htm_para1"><a name="07022075000023">I want briefly to reinforce the comments made by my hon. Friend the Member for Rayleigh. We are rewriting into plain English tax law that is becoming ever more complex. Our tax law may still have some advantages compared with the law overseas, but we are eroding any competitive advantage that might have resulted from having simple tax law in the past. This stems from a policy difference, a difference of approach, and a difference of instinct and philosophy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o251"><a name="70220-0014.htm_para2"><a name="07022075000024">When I was Chancellor, I tried to follow a practice that I thought I had acquired from watching Lord Lawson of Blaby when he was Chancellor of the Exchequer. His principle was that taxation should be as simple as possible, with exemptions and exceptions as limited as possible, and that it should be imposed at the lowest level possible, while still raising the revenue that one needed. I fear that the present Chancellor does not have the same instincts. He is a micro-manager, and he keeps introducing more complexity into the policies of taxation, which the rewrite project must then turn into plainer English. The result is thousands of clauses of ever greater length. The whole House should continue to press the next Chancellor&#151;who will have the unhappy task of being Chancellor for the next Prime Minister, and will probably have a limited scope in some policy areas&#151;to be a tax reformer and to return to some simplicity of policy, which would be welcomed in all quarters.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o252"><a name="70220-0014.htm_para3"><a name="07022075000025">My other point has already been raised by thehon. Member for Falmouth and Camborne (Julia Goldsworthy). When the project was set up, we talked about rewriting the entire tax code in five years. A little more than 10 years later, we have a long way to go; I think that the next item on the agenda is a rewrite of the entire law on corporation tax. There have been some criticisms as to whether that fantastic effort is justified; I was somewhat concerned that the Institute of Chartered Accountants queried whether we were getting the right return on all the effort being put in. I have reflected on that since the Joint Committee. I think that the answer is yes, but I suspect that, as has been mentioned, part of the problem&#151;a familiar one to me, as someone who used to practise law&#151;is that those who have practised for a long time and have wrestled to become familiar with the existing law find it slightly irksome that they must start all over again and remember where the law is now in the rewritten Bill, whereas new practitioners, who were recently at law school, find the straightforward language much simpler. That is inevitable when any law is simplified.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o253"><a name="70220-0014.htm_para4"><a name="07022075000026">There was a problem with language and drafting, and many distinguished practitioners were beginning&#151;unfairly, as it turned out&#151;to curse the office of the parliamentary draftsman, which I also did, for  <br>

producing such impenetrable language. Representatives of the office of parliamentary draftsman have played a leading role, however, in turning that into the nearest that one can get to plain English, given the legal language that a tax code must have to provide certainty and fairness. The whole thing will become impossible if we do not continue the process and continue to clarify what has been enacted.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o254"><a name="70220-0014.htm_para5"><a name="07022075000027">At some stage&#151;I do not think that it was today&#151;the Economic Secretary to the Treasury said that the acid test was whether the professional bodies continue tobe prepared to devote time and effort and to apply themselves to the consultation process, which is essential if we are to make sure that no serious mistakes are made. As far as I can tell, the members of the professional bodies do appreciate that: plenty of people in the professional world are prepared to give a great deal of what would otherwise be their expensive time to that. Therefore, the labours of Hercules should be continued.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o255"><a name="70220-0014.htm_para6"><a name="07022075000028">The process will require the same levels of professionalism and application as we have had from the Ministers whom we have been lucky enough to have handling the matter over the past 10 years; for a long time it was one Minister, and I am sure that she is mightily glad to be rid of it and pass it on to her successor. The process is worthwhile, however, and today marks an extremely significant step. I just hope that we find that only two errors have been made in the hundreds of pages, and that the provision that has rightly been included to achieve minor corrections and return to the old law if anything is wrong does not have to be overused. I shall be very surprised if it does, because I was so impressed by the way in which the whole Bill had been put together.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o265"><a name="70220-0014.htm_para16"><a name="07022075000041">Members may be wondering why I have asked for this debate on the British steel industry, considering that the steelworks in my constituency closed over four years ago, after some 200 years of steel making. The reason is that I was employed in the steel industry for over 26 years&#151;the last of four generations of my family to be so employed&#151;and I care for those who are still involved in the industry. I believe that the retention of steel making in this country is vital for the economy, and that it is unthinkable that our country could be left without this strategic industry.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o266"><a name="70220-0014.htm_para17"><a name="07022075000042">During the 18-month closure period of the steelworks in my constituency, partnership working between Corus management and the senior trade union representatives on site, including me, meant that over 300 individuals were able to transfer to other steel sites in south Wales. Because those individuals commute to work, the wages that they earn come back into the local economy&#151;significant salaries that my constituency can ill afford to lose. There is also a Corus sitestill located in my constituency that employs around70 people and pays in excess of the minimum wage, providing quality jobs in an area in which few jobs do pay above the minimum wage.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o267"><a name="70220-0014.htm_para18"><a name="07022075000043">In 1976, when I started working for the then British Steel Corporation, there were in excess of 200,000 employees in the industry. Today, that number is down to around 24,000. I accept that a significant number of those job losses were attributable to increased technology, but that is still a massive loss to local economies around the country, especially when we take into account that one job lost in the steel industry has a knock-on effect of four times on relevant jobs in the community such as transport and jobs that are linked to the industry. The effect is devastating for the area and people concerned.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o268"><a name="70220-0014.htm_para19"><a name="07022075000044">My concern for the British steel industry is heightened by the recent buy-out of Corus by Tata Steel. Although it is still inconceivable that our country could lose its steel industry or steel-making capacity, I have seen nothing in the press or in news coverage that fills me with any certainty about the future of the industry.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o269"><a name="70220-0014.htm_para20"><a name="07022075000045">During the steel closures and 7,000 redundancies in 2001-02, meetings were held with the Prime Minister and the joint trade unions on two occasions to ask him to intervene and to speak to the Corus management, but that was after the closure announcements were made. The Prime Minister made it clear that, because the steel industry was privately owned, there was very little he could do to prevent the closures, althoughthe Government helped by providing retraining packages for the areas affected. However, the quality employment has not been replaced.</p>

I urge them to have continuous dialogue with Tata Steel in an attempt to gain assurances that it intends to invest in the steel industry in this country and not asset strip.</p>

<p><a name="st_o240"><a name="07022075000047"><a name="70220-0014.htm_spnew4"><a name="07022075000173"><b>Dr. Ashok Kumar (Middlesbrough, South and East Cleveland) (Lab):</b> Is the hon. Gentleman saying that he does not have confidence in Tata Steel, despite all the assurances that it has given? It is investing about&#163;6 billion in buying Corus. If it did not have confidence in the first place, it would not be purchasing the steel industry here.</p>

<p><a name="st_o241"><a name="07022075000048"><a name="70220-0014.htm_spnew5"><a name="07022075000174"><b>Mr. Davies:</b> I thank the hon. Gentleman for his intervention. When the buy-out was first mooted, there was talk in the press of investment and growth. Since then, the press coverage has worried me. One of the words that was used during the closure time was synergies. At the time, we did not really understand what it meant, which is that if there was a cheaper cost route or like product, there was a chance of closure. That is what happened under the merger with Corus. All I am asking for is that we continue dialogue with Tata Steel to ensure that that promise of investment and support is carried through.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o271"><a name="70220-0014.htm_para22"><a name="07022075000049">I have been contacted over the past few months by numerous people who have transferred to other sites. They have expressed concern, and of course the stress and worry are passed on to families. The more we can do to alleviate that, the better it will be.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o272"><a name="70220-0014.htm_para23"><a name="07022075000050">I know from my experience as a senior negotiator in the industry that the trade unions have argued for a level playing field within the European steel industry. There is an urgent need for a review of energy prices in this country because there is an imbalance between our production of steel and that in the plants across Europe.</p>

In this country, the energy prices are significant in terms of the cost of a tonne of steel. We need to review those and to ensure that we are making our steel industry as competitive as possible. We also need to review business rates. Some work has been done on that in previous years, but we need to look at business rate levels for the industry.</p>

The Government have to be robust with the European Commission to ensure that it does  <br>

<notus-date day="20" month="2" year="2007" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><b>20 Feb 2007 : Column 227</b><br>
not allow European steel companies to get away with a higher rate of emissions than the British steel industry is allowed. We need a level playing field in that sector in Europe, too.</p>

<p><a name="st_o245"><a name="07022075000054"><a name="70220-0014.htm_spnew9"><a name="07022075000178"><b>Mr. Davies:</b> I thank the hon. Gentleman. That was my next point. We tend to look at our industry as a dirty industry, and our first reaction is to fine it. I ask the Government to work with the steel industry to help it to become more efficient in terms of carbon emissions. We need to do everything we can to support it, not fine it. As for the level playing field in Europe, there have been problems with other Governments ignoring what has come out of the plants across Europe. That is an important point.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o273"><a name="70220-0014.htm_para24"><a name="07022075000055">The steel industry has more to offer than its traditional products. Its apprentice training structure is second to none and one of the few such schemes left. It includes traditional craft training to degree level, team working programmes, business administration, chemical engineering and health and safety, to name just a few. We could go on and on. Those training programmes are among the best in the world.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o274"><a name="70220-0014.htm_para25"><a name="07022075000056">One of the drawbacks of college-based training is that, at the end of the course, the individual has little,if any, on-site experience. I ask the Government to discuss with Tata Steel the possibility of establishing a sponsoring system where colleges and other companies external to the steel industry would be able to access the industry&#146;s training schemes. The aim would be to establish training partnerships to produce the skilled work force that this country desperately needs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o275"><a name="70220-0014.htm_para26"><a name="07022075000057">I cannot end this Adjournment debate without placing alongside securing the long term future of the steel industry in this country the importance of ensuring the security of the British Steel pension fund, which forms part of the Tata takeover. As the hon. Member for Middlesbrough, South and East Cleveland (Dr. Kumar) said, Tata has made moves to pay into that scheme. That is an important point. As a former trustee of the scheme for some four and a half years I know that it is a very good scheme. It has some 90,000 members across the country. It has helped in no small measure to mitigate the impact of steel redundancies in the past 20 years on communities such as mine. In the present climate of pension uncertainty, I urge the Government to do all they can to protect that scheme.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o276"><a name="70220-0014.htm_para27"><a name="07022075000058">I believe that part of the cause of antisocial behaviour in our communities is the loss of manufacturing jobs. Industries such as steel and coal give an identity to the people working in them and to the areas in which they are located. We need to ensure that young people have a role in life, a sense of belonging and a purpose to their existence. The industries were hard, are hard and are dangerous, but communities were built around them. I have always looked at the area I represent as a community of steel&#151;it was built around the steel industry and would not exist today without it. That is probably the case across many parts of the country. We can use the influence of those industries to help to get youngsters involved in training and in manufacturing production. I hope that the Government will be able to work on some of those ideas to secure the industry for the future.</p>

I say that it is opportune for obvious reasons. We are moving into a new period with the imminent takeover by Tata of Corus. In listening to the speech by the hon. Member for Blaenau Gwent (Mr. Davies), I am reminded of the words of the Italian socialist Antonio Gramsci:</p>
<a name="70220-0015.htm_brev0"><a name="07022075000152"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Pessimism of the intellect, optimism of the will.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o277"><a name="70220-0015.htm_para0"><a name="07022075000060">While the hon. Gentleman&#146;s speech had that sense of pessimism or, I should be generous, realism, I would like to strike a more optimistic note&#151;optimism of the will. Potentially, we are in a situation where there isa great opportunity. That is certainly the view of management and unions in the Port Talbot steel plant in my constituency. I commend in particular the work of Mr. Phil Dryden of the management of Corus and Mr. David Ferris, the chair of the joint unions, who personify the joint working in the way in which they are building a new future for that plant. That joint-working is known as the journey.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o278"><a name="70220-0015.htm_para1"><a name="07022075000061">I should also point to the words of the Secretary of State for Wales, my right hon. Friend the Member for Neath (Mr. Hain). He recognises, as I do, that the takeover has enormous potential, and he emphasises, as I do, that the steel industry has been, and still is, strategically important to both the Welsh economy and the British economy.</p>

<p><a name="st_o247"><a name="07022075000062"><a name="70220-0015.htm_spnew1"><a name="07022075000180"><b>Dr. Kumar:</b> My hon. Friend thanks many people for the contribution that they have made to the steel industry in his area. We should also congratulate Philippe Varin on doing a marvellous job in turning around Corus from the situation it was in three or four years ago. It is because of his leadership of Corus that Tata Steel from India is in a position to buy the Corus steel industry. Credit is due to Philippe Varin&#146;s leadership, and to the entire board.</p>

<p><a name="st_o248"><a name="07022075000063"><a name="70220-0015.htm_spnew2"><a name="07022075000181"><b>Dr. Francis:</b> My hon. Friend anticipates what I am about to say. I acknowledge the contribution of Philippe Varin, and that of the chair of the company, Jim Leng.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o279"><a name="70220-0015.htm_para2"><a name="07022075000064">The key is investment. The signs are relatively positive&#151;in contrast to some of the comments of the hon. Member for Blaenau Gwent. I welcome the good work done in the run-up to the takeover by the Corus management in securing a good deal for its employees for the immediate future, including resolving the employee pension fund issue and trade union representation and consultation arrangements, and&#151;equally importantly&#151;in securing the confirmation of previously agreed capital expenditure projects. That shows that, importantly, there is recognition of the position of the steel industry in Britain. Tata appears to have a strong commitment to the UK steel industry; otherwise, why make those commitments?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o280"><a name="70220-0015.htm_para3"><a name="07022075000065">That leads us to believe that the other key factor is the positive role of our Government in the changeover period. The industry is rightly praised for the success in terms of productivity improvements year on year&#151;  <br>

they are much better than for any other part of the British economy. Both the management and the unions should be proud of that, and I am sure that the Government recognise that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o281"><a name="70220-0015.htm_para4"><a name="07022075000066">I was very pleased by the constructive statement made to the Welsh Affairs Committee by the Minister for Trade, my right hon.

That seems to give me an impression that they are here for the long haul.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o283"><a name="70220-0015.htm_para6"><a name="07022075000068">That last phrase is worth emphasising. He ended by saying:</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o284"><a name="70220-0015.htm_para7"><a name="07022075000069">That is a welcome commitment on the part of the Government. I take from that ministerial statement that this Labour Government recognise that steel is of strategic importance to the British economy and that they are prepared to enhance that. I look forward to hearing the Minister&#146;s response to that point.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o285"><a name="70220-0015.htm_para8"><a name="07022075000070">Finally, may I be a little parochial? Will the Minister urge the Government to encourage discussions with Tata to ensure that there is long-term steel investment in Port Talbot in my constituency, and also in all other plants right across the United Kingdom? My plant needs a modest investment of &#163;240 million in the finishing end to ensure that the necessary efficiency and the maximum output of 5 million tonnes can be achieved. Incidentally, that &#163;240 million is roughly the same amount as the banking costs of achieving the recent takeover.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o286"><a name="70220-0015.htm_para9"><a name="07022075000071">I am sure that the response of the skilled, professional and dedicated steel industry work force throughout the UK will be worthy of that great industry. We are very proud of them, and we believe that the industry has a great future.</p>

I am sure that the hon. Gentleman accepts that, like his own area, Scunthorpe is a community built on steel; few communities have been so dependent on an industry. That is why I, as MP for Scunthorpe, and my hon. Friend the Member for Brigg and Goole (Mr. Cawsey), where many steelworkers also live, are very concerned about the changes.

<notus-date day="20" month="2" year="2007" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><b>20 Feb 2007 : Column 230</b><br>

<p><a name="stpa_o287"><a name="70220-0015.htm_para10"><a name="07022075000073">It is a matter of regret that when the steel industry in this country was at its height, the managements of steelworks did not have the strategic vision to reach out to developing countries and to make strategic partnerships. Such partnerships might have been established on a different basis if they had been agreed some years ago. That was a missed opportunity. I know that the Corus management sought a partnership with a Brazilian company. That reflects the fact that there is a strategic argument for this kind of link-up. I do not think that anyone would deny that fact in respect of the Arcelor-Mittal link-up, or that we are in a global economy and we have to compete globally. There is a logic to this kind of development. That is why there were talks with Tata and other companies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o288"><a name="70220-0015.htm_para11"><a name="07022075000074">By coincidence, I was invited by the British Council to speak in Jamshedpur where Tata&#146;s headquarters are, at an environmental event. As it happens, that wasalso part-sponsored by the Association of British Scholars. They are all prominent Indian academics and business people who have been educated in the UK. Many Tata executives fall into that category, including Dr. Mukherjee, who is the managing director of the steelworks in Jamshedpur. He was one of the organisers of the conference. I had an opportunity to meet Dr. Mukherjee, and Mr. Muthuraman, who is the chief executive of the group and to see their operations in Jamshedpur and to talk to a lot of people involvedin it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o289"><a name="70220-0015.htm_para12"><a name="07022075000075">Tata has a good record in India. It has a good social record and is a well-managed company with global ambitions. I take on board the point that has been made by hon. Friends that Tata would not have spent all the money that it has spent on buying a steel company in order to close it down. The company bought it because it is seeking a strategic partnership. There is logic in that argument. In fact, my hon. Friends might be interested to learn that the founder of Tata&#151;it was founded at the beginning of the century&#151;invited Beatrice and Sidney Webb to Jamshedpur to advise the company on its social and economic policies. The Webbs advised Tata to introduce an eight-hour day in 1912, and it introduced that in 1912; a long time before its interest in Corus. I talked about jobs to Mr. Muthuraman, and about investment and the pension. Tata has certainly delivered on the pension, in terms of making up the shortfall and raising the company contributions. That offers great reassurance to many of my constituents, and to people in the whole of the region.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o290"><a name="70220-0015.htm_para13"><a name="07022075000076">I felt that Tata was serious about things; it made it clear that it was not buying in to Corus to reduce jobs and sack lots of people. Of course, it is a global company, and I have to say that one will not hear many reassurances from Corus&#146;s management about the long-term future of jobs. Scunthorpe has been through a lot of very painful restructuring, involving the loss of many thousands of jobs. That happened under the present management.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o291"><a name="70220-0015.htm_para14"><a name="07022075000077">I take the point that was made about energy. Deregulation in this country gave us the lowest energy costs in Europe and Corus has of course benefited from that. There have been changes following the rise in energy prices, and I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Aberavon (Dr. Francis) that there hasbeen a delay in deregulating the European markets.  <br>

Deregulation is coming, and it will certainly be to the benefit of this country&#146;s industry. I also understandthe point that was made about carbon. As a former Minister with responsibility for carbon trading, I pressurised Commissioner Dimas to take a tough line on other countries, particularly in the second round of the national allocation plan and the European emissions trading scheme. I am glad to say that he took that tough line, and he has shown real leadership in rejecting plans from a number of other countries, including Germany and France, and saying that they had to make sharper cuts in emissions. Of course, that levels the playing field for us.</p>

Friend agree that we need to study the issues in detail in order to provide a proper level playing field for new investment in our steel industry?</p>

Friend makes. I must echo the point that was made about Philippe Varin; he has indeed been a very good leader of the company. I recently met Andrew Page, managing director of Corus, to talk about the various issues. Corus&#146;s management have led the company into profitability. They were tough negotiators regarding the carbon allocation; indeed, their carbon allocation is quite generous. I appreciate that new entrants constitute a different issue and all I can say is that I am more than ready to work with the unions and the companies to make sure that they get a fair deal and that they are not disadvantaged compared with European rivals. That is very important.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o292"><a name="70220-0015.htm_para15"><a name="07022075000080">I agree with the hon. Member for Blaenau Gwent that the test of commitment is investment and it is investment that we want to see. It does nobody any good to talk about massive job losses or the end of steel making in this country; I do not believe that that will happen. My local paper, the <i> Scunthorpe Telegraph</i>, carried out a survey on this issue, stopping people in the street and asking them what they thought about the Tata takeover. The vast majority of people said, &#147;I think that we should give the company a chance. Let them demonstrate what they want to do. We should judge them on their actions.&#148; That is not an unreasonable position to take, and I am sure that that is by far the overwhelming view of the unions and of the people of Scunthorpe. One person did tell the paper that there would be thousands of job losses. I did notice, however, that he refused to give his name, soI doubt whether we can take what he said seriously. Nor do such comments help the steel industry in Scunthorpe and the rest of the country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o293"><a name="70220-0015.htm_para16"><a name="07022075000081">Investment is the test. We want investment in our steel works, because we have to compete on the global stage. We now have links to the Asian market, which is to the advantage of steel making in this country. A lot of added-value steel is made in this country that is not made by the Tata group, which is also an advantage. Tata can bring expertise, skills and enthusiasm that can benefit steel making in the UK. Let us judge Tata by what it does. That strategic link can bring benefits, but  <br>

we do, as I said, want to see investment. Manufacturing is the bedrock of our economy and our productivity, and I agree with the Chancellor that we should move toward a high-tech, high-skill manufacturing economy. I believe that the Tata group shares that vision, and that we in this country have a good steel industry; we certainly have a good steel works in Scunthorpe. I want the industry to succeed and prosper, and I see no reason why the Tata group does not share those objectives.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o294"><a name="70220-0015.htm_para17"><a name="07022075000083">I congratulate the hon. Member for Blaenau Gwent (Mr. Davies) on securing this debate. I had not realised that because of the time at which the debate started, we would be able to say more than just a few words. I agree with a lot of what my right hon. Friend the Member for Scunthorpe (Mr. Morley) has said. I concur with the fair-minded spirit of his comments about giving Tata a chance to demonstrate what it is capable of.I should also point out that I worked for Corus for15 years and am one of its shareholders. Shares were given to us when the steel industry was privatised, and I want to put that on the record before someone says that we have not declared that fact, and we have to come before another body to offer an explanation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o295"><a name="70220-0015.htm_para18"><a name="07022075000084">I want to emphasise the opportunity that exists for the steel industry, and to destroy one myth before it takes off. There is no evidence that I am aware of that Tata Steel has in any way been involved in asset stripping. Peddling such a myth would be a wrong and destructive approach, given that some &#163;6 billion is being invested in an effort to save the pension fund and to ensure that we have a steel industry. We are talking about the fifth biggest steel industry in the world, so this is indeed a great opportunity and a great merger, and it should be seen in that light.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o296"><a name="70220-0015.htm_para19"><a name="07022075000085">My own Teesside area will benefit greatly from this merger, which will ensure a secure future for some 3,000 direct workers and between 20,000 and 30,000 indirect workers. So it is very important that we welcome the new takeover and those who are trying to ensure that we have a strong steel industry. In doing so, we must praise Philippe Varin. His leadership and that of the main board, under its chairman, Jim Leng, ensured that the steel industry was in a position to be purchased by Tata Steel. A few years ago, the steel industry was heading for bankruptcy. If I remember rightly, the shares, now worth &#163;2.60 or more, fell to 4p; they were certainly heading in a downward direction. So we must praise Philippe Varin for all that he has done.</p>

People I know who have talked to them tell me that they have great affection for this country.

<p><a name="stpa_o298"><a name="70220-0015.htm_para21"><a name="07022075000087">Investment has already been mentioned, and we do indeed want to see investment, particularly in research and development. I worked in R and D for 15 years, so I know that it is essential to the steel industry&#146;s long-term and medium-term strategy. Here, the Government can play a very powerful role. I realise that we no longer intervene in the industry, but we can play our part. We should say, &#147;What can we do to give Tata support for R and D?&#148; Such support, which would ensure that our base here is maintained, is essential for all who work R and D.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o299"><a name="70220-0015.htm_para22"><a name="07022075000088">Tata has been well respected since it was first set up in 1907. It was one of the first companies in India to provide free health care for all its work force. My right hon. Friend the Member for Scunthorpe mentioned the Webbs&#146; contribution, and I am sure that they had a hand somewhere along the line in that social provision. If one talks to the Tata work force in India, it is obvious that most of them love working for the company, which is one of the most respected companies in India. I feel strongly that this is a huge opportunity that is in the interests of our economy. It also shows a great confidence in British industry and our skilled work force, as well as in the Labour Government. Tata feels that under this Government the conditions are right to invest and ensure that the steel industry prospers in this country. Credit must go to the Government for managing a successful economy so that overseas investors have the confidence to invest.</p>

Friend the Member for Ogmore (Huw Irranca-Davies), who as a Whip cannot contribute but who has volunteered for extra duties to be able to attend this evening. I also acknowledge the clear understanding that the hon. Member for Blaenau Gwent has of the industry and his long personal and professional involvement in it, with which obviously I cannot compete.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o301"><a name="70220-0015.htm_para24"><a name="07022075000093">This debate is very timely, as recent developments in the UK steel industry, particularly the battle for the ownership of Corus, have captured the imagination of just about anyone with an interest in the future of manufacturing in this country. The Tata deal is symbolic not only of the changes that are taking place in the global steel industry but of a fundamental and seismic shift in the economic world order.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o302"><a name="70220-0015.htm_para25"><a name="07022075000094">Despite significant restructuring over the past30 years, the UK steel industry remains a significant employer and an intensive research and development contributor to the UK economy, and it underpins many parts of manufacturing and many local communities. High technology industries such aerospace, automotive and construction require high value steel products. The UK steel industry employs some 50,000 people directly. It also provides employment indirectly for many more who supply goods and services to the steel sector.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o303"><a name="70220-0015.htm_para26"><a name="07022075000095">The UK industry, the 17th largest in the world and fifth in Europe, produced 13.9 million tonnes of crude steel in 2006, the highest level of output for six years. Production is expected to increase by roughly a further 50 per cent. by 2010. According to the Office for National Statistics annual business inquiry, some 300 companies are engaged in the production of iron and steel. Around 50 per cent. of UK steel production is exported, with the EU as the main overseas market accounting for more than 60 per cent. of that total.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o304"><a name="70220-0015.htm_para27"><a name="07022075000096">Our ability to respond positively to globalisation will affect our future economic prosperity. It is a huge challenge, but also a great opportunity. The global economy has undergone radical change over the past 50 years, but the last decade has seen the greatest economic change since the industrial revolution of the 19th century. But what took 200 years to change in the industrial revolution is taking 20 years in the global revolution. For example, China&#146;s share of the global economy, which was just 0.5 per cent. in 1978 and 5 per cent. in 2005, is expected to grow to around 20 per cent. by 2015. That is in the space of less than 50 years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o305"><a name="70220-0015.htm_para28"><a name="07022075000097">World steel demand has improved dramatically over the past four years, but the underlying global business environment will remain fiercely competitive for UK metal producers. Increased energy and raw materials prices have added to the pressures, which are set to intensify as rapidly expanding, low cost countries such as China, Russia, India and Brazil look set to increase their exports of steel products to Europe, includingthe UK.</p>

Between 2004 and 2006, Corus made investments totalling &#163;330 million to improve quality and productivity. That was a real vote of confidence by the company in its employees and it resulted in a return to profitability. In 2004 the  <br>

company announced that it was in profit for the first time since 1999. Pre-tax profits reached &#163;580 million for 2005 and the consolidated share price rose from a low of 20p in 2003 to 375p in September 2006, prior to the takeover battle, as my hon. Friends said. That is a remarkable performance for a company that was considered to be on the verge of bankruptcy just three years earlier. The qualities of the work force that have brought about such a remarkable turnaround must bode well for the future of Corus&#146;s operations inthe UK.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o307"><a name="70220-0016.htm_para1"><a name="07022075000099">Corus is not the only UK steel producer that is thriving.

production today did not exist 10 years ago. Corus is co-operating with leading world steel companies to develop ultra-light steel solutions for car designs to meet society&#146;s demands for safe, affordable, fuel efficient and environmentally responsible vehicles for the 21st century.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o312"><a name="70220-0016.htm_para6"><a name="07022075000106">The Department of Trade and Industry has enjoyed an excellent relationship with the UK steel sector over the years and, during that time, there has been regular contact between DTI Ministers and officials and senior industry representatives. The Government have embarked on a partnership with the UK materials industry to promote technology transfer, drive up productivity and help UK companies to move into higher-value-added products. The National Metals Technology Centre, located at the Corus Swinden laboratories in south Yorkshire, was the first initiative to emerge from that collaboration. The world-class technical facilities and expertise of Corus are now benefiting all of the UK metals industry. As a result, sales have increased, some jobs have been created and many others have been safeguarded. We have also created an industry-led umbrella organisation, Materials UK, to take forward the recommendations and strategy set out in the materials innovation and growth team report published in March 2006. We will continue to work closely with the UK metals industry on issues affecting the future prosperity of the sector.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o313"><a name="70220-0016.htm_para7"><a name="07022075000107">Compared with other major industrial sectors, the steel industry has been much more fragmented than its suppliers, its customers and producers of competing materials such as aluminium. Over the last few years, steel producers have looked to integrate horizontally with other mills and vertically with raw material suppliers and steel distributors to secure their futures. A key objective in steel industry consolidation is for producers to get more bargaining power, lower prices for raw materials, and more stable, if not higher, prices for finished products.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o314"><a name="70220-0016.htm_para8"><a name="07022075000108">In August 2005, Corus announced that it would seek opportunities for partnerships in countries with access to low-cost raw materials and high-growth markets in order to secure its future competitive position. On30 January, Tata Steel of India outbid its rival, CSN of Brazil, with an offer to acquire Corus for &#163;6.2 billion. We are pleased that a significant step has been taken to resolve the question of Corus&#146;s future ownership, which must have been a cause of great uncertainty for the company&#146;s employees and stakeholders. However, hon. Members will realise that it is now for the shareholders to decide on the merits of the Tata deal.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o315"><a name="70220-0016.htm_para9"><a name="07022075000109">According to Corus, the Tata deal would provide access to low-cost raw materials and to high-growth markets for products where Corus has a particular strength. That would enable the company to compete on a global scale, and thereby help to secure the future of plant and jobs located in the UK, particularly in the event of a downturn in the steel market. Corus is a leading supplier to many of the most demanding markets around the world, such as the automotive, aerospace, packaging, rail and engineering markets. The Tata takeover would offer Corus access to new and burgeoning markets for those products in India and Asia. There would also be opportunities for Corus to penetrate niche sectors in those markets, for example for its coated sheet products.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o316"><a name="70220-0016.htm_para10"><a name="07022075000110">Tata said that it would preserve agreed capex&#151;capital expenditure&#151;plans, and would honour current employees&#146; terms and conditions. It also said that it had no plans at present to cut jobs or change the location of Corus&#146;s main businesses. An advantage of the Tata deal is that the Corus senior management team will remain in place, offering Corus stability in the initial transition period. Under Tata&#146;s plans Philippe Varin, Corus&#146;s chief executive, is set to stay for two years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o317"><a name="70220-0016.htm_para11"><a name="07022075000111">In its original offer, Tata made a number of proposals to ensure the long-term security of Corus pensions. They were discussed with and approved by the trustees, as several colleagues mentioned. Now that the announcement has been made on the recommended final offer for Corus, the pension trustees will meet Tata once again in order to develop the constructive discussions on pensions held earlier in the bidding process. Those earlier discussions resulted in a memorandum of understanding on pensions that will need to be looked at in the light of the revised offer. The memorandum includes various commitments to the schemes including security measures to address the financing structureof the takeover arrangements.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o318"><a name="70220-0016.htm_para12"><a name="07022075000112">As regards the Corus engineering steels pension scheme, Tata has offered to make an immediate cash injection of &#163;126 million to clear the accounting deficit&#151;a point that was made by several colleagues in the debate. Normal expectations would be for a staged payment over a period of time. On the British Steel scheme, Tata will increase payments from 10 per cent. to 12 per cent. until March 2009. During these lengthy discussions, the trustees have been supported by a team of professional advisers. The pensions regulator has been kept closely informed of developments by the trustees throughout the process.</p>

The UK is regarded as one of the best places in the world in which to do business and foreign investment is making a major contribution to UK wealth. That means new jobs, with some 90,000 in 2005, which was an increase of 19 per cent. from the previous year. Many of those were high-quality, well-paid jobs. The production of many lower-cost, labour-intensive goods is now carried out in developing countries that have lower wages, while the UK is moving towards technology-driven production with high added value.</p>

The &#163;200 million redevelopment of the site, which is driven by the partnership between the local council and the Welsh Assembly Government, will create new places for living, working and recreation.

has built the 30,000 sq ft Ebbw Vale innovation centre, which has been in operation for two years and is, I am advised, running at approximately 80 per cent. occupancy. Some 40 per cent. of the total costs of the project came from the European regional development fund and UK Steel Enterprise continues to finance the running costs of the innovation centre.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o322"><a name="70220-0016.htm_para16"><a name="07022075000116">The hon. Member for Blaenau Gwent called on Tata&#151;I am sure that he would say much the sameto other steel companies&#151;to develop training partnerships with other sectors and companies so that they can benefit from the steel industry&#146;s excellent training programmes. I am pleased to inform him and my hon. Friends that on 25 January my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry launched the national skills academy for manufacturing, The academy is about putting employers in the driving seat to develop more responsive ways of enabling them and their work forces to benefit from better skills. It will provide an opportunity for all manufacturing companies in the UK to gain access to world-class training through their regional contacts and supply chains. I am delighted that many UK leading manufacturing companies have demonstrated their support and leadership by becoming regional lead companies. Through the platform, any company&#151;large or small&#151;will be able to access the academy and what it has to offer. The sector skills council, which works with the steel industry on training and skills, is also directly involved in the academy. No doubt Tata will wish to build on the links.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o323"><a name="70220-0016.htm_para17"><a name="07022075000117">The Government accept that the closure of a steel plant can have an impact on other sectors, especially suppliers and contractors. Assistance for areas that are affected by steel closures is co-ordinated through the regional development agencies. The UK has a good record of bringing new investment to former steel-making areas. For example, in Corby, targeted Government assistance and inward investment promotion attracted a wide range of new activities following the closures in the early 1990s.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o324"><a name="70220-0016.htm_para18"><a name="07022075000118">It will be some time before Tata&#146;s operations will be in a position to supply slab to replace the output from Port Talbot&#146;s blast furnace operations, if indeed the company&#146;s plans for expansion in India and elsewhere come to fruition. In the meantime, Port Talbot will build on the success of recent investments and efficiency programmes to drive down costs further so that it can compete in the global marketplace.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o325"><a name="70220-0016.htm_para19"><a name="07022075000119">Teesside Cast Products is effectively a joint venture with a major purchasing consortium that is led by the Swiss-Italian based Duferco. The consortium, which also includes Italian, Korean and Mexican steel processors, purchases Teesside&#146;s output of slab under a 10-year off-take contract that commenced in late 2004. We have no reason to believe that Tata plans do anything other than to continue to honour that contract, which will secure the future of the plant until at least 2014.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o326"><a name="70220-0016.htm_para20"><a name="07022075000120">Although there have been no specific meetings with Ministers, the company and trade unions have kept DTI officials and advisers up to date as the situation has developed. Further meetings will be held if requested by Corus and the unions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o327"><a name="70220-0016.htm_para21"><a name="07022075000121">It would not be appropriate for me comment on speculation about how Tata plans to finance its takeover of Corus. We have not seen any details as yet,  <br>

and as far as we are aware the company has not made any final decisions on the matter.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o328"><a name="70220-0016.htm_para22"><a name="07022075000122">The hon. Gentleman and other colleagues raised the question of the EU emissions trading scheme. For phase II of the scheme, which runs from 2008 to 2012, the level of the overall quantity of allowances to be allocated in the UK represents an annual reduction of 29.3 million tonnes of carbon dioxide against projected &#147;business as usual&#148; emissions for the phase. The Government have carefully considered the ability of individual sectors to take on a reduction in allocation below &#147;business as usual&#148;, taking into account the extent to which a sector can pass on the costs of reducing emissions and the extent to which it is technically and economically feasible to abate emissions. We concluded that all sectors apart from the large electricity producers sector should get allocations equal to projected &#147;business as usual&#148; emissions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o329"><a name="70220-0016.htm_para23"><a name="07022075000123">For phase II, therefore, the steel sector&#146;s cap will be set in accordance with its projected &#147;business as usual&#148; emissions. Those emissions projections include provision for the emissions of new entrants as they are based on output growth assumptions that relate to demand for a particular product, without regard to whether it has been produced by increased output at existing capacity or output from new capacity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o330"><a name="70220-0016.htm_para24"><a name="07022075000124">The Government have introduced some policy changes in respect of eligibility for allowances for new entrants in phase II. In phase I, extensions in the iron and steel sector were eligible for allowances under an &#147;integrated&#148; approach&#151;that is, where the extension increased the emissions of the site as a whole. We concluded that for phase II extensions should be eligible only for allowances where they involved a piece of equipment that directly produced emissions that had to be accounted for under the EU emissions trading scheme.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o331"><a name="70220-0016.htm_para25"><a name="07022075000125">We do not believe, however, that this change should discourage new investment, as allocations to new entrants need to be seen in the context of allocations to the steel sector as a whole. Although the benchmarks will in future provide much lower levels of allocation to expansions at existing plants, a move to a direct approach will also involve a reduction in the number of allowances that the steel sector has to provide to the new entrant reserve. Therefore, incumbent allocations will be higher as a result&#151;the existing installations will receive more of a sector cap that is growing to reflect the investments that are being made. Although Corus as a whole will be worse off under a direct approach, we estimate that its reduction in allowances would be very small&#151;equivalent to around 1.3 per cent. of its allocation. That reduction is concentrated at one plant, Port Talbot; six others receive a higher allocation under a direct approach.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o332"><a name="70220-0016.htm_para26"><a name="07022075000126">We consulted on those proposals and have fully reflected on the responses that we received in finalising our plans. Overall, I believe that our policy encourages the cost of carbon to be taken into account and balances the different interests within the steel sector.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o333"><a name="70220-0016.htm_para27"><a name="07022075000127">The Government fully appreciate the impact that high and volatile energy prices have had on the operational effectiveness of industry, and the impact on jobs and investment ,which has been raised by a number of colleagues. However, the market has responded to tight supply by developing new gas import infrastructure, and there is now increasing interconnection between the UK and continental Europe and Norway, through the IUK, BBL and Langeled pipelines, and the new LNG terminal at Teesside.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o334"><a name="70220-0016.htm_para28"><a name="07022075000128">That has resulted in the wholesale price of gas falling significantly. Average day-ahead prices from January 2007 have fallen by 60 per cent. compared with January 2006, and are now at levels similar to those in January 2004 and January 2005. The average day-ahead price for the fourth quarter in 2006 fell by 52 per cent. compared with the average price in the same quarter in 2005. In addition, average forward prices for the fourth quarter in 2007 in January 2007 had fallen by 42 per cent. since they peaked in April 2006. Those trends also reflect convergence with gas prices in Europe.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o335"><a name="70220-0016.htm_para29"><a name="07022075000129">The Government have also been working to ensure that the market is able to maximise supplies of gas to the UK for this winter. The situation for industrial customers buying gas at current prices should therefore have eased. However, we recognise that gas prices remain uncomfortably high for users who negotiated contracts when the price was high. There has also been a large drop in wholesale electricity prices during the past year; for example, the average day-ahead base load price for January 2007 was 55 per cent. lower than the average price in January 2006. There has been a similar downward movement in price for future contracts: the January 2007 average price for delivery in the second quarter this year is 48 per cent. lower than the average second quarter price for 2006 reported in January of that year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o336"><a name="70220-0016.htm_para30"><a name="07022075000130">I hope that I have covered most, if not all, of the points raised by the hon. Member for Blaenau Gwent, together with those raised by my hon. Friends, but I will be happy to write to colleagues if that is not the case. I emphasise again the overall positive tone with which the development has been welcomed by hon. Members in the Chamber this evening. I concludeby once more congratulating the hon. Member for Blaenau Gwent on securing this important debate and express my appreciation to my hon. Friends for their contributions.</p>
