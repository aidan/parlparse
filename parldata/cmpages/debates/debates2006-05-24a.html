Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Northern Ireland (Paul
Goggins):</b> The 10th report by the Independent Monitoring
Commission was the most positive yet and confirmed that the security
situation has shown enormous improvement. Although loyalist
paramilitaries and dissident republicans continue to pose a threat, I
am confident that we continue to move towards the kind of peaceful
future that we all want for Northern
Ireland.</p><p><a name="06052453000071"><b><a name="06052453003650">Mr.
Dodds:</b> As regards that peaceful future, the Minister will
be aware of the full-scale republican paramilitary parade through
Londonderry at the weekend, which was attended, it is reported, by
Martin McGuinness&#151;an interesting commentary on his commitment to
exclusively peaceful and democratic means. Given that we are going to
have an orchestrated campaign against Orange and other dignified and
lawful parades in Northern Ireland, can the Minister tell us what his
Department, the police or the Parades Commission have done, or will do,
about that illegal display of force by republicans in
Londonderry?</p><p><a name="06052453000072"><b><a name="06052453003651">Paul

well&#151;that have a particular interest in a peaceful period of
parades over the next few weeks and months. I know that he is committed
to that, as am I. Of course, all these parades should happen in a
lawful and legal way. The Parades Commission has an important role to
play in determining routes that make them

did during their time

Minister had time to consider the conclusion by the Independent
Monitoring Commission that loyalist and republican paramilitary groups
are using community restorative justice projects as a way of imposing
control over local communities? In the light of that verdict, will the
Government undertake not to support such schemes or to impose new
guidelines unless they have the clear support of the Police Service of
Northern Ireland and the Northern Ireland Policing
Board?</p><p><a name="06052453000077"><b><a name="06052453003655">Paul
Goggins:</b> I thank the hon. Gentleman for his warm welcome.
He asked whether I have had sufficient time to look into this. I have
had sufficient time to know that this is a very tricky area and one
that my hon. Friend the Minister of State is considering very
carefully. He will bring forward some clear guidelines in the near
future.</p><p><a name="06052453000078"><b><a name="06052453003656">Mr.
Lidington:</b> May I further encourage the hon. Gentleman and
his right hon. and hon. Friends to ensure that their proposals on
community restorative justice are placed on a clear statutory basis by
embodying them in secondary legislation rather than just leaving this
very important matter as the subject of administrative decision by the
Minister of the
day?</p><p><a name="06052453000079"><b><a name="06052453003657">Paul
Goggins:</b> I can further confirm to the hon. Gentleman that
when the guidelines are published, they will of course be underpinned
by the rule of law and will indeed be operated in full partnership with
the police. It is very important that it is done in that way.
Restorative justice, as a concept, can have a role to play, but it must
be part of the rule of law and operate within proper
systems.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="06052453000060">Northern Ireland

Eddie McGrady (South Down) (SDLP):</b> May I refer the
Secretary of State to his statement that he would make a further
proclamation this week about creating a restoration committee for
Northern Ireland, which he hopes that the party leaders will attend?
Does not he believe that that might frustrate the work of the Assembly,
the primary purpose of which is to restore Executive functions? What
gives him the hope that, for example, the party leaders, who will not
come together in the Assembly, will do so outside it in a restoration
committee? Does not that make the shadow Assembly of even less
substance by transferring its primary function outside that
body?</p><p><a name="06052453000086"><b><a name="06052453003663">Mr.
Hain:</b> I am giving further consideration to representations
from all the parties, including the hon. Gentleman&#146;s, on the
proposal for a committee to prepare for restored government. I am
listening carefully to what people are saying, and there is a case for
it. I know that he will understand that the proposal made by Sir Reg
Empey of the Ulster Unionist party is not a model that I favour and
that it has not found favour with the other parties. We must continue
the consultations until I am in a position to move forward.

Secretary of State summon the leadership of Sinn Fein and tell it
simply and unequivocally that, unless it is prepared absolutely to
forswear criminality, stop manipulating schemes for restorative justice
and sign up to the rule of law, there can be no future for the Assembly

succeed with that.</p><p><a name="06052453000088"><b><a name="06052453003665">Mr.

everybody operating within the rule of law. I am encouraged by recent
statements by senior Sinn Fein figures, including Martin McGuinness,
condemning criminality and, unusually, saying that those who absconded
in the Tohill case should return and be brought to justice. Such
statements may be too late but they are nevertheless welcome and we
must

promised between the Government and the parties and there cannot be
another set of negotiations running alongside them. We know that the
Prime Minister and the Minister are coming to talk to us. Will the
Secretary of State assure me that no committee with power to negotiate
will be set up? He knows the attitude of the Democratic Unionist party
to that. We would not take part in any such committee. Hon. Members

others about the proposal for a committee to prepare for restored
government. I do not intend to give it any power to negotiate. I could
neither do that nor force that on anyone. However, it would be helpful
if there were a forum in which issues could be identified by all the

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Northern Ireland (Maria
Eagle):</b> In March 2006, my right hon. Friend the Secretary
of State announced &#163;100 million additional funding for children
and young people in Northern Ireland, of which &#163;5.6 million has
been set aside specifically for projects to improve the education

adults.</p><p><a name="06052453000097"><b><a name="06052453003673">Jeff
Ennis:</b> I thank the Minister for her reply. I have always
thought that the term &#147;looked-after children&#148; was a
misnomer, because I have always regarded them as looked-over children.
Will the Minister tell me what her Department is doing to ensure that
looked-after children take the opportunity to stay on in education
post-16?</p><p><a name="06052453000098"><b><a name="06052453003674">Maria
Eagle:</b> I have every sympathy with my hon. Friend&#146;s
view that looked-after children are often overlooked rather than looked
after. We have a particular responsibility and obligation to do well by
looked-after children, because we are effectively their parents. Part
of the &#163;5.6 million that I have mentioned will be spent on
enabling children leaving care to stay on with their foster carers
until they reach the age of 21. The resulting increase in stability
will play a key role in improving the chances for looked-after children
to achieve proper educational attainment in line with their peers. That
in turn will be a key determinant in improving the life chances of this
vulnerable group of young people.</p><p><a name="06052453000099"><b><a name="06052453003675">Mary

people with learning disabilities is an essential part of enabling them
to do well in life, and it is our commitment to those young people that
we want them to do as well as they possibly can and to play their full
part in society&#151;including in education and jobs. The kind of

part in ensuring that that happens.</p><p><a name="06052453000101"><b><a name="06052453003677">Mrs.

<br><notus-date day="24" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>24 May 2006 : Column 1464</b><br>has been suggested that one of the factors that contributes to this is
the fact that, on average, those youngsters have access to only one
text book for the full range of subjects that they are studying, even
though the Royal National Institute of the Blind, and St.
Joseph&#146;s School for the Visually Impaired in the Irish Republic,
have the facilities to translate such books into Braille or to transfer
them on to disks. What steps is the Minister taking to ensure that this

reconcile that, and the commitment to special needs education, with the
savage financial cuts being made by education and library boards? Those
cuts are hitting the soft underbelly of education very hard, and
seriously eroding those services. What we are giving with one hand, we
are taking away with the other.</p><p><a name="06052453000106"><b><a name="06052453003682">Maria
Eagle:</b> I do not accept that there are cuts in education
spending in Northern Ireland. There has been a massive increase in
spending, by more than 60 per cent., since 1997. There are demographic
issues involved, however, and falling school rolls mean that the money
has not always been used as efficiently as it might have been. That is
why we are engaged in a strategic review of education, which will
enable us to ensure that the big increases in spending planned for the
future will be properly used to benefit the education of all the
children of Northern Ireland.</p><p><a name="06052453000107"><b><a name="06052453003683">Jim

training?</p><p><a name="06052453000108"><b><a name="06052453003684">Maria
Eagle:</b> My hon. Friend raises an important point. I am
happy to be able to tell him that more than &#163;2 million is being
invested in an education and training credit to make sure that a grant
of at least &#163;800 a year is given to foster carers, to enable
them to make sure that each looked-after child has a computer. Having
access to IT is one of the key ways in which children participate and
do well at school. We must make sure that our looked-after children
have that same access. In that regard, we are also making sure that
every child who lives in a children&#146;s home has a computer of
their own, not just one that might be available to more than one child.

that it is fundamental for police groups and community groups to work
together to ensure that the trend goes downwards, not
upwards?</p><p><a name="06052453000124"><b><a name="06052453003698">Paul
Goggins:</b> I thank my hon. Friend for his question. I know
that he has a particular interest in the matter and that he has been
very supportive of the relevant legislation. He is quite right that, if
organised crime is taking place in order to line the pockets of
organised criminal gangs or to fund paramilitary activity, those people
need to know that the full force of the law will be brought to bear
against them and that the agencies will work together to ensure that
organised crime in Northern Ireland is
combated.</p><p><a name="06052453000125"><b><a name="06052453003699">Mr.
Jeffrey M. Donaldson (Lagan Valley) (DUP):</b> The issue in
Northern Ireland is not the lack of cross-community support for the
security forces in dealing with organised crime, although I note that
Sinn Fein still does not support the police. I hope that the Minister
will join me in urging that party to cross the line and support the
rule of law. Is not the issue one of ensuring that the police, the
Assets Recovery Agency, the Organised Crime Task Force and Revenue and
Customs have the resources that they need to tackle the problem? Until
organised crime and the grip of paramilitarism is broken, we will not
have real peace in Northern Ireland.</p><p><a name="06052453000126"><b><a name="06052453003700">Paul
Goggins:</b> I certainly join the hon. Gentleman in saying
that all parties in Northern Ireland should fully support the rule of
law. Of course that is the case. The agencies are well resourced and
may I say that, under the incentivisation scheme that the Government
have put in place, 50 per cent. of any assets recovered go back to the
agency that recovered them and into front-line services? It therefore
becomes a successful cycle in which more ill-gotten resources go back
to the benefit of the community.</p><br><notus-date day="24" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>24 May 2006 : Column 1467</b><br>

What they describe to me is a situation in which, for the first time,
they have a genuine unity Government. In other words, we have Sunni,
Shi&#146;a and Kurds sitting down and working together, all of them
representing parties that have stood in elections and been elected by
the people of Iraq. I may say that none of them wanted the
multinational force to withdraw immediately, but all of them believe
that the terrorism that is attempting to push their country into civil
war is a terrorism that has to be defeated&#151;that can be
defeated&#151;by the united will of the Iraqi people who want
democracy, and the international community that should support them in
that endeavour.</p><p><a name="06052453000145">I

David Cameron (Witney) (Con):</b> May I begin by adding my
tribute to Eric Forth. He was a master at this Dispatch Box. He had a
quick wit, a brilliant mind and, above all, a dedication to this place.
While he loved the Commons, he also worked hard for people in Bromley
and Chislehurst. From his seat just behind me, he gave a running
commentary on Prime Minister&#146;s Question Time. He had a few
things to say about the Prime Minister&#146;s performance, but just
as often he had a few things to say about mine as well. He always spoke
his mind about everything, but he was a principled defender of what he
believed in, and he will be missed by everyone. The new Home Secretary
has said that the immigration and nationality directorate, after nine
years of a Labour Government, is &#147;inadequate&#148;,
&#147;dysfunctional&#148; and &#147;not fit for purpose&#148;.
More than two years ago, in February 2004, the Prime Minister
said:</p><a name="06052453003564"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The IND
is a transformed part of the Home Office&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="06052453000147">Does the Prime Minister now agree that

Prime Minister:</b> Let me give the right hon. Gentleman the
facts of what has changed over the past nine years. I think it is fair
to point out that whereas over the last four years of the Conservative
Government the number of asylum applications rose by 50 per
cent.&#151;<i> [Interruption.]</i> This is on the record. We have
reduced the number of asylum claims to below the number that we
inherited in 1997. Whereas that Government used to take 22 months over
initial asylum applications, 80 per cent. are now decided within two
months. We have doubled the number of people removed who are failed
asylum seekers, and unlike the previous Government we now actually know
the number of people whom we need to deport and can deport
them.</p><p><a name="06052453000149">I agree that a
huge amount still needs to be done, for the reasons given by my right
hon. Friend the Home Secretary. We have waves of migration, not just in
this country but throughout Europe. Migration is a major issue in the
United States at the moment for the self-same reasons. There has been,
as my right hon. Friend said, huge progress in the past nine years, but
there needs to be much
more.</p><br><notus-date day="24" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>24 May 2006 : Column 1470</b><br><p><a name="06052453000150"><b><a name="06052453003719">Mr.

Robert Peel next. Let us be clear about what the Prime Minister said

Prime Minister:</b> For the very reason that I have just given
to the right hon. Gentleman. <i> [Interruption.]</i> No, I am not
blaming the last Conservative Government. I am simply pointing out that
the system that we inherited in 1997 took ages to decide asylum claims,
and that it was a system in which the number of asylum seekers rose and
people who were failed asylum seekers were not removed. It is a fact
that the number of asylum claims is now down; it is a fact that the
number of removals has now doubled; and it is a fact that 80 per cent.
of claims are now decided in two months. It is also, however, the case
that much more needs to be done.</p><p><a name="06052453000154"><b><a name="06052453003721">Mr.

responsibility, perhaps the Prime Minister can answer this. Can he
explain why the Minister who has been judged too incompetent to run the
immigration part of the Home Office has been put in charge of the
police?</p><p><a name="06052453000155"><b><a name="06052453003722">The
Prime Minister:</b> I do not accept that that is why my hon.
Friend the Member for Harrow, East (Mr. McNulty) has been moved, and I
point out that, under him, we actually doubled the number of removals
of failed asylum seekers.</p><p><a name="06052453000156">Let us turn to the measures
that we now need to take. We need to introduce the new immigration
points system, as we have outlined, but we also need to introduce the
electronic borders that we have suggested, and we need a proper system
of identity for everybody in this country. In addition, we need to
change the law on deportation. Let me just point out to the right hon.
Member for Witney (Mr. Cameron) that every time that this Government
have sought to take measures&#151;<i> [Interruption.] </i>Well, yes,

suspend the House. That is the next move.</p><p><a name="06052453000160"><b><a name="06052453003726">The

measures&#151;for example, to deport people or to fine those
illegally getting people into our country&#151;and every time that we
have tried to tighten the law on those people who are in prison and
whom we need to deport, the Opposition have voted against it.
<i> [Interruption.] </i>It is no use the right hon. Gentleman looking
puzzled. Does he want me to go through each and every measure?
<i> [Interruption.]</i> Right. The Opposition voted against deporting
foreign national prisoners at the halfway point of their sentence. They
voted against removing refugee convention protection from all prisoners
sentenced to two years. They voted against the single-tier appeal
system, which is an absolutely vital part of getting people out of the
country. They failed to support fines for carriers of illegal
immigrants, and they failed to support one-stop appeals or penalties
for spurious appeals. They also abstained on the measures for a points
system and for limiting the rights of appeal in this country. In other
words, the charge against the right hon. Gentleman, with respect, is
that every time that we propose a tough measure, he opposes
it.</p><p><a name="06052453000161"><b><a name="06052453003727">Mr.
Cameron:</b> Honestly, it is hard to know where to start. If
the hon. Member for Harrow, East (Mr. McNulty) was doing such a good
job, why was he moved? The Prime Minister says that we have opposed his
legislation: we have been telling him about the problems with the Human
Rights Act 1998 for years, and he said that everything was fine. In the
last week, we have learned that 95 foreign criminals who have committed
serious crimes are still at large; 700 people escaped from open prisons
last year; and illegal immigrants have been allowed to clean the
offices of the Department that is meant to remove them. That is a
typical week in Labour&#146;s Home
Office.</p><p><a name="06052453000162">While all the
other Ministers are being moved, there is one Minister who has held the
same job for nine years and who said that law and order was his
priority. When will the Prime Minister take personal responsibility for
the
shambles?</p><p><a name="06052453000163"><b><a name="06052453003728">The
Prime Minister:</b> I am happy to take personal
responsibility, but I remind the right hon. Gentleman that according to
the British crime survey, overall crime is down, not up. We have put in
place the antisocial behaviour legislation&#151;measures that he also
failed to support in this House. We have also toughened sentences,
which is why there are more people in prison serving longer prison
sentences. He voted against the measures that allowed us to do that. In
addition, we have an extra 14,000 police officers, and he voted against
the investment for that. With the greatest respect again, although he
talks in general about how much he cares about crime, he ends up voting
in particular against the measures necessary to deal with
it.</p><br><notus-date day="24" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>24 May 2006 : Column 1472</b><br><p><a name="06052453000164"><b><a name="06052453003729">Mr.

specialist help for children with very severe speech and language
disorders that the Prime Minister described. Given, however, that as
things stand the unit faces the threat of closure purely on financial
grounds, will the Prime Minister agree to consider how to safeguard it,

understand it, there are a number of children in the unit at present,
but a significant proportion of them are due to leave in July and
therefore the income for the unit will diminish. However, I understand
that referrals have been taking place over the past few weeks, so it is

over the period of this Government. [Hon.

the hours of opening of large shops on Sundays and other specified

have the opportunity to present to the House a Bill that will limit the
hours in which large supermarkets and other stores trade on a Sunday at
present. I do so because I believe that every politician in the House
must answer a simple question: what kind of society do we wish to
create? In 1994, did we really wish to create a seven-days-a-week
society, with each day identical to the previous one? Did we wish to
make Sunday the same as a Saturday, Friday or Monday? I do not believe
that we did.</p><p><a name="06052453000222">A healthy
society has a rhythm to life, not a monotony of work, work, work, shop,
work, shop, shop, work, or whatever. To me, that is not good for a
healthy society. I am worried about families, and I want to help them
to be together, not to split them apart so that one partner works on a
Sunday while the other looks after the children, allowing them to work
on a Monday while the first partner looks after the children. That is
not good for families. Families are generally a unit of two partners
and children. I think that it is good if families can spend time
together as a unit, rather than each partner spending time individually
with the children. There are other opportunities that are missing from
the rhythm of
life.</p><p><a name="06052453000223">Although I am a
Christian&#151;I am a Roman Catholic and I go to church&#151;that
is not the fundamental reason why I am proposing the Bill. I am
suggesting that one day has to be different, and it does not matter
whether that is for religious observance, a sporting interest, leisure,
or time with the children. I fundamentally believe that, for a healthy
society, such a difference must go
on.</p><p><a name="06052453000224">Let us consider
the impact of the 1994 Act. The Government-commissioned Indepen report
stated that the changes that have occurred since 1994 include the
extension of Sunday opening and its continuing growth. The report
concludes that congestion has increased on Sundays as more and more
people go to the shops. However, more importantly for those who have to
work on Sundays, there has been a reduction in the Sunday wage premium.
Those who find themselves with little choice but to work on Sundays are
thus finding that their reward for giving up their day off with their
families is being
reduced.</p><p><a name="06052453000225">When we
consider what people want, we must look at the changes that have
occurred. One of the big changes to the grocery trade has been the
growth of the big four. The big four now have 70 per cent. of all
grocery trade. The Department of Trade and Industry&#146;s response
to that is not to say, &#147;Hold on a second. Aren&#146;t just
four companies dominating the whole market?&#148; It has refused year
after year to examine that situation to determine whether there is fair
trading, although there is some give on that at the
moment.</p><p><a name="06052453000226">The
Department&#146;s proposals are actually the reverse of mine. It
proposes to consult on deregulating Sundays altogether. The only
consequence of that 
<br><notus-date day="24" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>24 May 2006 : Column 1482</b><br>would be to increase the dominance of the big four. It would work to the
detriment of small shops, and there would be not only no rhythm of life
in society in the week, but no rhythm of where people can go to shop:
the convenience stores would all close because they could not compete
with the buying power of the large
supermarkets.</p><p><a name="06052453000227">What
sort of society do we want? Is it one that is led by the market? I
believe that that should not be the case. The market should serve us,
not we serve the market. A survey by the Union of Shop, Distributive
and Allied Workers, which does not support my proposals&#151;it wants
the existing regulations to remain in place; it does not want an
extension of opening hours, but nor does it want to go back to the
situation in 1994&#151;showed that 43 per cent. of those who
responded did not want to work on Sundays but often had to, that 37 per
cent. did not mind working on Sundays occasionally, and that only 20
per cent. wanted to work on Sundays. The reality is, however, that more
and more people are being forced to. I am aware of people in my
constituency who are frightened to say no to their employers when it
comes to Sunday working. The number of workers who are now protected is
falling because work within the sector tends to be short
term.</p><p><a name="06052453000228">However, not
only are shop workers affected by Sunday opening; so are street
cleaners, who have to go out on a Sunday because there is now more mess
on that day; so are bus drivers, because people want to go to the shops
and there is pressure on services on Sundays; so are lorry drivers, who
have to give up their weekends to make deliveries to stores; so are the
police, who now have to do more work because shops are open on a
Sunday; so are traffic wardens, who have to control the traffic on
Sundays; and so are fire crews, who have to staff the fire stations
because there is an increased risk of their being called out because of
the shops and additional offices that are open on a Sunday. The 1994
Act has had an impact not just on the rhythm of life and on workers who
are forced to give up their free time to work on a Sunday, but on a lot
of other people in many other sectors.</p><p><a name="06052453000229">Let me quote two or three cases
that have been put to me. A woman working for a large department store
in Swansea wrote to Keep Sunday Special,
saying:</p><a name="06052453003569"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;I feel
enormous pressure exerted on me to work Sundays, not only by my
employer, but by my colleagues, many of whom felt threatened and
worried by recent redundancies. I approached a supervisor, pointing out
that legally I could not be forced to work on a Sunday. I was told that
it was in my interests to be part of the team...no one else is
complaining!&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06052453000230">People have
contacted Working Families, which also wants to keep the status quo. It
said:</p><a name="06052453003570"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;One
caller had been working weekend shifts for many years while her
ex-partner looked after the children. However, when he moved away she
was left with no cover. She simply couldn&#146;t work weekends any
more.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06052453000231">She lost her job
as a consequence. Working Families also
said:</p><a name="06052453003571"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Another
caller had had his shift patterns changed unilaterally to include some
weekends, which coincided with when his wife worked. His employer
wasn&#146;t prepared to fit shifts around partners. We advised the
caller of his rights regarding flexible working, but he said that both
he and his wife were too scared of losing their jobs to do
anything.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06052453000232">That is the
reality of Sunday work.</p><br><notus-date day="24" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>24 May 2006 : Column 1483</b><br><p><a name="06052453000233">There is support for a change

work weekends. They are not like MPs, who may opt to do their casework

people who are forced to work. For them, we need to look at the
legislation and to change it. For society as a whole, we need to look

Hayes:</b> I am delighted to speak to new clause 4, and the
other new clauses and amendments in this group.</p><p><a name="06052453000255">For the benefit of the House,
the new clauses that I have tabled with my hon. Friends mount a strong
defence of the role of special schools in the service of special needs
children. Last night, we ended our consideration of the Bill with a
debate on school discipline and the quality of life in schools: their
ethos and atmosphere. I hope that that debate marks the start of a war
on thugs and bullies and a crusade for their victims.</p><p><a name="06052453000256">Most strong, confident, able
children will survive any school, but that is not so for the most
vulnerable, including children with special educational needs. They are
indeed special, and they deserve our special care and concern. Every
parent knows the protective instinct evoked by a fragile, innocent
child as we wonder at their beauty. Imagine the intensity of those
feelings in the case of a child who is especially fragile, physically
or emotionally, because of special needs.</p><p><a name="06052453000257">I invite the House, in
considering the new clauses and amendments, to attempt for a short time
to share those emotions. I do so with little doubt about the good will
in all parts of the House on the subject, which is not a matter of
party affinity or prejudice. It is not, however, unaffected by ideology
or even dogma. The unrelenting pursuit of the integrationist policies
that followed the Warnock report in 1978 and the Education Act 1981,
which was introduced by a Conservative Government, could hardly have
been more dogmatic.</p><p><a name="06052453000258">That dogma has coloured our
perception for too long. When introducing the Special Needs and
Disability Bill&#151;I was pleased to serve as a Front-Bench
spokesmen on the Standing Committee that considered that
Bill&#151;Baroness Blackstone said in the Lords that</p><a name="06052453003572"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;commitment to inclusion has been
strong and constant...The potential social, moral and educational
benefits are significant.&#148;&#151;[<i> Official Report, House of
Lords,</i> 19 December 2000; Vol. 620, c.
635.]</p></ul><p><a name="06052453000259">As I said in Committee,
the order in which she listed those benefits is interesting. We are, of
course, 
<br><notus-date day="24" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>24 May 2006 : Column 1487</b><br>concerned about the social, moral and cultural needs of people with
learning difficulties, but their educational needs are always more
significant than any cultural or social benefits that we might derive
for them, their contemporaries or their schools. I could put it more
bluntly: children&#146;s futures count&#151;not the guilt-ridden
consciences of the liberal bourgeoisie.</p><p><a name="06052453000260">Closed minds have closed
schools, and thus damaged lives. Of course, none of that was
malevolent, and much of it was fuelled by the best intentions. But as
we know, the path to hell is paved with good intentions. The
integrationist broad-brush approach to an infinitely complex issue has
damaged the educational prospects of countless children.</p><p><a name="06052453000261">Of course, many children with
special educational needs, where their parents wish it and where their
needs can be accommodated, do well in mainstream schools and in special
units attached to mainstream schools. I celebrate the work of those
schools and of the teachers so committed to their important duty.
However, there are two fundamental problems with integration. The first
is that the resources necessary properly to meet the stated needs of
children rarely follow them into mainstream schools. That is certainly
true of staff
training.</p><p><a name="06052453000262">The former
head of a middle school with a special unit tells of the practical
costs of the policy in a letter referring to these matters published in
the national media this week. He
writes:</p><a name="06052453003573"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;When I
was appointed head, I was not asked at the interview if I had any
experience of children with special needs. I didn&#146;t. When I took
up the post, I discovered that the teachers at the unit of 24 children
with special needs ranging from emotional behavioural difficulties to
mild autism also had no specialist qualifications. In a school of 400,
these children took up at least half of my administrative time. The
teachers were often off sick and most of the children in the unit
would, in my view, have been better served in special schools.
Inclusion may sound good in theory, but the practicalities often tell a
different story.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06052453000263">So it
is not surprising that, according to the comprehensive review conducted
by <i> The Times Educational Supplement</i> last year, two thirds of
teachers receive less than one day&#146;s training in how to teach
children with special needs, and 90 per cent. of head teachers thought
that their schools did not receive sufficient resources to fund
integration.</p><p><a name="06052453000264">That is
perhaps why the amendments have been welcomed by the National Union of
Teachers as an important set of improvements to the Bill. It is why the
orthodox thinking on the subject among teachers and others has moved to
the position that I have held from the early 1980s onwards, when I
first became interested in special educational needs. I recall from
that period&#151;the mid-1980s&#151;supporting many struggling
parents who wanted their children taught in special schools, sometimes
out of authority or even out of country, because they knew that that
was the best way of allowing their children to fulfil their
potential.</p><p><a name="06052453000265"><b><a name="06052453003786">Roger

right that parental wishes are paramount in these matters. I would not
wish any child whose parents did not wish it or whose needs were not
best catered for there to be educated in a special school. As I said at
the outset, the educational needs of the child should be paramount in
our considerations. I know the hon. Gentleman has a longstanding
commitment to the subject and a detailed knowledge of it. I pay regard
to that. He, like many hon. Members, wants the best for children with
special needs. This debate is about how we achieve
that.</p><p><a name="06052453000268"><b><a name="06052453003788">Roger
Berry:</b> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. There is an
issue about the needs of the child and the wishes of parents, which may
come out in the debate. If the hon. Gentleman agrees that where
educating a child in a special school is incompatible with the wishes
of his parents, that child should have the right to mainstream
education, why has he not made that clear in the new
clause?</p><p><a name="06052453000269"><b><a name="06052453003789">Mr.
Hayes:</b> Because the war that has been waged since Warnock
has not been a war against children being integrated into mainstream
schools. It has been a war against special schools. The prejudice that
has underpinned much of the policy that has emanated since Warnock has
not been a prejudice in favour of special schools; it has been a
prejudice against them. So parents who wanted their children educated
in special schools have found it increasingly hard to get places in
them as those schools have closed, as I shall describe later in my long
but fascinating
speech.</p><p><a name="06052453000270"><b><a name="06052453003790">Ms
Sally Keeble (Northampton, North) (Lab):</b> Does the hon.
Gentleman accept, however, that in addition to people campaigning for
special schools, as indeed they have for various reasons, there has
also been a major problem for parents of a child with special needs who
want that child in a mainstream school and want the necessary support?
Many, many of my constituents campaign to get that support, because
they want their child in a mainstream
school.</p><p><a name="06052453000271"><b><a name="06052453003791">Mr.
Hayes:</b> The hon. Lady makes another important
point&#151;a slightly different one from the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s&#151;about resources, which I was dealing with. It
is crucial that if a child is to be successfully educated in the
mainstream, proper resources and training be put in place to facilitate
their progress. It is often difficult for parents to achieve a
statement in the first place. The statementing process is still too
often long, complex and bureaucratic. It bamboozles many parents. They
are intimidated by the whole subject of their child&#146;s education
and opportunities. I agree with the hon. Lady that it can be a
struggle, therefore, for them to find their way through that maze, get
the necessary resources put in place, get a statement that is
appropriate to their child&#146;s needs, and get the education they
need where they want it delivered.</p><br><notus-date day="24" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>24 May 2006 : Column 1489</b><br><p><a name="06052453000272">I argue for parental choice and

Gentleman points in a rather theatrical way to the new clause. No doubt
he will make an interesting contribution to the debate when he has a

inclusion should be, &#147;Up to a point, Lord Copper&#148;? In the
case with which I am currently concerned&#151;the future of the
Nuffield speech and language unit&#151;it is a matter beyond argument
that the reason for a significant decline in the referrals to the unit
is that there is pressure on local authorities to reduce the number of
statements and, in particular, to avoid wherever possible the fact and
cost of out-of-area placements. Should not we accept that sometimes it
makes sense to include and sometimes it does
not?</p><p><a name="06052453000276"><b><a name="06052453003795">Mr.

Friend says, pertinently, that part of the problem is getting the right
referrals. Because of doubts about resources, there is a reluctance to
statement and to refer. Consequently, parental choices and
children&#146;s needs are neglected along the way. I said at the
outset that I celebrated the work of all those who made integration
work for the very many children who have integrated into mainstream
schools and enjoyed and benefited from the experience. My hon. Friend
the Member for Buckingham (John Bercow) is right when he says that a

mainstream on the one hand and special schools on the other? I put it
to my hon. Friend&#151;I think that he understands the point
extremely well&#151;that when one intervenes early in cases of people
with very severe learning difficulties and has specialist provision
outside mainstream for a period, one can then facilitate re-entry to
mainstream, but to suppose that all children can get by in mainstream
represents a triumph of hope over
reality.</p><p><a name="06052453000287"><b><a name="06052453003803">Mr.

dynamic, because their causes are often dynamic. A child&#146;s needs
will vary; that is why we need to look at the statementing process to
ensure that it is sufficiently sensitive to deal with those changing
needs. Secondly, a child&#146;s educational progress may mean that
they are better educated at different points in their education in
different places. Again, we have to be sufficiently flexible to take
account of that. A good example is indeed that of the Nuffield speech
and language unit. My hon. Friend knows better than I do that the
average time that a person spends at Nuffield is two years, because
they move in and out of provision as their needs require. He is
absolutely right that a static view about appropriateness has been one
of the problems with
policy.</p><p><a name="06052453000288"><b><a name="06052453003804">Ms

makes it clear that one of the criteria for placing a child in a

it?</p><p><a name="06052453000291"><b><a name="06052453003807">Mr.
Hayes:</b> The difficulty, as the hon. Lady will know from her
experience in this House and previously, is that in practice a balance
is often struck between appropriateness of provision and resources.
Sadly, integration, if it is to work well, is often very
resource-hungry. I do not want to be too simplistic about this because
it depends on the need of the child at any one point in time, but the
resource issue that the hon. Lady properly raises is one of the reasons
why integration sometimes fails. That will be an ongoing concern and
something that Members on both sides of the House will want to
scrutinise and raise when appropriate, both nationally and in their own
localities. </p><p><a name="06052453000292">I must

results of last year&#146;s comprehensive survey of schools by <i> The
Times Educational Supplement</i> were shocking. It revealed that
teachers believe that up to 25,000 children in mainstream schools in
England and Wales would be better off in special schools. More
recently, the National Union of Teachers has said that inclusion
amounts to&#148; child abuse&#148; in some cases. It speaks
particularly of those children with the most serious conditions who
struggled in the confusing regime of secondary schools, where they
could be taught by 10 or more teachers a week in different classrooms.
Those findings followed a report that the NUT commissioned from
Cambridge university. It is certainly true that teachers, head teachers
and governors around the country are increasingly alarmed about the
effect of inclusion when resources and training do not follow the
child.</p><p><a name="06052453000294">The second
problem with the policy that followed Warnock is that many secure,
supportive and vastly experienced special schools have closed, as a
direct result of the pernicious Warnock effect. Ninety-three schools
have closed since the Prime Minister promised that things could only
get better in 1997. Before the Minister tells me, as I am sure that he
will, that the same number of children with special needs are educated
in special schools as always were, which is usually the rejoinder when
one talks about special school closures, let me give him the figures.
From January 1999 to January 2005, the number of children educated in
special schools has declined by more than 85,000. The truth is that
many fewer children are being educated in special
schools.</p><p><a name="06052453000295"><b><a name="06052453003808">The

Darlington to see a truly excellent example of an establishment that
brought together a secondary school, a primary school and a special
school, and where the education was entirely centred on the
children&#146;s needs. The whole educational debate is moving on to
be child-centred, so that we look after the educational needs of all

that good education depends on much more than structure. It is sad that
the Bill has necessarily focused our attention on structure when we
should be discussing quality, as she so often does. Good education
depends on the quality of teaching and learning; leadership; the
home-school environment; and a proper understanding of
children&#146;s needs. That mix makes for high quality education.
Most important of all is the need to raise the status of teachers and
to believe in education and in those to whom we entrust our
children.</p><br><notus-date day="24" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>24 May 2006 : Column 1493</b><br><p><a name="06052453000304"><b><a name="06052453003816">Anne

should not ignore the cries from the heart and from the front line that
we hear from teachers about special needs education. The practical cost

not my main consideration. What we cannot quantify often counts most:
the joy of a child who can relax, play and learn in the knowledge that
he is safe; the relief of a teenager who no longer feels different; and
the peace of mind of parents who simply want to entrust their children
to people with the specialist skills and experience to help them
achieve their potential.</p><p><a name="06052453000308">One such parent wrote movingly

<p><a name="06052453000311">There
are many other aspects to the complex subject that we are discussing.
We must consider the early identification of need much more seriously.
Hon. Members with an interest in specific elements of special needs
know that that is vital for autistic children&#151;early
identification of need can make a great difference to their progress.
Hon. Members also know that it is profoundly important in the case of
children with emotional and behavioural difficulties whose lives can be
changed if they are statemented and supported in the right way. Hon.
Members know that the House&#151;not the Government; I make no party
political point&#151;needs to get better at concentrating on the
critical matter of early identification of
need.</p><p><a name="06052453000312">As I have said,
8 per cent. fewer special needs children are now secure in special
schools. I was going to speak at length about Nuffield school, but I
did that in Committee, my hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham asked a
question about it at Prime Minister&#146;s questions and there has
been an extensive Adjournment debate on it. I know that hon. Members
will want to pay attention to it if they have not already done so. It
is one of many examples that I could list.</p><p><a name="06052453000313">A recent report published by
Rathbone, the national charity that provides advice and support to
parents of children with special educational needs, is a damning
indictment of the current SEN system. Evidence collected from 570
schools in 36 local education authorities reveals that alarming numbers
of parents feel frustrated and let down by their child&#146;s school.
Forty-two per cent. of parents questioned believed that their children
had made no progress since being on the SEN register and 10 per cent.
felt that they had regressed. I draw hon. Members&#146; attention to
the Rathbone study, but I will not detain the House with details now
because others want to contribute to the short
debate.</p><p><a name="06052453000314">Parents of
special needs children already have to contend with so much. At the
beginning of my contribution, I asked us to try for a moment to
envisage their circumstances. Is it fair that they should also have to
take the flak for a failed and failing education policy? Baroness
Warnock, the architect of inclusion, has admitted that inclusion, as an
aspect of her report and the subsequent Act, was
&#147;disastrous&#148;.</p><p><a name="06052453000315">Special schools do a special
job for very special children. The teachers and those whom they teach
invariably show great commitment and immense courage. Let us now have
the courage to admit that we got it wrong, as the architect of
inclusion has done. Let us have no more closures, broken dreams and
shattered lives. I am delighted to invite hon. Members, in the spirit
of generosity that has permeated our consideration of the measure, to
embrace the new clauses with relish on behalf of those very vulnerable
children.</p><br><notus-date day="24" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>24 May 2006 : Column 1495</b><br><p><a name="06052453000316"><b><a name="06052453003818">Ms

have had one of his lunches at the Savoy in order to perform so
well.</p><p><a name="06052453000317">Much of our
recent debate on these issues has become rather adversarial, which has
polarised philosophies. A belief has grown that there is a stark choice
to be made in regard to the means of educating special needs children
between inclusion and special schools. That view is unhelpful, because
it ignores the fact that children with special needs are as individual
as the rest of us, that they often present with complex sets of needs,
and that their education should to be tailored to reflect that. The
hon. Gentleman&#146;s comments hinted that he understood that and
showed some movement from the position that he held some time
ago.</p><p><a name="06052453000318">Our debate
should therefore focus on how best we can develop a spectrum of
provision in each local authority area. Such a spectrum should
encapsulate special schools and special educational needs units in
mainstream schools, as well as learning support units&#151;which have
a role to play&#151;and pupil referral units, alongside provision
developed and managed by the voluntary sector. In my constituency, for
instance, we have an excellent facility called Pit Stop, which takes
children with learning difficulties out of school and gives them the
breathing space and focused attention that they need to get them back
on track. Pit Stop works closely with its partner secondary schools and
has a wonderful record of bringing children back into mainstream
education. It is an excellent example of how special needs education
can work more flexibly in the interests of the individual
child.</p><p><a name="06052453000319">It is true that
many special needs children need the kind of education that only a
special school can offer. I have no problem admitting that. However,
those children can also benefit from mixing with their peers in a
mainstream setting. Increasingly, special needs professionals are
recognising that a flexible mix of provision, achieved by schools
working together, is the way forward. That is why my local authority is
redeveloping its provision, and building new fit-for-purpose special
schools across the city, alongside the development of a series of SEN
units in mainstream schools. This is not an either/or approach; it uses
both options.</p><p><a name="06052453000320">New
clause 5 is unhelpful because it would limit the ability of local
authorities to plan strategically the spectrum of provision that I have
described. It would, for instance, limit Sheffield&#146;s plans
slightly to reduce the number of special school places available for
children with learning disabilities while increasing the number of
special school places for children with emotional and behavioural
difficulties. Local authorities are best placed to recognise and to
consult on local need, and to remould the spectrum of provision
accordingly.</p><p><a name="06052453000321">New
clause 4 would replace section 316 of the Education Act 1996. In so
doing, it would remove the requirement for local authorities to
consider in the statementing process the need to ensure that a child
receives the provision that his learning difficulty calls for. It would
replace that requirement with proposed new subsection 3, which asserts
the rights of parents. That substitution ignores the fact that schedule
27 to the 1996 Act makes it clear that there is already a presumption
in favour of parental preference for the 
<br><notus-date day="24" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>24 May 2006 : Column 1496</b><br>placement of a child in a particular school. The schedule also contains
the important qualification that, if a statement names a school, the
school should be suitable in relation to the child&#146;s age,
ability and/or special
needs.</p><p><a name="06052453000322"><b><a name="06052453003819">Mrs.

Bercow:</b> The hon. Lady rightly says that there is merit in
mixed provision. I entirely accept that. However, she said a few
moments ago that local education authorities were best placed to make
judgments on these matters. May I suggest that there is often a
well-grounded concern, even among those who are not overly suspicious
or cynical, that LEAs are at least partly motivated by the
consideration that they need to save money where they can? In that
context, is there not sometimes a conflict of interest between the LEA
commissioning and providing the educational provision, and its being
obliged to pay for it? Would it not be better if there were an
independent element in the process, so that there would be no reason to
question or impugn the motives of the
LEA?</p><p><a name="06052453000325"><b><a name="06052453003822">Ms
Smith:</b> The hon. Gentleman makes an important point, but it
is important that the local people who elect their accountable
representatives are listened to, and that they have the chance to
remove a particular elected body if they feel that resources are being
prioritised over need. That option is available and should be
used.</p><p><a name="06052453000326">The approach
outlined in the Education Act 1996 is reasonable. It directs that
parental preference should be strongly favoured, but requires that such
preferences should be balanced, where necessary, with a professional
assessment of a child&#146;s needs. New clause 4 would effectively
prioritise the requirement to secure efficient use of resources over
the need to provide the appropriate provision necessary to meet a
child&#146;s special needs. I therefore believe that the new clause
does not merit support
today.</p><p><a name="06052453000327">Amendment No.
16 is interesting because it draws attention to the needs of children
who are sometimes badly served by our education system, a point to
which I will return. However, the amendment, as it stands, is flawed.
Non-statemented children with special needs are at present registered
on school action or school action plus, but the code of practice that
triggers entry to those registers allows for a great deal of
flexibility in how schools interpret the criteria.</p><p><a name="06052453000328">The criteria are drawn
incredibly broadly and have led to wide and significant variations
between local authorities. For example, Knowsley registers 21.6 per 
<br><notus-date day="24" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>24 May 2006 : Column 1497</b><br>cent. of its pupils as having non-statemented needs, Rotherham 18.3 per
cent., Doncaster 12.3 per cent. and Cornwall 16.3 per cent. Given those
variations, it would be irresponsible to give admissions priority to
children on those registers.</p><p><a name="06052453000329">That does not mean that we do
not need a debate about provision for non-statemented SEN children,
because we clearly do. For instance, we need to discuss why there are
such wide variations between local authorities. However, I suggest that
the real challenge is to ensure that all our schools are equipped
effectively to meet the needs of low-incidence special needs
children.</p><p><a name="06052453000330">New clause
31 would require governing bodies to secure the necessary support for
SEN children, yet the SEN code of practice already places that
statutory duty on those bodies. We have all heard stories of schools
that fail to satisfy the demands of the code of practice and all MPs
get complaints about children whose needs are apparently neglected.
That point was also made by the hon. Member for South Holland and The
Deepings.</p><p><a name="06052453000331">I therefore
ask the Minister to look closely at the evidence relating to provision
for non-statemented children, and to act if necessary to strengthen the
role of local authorities as champions of parents and children, in
order to help to drive forward improvement in this often neglected area
of education
provision.</p><p><a name="06052453000332"><b><a name="06052453003823">Annette
Brooke (Mid-Dorset and North Poole) (LD):</b> The hon. Member
for South Holland and The Deepings (Mr. Hayes) suggested that Warnock
had been pernicious, but I remind the House of what was happening
pre-Warnock. We need to reflect on that, because we certainly do not
want to go back to a situation in which children were
institutionalised, regardless of the nature of their special needs,
with no entitlement to a full and rich curriculum, and without the
ability to mix with other children that they have today. We have had
one of those infamous pendulum swings that take place in education over
time and, possibly, it has swung too far. If the Minister shows total
resistance to all the amendments, there is a denial that something is
wrong, or at least a pretence that everything is right when, clearly,
it is not.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06052453003627">1.30
pm</h5><p><a name="06052453000333">It is well
researched and proven that the main inclusion agenda, which I broadly
support, has simply been under-resourced. The problem with inclusion is
that it was never going to be a cheap option; it was going to cost
money. Unfortunately, with pressure on resources, it has been seen as a
cheaper option, which has led to certain actions. We must accept that
under-resourcing has created a great deal of problems. First and
foremost, it has created problems for those pupils who inadvertently,
in so far as they are not in full control of their behaviour, make up
60 per cent. of exclusions. That is unhelpful for everybody. New clause
31, which we want to strongly support, picks up that point. When there
is an exclusion, a full assessment of the special needs of the child
involved is required.</p><p><a name="06052453000334">As we know, parents do not feel
fully supported and involved in the current system, which causes
problems, 
<br><notus-date day="24" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>24 May 2006 : Column 1498</b><br>and many teachers in mainstream schools find it hard to cope because of
lack of resources. The report commissioned by the National Union of
Teachers, &#147;The Cost of Inclusion&#148;, has made a valuable
contribution to the debate in highlighting the wide variety of special
needs. Given that there is such an array of special needs, we should
not use a single terminology. Obviously, individual children will need
their requirements met in different ways.</p><p><a name="06052453000335">The NUT report also highlights
that, once one moves from primary to secondary school, the situation
becomes even more complex. Children with special needs relating to
mental health face a huge gap in resourcing for children&#146;s
mental health services. While I acknowledge the massive increase in
resources from the Government, I am sure that all Members know of
inadequate provision locally. That puts enormous pressure on teachers
and, although I have not seen the statistics, I think that that is a
good reason for teachers deciding that they cannot cope any more. That
is reflected in the point that more learning support assistants and
teaching assistants&#151;whatever we like to call them&#151;are
probably needed to make inclusion work. Being able to give more
individual attention to children with behavioural difficulties is the
No. 1 item that teachers mention to me. If they had that ability, they
could make inclusion work. They want to make it work and feel proud
when they do so, but it is difficult with all the
constraints.</p><p><a name="06052453000336">In
relation to the points made by the hon. Member for Sheffield,
Hillsborough (Ms Smith), I agree strongly about the need to have a
spectrum of support. That fits into my argument that we have swung the
pendulum instead of getting the right balance. It is important for a
local education authority to give a strong, strategic lead on special
educational needs. Perhaps we should not rehearse the arguments again,
but with different types of schools, including those becoming more
autonomous from the local education authority, it is more difficult to
promote collaboration, which is especially important in relation to
special needs, between all the schools within an LEA. A special
school&#146;s numbers might fall for all sorts of reasons, but it is
important to keep the resources of that school together and to have
outreach workers with specialities supporting mainstream schools.
However, such collaborative working requires the local education
authority to pull everything together. I agree that pupil referral
units, learning support areas and learning zones are needed in which
specialist intensive help can be provided alongside mainstream
school.</p><p><a name="06052453000337">Training is
essential and is probably mentioned in one of the many new clauses in
the group. As we discussed in Committee, that applies to teachers,
special educational needs co-ordinators and, I would add, the various
teaching assistants&#151;that is a slight omission from the new
clause concerned. I still feel nervous about the idea that any closure
of a special school should have the authority of the Secretary of
State. I find that a surprising proposal from the Conservatives, as
they keep telling me that the Secretary of State is causing all the
closures in the first place with the policy being operated. I do not
therefore know why they have such confidence in central Government in
that respect.</p><br><notus-date day="24" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>24 May 2006 : Column 1499</b><br><p><a name="06052453000338">My main concern is about the
proposal that the Secretary of State shall consent to the closure of a
special school only if there are places at nearby special schools. Of
course, when one is managing a comprehensive policy for special
educational needs, one might close a special school that does not have
technology and science facilities&#151;because it was built in the
years when children with special educational needs were
neglected&#151;in order to build a brand-new unit, which might be on
the site of a mainstream school. I cannot see the amendment concerned
working.</p><p><a name="06052453000339">Generally,
we greatly support the sentiments behind this group of amendments,
because this is a debate that should be held, and it would be a good
idea, as the NUT&#146;s report suggests, to have an independent
review of inclusion. Perhaps we should stop pretending that we can
carry out a policy of inclusion on the
cheap.</p><p><a name="06052453000340"><b><a name="06052453003824">Mr.

inquiries.</p><p><a name="06052453000341"><b><a name="06052453003825">Annette

especially in this area.</p><p><a name="06052453000342">Apart from the caveats that I
have mentioned, we are sympathetic to the new clauses. I hope that the

speak to new clause 30 and other new clauses and amendments tabled by
me and my hon. Friends.</p><p><a name="06052453000344">Perhaps I can begin, as an
effective way of structuring my remarks, by referring to the briefing
on the new clauses and amendments, which states that they are designed
to strengthen the rights and position of disabled children and those
with special educational needs, with or without statements both for
existing and for future schools. That follows on from discussions with
the Special Educational Consortium and other disability and special
educational needs groups about their concern that, in certain key
areas, the Bill needs to be beefed up to ensure that the position of
such children is protected. My hon. Friend the Member for Huddersfield
(Mr. Sheerman) has already mentioned the fact that his Select Committee
is conducting a dedicated SEN inquiry. In its inquiry into the White
Paper, we also took evidence on some of the issues, 
<br><notus-date day="24" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>24 May 2006 : Column 1500</b><br>albeit briefly. I share the concerns of others that these matters need a
broader airing on the Floor of the House, not least because they did
not receive an adequate airing in the latter stages in
Committee.</p><p><a name="06052453000345">The
amendments and new clauses tabled by my hon. Friends and myself cover
three separate areas: setting training standards in special educational
needs and disability issues for teachers; ensuring that fair admissions
are a school requirement and are properly monitored; and, perhaps most
importantly, strengthening the rights of SEN and disabled pupils in
exclusion matters and educational support for excluded categories. I
merely add at this stage that that is essential in view of alarming
figures showing that SEN children have a disproportionate number of
exclusions from school and that parents often fail to receive
sufficient support and advice in those
circumstances.</p><p><a name="06052453000346"><b><a name="06052453003827">Mr.
Hayes:</b> I welcome the hon. Gentleman&#146;s contribution
to the debate and, indeed, the important new clauses that he has
tabled. May I invite him to suggest to the Select Committee that it
looks specifically at the issue of exclusions, which was raised in
Committee by my hon. Friends? It is a profoundly important issue, so
perhaps the hon. Gentleman would like to encourage the Select Committee
to deal with it.
</p><p><a name="06052453000347"><b><a name="06052453003828">Mr.

Friend the Member for Huddersfield would endorse this&#151;that we
have taken a broad range of evidence, both oral and written, and that
the issues that the hon. Gentleman raised are covered by it. I wholly
accept that they are vitally
important.</p><p><a name="06052453000348"><b><a name="06052453003829">Mrs.
Dorries:</b> It is important to mention that about two thirds
of all children excluded from school have special educational needs;
that is, two thirds of the total number excluded at any one
time.</p><p><a name="06052453000349"><b><a name="06052453003830">Mr.
Marsden:</b> I thank the hon. Lady for her intervention. She
will see, as I continue with my remarks, that I will provide further
statistics that underline her point.</p><p><a name="06052453000350">New clause 30 specifically
deals with professional standards for teachers, aiming to ensure that
they demonstrate an understanding of SEN and disability legislation.
That is terribly important because, without ensuring the inclusion of
SEN children and without specialist support services, many children
will not achieve their potential. The majority of deaf children, for
example, are now educated in mainstream settings, but many still need
appropriate support and provision.
</p><p><a name="06052453000351">I refer hon. Members
to the Ofsted report of 2004, which dealt with the issue of inclusive
schools and children with special educational needs and disabilities.
It states that only a minority of mainstream schools meet special needs
very well and that others are becoming better at doing so. However, the
report also notes that few schools evaluate their provision for pupils
with SEN systematically so that they can establish how effective the
provision is, with many 
<br><notus-date day="24" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>24 May 2006 : Column 1501</b><br>schools undertaking too little forward planning to ensure that provision
was in place. It said that</p><a name="06052453003580"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;when they coped poorly, this was
often attributed to pupils&#146; difficulties rather than the
school&#146;s inability to provide adequately.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06052453000352">That is a leitmotif, highlighting an
issue that we must deal with.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06052453003628">1.45
pm</h5><p><a name="06052453000353">Reference has
already been made to the recent NUT report, &#147;The Costs of
Inclusion&#148; published by Cambridge university. I shall cite from
it because it provides important evidence about standards. It
states:</p><a name="06052453003581"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;In the
absence of professional development, teachers are sometimes
&#145;trained&#146; by parents, placing reliance on parental
knowledge and expertise. Input on most initial training courses is
minimal and few new teachers are able to develop strategies for meeting
the needs of pupils with specific learning difficulties. &#145;On the
job&#146; training is also
inadequate.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06052453000354">There
is also sometimes a strong lack of understanding in schools of the
requirements of the Special Educational Needs and Disability
Discrimination Act 2001. The National Autistic Society report,
&#147;Make School Make Sense&#148;, concluded that in mainstream
schools, only 27 per cent. of parents say that all their child&#146;s
teachers have been able to adjust their approach and teaching
materials, thereby meeting their legal duties under the 2001 Act to
differentiate the curriculum for SEN children.</p><p><a name="06052453000355">Finally, on the matter of
training and development, I would like to cite two specific examples
because I am mindful of the point made by the hon. Member for South
Holland and The Deepings (Mr. Hayes) in his opening speech&#151;that
we should view the problem in the context of real individuals, real
families, real pressures and real crises rather than by trading
statistics across the Floor of the House.</p><p><a name="06052453000356">These examples come from the
National Autistic Society. A 13-year-old boy with Asperger&#146;s
syndrome attended a mainstream school, part time, to facilitate his
integration process. His mother and a neighbour went to the school to
find him standing facing a wall with a female teacher and assistant
head teacher on the other side of the room. She went to talk to him. He
had a tantrum, but was not physically aggressive. The female teacher
intervened and tried physically to restrain the boy. The tantrum
worsened and the boy ended up on the floor with all four adults trying
to restrain him. He is then alleged to have kicked the female teacher
and the police were called. The boy was calm when they arrived and was
allowed to leave the school without comment, but he was formally
excluded as a result of the incident. Three months later, he was
actually arrested, with no recollection of the earlier incident being
made, and he probably had no understanding of why he had been
arrested.</p><p><a name="06052453000357">Three
important implications apply. First, there should be proper training in
and guidance for staff on the appropriate use of force. Secondly,
appropriate provision should be made in respect of behaviour policy and
disciplinary penalties. Thirdly, as I have already said, it is vital
that teachers are trained in SEN and disability legislation and
requirements. A range of other examples across the autistic spectrum
disorders 
<br><notus-date day="24" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>24 May 2006 : Column 1502</b><br>could be mentioned. In that context, it is worth saying that there is
often a false assumption that children with disabilities have low
intelligence. In certain groups, and particularly among children with
Asperger&#146;s syndrome, nothing could be further from the truth.
That is a major misunderstanding that must be dealt with in training
and related areas.</p><p><a name="06052453000358">I
want to put on record the fact that my hon. Friend the Member for
Kingswood (Roger Berry) and I have had useful discussions with the
Under-Secretary in the other place. We have already had a very helpful
and supportive response from him and I am sure that the Minister will
want to add to it today. I do not want to trespass on what he may say
later, but on the issue of professional standards for teachers, I am
reassured by the fact that a revised set of standards for qualified
teacher status will be produced shortly. They will help to tackle some
of the problems that I have mentioned. I understand why Ministers
should think that there is no need to incorporate or update these
references in statute, but the new clause does not preclude the
updating of guidance or professional standards for SEN. I am sure that
Minister will respond to the point later, but what we are attempting is
simply to set basic minimum requirements that could and should be
supplemented and complemented by further guidance.</p><p><a name="06052453000359">The other point that I would
make about the proposed consultation on the standards is that, assuming
their wider acceptance, they will be initially used in pilot schemes
only&#151;they will not be compulsory&#151;because of which we
should have a further discussion of whether we need to include more
explicit standards in the Bill or, indeed, in other guidance. If my
hon. Friend the Minister cannot develop that suggestion today, I hope
that that will happen when the Bill passes to the other
House.</p><p><a name="06052453000360">Time is
pressing, so I want to focus specifically on new clause 80, which was
alluded to by the hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole (Annette
Brooke). New clause 80 and the associated new clauses that my hon.
Friends and I have tabled are designed to address behaviour policy and
exclusions. From my example of the boy with Asperger&#146;s syndrome,
I hope that it is clear to the House how vital it is that we get things
right in this respect. There is a lack of understanding about the
requirements of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 in schools. Of
course the DDA requires schools to make reasonable adjustments to
ensure that pupils are not discriminated against because of their
disability, but the hon. Member for Mid-Bedfordshire (Mrs. Dorries)
made an entirely valid point in intervening on me a few moments ago:
two thirds of all exclusions involve pupils with SEN.</p><p><a name="06052453000361">The Audit Commission report of
2002, &#147;Special Educational Needs: a mainstream issue&#148;,
suggested that children with SEN, including those without statements,
account for the vast majority permanent exclusions&#151;almost nine
out of 10 from primary schools and six out of 10 from secondary
schools. So it is important to evaluate behaviour policy and
disciplinary penalties to ensure that they are justified in the
particular circumstances of pupils with SEN and those with
disabilities. It is essential that we ensure that appropriate special
provision is made for pupils with 
<br><notus-date day="24" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>24 May 2006 : Column 1503</b><br>SEN that will reduce the risk of unnecessary exclusion. The Department
for Education and Skills has very strong guidance on the issue: schools
should try every practical means to maintain the pupil in school,
including seeking LEA and other professional advice and so on. Again,
all too often, that advice is not taken
up.</p><p><a name="06052453000362">I also want to
talk about pupils with SEN who have multiple fixed-term exclusions.
Almost 4 per cent. of pupils with statements of SEN and 2.6 per cent.
pupils with SEN without a statement have one or more fixed-term
exclusions in a year. It is very important that children who are not
registered as permanently excluded but who still do not attend schools
regularly due to multiple fixed-term exclusions should be provided for
appropriately, especially given the number of informal or unofficial
and, quite frankly, sometimes illegal exclusions of pupils with SEN.
That issue will be familiar to many hon. Members because it comes to
them by way of their casework, and for many hon. Members and certainly
for me, it is one of the things that makes us have such a strong focus
on the importance of the
issue.</p><p><a name="06052453000363">I want to refer
to what has been done in this respect since September 2002, when the
Special Education Needs and Disability Act 2001 came into effect, and
to refer to the new disability equal duty that schools and local
authorities have under the Disability Discrimination Act 2005. Again, I
am grateful to the Minister in another place and his officials for the
comments and assurances that they have offered in that respect. They
say that</p><a name="06052453003582"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;the resource
was developed with schools and local authorities for schools and local
authorities and fulfils a commitment we gave in our SEN strategy,
&#145;Removing Barriers to
Achievement&#146;&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="06052453000364">That
shows how some schools are already meeting the duties effectively and
provides a range of guidance and training activities. I understand that
that guidance will be available in printed form very
shortly.</p>

<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060524/debtext/60524-0310.htm"/>


<p><a name="06052453000365">The key
phrase to consider, however, is &#147;some schools&#148;, which
suggests that the standards are very good, but that they are still not
being implemented widely enough. They need to be stated more explicitly
and more needs to be done to implement them. Although I accept the
Government&#146;s assurances on the issue and that the new duties
under the DDA 2005 will help with the exclusions issue, it is important
they do not consider that the job is done. I hope that my hon. Friend
the Minister will reflect on the fact that the Government should use
the opportunity of the time between the Bill leaving the House if it
receives its Third Reading and passing to the other place to talk to
the Special Education Consortium and the other disability charities
that have made representations to discover whether such things can be
strengthened above and beyond the existing DDA
legislation.</p><p><a name="06052453000366"><b><a name="06052453003831">Mrs.
Betty Williams (Conwy) (Lab):</b> Does my hon. Friend agree
that quite a number of the exclusions from schools and LEAs that
involve pupils with special educational needs are caused by the delay
in statementing those children? If the statement is not made at an
early stage, all the members of staff will not be aware of that
child&#146;s needs. That leads to more serious behaviour problems if
it is not addressed very early in that child&#146;s
life.</p><br><notus-date day="24" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>24 May 2006 : Column 1504</b><br><p><a name="06052453000367"><b><a name="06052453003832">Mr.

know of her strong interest in these issues, and she is absolutely
right to pinpoint the issue of early intervention and the concerns that
she expresses about statementing. Statementing is very complicated, but
the sort of delays that she refers to are apparent. Despite the
legislation, delays occur in providing alternative education for
children with SEN who have been excluded. I caution Ministers not to
believe that, merely because the extremely welcome new clauses on
discipline will reduce the period in which action should be taken, we
should automatically assume that that will mean that everything is
splendid. A conscious effort needs to be made to monitor the
implementation of those provisions, to consider the way in which local
authorities deal with the issue and, where and if appropriate, to give
further guidance and support in that
respect.</p><p><a name="06052453000368">I want very
briefly to return to where we go on these issues. It is evident from
what I have said and from the helpful responses that we have received
that there is no one solution to the sorts of the problems that I have
been highlighting today. The solution is not just a question of
legislation, nor of guidance; it is not even just a question of good
practice. It is a question of ensuring that all three of those aspects
are joined together.</p><p><a name="06052453000369">Yes, I believe that the
Government should look carefully at the new clauses and amendments that
we have proposed to see whether more could be done to strengthen the
legislation, but the most important thing is that they see, and we all
see, the connection between those three areas and the need to keep the
pressure on, to put it bluntly. Only by keeping that pressure on will
the needs of children with disabilities and SEN and of their parents be
met. We must remember that a substantial number of children with SEN
have parents who either have or have had special educational needs.
Sometimes, it is a question not just of dealing with the needs of one
generation, but of dealing with those of two
generations.</p><p><a name="06052453000370">I make my
final point in reference to a previous discussion. I think that someone
used the word &#147;Manichaean&#148; earlier, but please let us not
get hung up on the idea that the special schools issue is a complex
battle between good and evil, or this year&#146;s zeitgeist as
opposed to last year&#146;s
zeitgeist.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06052453003629">2

close collaboration. One of the schools is adjacent to a mainstream
local authority school. I have visited all three regularly, and visited
Highfurlong very recently. A mixed class there also included children
from a local primary school and a local high school. The benefits of
working together and using the same facilities were felt by both the
children with disabilities and special educational needs and those
without.</p><p><a name="06052453000372">As I have
said, we should not become too hung up on the struggle between good and

trench warfare between mainstream and special schools. It is
acknowledged that each child has individual needs, on which will depend
whether that child is placed in a mainstream or a special
school.</p><p><a name="06052453000375">The wishes of
the parent are very important. New subsection (3)(b) refers
to</p><a name="06052453003584"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;the provision of
efficient education for other
children&#148;,</p></ul><p><a name="06052453000376">which is
indeed an important consideration in mainstream schools. It is
essential for proper provision to be made for the support of a child
with special needs in a mainstream classroom, especially in practical
terms. The practical tasks involved in looking after a child who is a
wheelchair user and is unable to transfer from the wheelchair to an
ordinary chair, or who needs a standing frame, are very time-consuming.
There must be sufficient teaching and welfare support in the classroom,
so that the education of the other children is not
compromised.</p><p><a name="06052453000377">New
subsection (5), which has already been mentioned several times,
states:</p><a name="06052453003585"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;A
child with special educational needs being provided for under section
(3) above shall not be educated in a mainstream school if that is
incompatible with the wishes of his
parents.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06052453000378">New subsection
(4) is central to the decision that parents must make. Many parents,
particularly if the child with special needs is their first and they
have no recent experience of schools&#151;perhaps no experience since
they were at school themselves&#151;will not know which is the best
placement for their child. They will need to be presented with all the
options and all the information that is available. They should be able
to visit both local mainstream schools and special schools to gain an
impression of provision there. They should be able to speak to head
teachers, past teachers and assistants, and to members of the education
authority, so that they can reach an informed decision about the best
provision for their particular
child.</p><p><a name="06052453000379">I worked in a
special school for many years during the 1970s and 1980s. The first
thing that comes to mind is that it is impossible to generalise about
children with special needs, and that therefore provision cannot be
generalised. There was a fair amount of movement between the school
where I worked, which is not there any more, and local mainstream
schools, in both directions and with varying degrees of success. Again,
it is impossible to generalise about whether movement from special
school to mainstream or from mainstream to special school will succeed.
It is necessary to take account of the individual
child.</p><p><a name="06052453000380">I recall one
child with brittle bones who was highly intelligent. Her parents wanted
her to try her luck in a mainstream school. She acquired a large degree
of independence in a special school, because one of the rules was that,
whatever a child&#146;s disability, that child should enjoy as much
independence as possible. Unfortunately, when the girl went to a
mainstream school, she was seen as a novelty: everyone wanted to help
her, particularly the other children, who would 
<br><notus-date day="24" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>24 May 2006 : Column 1506</b><br>fetch and carry for her. She lost much of the independence that she
gained in the special school.</p><p><a name="06052453000381">There was an enormous spectrum
of disability at the school where I worked, from complex conditions
affecting mobility such as Freeman-Sheldon syndrome, Friedrich&#146;s
ataxia and spastic quadriplegia to disabilities that are not visible,
such as chronic asthma, diabetes and heart conditions. In the middle of
the spectrum are all sorts of other conditions which require very
sensitive handling.</p><p><a name="06052453000382">Special schools provide much
more than education. Because they are so used to dealing with children
with profound special needs, they are sensitive even to changes of
mood, and to how a child may be affected by an incident in the
classroom. They can avert episodes of children being unable to cope. It
is that experience, built up over many years, that is so valuable to
children, in terms not just of education but of emotional support. It
enables them to cope with life as well as
learning.</p><p><a name="06052453000383">I recall
another child. The hon. Member for Blackpool, South (Mr. Marsden)
observed that people are not always conscious that children with
special needs are often highly intelligent. There is an assumption that
they are of low intelligence, which is wrong. One of our pupils, aged
16, had very mild cerebral palsy which affected only his speech. We
discovered belatedly that his own family did not realise that he
understood what they were saying to him. Because they did not
understand what he was saying to them, it did not occur to them that
his thought processes and intellect were perfectly normal. He reached
the age of 16 before we were able to discover that, and to explain to
the family that they could speak to him perfectly normally, as they
spoke to everyone else, and he would understand: the mechanics of
speech were his only
problem.</p><p><a name="06052453000384">Speech and
language have been mentioned several times today. Even in the 1970s,
there was a chronic, long-standing shortage of speech and language
therapists. Since I have been in the House, I have conducted some
research into why that might be. It is very difficult to get to the
bottom of it. We have plenty of colleges and courses involving speech
and language. They are full&#151;they are not short of
students&#151;and they have a high success rate. Many students
qualify, and there is not an unusually high drop-out rate. The mystery
is, where do all the students go when they have qualified? They do not
seem to go into the national health service, because my primary care
trust cannot recruit speech and language therapists, and they do not go
into special schools. The challenge for all of us is to redirect speech
and language graduates to special schools and the NHS, where there is
an enormous need for speech and language therapy. Whatever other
problems they may have, if children cannot communicate with people whom
they meet, that is almost the worst handicap that they could
suffer.</p><p><a name="06052453000385">Like the hon.
Member for Blackpool, South, I have three superb special schools in my
constituency: Corbets Tey, Dycorts and Ravensbourne. None of them,
thankfully, is threatened with closure, which would be unthinkable. I
cannot think of a single pupil in any of those schools who would be
better off in a mainstream school. The children are flourishing, and
their educational and social needs are being met. The 
<br><notus-date day="24" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>24 May 2006 : Column 1507</b><br>schools also provide a support system for families. They often have
great difficulty in conducting anything resembling what we would
recognise as a normal daily life, particularly if they have children on
the autistic spectrum. One function of those schools is giving
additional support to parents and siblings. With the best will in the
world, mainstream schools&#151;given how busy they are and the
enormous demands and pressures that are placed on them&#151;do not
have the time to provide such extra services to families with children
with special needs.</p><p><a name="06052453000386"><b><a name="06052453003834">John
Bercow:</b> My hon. Friend made some important remarks a
moment ago about the need to improve and to maximise recruitment of
speech and language therapists, and to get them into the national
health service and, in many cases, special schools. This has been a
good and stimulating debate so far, and I want to underline her point
by saying that it is incumbent on all of us in public service to
re-double our efforts on that front. It always strikes me that, when a
popular local school or hospital is to close, there is a ready supply
of articulate protestors. However, when a special school facility is to
close and that closure will affect only a relatively small number of
children, many people either are not aware of that threat and shortage
of specialists, or, frankly, do not care enough about it. So Members
across the political spectrum have a duty to step up efforts to meet
the
challenge.</p><p><a name="06052453000387"><b><a name="06052453003835">Angela
Watkinson:</b> I thank my hon. Friend for those comments. We
are all only too well aware of the shortage of such specialists. All of
us do whatever we can, wherever we can, to encourage the greater
availability of speech and language therapists. Even in the 1970s,
children with speech and language problems in my school had a visiting
speech and language therapist, who was able to give each child a
quarter of an hour a week. Anyone who knows children with speech and
language problems knows that that is hopelessly inadequate. So we all
need to work very hard on the issue.</p><p><a name="06052453000388">I turn to new clause 5, which
deals with restrictions on special school closures. As I said, it would
be unthinkable for any of the special schools in my constituency to
close. New clause 5(2)
states:</p><a name="06052453003586"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The
Secretary of State shall only consent to the closure of a special
school if there are places at nearby special schools in sufficient
number and sufficient quality to replace the school
adequately.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06052453000389">I should be
surprised to learn that there is a single constituency in the entire
country in which special school places are available. Most such schools
have no spare capacity and are unable to take more children who would
like to be placed there. It is highly unlikely that any area has
sufficient spare capacity to enable a special school to be closed in
the light of the caveat in the new clause. That caveat is important in
protecting special schools and the enormously good work that they
do.</p><p><a name="06052453000390">I urge hon.
Members in all parts of the House to support not just new clause 4, but
new clause
5.</p><p><a name="06052453000391"><b><a name="06052453003836">Mr.
David Blunkett (Sheffield, Brightside) (Lab):</b> I confess to
the hon. Member for South Holland and The Deepings (Mr. Hayes) that, at
one time, I was 
<br><notus-date day="24" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>24 May 2006 : Column 1508</b><br>dogmatic. I was dogmatic for a brief period&#151;I promise that it was
brief&#151;when I came out of a special residential environment. I
spent six years in integrated education for the first time, on
day-release from work and at evening class, before going into full-time
integrated education for the first time at university. I was dogmatic
because my experience had been a difficult one. My schooling had not
offered the academic achievement that we would want for our own
children, and, as with so many schools, the physical environment left
something to be desired.</p><p><a name="06052453000392">In the 1960s and 1970s, special
schools, be they day or residential, were not what they are today. One
precise reason why Baroness Warnock has changed her mind on this
issue&#151;and why, by the time that I became Secretary of State for
Education and Employment, I began to see that it was absolutely crucial
not to be dogmatic&#151;is that the world has changed.</p><p><a name="06052453000393">When I went to primary school,
most of those whom I was at school with had just one special need: they
could not see. By the time that that school closed because the number
who simply could not see had dropped, the incidence of multiple
disability&#151;the multiple special needs that children
had&#151;had grown to the point where that type of education could no
longer cope. So the school closed not because people wanted to
eliminate a facility, but because it needed to be re-shaped for a
different era, in which medical science had eliminated the original
causes of special need, but had also kept alive children who previously
would not have been in school at all, because they would not have
reached school
age.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06052453003630">2.15
pm</h5><p><a name="06052453000394">So we are
dealing with a different environment, and I appeal to the House, as my
hon. Friend the Member for Blackpool, South (Mr. Marsden) did, to come
together. None of us wants a system that does not take account of the
special needs of the individual child and their family. Various issues
have been raised this afternoon, such as the proper of training of
teachers, professional development, the training of learning support
workers&#151;there are now 110,000 such workers in mainstream schools
throughout the country; they did not exist nine years ago&#151;and
the ability of learning mentors to develop, alongside special
educational needs co-ordinators, the specialism of guiding and
supporting families and others in the school environment. We need to
recognise that those issues are crucial.</p><p><a name="06052453000395">I congratulate my hon. Friend
the Minister for Schools on intervening to get the statistics right,
and I believe that the Government are listening and responding.
However, I have two or three regrets that I want to put on the record.
In 1998, when I was Secretary of State for Education and Employment, we
moved towards regional planning. I believe strongly that, without it,
we cannot maintain centres of excellence, expertise and the necessary
facilities. Even with the best resources in the world, no single
education authority can possibly provide for every specialism and every
need. In any case, the level of expertise across the country is
limited. My hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Hillsborough (Ms
Smith) described what my own authority is doing, but there are
authorities such as Derbyshire that come very close 
<br><notus-date day="24" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>24 May 2006 : Column 1509</b><br>to being exemplars. It is at the local level that an understanding must
be shown of people&#146;s specific needs. However, we can do things
at a regional level that cannot be done at the purely local. I now
regret that the Special Educational Needs and Disability Act 2001 did
not place greater emphasis on ensuring that that
happened.</p><p><a name="06052453000396"><b><a name="06052453003837">Anne
Snelgrove: </b>My right hon. Friend is making an important
point, and I have been of the same opinion for years. Small unitary
authorities, in particular, are unable to provide the breadth of
special needs education that larger authorities such as Derbyshire can
provide. I hope that the Minister is listening to my right hon.
Friend.</p><p><a name="06052453000397"><b><a name="06052453003838">Mr.
Blunkett:</b> I am grateful to my hon. Friend. Derbyshire has
understood the message that is coming across loud and clear in this
very good debate: unless we train teachers and assistants properly, and
unless they are prepared for what is likely to happen, there will be
resistance to sensible integration. If integration is done badly, it
should not be done at all. We therefore have to get the balance right
in providing training and expertise in centres of excellence. If
special schools that can cater for specific requirements are no longer
available, the expertise will die with them.</p><p><a name="06052453000398">Providing good teaching in the
classroom means providing adequate and supportive resources not just in
the school itself, but during out-of-school activities, in order to
make integration a reality. I took slight umbrage at the beginning of
this debate at the idea that inclusion is a dogma, which is very silly.
Inclusion is not a dogma; it is a sensible objective, which is to be
met by not attempting to include children in mainstream education where
doing so would be detrimental to them and to those around
them.</p><p><a name="06052453000399">That raises one
further point. Because multiple disability needs and special needs are
very different, we have to adapt the way in which we behave towards and
think about them, in order to deal with those different layers. My hon.
Friend the Member for Sheffield, Hillsborough mentioned the
non-statemented special educational needs child. I hope that the
Government will place greater emphasis on supporting schools in that
regard. What my hon. Friend the Member for Blackpool, South said on the
issue&#151;it was repeated by the hon. Member for Upminster (Angela
Watkinson)&#151;is absolutely true, and, although it pains me to say
so, I also agreed with quite a lot of what the hon. Member for
Mid-Dorset and North Poole (Annette Brooke)
said.</p><p><a name="06052453000400"><b><a name="06052453003839">Mr.
Hayes:</b> Would the right hon. Gentleman join the hon. Member
for Blackpool, South (Mr. Marsden) in calling for an independent review
of some of these issues? I have in mind particularly the issue of
non-statemented special needs, which were mentioned by the hon.
Gentleman and which the right hon. Gentleman rightly amplifies
now.</p><p><a name="06052453000401"><b><a name="06052453003840">Mr.
Blunkett:</b> I am hoping that the Education and Skills
Committee review that is taking place, and the Ofsted thematic
inspection will also highlight what needs to be done in a constant
monitoring review. I 
<br><notus-date day="24" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>24 May 2006 : Column 1510</b><br>learned as Secretary of State that monitoring is even more necessary
than vision or legislation in order to achieve anything. That was the
point that I was going to make about the 2001 Act&#151;we left it
with a hope and prayer that people would do the right thing, but
limited progress has been made in the past five
years.</p><p><a name="06052453000402">In supporting
schools with a high number of special educational needs pupils, we need
to recognise the point that has been made this afternoon that such
needs can be passed from one generation to another, not just
genetically but through the gross reinforcement of disadvantage that
often leads to the exaggeration and emphasis of special educational
need.</p><p><a name="06052453000403">I found out
that two of my older sons had quite severe dyslexia at a time when the
teaching profession dismissed dyslexia as though it were a middle-class
fad. Because I was emerging into the middle class and have always been
tenacious, I managed to engage with the Dyslexia Institute&#151;it
has now changed its name&#151;which did a superb job in finding out
what was wrong. I do not think that my sons would mind me saying that
the change in confidence, self-esteem and behaviour was dramatic once
what was required was identified. Early identification, sensible
assessment, proper decision making about the right environment, and
training and support for teachers are all more important than any
disagreement over whether an individual school should close. I hope
that that will be the message from today&#146;s
debate.</p><p><a name="06052453000404"><b><a name="06052453003841">Mrs.
Dorries:</b> We have all been elected to represent the most
disadvantaged in our constituencies. From that perspective, and in the
spirit of consensus, I hope that the Minister will accept that any
points that I make are not party political but made with the view of
representing those of my constituents in the unfortunate position of
not receiving appropriate educational provision.</p><p><a name="06052453000405">I wish to speak about new
clause 5, with brief reference to new clause 4. I notice that the
Minister mentioned the number of schools that the Conservative
Government closed before 1997, and he was right to do so. All
Governments have made mistakes in education, and it is about time we
all started getting it right. However, I am reminded of the point made
by Baroness Warnock when she described the need to close down special
schools because too many children were being isolated in special
provision. She said that the pendulum had swung too far. Perhaps not
all those 200 schools needed to close, but too many have and that has
resulted in a crisis, which is why hon. Members are receiving so many
representations on the issue.</p><p><a name="06052453000406">One of the organisations with
which I liaise contacted me this morning and asked me to make a point
about something that the Minister said yesterday. I have not had a
chance to check <i> Hansard</i> yet and I was not in my place when it
was said, but the organisation said that the Government referred to the
school admissions code as a panacea to protect the rights of children
who benefit from a statement of special educational needs, but we
should all be aware by now that the protection of children with
statements of special educational needs is not dictated by
the 
<br><notus-date day="24" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>24 May 2006 : Column 1511</b><br>admissions code or the School Standards and Framework Act 1998, but by
the criteria specified in the Education Act 1996, especially schedule
27. I have now put that on the record on their behalf.</p><p><a name="06052453000407">The Minister mentioned the 300
schools that have opened, and I have tabled questions to ask where they
are and how many children they will take, because they are not in my
patch nor in those of the many people who have asked me to speak on
their behalf. It was fascinating to hear the hon. Member for Sheffield,
Hillsborough (Ms Smith) say that schools were opening in her area,
because I wish I had such provision in my constituency. Perhaps some
areas are better served than others, and the crisis arises in areas
that are poorly served. When things go wrong for a special needs child,
they can go spectacularly wrong, and that is why we tend to hear about
such issues in that way.</p><p><a name="06052453000408">The way in which many of our
SEN children are educated is described to me as a scandal. I do not
like to use that word, because it is emotive, but when we hear some of
the stories, such as that told by the hon. Member for Blackpool, South
about the little boy against the wall, we realise that it is shameful
that children are educated in such environments today. The hon.
Gentleman mentioned the statistic that two thirds of all excluded
children have special needs, including nine out of 10 of those excluded
from primary schools and six out of 10 from secondary
schools&#151;some 27 per cent. of autistic children. I prefer to use
the word &#147;expelled&#148; as do the organisations I talk to,
because it expresses the nub of the matter. I shall talk in a minute
about a six-year-old girl who has been excluded, but the reality is
that she has been expelled from future education. Can hon. Members
imagine the outcry if 27 per cent. of the generic school population was
excluded or expelled each day? There would be an outcry. Despite that,
special schools are still being
closed.</p><p><a name="06052453000409">When Lord
Adonis gave evidence to the Education and Skills Committee I asked him
whether the Government had a policy of inclusion, because I believe
that the inclusion agenda may be driving the closures. He said that
inclusion was the will of Parliament, which was a very strange answer.
I asked the Minister in Committee whether the Government had a policy
of inclusion, and he did not answer, so I ask again. Do the Government
have a policy of inclusion? That is the fundamental question in special
education today, and education authorities, parents and governors all
deserve to know.</p><p><a name="06052453000410">While the Government refuse to
confirm whether they have an inclusion agenda, there are policies in
the background that are driving forward and enabling that agenda. For
example, the Special Educational Needs and Disability Act 2001 states
quite
clearly:</p><a name="06052453003587"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;If a
statement is maintained under section 324 for the child he must be
educated in a mainstream school unless that is incompatible with the
wishes of the parents or the efficient education of
others&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="06052453000411">Those words lead
to the presumption that all children should be educated in the
mainstream, and they are backed up by the &#147;Removing Barriers to
Achievement&#148; document, which acts as a reinforcement to the
inclusion agenda.</p><p><a name="06052453000412">The
hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole (Annette Brooke) asked
whether the Secretary of State 
<br><notus-date day="24" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>24 May 2006 : Column 1512</b><br>is going in and closing down special schools. Of course he is not
walking into a special school and saying, &#147;This school closes
today&#148;, but LEAs are implementing policies that they believe are
the Government&#146;s agenda. LEAs are reluctant to statement
children or to refer them to special schools. In a neighbouring
constituency, referrals from the LEA have dried up completely since the
2001 Act. As a result, the local special school will be financially
unviable by the end of the educational year. Referrals have dried up
because the LEA is reluctant to statement. It believes that it is
carrying out the wishes of the Government and using the 2001 Act as its
justification not to statement or refer. It is also using the
&#147;Removing Barriers to Achievement&#148; document to back that
up.</p><p><a name="06052453000413"><b><a name="06052453003842">Kelvin

<p><a name="06052453000420"><b><a name="06052453003849">Mrs.
Dorries:</b> I thank my hon. Friend for rescuing me from my
difficulty.</p><p><a name="06052453000421">I want
the Minister to say whether the Government have a policy of inclusion,
because he may be aware of the 2020 group, whose sole purpose is to
ensure that all this country&#146;s special schools are closed by
2020. Its founder, Richard Reisner, told the Select Committee that the
group had been given &#163;460,000 in Government funding. Would an
organisation campaigning to keep special schools open be given an
equivalent amount of funding? By giving the money to that group, are
not the Government endorsing its
policy?</p><p><a name="06052453000422"><b><a name="06052453003850">Ms
Angela C. Smith:</b> I acknowledge the hon. Lady&#146;s kind
words about Labour Sheffield, but if the Government have weighted their
policy so heavily towards inclusion, why have authorities such as
Sheffield been able to develop such a broad spectrum of
provision?</p><p><a name="06052453000423"><b><a name="06052453003851">Mrs.
Dorries:</b> I am sure that the hon. Lady will not be
surprised to hear that I have absolutely no idea of what happens in
Sheffield.</p><p><a name="06052453000424"><b><a name="06052453003852">Dr.
Blackman-Woods:</b> Will the hon. Lady give
way?</p><p><a name="06052453000425"><b><a name="06052453003853">Mrs.
Dorries:</b> I wanted to mention a remark made to me yesterday
by a Labour Member, but I shall leave it till later, when it will be
more in context. She said that the policy was not the same in all areas
of the country. However, I shall give way
now.</p><p><a name="06052453000426"><b><a name="06052453003854">Dr.
Blackman-Woods:</b> Does the hon. Lady accept that the
Education Select Committee heard a lot of evidence from local
authorities? They are planning a range of provision to meet special
educational needs that involves special schools, mainstream schools and
special units in mainstream schools. The range of provision is becoming
wider all the
time.</p><p><a name="06052453000427"><b><a name="06052453003855">Mrs.
Dorries:</b> I agree that LEAs perform what is called
provision mapping, which works for some but not for others. The fact is
that 27 per cent. of children with autism are excluded from school
every day. Those are the national statistics, and they apply to all
LEAs, regardless of their provision policies.</p><p><a name="06052453000428">I hope that the Minister will
follow Baroness Warnock&#146;s lead in respect of inclusion and say,
when he replies to the debate, that he will not continue with the
policy. I have mentioned a little boy called Jack a number of times in
the House, and the one thing that I want him to take away from this
debate is the fact that the Minister mentioned his name in the
wind-up.</p><p><a name="06052453000429">Jack was the
first child to come to my surgery. He has special educational needs,
and on that visit he emptied my bookcase, turned my chairs upside-down
and fizzed the lights on and off. He was excluded from 
<br><notus-date day="24" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>24 May 2006 : Column 1514</b><br>school: his parents had taken him out of the school because the teachers
could not cope with his very specific needs. He was beginning to be
bullied, as happens to many autistic children in mainstream
schools.</p><p><a name="06052453000430">Jack now
attends the Moorhouse school, thanks to the fact that his well educated
and articulate parents were able to go to a SENDIST tribunal and argue
his case. He is flourishing there, but he offers a perfect example of
what happens when a child is placed in the wrong
school&#151;something that happens to many children in this
country.</p><p><a name="06052453000431">Some
children have very complex special needs because they have physical as
well as learning difficulties. I spoke recently to a teacher who has in
her class a child with severe disabilities. The funding associated with
that child has gone into the school pot, and the teacher has only a
teaching assistant to help her. She believes that the funding allocated
to a child should be velcroed to that child and used only to help him
or her.</p><p><a name="06052453000432">The teacher
to whom I am referring gave evidence about her job which was used in a
recently published report. Once an hour, she has to suck out that
child&#146;s&#146; tracheotomy tube. She has to wash her hands, use
the suction machine to clear out the tracheotomy tube, then wash her
hands again and return to teaching the class. The process takes 10 or
15 minutes, every hour of her working day. Is that really something
that teachers should be doing, on top of trying to teach the other 28
children in the class the national curriculum? The teacher has had
training only from the child&#146;s parents. She has had no
specialist instruction, not even in how to lift the child. Is that to
be the role of teachers? Do the Government expect them all to have a
special needs child in their
classes?</p><p><a name="06052453000433">I shall
conclude by quoting the evidence that Baroness Warnock gave to the
Select Committee, which reinforces my belief that LEAs are driving
forward a policy of inclusion. Although the Bill emphasises parental
choice as the great good, Baroness Warnock
said:</p><a name="06052453003589"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;I think
that produces a hollow laugh on the part of parents with children with
disabilities because they have no choice. Everything depends on the
assessment that their child gets and it is the local authority which
conducts the assessment and also has to pay the money and naturally the
parents do not believe the assessment is truthful because it is pitched
as low as the local authorities can get away with because of the money.
They really have...no
choice.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06052453000434">Parents
of children with special needs do not have any choices. It is sad that
special schools are being closed, and I hope that the Minister will
assure the House that the inclusion agenda will be
abandoned.</p><p><a name="06052453000435"><b><a name="06052453003856">Jim
Knight:</b> This has been a good debate, which deserves more
than seven minutes for my response. It is occasionally a frustration of
ministerial life that we do not have anything near as much time as the
Opposition or Back Benchers when we
respond.</p><p><a name="06052453000436">I think that
we are agreed on both sides of the House that we need a range of
provision to deliver for the range of children&#146;s needs. We all
agree that there is more to be done, but the picture is in shades of
grey 
<br><notus-date day="24" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>24 May 2006 : Column 1515</b><br>rather than the black and white presented by the hon. Member for South
Holland and The Deepings (Mr.
Hayes).</p><p><a name="06052453000437">I shall say a
few words about Government policy. Schools and local authorities
already have clear duties in relation to children with special
educational needs and disabilities. Our policy is to achieve better
outcomes for those children by ensuring that provision is tailored to
individual needs and that all children have access to a broad and
relevant education and maximum engagement with their peers. In that
respect, I point out to the hon. Member for Mid-Bedfordshire (Mrs.
Dorries), there is inclusion, but I am mindful that, as my right hon.
Friend the Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett) said,
inclusion is a good aspiration but it has to deliver appropriate
education for every child, which may be in a special
school.</p><p><a name="06052453000438">Our policy is
also that agencies work together to provide children and families with
co-ordinated services. We see the fruits of that in high-quality
teaching and learning, in children&#146;s centres and extended
schools and in better arrangements for accountability for the outcomes
achieved by different groups of pupils in the new relationship with
schools.</p><p><a name="06052453000439">We are
backing that change with real investment. Funding per pupil with SEN
has increased by nearly 40 per cent. in real terms. Budgeted
expenditure by local authorities is &#163;4.1 billion, about 13 per
cent. of all education spending, and the building schools for the
future programme is delivering better schools and facilities for those
children.</p><p><a name="06052453000440">Ofsted
reports improved local management of SEN, growing awareness of the
benefits of inclusion and some improvements in practice. It also notes
that many of the children with the most complex needs are in special
schools or other specialist provision. I used statistics about those
schools in an intervention during the speech of the hon. Member for
South Holland and The Deepings: all 300 of those schools are new; they
are not units added to existing schools. Contrary to what is reported
in the media, they demonstrate our commitment to special schools
alongside mainstream
provision.</p><p><a name="06052453000441"><b><a name="06052453003857">Mr.
Hayes:</b> Will the Minister give
way?</p><p><a name="06052453000442"><b><a name="06052453003858">Jim
Knight:</b> I can respond to interventions or to the
debate&#151;I am in the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
hands.</p><p><a name="06052453000443"><b><a name="06052453003859">Mr.
Hayes:</b> I thank the hon. Gentleman and I take his point,
but will he tell us why in 2001 the Government dropped the provision in
the Education Act 1996 that special education should be related to the
learning difficulty of the child? Why did they drop the appropriateness
provision in that
Act?</p><p><a name="06052453000444"><b><a name="06052453003860">Jim
Knight:</b> I cannot give the hon. Gentleman a precise answer
because I was not an Education Minister at the time. I can only imagine
that it was because the provisions that were already in place and that
we had introduced were delivering what he
described.</p><p><a name="06052453000445">The
proportion of children with SEN statements and taught in special
schools has increased by about 1 per cent. over the past five years,
despite a fall in the 
<br><notus-date day="24" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>24 May 2006 : Column 1516</b><br>total number of children with statements. We are not an anti-special
school Government. We want children&#146;s special educational needs
to be met so that, as far as possible, exclusions are unnecessary.
Through our long-term SEN strategy, we are working to build the skills
and capacity of schools to meet children&#146;s special educational
needs earlier and more
effectively.</p><p><a name="06052453000446">We are
mindful, however, that the Select Committee on Education and Skills is
looking into SEN and we want time to consider the outcome of its
inquiry. The Bill will go into another place after a very good debate,
although I cannot respond to the amendments or the various
contributions that have been made. My noble Friend, Lord Adonis, has
met my hon. Friends the Members for Blackpool, South (Mr. Marsden) and
for Kingswood (Roger Berry) and we shall continue such
engagement.</p><p><a name="06052453000447">We will
continue to listen to the House and to try to improve things. I am
particularly impatient about the exclusion figures for children with
special educational needs. It is not right that two thirds of excluded
children have special education needs. The issue should not divide us;
we should all work together to resolve
it.</p><p><a name="06052453000448"><b><a name="06052453003861">Mr.
Hayes:</b> This has been a good debate, albeit a short one. It
has illustrated the strong feelings on the subject on both sides of the
House and perhaps, as various Members have said, that we need more time
to debate the issues over the coming weeks and months. I hope that the
Government will make more time for
that.</p><p><a name="06052453000449">I do
not have time to deal with all the points that were raised in the
debate, but important things need amplification. Of course, the
continuing and particular role played by special schools must be
defended, but non-statemented special needs must be given closer
consideration, as was pointed out. As the hon. Member for Blackpool,
South (Mr. Marsden) said, we need to look at the training and resources
provided to our teachers to educate children who are especially
vulnerable and have particular needs. Where schools are doing the right
thing they need our support, whether they are mainstream or special
schools. As my hon. Friend the Member for Upminster (Angela Watkinson)
said, that means providing the services of speech and language
specialists and educational
psychologists.</p><p><a name="06052453000450">This
has been a good debate. I am determined that the Opposition will
continue to fight the battle on behalf of special needs children. We
will continue to defend special schools. We will not relent in
defending those vulnerable people. I hope other Members will join
us.</p><p><a name="06052453000451"><i> It being two

Teather:</b> The amendments relate to what is probably the
most controversial aspect of our debate. What has concerned many people
is the proposal in the Bill and in its forerunner, the White Paper, to
give schools more freedom to control their admissions. People are
worried about that because all the evidence suggests that when we give
schools that freedom, over time they tend to move towards choosing the
brighter children and the more middle-class
children.</p><br><notus-date day="24" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>24 May 2006 : Column 1530</b><br><p><a name="06052453001534">I am certain that hon. Members
will have constituency examples of when that is not the case, and I
would not want to say that that is what happens in all schools, because
clearly it does not. However, the worry is that the evidence suggests
that, on the whole, schools will use that power to choose those
children because of the pressure to drive up standards, particularly in
the light of league tables. We have seen evidence from the Sutton
Trust, Simon Burgess from the university of Bristol, and Rebecca Allen
from the Institute of Education, and it all suggests the same
outcome.</p><p><a name="06052453001535">In response
to that widespread concern, hon. Members&#151;certainly Liberal
Democrat and, in particular, Labour Members, if not Conservative
Members&#151;put pressure on the Government, who responded by
changing the proposals in the White Paper so that the Bill now states
that all admissions authorities should act in accordance with the code
of admissions, rather than just having to have regard to that code.
That was a welcome change.</p><p><a name="06052453001536">The draft school legal code was
published while the Bill was in Committee and was debated extensively
in Committee. It touched on many things that worried me and was a
welcome addition. Some things in it are very good. They include the ban
on interviewing and prioritising children in care and those with a
statement of special educational needs. However, I particularly
welcomed the focus on the softer aspects, such as the tendency for
schools to put poorer families off applying by advertising expensive
trips and expensive uniforms and, specifically, for schools to use
information known about a family gained through either brothers or
sisters attending the same school or through parent open
evenings.</p><a name="06052453003560"><p>The
difficulty with many of those things is that they require a subjective
judgment about whether the school has used that information in coming
to a decision on admissions. My fears were fuelled by an ICM poll
published in the press a few months ago, which suggested that one in
four head teachers cheat on their selection criteria to cherry-pick
pupils. The latter aspect of that concerned me most: they were quite
specific that they do it to cherry-pick pupils. If a head teacher
cheats, that undermines trust in the system. It undermines the trust of
parents, students and other schools in the same local authority area.
Above all, it undermines the Government&#146;s good work and their
efforts to improve admissions and tackle covert selection by
introducing a code that is welcome in many ways.</p><p><a name="06052453001537">The safest way to remove the
danger of cheating is to allow someone else to administer the system.
New clause 24 would allow schools to continue to set their own criteria
in accordance with the code. Under that code, admissions criteria must
be objective. They must not be subjective, and they must be easily
understood. However, if they are objective, why must the school
administer them? Anyone could do so, as they could be written down and
measured. It would be better to give the duty to an impartial body. The
local authority, which oversees and co-ordinates strategic provision,
is best placed to administer the system. It does not have any incentive
to cheat as it does not favour one school over another. It simply wants
all its schools to do well and to raise standards across the
area.</p><br><notus-date day="24" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>24 May 2006 : Column 1531</b><br><p><a name="06052453001538"><b><a name="06052453004901">Mr.
Graham Brady (Altrincham and Sale, West) (Con):</b> The hon.
Lady takes the view that local authorities do not have any reason to
favour one school over another in admissions. Does she accept that if a
school is undersubscribed the local authority may have an incentive to

Teather:</b> It would have to act in accordance with the code
and, indeed, with the selection criteria submitted by the schools and
admissions authorities. We have included a safety net so that if a
school believes that the administering authority has not administered
admissions in accordance with its own selection criteria, it can appeal
to the admission forum.
</p><p><a name="06052453001540"><b><a name="06052453004903">Mr.
Brady:</b> The hon. Lady appears to accept that the local
education authority may not be unbiased and impartial. Why, therefore,
is it is better at administering admissions than the school
itself?</p><p><a name="06052453001541"><b><a name="06052453004904">Sarah
Teather:</b> No, I do not accept that. The local authority is
far more likely than a school to be impartial, as it does not have an
incentive to favour one school over another or to improve the standard
of only a few schools. We have seen a great deal of evidence of
cheating by schools, so to increase confidence in the system we must
try to give the administration of the system to an impartial body. That
would help to iron out the problem of cheating to which Members have
drawn attention, including prior knowledge of the family. A
child&#146;s brothers and sisters may be pupils at the school, or
staff may have met parents at parents&#146; evenings. In Committee,
the hon. Member for Bury, North (Mr. Chaytor) highlighted the case of a

dozen contacts with the school before they submit an application. It is
therefore unreasonable to assume that a school would not have prior
knowledge of a family in such cases.</p><p><a name="06052453001542">New clause 24 proposes that
admissions criteria should be set by the relevant admissions authority,
whether the school or the local authority, in accordance with the code.
Those policies would then be submitted to a named local authority
officer, who administers admissions in accordance with the criteria.
Parents would apply centrally to the local authority, which would make
application a great deal easier. Obviously, this is not the case in
London, but in some areas parents are forced to submit applications to
successive schools. Parents would state their preferred school and the
authority would sort the applications, matching the children against
schools&#146; criteria.</p><p><a name="06052453001543"><b><a name="06052453004905">Jim

of applicants should be kept from the schools. Obviously, applicants
are not completely anonymous, as names are required for administrative
purposes, but the proposal would deal with the problem of cheating. The
local authority 
<br><notus-date day="24" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>24 May 2006 : Column 1532</b><br>would send acceptance letters to parents and inform schools of
decisions. Under the system, head teachers and governors would not see
the list of names, so they would not be able to pick out difficult
parents or children who are in trouble. In response to our debate in
Committee, we have added extra protection so that if schools believe
that the local authority has failed to administer the system in
accordance with the criteria, they can apply to the admission forum for
a review. I am sure that the hon. Member for Bury will speak to his new
clause 46, which is similar to our new clause. The Local Government
Association believes that the proposal would improve the transparency
of the system, and individual councils are enthusiastic about it.
Teaching unions have expressed concern about allowing schools more
freedom to set admissions. They, too, favour a more co-ordinated
system. New clause 24 allows schools to continue to set their own
criteria, but it removes the danger of
cheating.</p><p><a name="06052453001546">New clause
39 leaves decisions on selection at 11 to local discretion, but it
reverses the presumption in favour of selection, which would cease to
exist unless local people asked for it in a ballot. That is a sensible
way forward, and we shall support the proposal if it is pressed to a
vote. As all Front-Bench spokesmen no longer favour selection, and
would certainly not re-introduce it, I hope that, despite the fact that
the issue was once divisive, the proposal will unite the entire
House.</p><p><a name="06052453001547"><b><a name="06052453004907">Damian

for raising standards in our schools. That ideology is based on the
notion that the quality of a school is determined solely or largely by
the intake of the school. That is not true. What makes a good school is
the quality of the teaching, the quality of the head&#146;s

taken by the

believe that head teachers throughout the country are deliberately
manipulating their intakes to boost their results. There may be a small
number of exceptions to that premise, but I do not believe that it is
happening on a large scale. It is not possible to engineer an intake to
accurately reflect the local population to the last detail. I suspect
that most of those results are capricious, rather than deliberately
manipulated.</p><p><a name="06052453001557"><b><a name="06052453004912">Sarah

one. Even if head teachers are unprincipled and are manipulating their

irrelevant to the quality of the school. It is the teachers, the

better.</p><p><a name="06052453001560"><b><a name="06052453004915">Mr.

on their ability level and attainment before they arrived at the

made.</p><p><a name="06052453001561">I believe that,
at the vast majority of the 3,500 secondary schools, the intake is
largely irrelevant. If we ensure that all academic subjects taught in
the school are set or streamed by ability, the intake is even less
relevant, because if we ensure that classes are made up of children of
a similar ability, the ability levels elsewhere in the school have no
impact on that class. The problem in many of our comprehensive schools
is that the vast majority of academic lessons are taught in mixed
ability classes. According to Ofsted, 60 per cent. of lessons are in
mixed ability classes: 49 per cent. of English lessons, 69 per cent. of
geography lessons and 71 per cent. of history lessons are mixed
ability. Even in science, where setting is even more important, a third
of lessons take place in mixed ability
classes.</p><p><a name="06052453001562"><b><a name="06052453004916">Annette
Brooke:</b> Can the hon. Gentleman give us some indication of
the ages to which his figures relate? It is often difficult to set by
ability at age five, even when the children might be doing simple
science lessons. Does he agree that a whole range of subjects,
including PE and art, are perfect for social integration to take
place?</p><p><a name="06052453001563"><b><a name="06052453004917">Mr.

figures that I have cited are for secondary schools. Secondly, I am
talking only about academic subjects&#151;this is not about PE or any
other non-academic subject. We do not disagree on
that.</p><p><a name="06052453001564"><b><a name="06052453004918">Helen
Jones:</b> May I try to tease out some more precise figures
from the hon. Gentleman? Does he have any information on the age range
for which mixed ability teaching is used in secondary schools? It is
quite common for secondary schools to begin teaching subjects in mixed
ability classes and move to setting later on. That will affect his
percentages for subjects such as history, because all children will
take them to begin with, but fewer will do so once options are
chosen.</p><p><a name="06052453001565"><b><a name="06052453004919">Mr.
Gibb:</b> The hon. Lady could be making a valid point, but the
figures do not show that. She is right in that there is a slightly
higher proportion of mixed ability teaching in year 7, but it does not
vary much beyond that. In fact, in the GCSE year, it dips from the 
<br><notus-date day="24" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>24 May 2006 : Column 1535</b><br>previous year, so that there is less setting than in the year before.
Broadly speaking, it goes right across the five years of secondary
education and is not confined to year 7. Even if it were, that would be
an error too. We need to set and stream by academic subject in all
years in secondary
schools.</p><p><a name="06052453001566">Maths has the
highest proportion of lessons set by ability&#151;86 per cent. That
still means, if my maths is correct, that one in seven maths lessons in
comprehensive schools takes place in mixed ability classes. That is
very much a linear subject that should not be taught in mixed ability
classes. Again, this is not confined to year 7 classes.</p>

if one sets by ability and tailors the curriculum to each ability
grouping, with accelerated and enhanced curricula for the most
academically able sets, one will see a huge rise in educational
attainment in the top sets, with no falls in attainment in the lower
ability set. The research also shows a small rise in self-esteem in the
lower sets as pupils are given the time, space and attention to learn
rather than drowning in a mixed ability group. At the top end, there is
a small fall in self-esteem as bright pupils find themselves competing

Setting is by definition flexible&#151;that is how it differs from
streaming. The more homogenous a particular group of children is, the
easier it is to teach them and the better able one is to tailor the
curriculum to that particular set level. There is a philosophical
divide between us&#151;I will not be able to convince the hon.

general agreement across the House, and within the educational
fraternity, that setting is a good thing that should be used in all
academic subjects, does that mean that the Conservative party has now
ceased to advocate grammar schools and selection by ability? If we
followed his thesis, we would not need

prescriptive methodologies for determining intakes do is substitute one
set of injustices for another. The genuine problem is that there are
simply not enough good schools. If there were more good schools, the
heartache and anger of parents who are unable to get their child into
their preferred option would be less.
</p><p><a name="06052453001573">The National Audit
Office report has been much cited in the two days of debate on Report.
It reported that 23 per cent. of secondary schools underperform and
that it is likely that a similar proportion is coasting. Ofsted reports
that 34 per cent. of secondary schools are no more than satisfactory
according to its grading system and that a further 10 per cent. are
inadequate. Forty-four per cent. of schools are therefore either
satisfactory, which we no longer regard as good enough, or inadequate.
That is a sad and alarming indictment of our education
system.</p><p><a name="06052453001574">No one claims
that the causes started in 1997, and they did not start under the
previous Conservative Government. They date back more than 40 years. We
all need to tackle the underlying causes in a practical and
non-ideological way. We must examine the evidence of what works and not
what fits our ideological stance. It is clear from the research
evidence and the success of schools that set that, when comprehensive
schools set all their academic subjects by ability in all year
groups&#151;with flexibility, so that children who develop later in a
subject can move up to a higher ability group&#151;and have smaller
classes with more experienced teachers focusing on the lower attainment
groups, far-reaching improvements occur in the quality of education in
those schools.</p><p><a name="06052453001575">If we
can recreate in the top sets the academic education that grammar
schools and many independent schools offer their pupils&#151;an
education that stretches children academically and enables them to
fulfil their educational potential with an enhanced or accelerated
curriculum&#151;there is no need to undergo the upheaval of
reintroducing the 11-plus and selection, and re-establishing grammar

11-plus because a grammar stream will be created in an alleged
comprehensive school. That is why I questioned the hon. Gentleman
closely earlier. I am sure that the hon. Member for Gainsborough (Mr.
Leigh) will be delighted by the news, but we should warn the general
public that that is what the Conservative party intends. It is not
right. Children could be prevented from going further and faster by the
policies that the hon. Gentleman proposes because they would be
excluded from the grammar stream.</p><p><a name="06052453001577"><b><a name="06052453004925">Mr.
Gibb:</b> No, I do not propose that. We are trying to create a
grammar school sort of education for the top sets in a school. Because
the school would be on one campus with a setted structure, there is
flexibility so that children who might have gone to a secondary modern
at 11 but develop later, when they are 13 or 14, can move up the sets
into the grammar stream. The grammar stream would not have a glass
ceiling, which prevents children below from getting into it. There
would be flexibility. Children could well be in the 
<br><notus-date day="24" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>24 May 2006 : Column 1537</b><br>grammar stream for English but not maths. The purpose is to enable us to
have the grammar school type education that the country needs but to
make it flexible so that children of all abilities can move into those
sets if they develop. It is precisely the opposite of what the hon.

probably share the hon. Lady&#146;s view that the binary division
that took place at 11 with the 11-plus was socially divisive. It is
uncomfortable for me to see children who have been friends at primary
school being forced to attend separate campuses, with one turning right
at the end of the road and the other turning left. That is why the

introduced into the Bill as a result of pressure from the Labour
rebels, and following the Secretary of State&#146;s letter of 6
February to the Chairman of the Education and Skills Committee. In that
letter, she said:</p><a name="06052453003598"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;As you know it has
always been our intention that the Code of Practice on admissions
should have real force.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06052453001599">She then said,</p><a name="06052453003599"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;we are concerned that recent
legal judgements may have weakened the perceived force of the Code, so
we will close the legal loophole so that admission authorities must
&#145;act in accordance&#146; with it, rather than having to have
&#145;regard&#146; to
it.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06052453001600">On the first of
those assertions, I looked in vain in the White Paper for a reference
to the code having real force. The nearest I could find was at
paragraph 3.22, which states;</p><a name="06052453003600"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;No one approach towards
admissions will work in all circumstances. This is why we want to
ensure that all self-governing schools...are free to use the
approach to fair admissions that they think will best meet their local
circumstances, as long as it is compatible with the Admissions
Code.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06052453001601">Of course, in all
their radio, television and newspaper interviews in the period between
the publication of the White Paper in October last year and the
concession letter of 6 February this year, the Prime Minister and the
then Secretary of State categorically ruled out giving the code of
practice any more compulsion than it already had. As the Prime Minister
said at his press conference on 23 January:</p><a name="06052453003601"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;I can&#146;t agree,
for the reasons we have given on many occasions, that this code becomes
statutory&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="06052453001602">The
second slightly misleading statement in the letter of 6 February is
that the change of heart was prompted by recent legal judgments that
may have weakened the perceived force of the code. The implication is
that those legal judgments occurred after the publication of the White
Paper in 2005, hence the need for a last-minute change of mind. The
case of the London Oratory school was decided on 17 December 2004, some
10 months before the publication of the White Paper. The truth is that
it is simply an unnecessary concession made for internal Labour party
management reasons and has nothing to do with what the Prime Minister
or the then Secretary of State thought, in their best judgment, was in
the best interests of the education system.</p><p><a name="06052453001603">We believe that clause 37 is
far too prescriptive and that circumstances not envisaged by the
drafters of the code might require more flexibility. For instance, it
should be permissible for a school to refuse admission to a child whose
parents refuse to sign a home-school agreement. We agree with the White
Paper at paragraph 3.25, which states:</p><a name="06052453003602"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;We recognise that no
form of admissions arrangements can increase the number of places at an
oversubscribed school. That is why we are continuing to increase the
number of good schools and the number of places in good
schools.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06052453001604">That should be
the focus of our attention rather than the over-obsession with
admission arrangements.</p><p><a name="06052453001605">I also agree with the Prime
Minister, who was absolutely right when he said on 24
October:</p><a name="06052453003603"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Local authority efforts
to create equity often produced deadening uniformity, with
child-centred learning and a rigid adherence to mixed ability teaching
too often failing to raise expectations and meet basic
standards.&#148;</p></ul><br><notus-date day="24" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>24 May 2006 : Column 1540</b><br><p><a name="06052453001606">The focus of an incoming Conservative

set flexibly but comprehensively&#151;not rigidly&#151;within a
school, all the upheaval involved in returning to selection would not
be necessary. We need to make sure that many of our comprehensive
schools have an enhanced and accelerated curriculum that stretches the
brightest children. In too many comprehensive schools, that is not
happening. We are concerned about standards in schools, and we think
that the best approach is universal setting in our comprehensive
schools.</p><p><a name="06052453001609">I believe
that parents want concentration on standards in our schools. They want
more good schools and they want their local school to be a good school.
That, rather than developing ever more complex and prescriptive
admission arrangements designed to allocate a dwindling number of good
school places, will be our focus. That is why we will move amendment
No. 104 at the appropriate moment, and I hope that it will have the
support of the whole

David Chaytor (Bury, North) (Lab):</b> I shall speak to the
group of amendments tabled by myself, but may I say first that I agreed
completely with many aspects of what the hon. Member for Bognor Regis
and Littlehampton (Mr. Gibb) said? He provided a powerful critique of
selective admissions systems, which will also underpin my own argument
in support of new clause 39. I am therefore extremely grateful to the
hon. Gentleman for making those points.</p><p><a name="06052453001611">Today&#146;s debate,
furthermore, could not have taken place without the Conservative
party&#146;s dramatic switch of policy over selection earlier this
year. My hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle-under-Lyme (Paul
Farrelly) asked why that happened, and it may well have been due to the
authoritative YouGov poll published in <i> The Daily Telegraph</i> last
December, which showed that only 20 per cent. of parents supported
selective admissions policies to secondary schools. That amounts to
focus-group policy making with vengeance, but I am delighted that the
Conservatives have listened to the focus group that <i> The Daily
Telegraph</i> offered them.</p><p><a name="06052453001612">I shall speak mainly to new
clause 39 and briefly to new clauses 40, 41, 42, 43, 45, 46 and 47 in
reverse order. New clause 47 argues the case for bringing academies
into the overall admissions arrangements of other schools. New clause
46 is similar to new clause 42, which was tabled by the hon. Member for
Brent, East (Sarah Teather), but the latter has the advantage of
dealing specifically with anonymised admissions.</p><br><notus-date day="24" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>24 May 2006 : Column 1541</b><br><p><a name="06052453001613">New clause 45 raises the
question of the local educational authority&#146;s role as the
co-ordinator of local admissions arrangements and the monitor of
compliance with them. I feel slightly ambiguous about it because I was
one of the first to argue that the admissions forums should have a new
enhanced power to monitor compliance. I am very pleased to say that
that is now in the Bill and I am grateful to the Government for
including it. I would still like to test the argument and I hope that
the Minister will think further about it in due course. Perhaps we
should ensure that the admissions forum has the full support of the
LEA, particularly in respect of secretarial and administrative
functions.</p><p><a name="06052453001614">New clauses
43 and 42 simply place within the Bill the admissions criteria that are
deemed to be either acceptable or unacceptable in the current code of
practice. There has been a long-standing debate about whether the code
of practice or elements of it should be incorporated into the Bill,
perhaps as a schedule, and these new clauses make the argument for
having a full list of approved over-subscription criteria&#151;not
non-permitted criteria&#151;placed directly in the Bill. We have
already established a precedent for doing so with some
over-subscription criteria: for example, we have agreed that the ban on
interviewing, the priority given to children in public care and the
promotion of banding should all be in the Bill, so it is illogical if
other approved criteria are not in it.</p><p><a name="06052453001615">New clause 41 is consequential
on new clause 40, which argues, given that the Bill brings about
significant changes to admissions arrangements, that we should
establish, six months after the passing of the Act, an independent
review body to monitor and assess the operation of all aspects of
admissions arrangements across the country.</p><p><a name="06052453001616">I wish to speak at slightly
greater length to new clause 39 and I intend to press it to a vote. The
new clause deals almost entirely with process rather than with the
arguments between supporters and opponents of selection. An argument
about process can take place now only because, for the first time in
more than 30 years, we have a consensus between the three main
political parties about not returning to selective admissions policies
as an organising principle of secondary education in this country. For
that, I am hugely grateful to the leader of the Conservative party, who
changed the policy earlier this year. I believe that they have
listened&#151;</p><p><a name="06052453001617"><b><a name="06052453004937">Ian

Chaytor:</b> No, they have listened carefully to the arguments
and considered the evidence about the impact of selective admissions
policies. What new clause 39 does is to deal simply with the anomaly
that is left. If all three parties accept that a return to the
universal 11-plus system is not acceptable because of the various
disadvantages of which we are all aware and about which I shall say
more later, it remains completely inconsistent that we should support
that system in the 36 English local education authorities where it
still applies. I do not argue that there is a simple solution, and I do
not argue that the 
<br><notus-date day="24" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>24 May 2006 : Column 1542</b><br>Government should simply decide to change things overnight. The purpose
of my new clause is to suggest a process whereby the remaining
anomalies in the 15 wholly selective areas and the 36 areas that
contain large elements of selection can be
resolved.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06052453003635">4
pm</h5><p><a name="06052453001619">At the heart of
the issue is the fact that it can be resolved neither by local people
alone nor by national Government alone. New clause 39 suggests that the
Government establish a clear principle, namely that selection is not a
desirable form of admission to secondary education, and that they set
an end date beyond which selection will no longer be permitted. It
proposes 2010 as the end date. At the same time, it allows the current
ballot arrangements to be maintained. Parents would be able to engage
in debate locally, consider the alternatives and express their views,
and would have the right to vote to reintroduce selection if they were
so minded.</p><p><a name="06052453001620"><b><a name="06052453004939">Mr.
Willis:</b> Let me add my voice to the consensus to which the
hon. Gentleman alluded.</p><p><a name="06052453001621">The School Standards and
Framework Act 1998, which introduced the current arrangements for
balloting to take a grammar school out of the selective process and
recreate it as a comprehensive, was deeply flawed. As the hon.
Gentleman knows, there has only been one ballot, involving Ripon
grammar school in north Yorkshire, and that process was deeply flawed
because of the nature of the constituency.</p><p><a name="06052453001622"><b><a name="06052453004940">Damian
Green:</b> What
happened?</p><p><a name="06052453001623"><b><a name="06052453004941">Mr.
Willis:</b> I have described what happened. The balloting
arrangements are deeply flawed: the hon. Gentleman and I agree on that.
The hon. Member for Bury, North (Mr. Chaytor) has said that under his
new clause the same arrangements would apply. If that is so, the same
flawed system determining who can vote would be transferred to this
Bill. I think it is appalling that the vast majority of people in the
community surrounding a grammar school do not have a say, although it
is their local school.</p><p><a name="06052453001624"><b><a name="06052453004942">Mr.
Chaytor:</b> The hon. Gentleman has raised an important point.
He has rightly forced me to clarify my point about the balloting
arrangements. Under new clause 39, there would still be a ballot, but
the new clause says nothing about the details of the arrangements. I
agree that the current ballot regulations are unfortunate. They are
designed to protect the status quo, are limited in terms of how they
describe the electorate and provide for different kinds of ballot
depending on local circumstances; on whether the area is wholly
selective, or is largely non-selective but contains individual
selective schools. Different rules apply in different circumstances,
but I think that the argument for reviewing the ballot regulations is
powerful. I hope that if the Government are minded to adopt the new
clause at some point, we shall in due course discuss the possibility of
a more democratic form of electorate and
procedure.</p><p><a name="06052453001625"><b><a name="06052453004943">Mr.

demonstrating a greater commitment to democracy than the hon. Member
for Harrogate and Knaresborough (Mr. Willis), but given his belief that
there should be a role for ballots and for democratic choice, why does
he not have the courage of his convictions? Why does new clause 39 not
allow the balloting process to be available to parents in areas
containing comprehensive schools that are
failing?</p><p><a name="06052453001626"><b><a name="06052453004944">Mr.
Chaytor:</b> The hon. Gentleman asked me the same question in
a Manchester BBC studio about two weeks ago. The answer I gave him then
is the answer I shall give him now. I am sympathetic to that argument,
for the simple reason that if the Conservative party in my constituency
went into the next general election arguing wholesale&#151;in a
ballot&#151;for the reintroduction of the system that was scrapped in
Bury 30 years ago and to which hardly anyone wishes to return, I should
be delighted to fight the election on those terms.</p><p><a name="06052453001627">The majority of my colleagues
would also welcome that opportunity. If we were to find that the
modern, newborn, compassionate Conservatives&#151;the friends of the
poor and the dispossessed&#151;were suddenly, in the next general
election, fighting ballots throughout the country to take us back to
the 1950s, we would be delighted. So the hon. Member for Altrincham and
Sale, West (Mr. Brady) makes an important point, and I am inclined to
table a handwritten amendment to that very
effect.</p><p><a name="06052453001628"><b><a name="06052453004945">Mr.
Brady:</b> I hope that the hon. Gentleman does, and I might
even be tempted to vote for it. However, surely those ballots ought not
to be fought by political parties. Is not his point that this is a
matter for parents to decide? If he believes that parents in areas that
are currently selective should be able to decide, why will not he give
a choice to parents in areas with failing comprehensives, who might
choose a grammar school?
</p><p><a name="06052453001629"><b><a name="06052453004946">Mr.
Chaytor:</b> The point is that the new clause would deal with
the remaining anomalies in the system. I take it as read that the three
main political parties have settled their argument about what happens
in the majority of the country. Of course, there is an internal debate
in the Tory party between those who deeply resent the change of policy
and those who are prepared to put up with it; but that is a matter for
the Tories, and I suggest that they go somewhere else and have that
internal debate.</p><p><a name="06052453001630">New
clause 39 has to be seen together with new clause 40. In retrospect, it
may have been preferable to incorporate the latter into the former,
because new clause 40 calls for an independent review of the admissions
arrangements. So the strength of the argument is simply this. If the
Government accepted the new clause, they would build on the all-party
consensus that no longer accepts selection as the organising principle
for admission to secondary education by following through the logic of
that consensus and establishing the end-date of 2010. Six months after
the Bill has been enacted, an independent review body would be
established to examine all aspects of our admissions arrangements, and
to study the evidence of the impact of admissions arrangements in
different parts of the country. The review body 
<br><notus-date day="24" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>24 May 2006 : Column 1544</b><br>would report before 2010, and we could then have an informed debate
based on evidence, not on ideology or prejudice. Parents would then
form their judgments in the light of that informed debate. That is
precisely why I am confident that if such a procedure were adopted,
very few parts of the country would choose to reintroduce
selection.</p><p><a name="06052453001631">It is
hugely significant that since the great change to our admissions
policies under the Labour Government between 1964 and 1970, and under
the Conservative Government between 1970 and 1974&#151;of course, we
all know which Tory Secretary of State was responsible for abolishing
more selection in our system than anybody else&#151;we have been
unable to have that informed debate.</p><p><a name="06052453001632">I draw an analogy with the way
in which we have tried to resolve other intractable problems when the
political parties have themselves found it difficult to reach
agreement. All the parties agreed that it was necessary to get a
neutral third-party expert to consider the funding of higher education,
and we invited Ron Dearing to take charge of the commission dealing
with HE funding. The Government did not accept everything in the
Dearing report, but it was subsequently considered to be the
authoritative body of evidence and argument, and now we all refer to
it. I am delighted that, in another of the Tories&#146; historic
flip-flops, they have adopted our policy on HE funding.</p><p><a name="06052453001633">I also draw attention to the
impact of the Tomlinson report on education reform for 14 to
19-year-olds. That issue was a political football that the parties
kicked about for a number of years. There was a desperate need for
consensus, and we resolved the problem by setting up an independent
review body under the chairmanship of Mike Tomlinson.
<i> [Interruption.]</i> No&#151;Mike Tomlinson suggested that there
would be a 10-year period of reform and change, and the Government have
taken the first steps as part of that reform.</p><p><a name="06052453001634">Let us move outside education
and consider the analogy of pensions policy, the implications of an
ageing work force, and the balance between the responsibilities of the
state, the individual and the employer. What did we do to deal with
that issue? We brought in a former president of the CBI and gave him
the task of building a national consensus on pensions policy.</p><p><a name="06052453001635">We can draw some lessons from
the Turner report. A few months ago, there was very little public
support for the raising of the state retirement age. Because of the
work of the Turner commission and the informed debate that followed the
publication of its report, the Government are now confident enough to
raise the retirement age and a majority of the public are in favour
because they now understand the arguments clearly. That is the best
analogy I can give for the way in which I would envisage new clause 40
operating, with an independent review body of admissions. We need a
neutral expert to lead the national debate and gather all the evidence.
With such a lead, we could kill off all the old sterile arguments about
which kind of school is best and how many A to C grades this school has
as opposed to that school. We could really focus on the impact of
selection in our system and, once we did so, people could form their
views accordingly.</p>

and they can correct me later&#151;that the Conservatives have
reached their new position because they understand that selective
admissions policies lower achievement overall. They understand, because
they have read the recently published evidence from Professor Jesson,
chief academic adviser to the Specialist Schools and Academies Trust;
because they have considered what the National Foundation for
Educational Research has been saying for many years; and because they
have read what the London Institute of Education has said. The
Conservatives know that the brightest children perform equally well, if
not slightly better, in all-ability schools than in selective schools.
They know that the impact of selection is to depress results overall;
to depress post-16 participation rates overall; and to increase levels
of segregation overall.</p><p><a name="06052453001637">The Tory party also knows the
differential between selective and non-selective schools, in respect of
the proportion of children on free schools meals. It is slightly over 1
per cent. in selective schools and almost 17 per cent. in the
population as a whole. Similar figures exist for children with special
educational needs and, in some parts of the country, from minority
ethnic groups&#151;an issue that has not been examined in the detail
that it deserves.</p><p><a name="06052453001638">The
Tories also know what we find if we compare Northern Ireland, the most
selected area with the highest levels of segregation, with Scotland,
with the least segregation; it compares favourably with the
Scandinavian countries that manage to combine equity and high
standards. In Northern Ireland, the number of adults in the population
who left school with no qualifications is twice the number for
Scotland. In Scotland, the number of adults in the work force with
degrees or degree-equivalent qualifications is almost 50 per cent.
higher than in Northern Ireland. That is the most dramatic evidence
that selective systems depress results overall, lower levels of
attainment and increase levels of social
segregation.</p><p><a name="06052453001639"><b><a name="06052453004947">Patrick

different ways to achieve an excellent academic education. That is
true, especially when one looks at what happens in the rest of

the schools in Holland are big comprehensives that contain
significantly different streams. In any given Dutch town, one can find
what is effectively a grammar school on the same site as a good
technical vocational school. Incidentally, it is the lack of the latter
schools that is the real, long-term failure of British
education.</p><p><a name="06052453001644">The German
approach is different, with different types of schools being provided.
Over the past 30 or 40 years, both countries have gone through good and
bad periods. Their results have been better than ours some of the time,
and at other times they have been worse, but both have managed to
ensure that debates about education have been about improving
children&#146;s life chances. They have not allowed them to deal in
social engineering, class warfare or any of the things that have
bedevilled education debates in this country. I am depressed to find
that those influences still affect our debates here.</p><p><a name="06052453001645">It is a shame that the hon.

to see whether my Liberal Democrat opponent in Ashford at the next
general election says the same thing, and whether his counterpart in
the neighbouring constituency of Folkestone and Hythe is pledged to
abolish the grammar schools in Folkestone. Over the years, I do not
remember Liberal Democrats ever saying such things in counties such as

precisely the point that I am
making.</p><p><a name="06052453001650">I oppose new
clause 39 because I saw the damaging effect of anti-grammar school
campaigns in the late 1990s and the early years of this century, both
in my constituency and across Kent. Those campaigns damaged all the
schools in the area, and not just grammar schools, because they
diverted effort, money, resources and energy from education. People who
should have been involved in improving school standards took up
opposing positions in destructive political campaigns that, in the end,
achieved nothing because they had no
support.</p><p><a name="06052453001651">In Kent, for
example, the Government&#146;s regulations meant that the
anti-grammar school campaigners needed 45,000 signatures to trigger a
ballot. When they set off, they were extremely confident that they
would achieve that number, but that was in the late 1990s heyday of new
Labour, when it was both new and popular. It is neither of those things
today.</p><p><a name="06052453001652">After months
of trying, however, the campaigners were forced to admit that they were
giving up, as they were able to raise only 7,000 signatures in the
whole of Kent. That was not just a failure, it was a pathetic failure.
Despite the opinion polls quoted by the hon. Member for Bury, North,
the campaign showed that the parents who knew most about education did
not want it to be disrupted. A majority of those parents would have
known that their children would go not to grammar schools but to the
high schools or comprehensives that we have in certain parts of Kent,
yet not only would they not vote to change the system, but they would
not even sign the petition to trigger a ballot.</p><p><a name="06052453001653">That is clear evidence, in
addition to the one ballot that actually did take place&#151;in
Ripon. The hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough (Mr. Willis)
could not even bring himself to say what happened, which was that when
parents were faced with a choice they voted to retain the existing
system. In Kent, which is a much larger area, parents did not even want
a ballot. However, the anti-grammar school campaigners came back again
and again, and the energies and efforts of too many people were spent
for too long on something that was not helpful to any school in the
area.</p><p><a name="06052453001654">I hope and
expect that the common sense of those on the Treasury Bench, including
the new Secretary of State, means that people of reason and common
sense on both sides of the House will vote against the new
clause&#151;against the hard left of the Labour party and their
natural allies, nowadays, in the Liberal Democrats. I am sure that they
will be defeated, because when parents have had the chance to speak
they have spoken loudly against that type of change. They do not want
to destroy the existing school
system.</p><p><a name="06052453001655"><b><a name="06052453004954">Gwyn

that they want the wholesale disruption of Kent schools; they all know
that is what would happen if he had his way. He says that the problem
is that the barrier to trigger the ballot was set too high. I have to
say, first, that that is a touch pathetic and, secondly, it was not a

but he had no support from the vast mass of parents in Kent, so he
should change tack and support different systems in different parts of
the country. I observe what happens in my constituency, as no doubt he
does in his. In my nearby constituency, schools work well together.
Ashford grammar schools and high schools co-operate in a forum; they
work together in an imaginative new cluster system. People do not care
whether they are working with a high school or a grammar school and
primary schools work with both. Educational standards, which need
improving, can be improved. Overall, the system works well for the
children from relatively poor backgrounds who can benefit from a highly
academic
education.</p><p><a name="06052453001662"><b><a name="06052453004959">Frank

what Conservatives do&#151;but what is the logic of saying that they

principle. Indeed, the Government whom he sporadically supports
occasionally say that they support that principle, too. They say that
they are in favour of local choice. I invite the Government to put
their words into practice and support local choice, as I think that

Green:</b> The hon. Gentleman is not listening to what I am
saying. I am not frightened of that, but I saw what happened after the
ballots were introduced under the School Standards and Framework Act
1998. There were years of disruption in Kent schools. People were not
spending enough time making the schools better. They were spending too
much of their time preparing themselves for a political campaign. I do
not want to go through that again and I do not want the schools to go
through that again.</p><p><a name="06052453001666">Every parent&#151;every
family&#151;should have choice, not just the well-off. One of the
more sensible things that the Government have said in recent years was
in their response to the Education and Skills Committee&#146;s report
on secondary schools admissions in November
2004:</p><a name="06052453003604"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The
Government wants all secondary schools to play to their strengths and
provide a flexible curriculum able to meet the needs of individual
pupils. Selection by aptitude allows a small number of pupils with
particular gifts and talents to benefit from particular curriculum
strengths.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06052453001667">I agree with
all of that. Where I part company from the Government is that I regard
all-round academic excellence as an aptitude, but I know that, for
historic reasons, they cannot adopt that view. I congratulate the hon.
Gentleman on his consistency. He disapproves of any kind of
differentiation. He wants all secondary schools to be the same and he
is completely consistent in that.</p><p><a name="06052453001668">I think that the Government
were right in that response and they are right to reject new clause 39.
I do not want to impose the system that obtains in Kent on other areas
of the country if they do not want it and I do not think that the hon.
Gentleman should want to impose his system on my constituents and the
schools in my constituency. I believe in local choice, and I demand
that local choice for parents in my locality. They have said clearly
that they admire the work done in all the schools in Ashford. They want
to keep the current system and they would hate political interference
driven by an out-of-date levelling down ideology to get in the way of
good schools. I urge the House to reject new clause
39.</p><p><a name="06052453001669"><b><a name="06052453004963">Ms

(Mr. Gibb). The new clause moved by the hon. Member for Brent, East
proposes an admissions policy that is based on a mistrust of head
teachers. That seems fundamentally flawed. We rely on the ability and
leadership provided by head teachers for the quality of what happens in
schools, so it would be wrong to have an admissions policy that assumed
that they were trying to cheat. I also think that, when we are trying
to encourage schools to build more links with their communities, it
would send mixed messages to say that they can have links at all times,
except where anything to do with admissions is concerned, when an
exclusion zone applies. The way in which that was presented was
completely false. The proposals made by the hon. Member for Bognor
Regis and Littlehampton were clearly a retrograde step and would undo
the progress that had been achieved by Labour Members.</p><p><a name="06052453001670">In opposing those new clauses,
I ask Ministers&#151;I have spoken to my hon. Friend the Minister for
Schools about this matter&#151;to give me some assurances about the
position on admissions in relation to a particular group of pupils:
those who have been excluded from school. They seem to have been missed
out of the present debate, although there are supposed to be some
provisions in the Bill for them.</p><p><a name="06052453001671">A school community can be
shaped by not only admissions, but exclusions. All of us who know of
schools that have opted out over the years, or entered into different
management arrangements, have often seen that accompanied by
large-scale exclusions. When I was a council leader in London, a school
became a city technology college under the then Conservative
Government. Its establishment as a CTC was accompanied by shedloads of
pupils being excluded, all of whom ended up at a neighbouring community
school. The situation had a profound impact on the community
school&#146;s ability to cope and its performance. Although we have
an admissions code, I am worried that it is not clear that the
priorities will also be applied to children who are excluded. I do not
want to end up with school communities shaped by not only admissions
policies, but exclusion policies&#151;in other words, selection by
behaviour, not
ability.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06052453003637">4.30
pm</h5><p><a name="06052453001672">I am especially
worried because we must consider the real ethnic impact of exclusions.
Segregation in schools has been profoundly damaging. Information from
the Office for National Statistics shows that permanent exclusion rates
are highest for children of Traveller Irish heritage, with a rate of 66
children in every 10,000. The rate for children of mixed ethnic origin
is 25 in every 10,000, which is much lower. The exclusion rate for
pupils of mixed ethnic origin and black pupils is similar, and it is
about twice the rate for white pupils. The figures are similar for
fixed-term exclusions. We also know that the peak point for exclusions
is for boys aged 13 and 14. Unless we are sure that those children can
get back into schools and that there is a code on, and sensible
arrangements for, their readmission to schools, we will run the risk of
finding that there is a drift of difficult children from schools that
abide by the consensus to those that decide for one reason or another
to be outside it.</p><br><notus-date day="24" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>24 May 2006 : Column 1551</b><br><p><a name="06052453001673"><b><a name="06052453004964">Mr.

turned down. I hope that the present attempt fails. I have two main
objections to banding. First, it derives from an ideology that dictates
that the quality of a school can only be determined by planning its
intake. People who push that philosophy do not believe that the success
of a school is determined by ethos, quality of teaching or leadership.
Banding is a substitute for making genuine improvements to a school. It
attempts to fiddle the figures, rather than address the problems

special needs they will not take any more. As a result, community
schools in the neighbourhood are affected. In Southwark, for example,
where the City of London academy is located, 62.2 per cent. of pupils
at neighbouring schools are children with special needs.
<i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> There is a table that shows how
many schools are affected&#151;it is not just one or two. Many
community schools in the area have far more
children&#151;</p><p><a name="06052453001708"><b><a name="06052453004989">Madam

Wilson:</b> My hon. Friend makes a very good point, and I am
sure that the Minister will respond later.</p><p><a name="06052453001710">Secondly, banding ultimately
takes children away from their local school. They are bussed to schools
in an extensive area for the sake of social engineering that diminishes
parental choice. I do not understand how that fits with the
LEA&#146;s responsibility under the Bill to champion parental choice.
I am sure that parents will not support the measure, so perhaps the
Minister can explain why he thinks they will do so. I have serious
concerns about whether banding will work effectively. The new clause,
the Bill, and the code of admissions do not give the number of bands
for good or best practice. Will there be a 10, five or three-band
system? Will all those systems be used, and will the number of bands
differ from school to school? Who decides the banding category? Is it
the governors, the LEA or another
authority?</p><p><a name="06052453001711">The
proposal has not been properly thought through. I instinctively oppose
anything that smacks of social engineering: clause 48 is an unnecessary
interference in local administration of schools, so it should be
removed. I hope that the Conservative spokesmen will press the matter
to a vote.</p><br><notus-date day="24" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>24 May 2006 : Column 1555</b><br><h5 align="left"><a name="06052453003638">4.45

Farrelly:</b> I, too, shall speak to the new clauses moved by
my hon. Friend the Member for Bury, North (Mr. Chaytor) which also bear
my name, and particularly new clause 39. I want to contribute also from
personal experience, as someone who was educated equally at a grammar
school and a comprehensive school. I was part of the generation that
went through the changes implemented by the then Labour Secretary of
State, Shirley Williams, and my school, Wolstanton county grammar
school, became the Marshlands comprehensive school in my fourth year,
when I was 15.</p><p><a name="06052453001713">I
speak, too, as someone representing a constituency where selection
remains very much part of the landscape. In 1997, as part of my rite of
passage, I contested Chesham and Amersham, that favourable ground for
Labour in Buckinghamshire, so I am familiar with a broad range of
opinion about the academic selection still practised in that
county.</p><p><a name="06052453001714">Before I begin
my remarks, I crave your indulgence, Madam Deputy Speaker, to take this
opportunity almost a decade after that election to pay tribute to the
late Keith Kingswood. Keith was the secretary of the Chesham and
Amersham constituency Labour party, a tough calling in an area where
for many people even new Labour conjured up the same fears as old
Vikings. Keith, a very erudite and educated man, was above all a
fervent opponent of academic selection all his life and a leading light
in the Campaign for State Education, CASE.</p>

<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060524/debtext/60524-0315.htm"/>


<p><a name="06052453001715">Sadly, during that election,
Keith died and was never able to see a new Labour Government. Such was
his dedication that he flew over to New York to see his son to register
a postal vote, of all things. During that visit, he contracted a
mystery virus and never recovered. In 1997, while many people were
still partying to the strains of &#147;Things can only get
better&#148;&#151;and they have&#151;on election night we went
quietly to bed and, with his family and widow Janet, laid Keith to rest
at his funeral the next
day.</p><p><a name="06052453001716">There is no
better tribute to Keith&#146;s lifelong efforts than the work done by
Comprehensive Future, by the Socialist Education Association, of which
I am a vice-chair, by my hon. Friend the Member for Bury, North, and by
dedicated educationists like Fiona Millar, in drafting and tabling the
new clauses.</p><p><a name="06052453001717">Of
course, we would all like the Government and my hon. Friend the
Minister for Schools to support the new clause or even allow a free
vote. After comments I have heard from many Labour Back-Bench
colleagues, Ministers and indeed some of the Whips, I have no doubt
that if there were a free vote, new clause 39 would be passed
today.</p><p><a name="06052453001718">I passed my
11-plus. I was also the only person in my year who did so and was
refused entry at a grammar school&#151;the Catholic grammar school of
choice&#151;because of a bad reference about my behaviour. The
Whips&#146; reach is long and I am still getting bad references now.
So I went to Wolstanton, which is a non-denominational school, where I
am now a governor, and in hindsight that did me the world of good,
because I do not think I was made for the Christian Brothers&#146;
discipline.</p><br><notus-date day="24" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>24 May 2006 : Column 1556</b><br><p><a name="06052453001719">I was distraught at the time,
however, and so were lots of children who, for whatever reason,
&#147;failed&#148;&#151;in inverted commas. That was the
language. There were good friends of mine who passed but went to the
secondary modern round the corner, the Blessed Thomas Maxwell, either
because other mates were going or because grammar schools were seen as
snobby and &#147;for them, not for us&#148;. And then there were
the kids&#151;and parents&#151;who at that age did not know, did
not care and did not have a clue. That was a disgraceful and divisive
way to run an education system&#151;to mark out large numbers of

Binley:</b> Thank you for that advice, Madam Deputy Speaker. I
take exception to those remarks. Does the hon. Gentleman not understand
that the secondary modern schools in many parts of the country gave a
very good education and set young people on a solid path to a good
future?</p><p><a name="06052453001723"><b><a name="06052453004995">Paul
Farrelly:</b> I congratulate the hon. Gentleman on his ascent.
He speaks eloquently, but perhaps he should listen more carefully. When
I used the word &#147;failure&#148;, I deliberately said &#147;in
inverted commas&#148;. That was the language. It should never again
be the
reality.</p><p><a name="06052453001724">Selection by
so-called academic ability through such a test is a throwback to the
days when education was in effect a privilege, not a right. When I was
young, the system acted at each stage as a sieve so that a small
minority could go to university. At each stage&#151;11-plus, CSE,
O-level and A-level&#151;those who did not make the grade were out:
they had &#147;failed&#148;. That was the language. Thank heaven
that, for most children, those days have
gone.</p><p><a name="06052453001725">There was no
proper vocational education at the local secondary modern. My two
brothers went there and left without many qualifications or any
preparation for working life whatsoever. In the 1980s, one of them went
through a succession of so-called youth training schemes, stacking
shelves, only to be &#147;let go&#148; days before his six months
were up, when the company was supposed to offer a permanent job. What a
great start to life that
was.</p><p><a name="06052453001726">I was fortunate
enough to start at a grammar school. However, there were hierarchies
among the grammars. There was a snobbery attached to the
grant-maintained schools, all of which locally opted out to become
private schools in the mid-1970s. Those hierarchies and snobberies
explain why many of us are suspicious about the Bill, which creates yet
another new class of schools&#151;trust schools.</p><p><a name="06052453001727">As I said, my grammar school
went comprehensive. That was a painful process because it involved the
merger of two schools&#151;a grammar and a secondary 
<br><notus-date day="24" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>24 May 2006 : Column 1557</b><br>modern&#151;but once the pain was over I do not remember Marshlands
high school being anything but the better for being a comprehensive. It
was far more balanced&#151;and we got girls for the first time, so
perhaps I was biased. There was certainly no attachment to the old
grammar school, the 11-plus and the all the disgraceful division
associated with it, and since then there has been no call from any
political party to go back to that system. However, the way in which it
was done left an echo of selection that remains divisive to this
day.</p><p><a name="06052453001728">That time of
reorganisation is full of great ironies. It is often said that the
Secretary of State who turned more grammars into comprehensives was
none other than Margaret Thatcher. And the Secretary of State who
presided over the biggest expansion of private education, at least in
my area, was a Labour Secretary of State who is now a Liberal Democrat
and whose mother, coincidentally, comes from
Newcastle-under-Lyme.</p><p><a name="06052453001729">It was wrong then, and it is
wrong now, that Labour has not followed through by fully addressing
academic selection at such a young age. New clause 39 would address
that historic anomaly, but not by imposition&#151;it would allow for
a ballot of parents of pupils and primary schools feeding grammar
schools.</p><p><a name="06052453001730"><b><a name="06052453004996">Mr.
Brady:</b> Does the hon. Gentleman share my concern that the
highest levels of independent education often occur in the areas that
have comprehensive schools, whereas the lowest levels often occur in
areas such as mine, which have extremely high-performing selective
education?</p><p><a name="06052453001731"><b><a name="06052453004997">Paul
Farrelly:</b> When I was at my comprehensive in
Newcastle-under-Lyme, I very much enjoyed going out to the ice rink at
Altrincham. I can speak only for my area, where the historical legacy
of the way in which the system was changed led to the expansion of
private education, not the existence de facto of comprehensive
schools.</p><p><a name="06052453001732">I want to
turn to the years before 1997 when I was campaigning in Chesham and
Amersham in Buckinghamshire with my good friend Keith and other
long-suffering Labour stalwarts such as my agent, Peter Ward. The area
has some great secondary schools&#151;high schools that are not
grammars, such as Chesham high school. However, it would be wrong to
say that as a result most parents to whom I spoke are happy with the
selective system&#151;quite the contrary. Many would welcome the
opportunity of a change, or a proper debate about change, which new
clause 39 would facilitate.</p><p><a name="06052453001733">None of us would be supporting
the new clauses if we did not believe that comprehensive education
levels up, not down. My hon. Friend the Member for Bury, North quoted
the evidence, which has remained unchallenged by Conservative Members.
But there is another factor that is often overlooked. Selective
schools, grammar and private, take out of the state system many of the
very parents who are most likely to agitate for and contribute to
better standards for every child in every school in every
community.</p><br><notus-date day="24" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>24 May 2006 : Column 1558</b><br><p><a name="06052453001734">I want to mention one another
overlooked factor. In 2000, when, much to the horror of some of my
former teachers, I became a governor of my old school, which is now
Wolstanton high school, I was taken aback by its size. It had 1,200
pupils, compared with 600 when I was there. Whereas before it had
teachers and form heads, it now had, like so many schools, senior
management teams and lots of the bureaucracy involved with
administering such a large establishment.

would say myopic&#151;view of the comprehensive ideal. Does he favour
it in its original incarnation&#151;one sort of school catering for
all abilities in one way&#151;or does he support the
Government&#146;s view of academies, specialist schools, trust
schools and a diversity of provision, whereby different children go to
different sorts of school, depending on where they
live?</p><p><a name="06052453001736"><b><a name="06052453004999">Paul

up, not down, for everybody. Again, I cite the evidence to which my
hon. Friend the Member for Bury, North referred. The Opposition have
not challenged
it.</p><p><a name="06052453001737">Labour Members
have rightly emphasised smaller class sizes. However, after so many
school mergers, the implications of school sizes for teaching and
attention to pupils and standards are often missing from the debate. I
hope that that will receive attention in
future.</p><p><a name="06052453001738">We want all
schools to be good schools, not factories, inclusive and not divisive,
and to level up, not down, for everyone. We want schools that improve
life chances for everyone, not only a minority, and we want all parents
to have a say. I therefore urge hon. Members, especially my hon. Friend
the Minister for Schools, to support new clause
39.</p><p><a name="06052453001739"><b><a name="06052453005000">Mr.

follow my hon. Friends who have spoken, especially my hon. Friend the
Member for Reading, East (Mr. Wilson), who obviously does an excellent
job not only for his constituents, but for education. One of the most
important aspects of his speech was a preparedness to talk about bad
schools. One of the most damaging things in education is the number of
people who find it convenient not to admit that bad schools exist. They
tend to ignore them and they get away with it. My hon. Friend mentioned
Reading local education authority&#146;s performance, with about 46
per cent. of children getting five or more good GCSEs. That is
unacceptable. The hon. Member for South Swindon (Anne Snelgrove)
intervened on him, and I believe that 50 per cent. of children in her
LEA obtain five or more good GCSEs. That is also unacceptable. Such

there is wholly selective and it would be an act of vandalism and
stupidity to disrupt and damage it.</p><p><a name="06052453001746">My hon. Friend the Member for
Ashford (Damian Green), who also represents an area with selective
education, made a point about the Liberal Democrats&#146;
contribution. I cannot resist picking up on that, especially given that
the hon. Member for Brent, East (Sarah Teather) is again in her place,
because my experience in Altrincham, like that of my hon. Friend in

he vote for the Bill, especially clause 36, which abolishes selection
by ability and limits the ability of other areas to benefit from the
fantastic schools that he
mentioned?</p><a name="06052453003561"><p><b><a name="06052453005006">Mr.

current Government and the future Government thankfully agree on one
issue&#151;the excellent education that is offered in my constituency

continue.</p><p><a name="06052453001748"><b><a name="06052453005007">Mr.

of course other measures that I would like to see in the Bill or
another education Bill. I have made that very clear.</p><p><a name="06052453001750">I was about to make a point
about the Liberal Democrats. My hon. Friend the Member for Ashford was
concerned about whether the Liberal Democrat candidate in Ashford would
be honest enough to communicate the position of the Liberal Democrats
on 
<br><notus-date day="24" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>24 May 2006 : Column 1560</b><br>these issues. Whether or not they do so, I would urge my hon. Friend to
do as I intend to do, which is to take it upon myself to inform the
local community of how the Liberal Democrats vote on the Bill today. It
is essential that people understand where the Liberal Democrats stand
on quality education, and I intend to ensure that they
do.</p><p><a name="06052453001751"><b><a name="06052453005009">Sarah
Teather:</b> When the hon. Gentleman makes that position

to exist if they were very popular in a particular
area.</p><p><a name="06052453001752"><b><a name="06052453005010">Mr.

were&#151;in which she made it clear that she opposed selection and
grammar schools. I will be happy to give way to her again if she wants
to make it clear that she in fact supports grammar schools and
selection; otherwise, I will rely on the remarks that she has already
placed on the record.</p><p><a name="06052453001753"><b><a name="06052453005011">Sarah

for the Liberal Democrats, this is a matter for local
discretion.</p><p><a name="06052453001755">The hon.
Member for Bury, North (Mr. Chaytor) has pointed out that we have had
this debate many times before, both inside and outside the House of
Commons. I know that his views are as sincerely held as mine. I believe
that he is profoundly mistaken, and he believes that I am. That is the
way in which debates ought to be conducted.</p><p><a name="06052453001756"><b><a name="06052453005013">Mr.

mistaken. I know that his majority depends on the parents who send
their children to Trafford grammar schools.</p><p><a name="06052453001757"><b><a name="06052453005014">Mr.
Brady:</b> Well, the hon. Gentleman may be right, but his
majority in Bury, North might prove more elusive than mine at the next
election. I would have much more faith in the arguments that he
advances&#151;especially his argument for the maintenance of the
balloting arrangement to mitigate the damage of his proposals&#151;if
he had put in his amendment a proposal that the ballots should be
extended more widely to other communities. As I said in an earlier
intervention, I might even have been tempted to vote for such a
proposal.</p><p><a name="06052453001758">I have no
doubt whatever that the situation in my constituency would be similar
to that in Kent, where the few campaigners against the grammar schools
could get nowhere near the 5 per cent. threshold necessary to trigger a
ballot. However, if such a ballot were to take place in my
constituency, I am confident that the majority in favour of preserving
the highest performing education system in the country would be at
least as great as it was when such a vote took place in Ripon, albeit
with a different type of electorate.</p><br><notus-date day="24" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>24 May 2006 : Column 1561</b><br><p><a name="06052453001759"><b><a name="06052453005015">Mr.
Chaytor:</b> In that case, why is the hon. Gentleman so
opposed to new clause 39? He should be supporting it, because it would
give him the opportunity to prove once and for all that his
pro-selection argument is supported by his constituents. Also, why is
he not arguing for ballots in the other parts of Greater
Manchester?</p><p><a name="06052453001760"><b><a name="06052453005016">Mr.

precisely that, and not just in Greater Manchester. I advanced that
case on Second Reading. I would be delighted if parents across the
country were given the freedom to choose on this issue. He asks why I
do not want to put this matter to the test in Trafford. He has already
pointed out his own test, which is the test provided by the electorate.
That is clearly why my majority has tripled in the past three general
elections and why we have now regained control of Trafford borough
council. Of course, if he were to advance the same cogent arguments
that I do on this subject, he might still be gracing the House with his
presence after the next general election, rather than merely until that
time. I wish that he would come over to our side on this
issue.</p><p><a name="06052453001761">The hon.
Gentleman talked about opinion polling, but he was slightly selective
in his choice of statistics. He referred to a YouGov poll, which
apparently took place last year, but did not allude to the ICM poll
that took place in March this year&#151;much more recently in the
context of the debate about this Bill&#151;which showed 70 per cent.
support for more grammar schools. That, however, is not really the
point. The fundamental point is what works in raising standards in
education. He did not explain in his opening remarks why the borough of
Trafford gets more than 70 per cent. of children through five or more
good GCSEs, whereas the borough of Bury, which he represents, gets only
58 per cent. through. I have been trying to get that explanation from
him for months if not years, so I would be delighted to listen to what
he has to say.</p><p><a name="06052453001762"><b><a name="06052453005017">Mr.
Chaytor:</b> If I did not explain that then, I shall explain
it now. The borough of Trafford sucks in children from the whole of
Greater Manchester, and the higher standards of Trafford are achieved
at the expense of lower standards in Manchester, Salford, Wigan,
Warrington and the county of Cheshire. It is
simple.</p><p><a name="06052453001763"><b><a name="06052453005018">Mr.
Brady:</b> I assure the hon. Gentleman that he does not know
my borough as well as I do. If he did, he would know that those who are
sucked in, as he put it, by the high-quality schools available in the
borough come in many cases from much more deprived areas, such as
Wythenshawe on the Manchester side of the boundary. I am afraid that
there is no cogency to the point that he makes.</p><p><a name="06052453001764">Similarly, the hon. Gentleman
alluded to the education system and performance in Northern Ireland
without, astonishingly, mentioning that Northern Ireland gets the best
GCSE results in the whole of the United Kingdom. It is scandalous that
the Government intend to proceed to abolish Northern Ireland&#146;s

Apparently, he is happy for Labour Ministers&#151;from a party that
is not even represented in Northern Ireland&#151;to act over the
heads of the people of Northern Ireland, the massive of majority of
whom, when there was consultation on the subject, supported keeping the
system as it is.</p><p><a name="06052453001765"><b><a name="06052453005019">Sammy
Wilson (East Antrim) (DUP):</b> Does the hon. Gentleman also
accept that the selective education system in Northern Ireland not only
provides better results but better social
mobility?</p><p><a name="06052453001766"><b><a name="06052453005020">Mr.
Brady:</b> I absolutely accept that it does, and that is also
the case in other areas that retain selective education. Of course, in
many areas where there are grammar schools, they are enormously
popular, especially with some ethnic minority populations, who find
them a way of raising their achievements and increasing their
opportunities in life.</p><p><a name="06052453001767">The hon. Member for Bury, North
talked about a consensus on this issue, and there is a sort of
consensus developing&#151;<i> [Interruption.] </i>He says from a
sedentary position that I am not part of it, and he may be right. It is
a funny kind of consensus, however. The Government and the Opposition
agree that existing grammar schools and selective areas should be left
alone because they work so well. My hon. Friendthe Member for
Bognor Regis and Littlehampton(Mr. Gibb) also made it clear
that the quality of education can be improved by teaching to a smaller
section of the ability range, which is why setting and streaming works
to raise standards in schools. Again, that is a point of consensus
between Government and Opposition.</p><a name="06052453003562"><p>In my view, that is also
a reason why academic selection between schools works, as my hon.
Friend generously acknowledged by paying tribute to Wellington high
school in my constituency, which gets outstanding results. It is not
the only high school that does so. Most high schools in Trafford, and
all those in my constituency, are achieving fantastic results and could
not be described in any sense as failing. They also perform
particularly well in the value-added league tables. Altrincham college
of arts, a high school in my constituency, is the best-performing
school in the borough of Trafford in that regard. As I also pointed out
to my hon. Friend, however, and as he accepted, the figures for
valued-added performance also show that grammar schools get remarkably
good results. That completely confounds the argument so often advanced
that grammar schools do well simply because they admit bright children.
They admit them, but they then raise standards of attainment even more
than other schools would have done. That is why, on the value-added
basis, 18 of the 21 best performing schools in the country for 11 to
14-year-olds are grammar schools.</p><p><a name="06052453001768">The high level of performance
in selective education authorities is shown in Trafford and across the
country in the value-added league tables. It is also shown in the
figures that I provided on Second Reading about standards from
high-performing LEAs at primary level being maintained into secondary
education. The comparison that I mentioned then was between Trafford
and the borough of Richmond-upon-Thames. 
<br><notus-date day="24" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>24 May 2006 : Column 1563</b><br>Trafford starts off being second in the country at primary level and
goes up to first place at secondary level; Richmond starts out first in
the country at primary level, slipping down to 65th place at secondary
level. The point is also borne out by the number of selective education
authorities that are at the top of the performance tables, year in,
year out.</p><p><a name="06052453001769">The first
part of the consensus is to keep selective education where it exists
because it works, and the second part is to maintain and increase
selection within schools also because it works. Almost everyone
believes that that is a way of raising educational standards within
comprehensive schools. However, another issue should be dealt with. It
relates to another part of the consensus, which appears to be that
there should be no more selective education, even if it would work. As
I made clear on Second Reading, I have no desire to impose a new system
nationwide. All the arguments about the dangers of disrupting selective
systems could be said to apply equally to comprehensive systems. It is
generally a bad thing to march in from Whitehall and attempt to reorder
and re-engineer the provision of local services by diktat. I would not
support that in any way, but I hope that we will, in time, move to a
more thoughtful and more open-minded consensus&#151;one built only on
what works and what parents want for their children. In doing so, we
will certainly defeat new clause 39, but I also hope that we will
endorse a much more diverse provision of education, which should
include some academically selective schools, especially in our
cities.</p><p><a name="06052453001770"><b><a name="06052453005021">Martin
Linton (Battersea) (Lab):</b> I shall speak briefly to
amendment No. 112, but I do not advise hon. Members to reach for the
amendment paper to see what it says because it is gobbledegook. What is
does, however, is to close an unintended loophole in the Schools
Standards and Framework Act 1998, under which an adjudicator could
increase the level of selection at a partially selective school back up
to the 1998 level. Thus, if a school selected 50 per cent. of its
pupils in 1998 and has since been instructed by the adjudicator to
decrease it to 25 per cent., it would be open to the adjudicator to
increase it back up to 50 per cent.</p><p><a name="06052453001771">If anyone thinks that that is
not what Parliament intended, I would agree, but Parliament only passes
the law and the judges decide what it means. In this case, Mr. Justice
Collins decided in the High Court a couple of years ago that the true
meaning of section 100 of the 1998 Act was not that there could be no
increase in selection, which is what we thought that it meant, but that
there could be no increase above the level that obtained in 1998. A
group of parents in my borough asked the adjudicator to increase
selection at two partially selective schools in the constituency of my
hon. Friend the Member for Tooting (Mr. Khan) from 25 to 50 per
cent.</p><p><a name="06052453001772">I am glad to
say that, on this occasion, the adjudicator did not accede to the
request, but she stated in her determination of September 2004
thatit would be within her power to agree an increase
to50 per cent. I put it to my hon. Friends that, if there
were such an increase from 25 to 50 per cent. in a partially selective
school, we could hardly view it as agreeing with our election promise
to have no new 
<br><notus-date day="24" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>24 May 2006 : Column 1564</b><br>selection. Indeed, we could hardly justify it by saying that it is not
an increase in comparison with 1998.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06052453003639">5.15

Khan:</b> Is not one of the problems that that loophole allows
the possibility of future sets of children and their parents being made
miserable by the annual wait for year 6 results? If a school is allowed
to increase from 25 to 50 per cent. those whom it selects by ability,
the number of those who come in because of their siblings, proximity or
special needs is
reduced.</p><p><a name="06052453001774"><b><a name="06052453005023">Martin
Linton:</b> I agree with my hon. Friend and constituency
neighbour, who knows all too well that the effect of selection in the
partially selective schools in constituency has a very big effect on
other parents of year 6 children in his constituency and, indeed, in
mine.</p><p><a name="06052453001775">Significantly,
the mistake was not made in the admissions code of practice, which does
not use the 1998 level as its benchmark but says that selection cannot
be raised if it has been continuous since that time. However, the code
of practice was not mandatory. Unfortunately, the 1998 Act causes the
problem. That Act was never intended to say what the judge says that it
meant. I spoke to my right hon. Friend the Member for Norwich, South
(Mr. Clarke), who was the Secretary of State for Education and Skills
when Mr. Justice Collins made his ruling, and I have a letter from his
Under-Secretary&#151;Stephen Twigg, whom we all miss, I am
sure&#151;who
wrote:</p><a name="06052453003606"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;It was
not widely expected that schools that had been compelled by the
Adjudicator to reduce the level of partial selection would be able to
raise it again. Nor was this our intent when we introduced this
provision.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06052453001776">The then
Minister went on to say
that</p><a name="06052453003607"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;we may want to
amend the School Standards and Framework Act at some time in the
future&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="06052453001777">The time has
come; the opportunity is
here.</p><p><a name="06052453001778">I raised the
issue with the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government
and I understood that she would consider it in Committee. It has not
yet been dealt with, so I have tabled an amendment that would deliver
what the School Standards and Framework Act 1998 intended, what we
meant when we said, &#147;No new selection&#148;, and what most of
my constituents and, I am sure, those of my hon. Friends are
expecting.</p><p><a name="06052453001779">My right
hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Education and Skills and the
Under-Secretary of State for Education and Skills, my hon. Friend the
Member for Corby (Phil Hope), both of whom were educated in my
constituency, will understand when I say that, when the 1998 Act was
passed, there was in my constituency one of the six lowest performing
schools in the country&#151;not the one that they went to&#151;and
its performance was worse than that of any school in Liverpool,
Manchester or Leeds. Since that Act was passed, that school has
dramatically improved its pass rate from 4 per cent. to more than 30
per cent., partly because the partially selective schools in the
neighbouring constituency were forced to stop taking the most
academically gifted children from our borough.</p><p><a name="06052453001780">The adjudicator forced those
schools to reduce academic selection in successive steps from 50 to 33
to 
<br><notus-date day="24" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>24 May 2006 : Column 1565</b><br>30 and then to 25 per cent. The head teacher and the staff of that
school, having rolled that heavy boulder up from the bottom of the hill
to the top, are now on the verge of a bright new future, as an academy.
I want to be able to assure them that that process will not be suddenly
reversed by an adjudicator who can decide to increase the proportion of
selective schools, with all the devastating consequences that that
would have for the other schools in the
borough.</p><p><a name="06052453001781">I wish to say
a brief word about new clause 39, tabled by my hon. Friend the Member
for Bury, North (Mr. Chaytor). I am a great admirer of the work that he
does with Comprehensive Future&#151;a total supporter&#151;and I
believe that it is important to keep hold of the fact that ballots in
fully selective areas of the country and adjudicators in respect of
areas with partially selective schools are the two means by which we
can gradually reduce and then I hope, one day, eliminate the use of
academic selection in secondary schools.</p><p><a name="06052453001782">I welcome the new cross-party
consensus&#151;although it does not appear to have reached all
Opposition Members&#151;the logical conclusion of which is that we
must make ballots and the adjudicator system work. With my brief
amendment, I am trying to ensure that the adjudicator system works in
the way that we intended. My hon. Friend is trying to improve the
ballots system, but I fear that putting the onus on supporters of
grammar schools to call for referendums may make it easer for them to
run &#147;Save our grammar schools&#148; and &#147;Vote no to
abolition&#148; campaigns, and to have the upper hand in referendums.
I am not convinced that reversing the current system and providing for
ballots opposing abolition would advance the cause that my hon. Friend
and I both support. For that reason I shall not vote for his new
clause, but I should like the Minister to say what the Government
intend to do about this
loophole.</p>

because I expected it and am therefore able to reject it.</p><p><a name="06052453001790">The Bill states that there can
be equal preference for admission, but that is not strictly true, and I
can cite a number of cases in which it has proved not to be true. A
school can include in its admissions policy the provision that, if it
is oversubscribed, it will have to choose from an excess of applicants.
It can give preference to those living in certain areas, and thus less
preference to those outside those areas; it can give preference to
children with a medical need, and thus less preference to those without
such need; and it can give preference to children with siblings already
at the school. So it is not quite right to say that equal preference
should be pursued.</p><p><a name="06052453001791">It
would be perfectly possible, within that framework, for school
governors to give preference to the admission of children of staff, and
that is what my new clause seeks to allow. It seeks to give preference
to teachers with one or two children whom they might wish to go to the
school in which they teach. There is good reason for that proposal. We
argue, again and again, that we want ladies, in particular, who have
had children and who have been teachers to return to
teaching.</p><p><a name="06052453001792"><b><a name="06052453005029">Ian

ignore it, and continue my remarks to the Secretary of State.</p><p><a name="06052453001794">There are ladies whom we want
to attract back to the profession. I believe that the new clause would
give ladies a major boost, and would help to attract them back to
teaching when their families are growing up. I ask the Secretary of
State to consider the new clause. I recognise that it is not the most
vital part of this debate, but it would help a number of teachers
returning to the profession, and it could well help in those areas
where we particularly need to attract experienced
teachers.</p><p><a name="06052453001795"><b><a name="06052453005031">Jim
Knight:</b> We have had a lively debate on school admissions.
The Bill creates a more equitable and transparent admissions process
for parents and children. Labour Members have always been opposed to
any extension of selection by academic ability, and the Bill reaffirms
that stance. I am delighted that we have now won the argument, with the
Opposition today agreeing that, far from having a grammar school in
every town, there should be no new selection. That is a great victory
for progressive politics. Perhaps thehon. Member for Bognor
Regis and Littlehampton (Mr. Gibb) will have to inform one or two of
his Back-Bench colleagues about that policy; they did not seem to be
that informed about it during the debate. Nevertheless, we welcome
it.</p><p><a name="06052453001796">It will be
unlawful for any school to introduce selection by ability to its
admission arrangements, or, if 
<br><notus-date day="24" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>24 May 2006 : Column 1567</b><br>it already selects part of its intake by ability, to increase its level
of selection. I shall address in a little while the points that my hon.
Friend the Member for Battersea (Martin Linton) made about that
issue.</p><p><a name="06052453001797">Schools that
set their own admissions arrangements need to know what is and is not
acceptable, so that parents are treated fairly. Clause 37 sets those
limits by creating a new, stronger schools admissions code with which
admissions authorities must act in accordance. The skeleton code that
was issued to Members in Committee and circulated among the educational
community has been widely welcomed. Opposition Members seek to
undermine the new, stronger code through amendments Nos. 103 and 104,
and I strongly urge the House to oppose
them.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06052453003640">5.30
pm</h5><p><a name="06052453001798">We will ban
interviews as part of the school admissions process. They have long
been perceived by many to be an unfair and subjective means of deciding
which applicants should be offered school places, and the provision
banning them has been widely welcomed.
</p><p><a name="06052453001799">Members in all parts
of the House asked for more to be done to give priority for admission
to looked-after children. I am delighted that in Committee, clauses 43
to 47 were inserted to give local authorities powers to direct the
admission of children in public care to appropriate schools, in order
to ensure that that most vulnerable group is not disadvantaged in the
admissions process. Of course, we have considered how schools and local
authorities can work together to ensure that admissions processes work
for parents, take account of local circumstances and do not restrict
fair access. We believe that we have provided helpful clarification,
and that the Bill&#146;s provisions will ensure a fairer admissions
process.</p><p><a name="06052453001800">New clauses
24 and 46 and amendment No. 95 illustrate the concern, shared by
Members in all parts of the House, that some admissions authorities
might not administer their arrangements fairly. The proposal is to give
local authorities or some other, more independent body responsibility
for allocating places to all maintained schools, by considering
applications against published admissions criteria.</p><p><a name="06052453001801">I fully appreciate
Members&#146; motives in proposing the new clauses and amendment, but
we are already taking the right steps to create a fairer admissions
system. We now have a single-form application via the local authority,
and we have created a robust system of checks and balances. Legislation
and the schools admissions code establish parameters within which
admissions arrangements must be set and operated. The schools
adjudicator and the Secretary of State both have a role to play in
dealing with complaints and objections. Under the current system,
individual admissions authorities are accountable for decisions to
permit or refuse admission to their schools. We do not want to change
that, particularly because they, as individual admissions authorities,
might be better placed to consider applications against their own
admission arrangements&#151;especially where they relate to faith
criteria or require an aptitude assessment.</p><p><a name="06052453001802">As I said in Committee, there
is nothing to prevent schools and local authorities from agreeing,
through their admissions forum, to take such an approach if 
<br><notus-date day="24" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>24 May 2006 : Column 1568</b><br>their admissions arrangements lend them to it. Indeed, I am interested
to know whether any areas are keen to pilot that approach, so that we
can learn from it. I hope that Members will accept that as a sign that
we are relatively relaxed about that approach, and that we do not feel
the need to include such a statutory requirement in the
Bill.</p><p><a name="06052453001803"><b><a name="06052453005032">Sarah
Teather:</b> When we discussed this issue in Committee, I
pointed out that there was no reason why faith criteria could not be
taken into account. A letter from a priest could be appended to an
application or a tick box could be added to the form to say what
criteria were required. We welcome the Minister&#146;s comments about
pilots, but will he actively encourage them or is he simply trying to
prevent us from voting against the
Bill?</p><p><a name="06052453001804"><b><a name="06052453005033">Jim

It would have to be with the agreement of the members of the forum. For
example, the faith communities would want to be happy with it and, at
the moment, some are cautious. They are certainly cautious about who is
best placed to make judgments about faith
criteria&#151;</p><p><a name="06052453001805"><b><a name="06052453005034">Mr.

Knight:</b> I cannot give my hon. Friend a definite commitment
on timescale. We have to allow time for the new admissions forums to be
set up in their new form. In many cases, they will be significantly
enlarged, and they need to identify the core members and elect the
chair. We need some time for the arrangements to bed in before we have
any idea about an accurate timetable. I fear that I might mislead my

concrete.</p><p><a name="06052453001807"><b><a name="06052453005036">Paul

Knight:</b> Foundation schools, including those with trusts,
are already proven. They have effectively been piloted already, and we
had that debate last night, as I
recall.</p><p><a name="06052453001809">I turn to the
amendments on selection, as I imagine that that is why most hon.
Members are present for this debate. The Government do not support the
extension of selection by ability. I do not like selection. That has
been our stance since 1997 and clause 36 reaffirms our stance that
selection by academic ability cannot lawfully be introduced. But the
Bill is not about imposing our view on structures centrally. It is an
enabling Bill, and we want to encourage schools of all kinds to work
together to benefit all
pupils.</p><p><a name="06052453001810">Clause 48 on
pupil banding is an example of how we are enabling schools to adopt
such arrangements, which will widen access and provide an intake that
is 
<br><notus-date day="24" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>24 May 2006 : Column 1569</b><br>more representative of the range of ability of all applicants. Banding
is not about selection. In fact, children cannot pass or fail a banding
test. What happens is that children are allocated to ability bands and
places are allocated from each of those in a non-selective way to
produce a comprehensive intake. Although some banding schools run tests
to assess ability and allocate to bands, it is not absolutely necessary
to run separate tests for that. In Lewisham, where all schools band,
the results of QCA year 5 SATS tests are used to allocate children to
appropriate bands, so no additional testing is required. We will
advocate the use of that means of assessing ability in the
code.</p><p><a name="06052453001811">Amendment No.
110 seeks to prevent the introduction of banding by removing clause 48.
I believe that pupil banding arrangements have a key role in reducing
social segregation in an area. The new flexibilities on banding are
important because they will allow schools situated in areas of
traditional high academic attainment to send out a positive message
that they are also there to serve less able pupils who might not gain
entry if the school banded simply to admit local residents. That,
coupled with our reforms of pupil transport, will increase
opportunities for less affluent children, and I encourage anyone who
wants to see a more equitable admissions system to support clause 48
and oppose amendment No. 110.</p><p><a name="06052453001812">Amendments Nos. 119 to 122
would go further and remove all selection by ability, including
banding. New clause 39 would discontinue all selection except for
banding purposes from all schools, unless local parents have voted in
favour of its
retention.</p><p><a name="06052453001813">In 1997,
the Government made a commitment to leave it to parents and governors
to decide the future of their grammar schools. The spirit of this Bill
honours that commitment, as it does not impose any structure on any
school. Grammar school governing bodies can bring forward proposals to
remove selective arrangements, and the appropriate mechanisms are
already in place to enable parents to challenge the continuation of
selection in their local
schools.</p><p><a name="06052453001814"><b><a name="06052453005038">Ms

for Bury, North (Mr. Chaytor) with great care, as he has great
knowledge and wisdom and adopts an instinctively progressive point of
view. However, the evidence suggests that it would be neither
productive nor cost effective for the Government to organise ballots
across the country, given that there has been so little call for them
so far.</p><p><a name="06052453001817">My hon. Friend
the Member for Battersea (Martin Linton) admitted that his amendment
No. 112 read like 
<br><notus-date day="24" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>24 May 2006 : Column 1570</b><br>gobbledegook, but it would prevent schools with partially selective
admissions arrangements from increasing the proportion of children
selected. In addition, if the schools adjudicator has upheld an
objection and reduced a school&#146;s level of selection, the
amendment would prevent that school from reinstating its original level
of selection later.</p><p><a name="06052453001818">As
I said, I appreciate that it is still possible for the admissions
authority to restore the proportion of intake that is selected, even
though we have moved to make sure that the decision of the schools
adjudicator will stick for two years. However, the loophole uncovered
by my hon. Friend the Member for Battersea goes against the
Government&#146;s commitment to no new selection&#151;a commitment
now shared by the Opposition&#151;and I shall look at ways to bring
forward an amendment in another place to close
it.</p><p><a name="06052453001819">I turn now to the
arrangements for admissions to academies, about which I know that my
hon. Friend the Member for Northampton, North is especially concerned.
I recognise that there are concerns that academies should be subject to
the same admission rules that apply to maintained schools. New clause
47 highlights that concern by seeking to require academies to consult
on their arrangements and take part in a co-ordinated admissions
process, and it would also require objections about those arrangements
to be made to the schools adjudicator. However, the Secretary of State
already places those conditions on academies through their funding
agreements. Moreover, he, rather than the adjudicator, determines
objections to their admissions arrangements. That means that we already
have the power that my hon. Friend is looking for, although it is
expressed in a different
way.</p><p><a name="06052453001820">The funding
agreement goes further, requiring academies to comply with admissions
legislation and to have regard to the school admissions code of
practice. Once clause 37 is enacted, academies will also have to act in
accordance with the new schools admissions code. I hope that that
reassurance is sufficient for my hon. Friend the Member for
Northampton, North.</p><p><a name="06052453001821">I
want to allow the hon. Member for Brent, East to wind up the debate,
and I apologise that there is not enough time for me to tackle all the
amendments. However, I think that we dealt in Committee with the
arguments in respect of the ones that remain, and I urge that they be
withdrawn.</p><p><a name="06052453001822">In
conclusion, this Bill addresses the needs of parents and children,
while at the same time setting a sensible framework in which school
admission authorities must operate. It allows a degree of flexibility
to take account of local circumstances, but it also provides clear
parameters.</p><p><a name="06052453001823">We want an
admissions process that allows parents to choose schools, rather than
schools choosing parents. Ruling out admissions interviews,
strengthening the status of the admissions code and giving forums
greater responsibilities and powers will all help to achieve that
aim.</p><p><a name="06052453001824"><b><a name="06052453005040">Sarah
Teather:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for his recognition
that distortion of admissions policy occurs on the ground, unlike
Conservative Front-Bench Members who were unwilling to accept that
fact.</p><br><notus-date day="24" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>24 May 2006 : Column 1571</b><br><p><a name="06052453001825">I am pleased that the Minister
has indicated that he will look at pilots, but I would have had more
confidence in his commitment to do so if he had drafted a permissive
clause or enabling regulations, such as those on banding or transport,
so that the pilots can go ahead. My fear is that under pressure,
perhaps from faith schools, the proposal will be kicked into the long
grass. It is a point of principle for the Liberal Democrats. We are not
willing to support greater freedom for schools to control their
admissions without extra
safeguards.</p><p><a name="06052453001826">Despite
the Minister&#146;s assurances, I shall have to test the opinion of
the House on the new clause. We want the provision to be included. I
hope that, perhaps in the other place, the Government will consider
drafting enabling regulations or a permissive clause so that safeguards
can be included in the
Bill.</p><p><a name="06052453001827"><i> Question put,

for Third Reading read.</i></p><h5 align="left"><a name="06052453003641">6.26
pm</h5><p><a name="06052453003513"><b><a name="06052453006652">The
Secretary of State for Education and Skills (Alan
Johnson):</b> I beg to move, That the Bill be now read the
Third time.</p><p><a name="06052453003514">Valid
concerns have been raised during the passage of this Bill, and I hope
that Members on both sides will agree that the Government have listened
very carefully and responded where possible to make this a better Bill.
The House has conducted a mature and healthy debate on a matter of
supreme importance to all of our
constituents.</p><p><a name="06052453003515">Education
remains this Government&#146;s priority. Since 1997, we have almost
doubled education spending, so that today there is an unprecedented
rebuilding and refurbishment programme, with more teachers and support
staff who are better trained and using new books and computers in our
classrooms. We have also made huge progress in tackling embedded
problems with literacy, numeracy and failing schools. All this is
reflected in the fact that schools today are achieving the best ever
results at every key
stage.</p><p><a name="06052453003516">However,
serious problems remain. High achievement is unevenly spread, and the
scales of educational opportunity are still tipped far too heavily
against disadvantaged children. The Bill focuses on unleashing the
potential of each and every child, and with nine years&#146;
successful experience in raising educational attainment, we can build
on what we know works
well.</p><p><a name="06052453003517">The Bill will
help more schools to follow the path to high achievement. By enabling
schools to become self-governing and to form links with a charitable
trust, the Bill will give greater independence, but within a structure
of increased interdependence, so that all those with an interest in
successful schooling can make a full contribution to their local
school. The opportunities are great for further and higher education
establishments to entice more children to climb the ladder of
attainment, for voluntary groups to bring in new ideas and fresh
thinking, for business trusts to help focus on future careers and take
forward the 14-to-19 agenda, and for schools to share best
practice.</p><p><a name="06052453003518">The trust
model also ensures that those relationships are permanent and lasting,
rather than transient and dependent on a few visionaries whose
departure heralds the collapse of the project. Trusts combine the best
of all the existing models, and there has been broad consensus about
their potential in principle. However, concerns have revolved around
how they might operate in
practice.</p><p><a name="06052453003519"><b><a name="06052453006653">Sarah
Teather:</b> Will the Secretary of State give
way?</p><p><a name="06052453003520"><b><a name="06052453006654">Alan
Johnson:</b> No, I will not, as time is limited.</p><p><a name="06052453003521">We have confirmed that no
school will be forced to become a trust school, but that every school
will have 
<br><notus-date day="24" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>24 May 2006 : Column 1589</b><br>that option, after consulting parents and stakeholders. And we have set
out safeguards to ensure that trusts are not involved in activities
that may be considered inappropriate. We have also put a requirement on
trusts not only to help drive up standards but to contribute to
community cohesion.</p><p><a name="06052453003522"><b><a name="06052453006655">Clive
Efford (Eltham) (Lab):</b> Will my right hon. Friend give
way?</p><p><a name="06052453003523"><b><a name="06052453006656">Alan
Johnson:</b> No.</p><p><a name="06052453003524">We have amended the Bill so
that the best local authorities will automatically be able to put
forward new community schools for consideration. Most other local
authorities will have opportunities to do the same, with only the worst
being barred from doing so. The Bill also includes a clear ban on
interviews and new selection by academic ability. We have strengthened
the code on admissions, enhanced its status and circulated a draft of
it to the House. That makes it crystal clear that there will be no new
selection by the more covert means used in some places.</p><p><a name="06052453003525">Although the spotlight has
fallen on trust schools, the Bill contains many other crucial measures
that have attracted less attention. Giving all 14 to 19-year-olds the
right to study for specialised diplomas will help to tackle three major
economic and social problems: the skills gap; youth unemployment; and
classroom disengagement. Twenty years after Lord Elton&#146;s
ground-breaking report, the Bill enacts its central recommendation by
giving teachers tough new powers to tackle unruly pupils inside and
outside school. That will reduce classroom disruption and improve the
attainment of all pupils. Other important powers relate to school
meals, transport and an obligation on local authorities to ensure that
young people have places to go and constructive things to do in their
leisure time.</p><p><a name="06052453003526">I want
to highlight one other less publicised aspect of the Bill. In respect
of looked-after children, on whom we will focus attention over coming
months, I remind the House that, for the first time, schools will be
obliged to take in looked-after children who move into their area
during the school year, as they often do, even if the school is full.
That addresses the central problem of looked-after children
consistently being dumped in the worst-performing schools to make up
the numbers. That is one of the most important measures in the Bill,
even if it has not attracted the most publicity.</p><p><a name="06052453003527">This Bill has received robust
and thorough scrutiny in the House.</p><p><a name="06052453003528"><b><a name="06052453006657">Clive
Efford:</b> I wanted the opportunity to engage with my right
hon. Friend on a number of issues that, I think, are missing from the
Bill, such as targeting resources on those areas where we need to raise
standards&#151;</p><p><a name="06052453003529"><b><a name="06052453006658">Mr.

Gentleman, but Third Reading is not the occasion to raise points that
are not in the Bill. Third Reading is about what is in the
Bill.</p>

Johnson:</b> Incidentally, through this Bill and other
policies, we are targeting attention on the most disadvantaged areas
and failing schools. Another aspect of the Bill is that it allows us to
turn around failing schools more quickly, as I have
mentioned.</p><p><a name="06052453003531"><b><a name="06052453006660">Mary
Creagh (Wakefield) (Lab):</b> Does my right hon. Friend agree
that the proposals in the Bill relating to school food provide for the
first time ever a national curriculum for children&#146;s bodies as
well as for their minds? Will he urge local authorities to use the
powers in the Bill to provide free school meals to children in their
areas and to opt out of the charges that they currently
impose?</p><p><a name="06052453003532"><b><a name="06052453006661">Alan
Johnson:</b> My hon. Friend gives me the opportunity to
mention the ground-breaking scheme introduced by the local authority in
Hull to provide free school meals, free fruit and vegetables and free
breakfasts to all primary school pupils. To do that, it had to go
through a tortuous process under the power to innovate. This Bill will
allow every local authority to do that, and I agree very much with my
hon. Friend, who has done some splendid work on the issue, that that is
another crucial aspect of the Bill.</p><p><a name="06052453003533">As always, there will be
Members who will not agree with every single aspect of the Bill. The
question on Third Reading must be what educational advantage would be
served by defeating the Bill. The Bill will drive up educational
standards further by supporting stronger partnerships; creating new
curriculum entitlements for 14 to 19-year-olds, enacting in many
respects what was in the Butler Act of 1944 but was never brought into
practice; ensuring better discipline; developing a powerful strategic
role for local authorities; tightening up the admissions framework;
and, as I mentioned, helping to turn around failing schools. Its
purpose is to make every school a good school and to ensure that every
child realises their full potential. Those objectives are shared by all
hon. Members, no matter on which Benches they sit, and I commend the
Bill to the
House.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06052453003642">6.34
pm</h5><p><a name="06052453003534"><b><a name="06052453006662">Mr.
David Willetts (Havant) (Con):</b> Perhaps I can begin by
paying tribute to the work that has been done by hon. Members on both
sides of the House in scrutinising the Bill in Committee. It emerged
from the Committee remarkably similar to the Bill that went into
Committee and remarkably similar to the Bill that the Conservative
party voted for on Second Reading. We will, of course, support the Bill
on Third Reading, for many of the reasons set out by the Secretary of
State for Education and Skills.</p><p><a name="06052453003535">I welcome the Secretary of
State to the Dispatch Box. I have not previously had a proper
opportunity to welcome him to his new post. I have enormous respect for
his abilities, both as a politician and as a Minister. Our paths have
strangely inter-twingled&#151;[Hon. Members:
&#147;Inter-twingled?&#148;] I should be the Deputy Prime Minister,
talking like that. We have gone from pensions to energy and now to
schools. In fact, the Secretary of State is to be found wherever the
Government are in crisis, and he brings his own distinct sort of
&#147;Dad&#146;s Army&#148;, &#147;Don&#146;t panic&#148;
style to the 
<br><notus-date day="24" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>24 May 2006 : Column 1591</b><br>various crises that he finds. If I may say so, I thought that he was in
fine form yesterday. I cannot think of any member of the Cabinet who
could have handled the rebellion that he faced yesterday better than he
did. His reward, of course, was a Labour rebellion of 69 Members who
voted against the Government. Perhaps it tells us a lot about the state
of the Labour party and the Labour Government that, with all his skill,
he faced a rebellion that wiped out their
majority.</p><p><a name="06052453003536">The debates
on the Bill, both in Committee and on the Floor of the House, have had
a strangely elusive quality, because the implications of the Bill may
be quite modest. I hope that they are not modest in practice, but I am
not as confident as the Secretary of State about how many schools will
become trust schools. I have some concerns about what will happen when
the human rights lawyers get to work on some of the points in a recent
report. We may find that some of the Bill&#146;s provisions are hard
to
implement.</p><p><a name="06052453003537"><b><a name="06052453006663">Mr.
Gordon Prentice (Pendle) (Lab):</b> The Secretary of State
told me yesterday that a great many schools would opt for trust status
by the end of this Parliament. Will the hon. Gentleman estimate how
many schools he thinks will go for trust
status?</p><p><a name="06052453003538"><b><a name="06052453006664">Mr.
Willetts:</b> I would not like to give an estimate, but I
believe that we should encourage schools to become trust schools. That
is what the White Paper said, and it was one of the more curious
moments in the passage of the Bill when the Secretary of State and
other Ministers went through the Lobby yesterday to vote against a
Conservative amendment that would have simply implemented the proposals
in the White Paper. It is very unusual for Ministers to vote against
the proposals in their own White Paper, when the Bill comes to the
House.</p><p><a name="06052453003539"><b><a name="06052453006665">Ian
Stewart:</b> Will the hon. Gentleman give
way?</p><p><a name="06052453003540"><b><a name="06052453006666">Mr.
Willetts:</b> I am afraid that time is very limited, so I hope
that hon. Gentleman will forgive me if I do not give
way.</p><p><a name="06052453003541">I want to bring
out the point that the reason why these debates have been so hard to
pin down is that, although the Bill&#146;s implications may be modest
in practice, they are very large in theory. There is a different way to
think about education behind the Bill. It is a recognition that the
future role for local education authorities is as purchasers, not as
providers, that the future for schools must involve diversity, not
standardisation, and that parents want choice, rather finding their
children trapped in certain catchment
areas.</p><p><a name="06052453003542"><b><a name="06052453006667">Ian
Stewart:</b> Will the hon. Gentleman give
way?</p><p><a name="06052453003543"><b><a name="06052453006668">Mr.
Willetts:</b> I am afraid that I will try to make progress in
very limited
time.</p><p><a name="06052453003544">Conservative
Members have consistently believed in that philosophy; it is the
thinking behind the White Paper and many of the provisions that survive
even in relatively modest form in the Bill. The Labour rebels, if they
may be called that, are deeply uncomfortable with that philosophy. I
disagree with them, but I respect the 
<br><notus-date day="24" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>24 May 2006 : Column 1592</b><br>integrity and consistency with which they have argued their case. They
have revealed the real division that now exists in the House on
education reform. A majority in the House, represented by the entirety
of my party and the Front Bench of the Labour party, believe in those
principles, although there may be many Labour Members who are
uncomfortable with them. It is partly a disagreement of principle, but
I have to say that I am increasingly persuaded by the evidence produced
by evaluations around the world that school choice and school freedom
work.</p><p><a name="06052453003545"><b><a name="06052453006669">Mr.

evidence from Sweden, from America and even from evaluations of our own
grant-maintained schools that that is the best way in which to raise
standards of education in our country, which is why we support the Bill
and will continue to support it. But of course, in supporting the Bill
and developing this agenda, my party has changed its approach as well.
I fully recognise that my party&#146;s approach to the issue of
selection has changed. In the process of forming a consensus on the
best way of reforming education, we have abandoned any idea of a
grammar school in every town. We have abandoned any idea of bringing
back the 11-plus in grammar schools. We have recognised that our focus
should be on how we can best raise standards in all our nation&#146;s
schools. If there is to be selection, it is best for it to take place
by means of setting within schools rather than allowing children across
the country to face an invidious decision, at the age of 11, on which
school they should
attend.</p><p><a name="06052453003549"><b><a name="06052453006672">Ian
Stewart:</b> Will the hon. Gentleman give way on that
point?</p><p><a name="06052453003550"><b><a name="06052453006673">Mr.
Willetts:</b> Of course we wish to support the grammar schools
that survive&#151;they are institutions with a long
history&#151;but my party will not bring back the 11-plus, and will
not bring back grammar schools. That was an important statement for us
to make, enabling us to show that we were serious about proceeding with
the education reform agenda that lies behind the
Bill.</p><p><a name="06052453003551">In fact, we have
now reached a stage at which, unlike some Labour Members, we are not
obsessed with the issue of selection. We are not going to try to
expunge the last grammar school from the country. We will focus our
attention on how to secure more good school places in total, rather
than on the endless depressing battle over exactly how children are
allocated to a small number of good schools. We all recognise that the
problem in our country today is that there are not enough good
schools.</p><p><a name="06052453003552"><b><a name="06052453006674">Ian

easier for schools to expand. We will use the powers in the Bill to
give more freedom to schools. We will use the powers in the Bill to
deliver on some of the promises that the Prime Minister made, but on
which he has not been able to deliver. We look forward to using the
powers in the Bill to deliver what the Prime Minister called, in his
foreword to the White Paper, the aim of</p><a name="06052453003621"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;the creation of a system of
independent non-fee paying&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06052453003557">state schools. That, I think, is the true
objective of serious education reform, and as we fight that battle we
will be able to say that ours is the party that is united in a
commitment to deliver the radicalism behind the White Paper&#151;from
which, sadly, the Government have had to retreat because of pressures
from their own Back
Benchers.</p><p><a name="06052453003558">It is on
that basis that Conservative Members are pleased to support the
Bill&#146;s Third
Reading.</p><p><a name="06052472000005"><b><a name="06052472000621">Sarah
Teather:</b> I am not sure how to follow that extraordinary
love-in between the hon. Member for Havant (Mr. Willetts) and the
Secretary of State&#151;[Hon. Members:
&#147;Intertwingle!&#148;] Indeed. I cannot help wondering whether
such a deep and personal display of affection may be something that we
should not be watching in public. Although we are liberals on these
Benches, I have always felt that three is a crowd, so we will not be
joining in.</p><p><a name="06052472000006">Of course,
the truth is that it is just a marriage of convenience, not the real
thing. The Secretary of State needs the passport that the Conservatives
can give his Bill, and the Conservatives are really only interested in
breaking up his family. The Secretary of State has been left walking a
tightrope between the two, trying to persuade his family that this time
he really has changed while still clinging to his affair with the
Conservative Front Bench. The truth is that, as the hon. Member for
Havant said, the Bill has change very little since Second Reading,
despite the Secretary of State&#146;s attempts to reassure his own
Back Benchers that it has.</p><p><a name="06052472000007">The three key concerns that we
had when we embarked on Second Reading remain. First, we do not believe
that adequate safeguards on admissions have been given. If we are to
give schools more freedom to control their own admissions, we want the
extra safeguard of ensuring that someone impartial administers them. I
welcomed the concession that the Minister made on Report for the
conducting of pilots. However, I would have preferred that a permissive
clause or enabling regulation be included in the Bill so that we could
be sure that the Government are serious 
<br><notus-date day="24" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>24 May 2006 : Column 1594</b><br>about this issue and are not simply going to kick it into the long
grass, as I fear they will. Without such a safeguard, giving schools
more freedom to control admissions is not adequate.</p><p><a name="06052472000008">Secondly, on accountability, we
are totally opposed to giving trust schools the option of reducing the
number of elected parent governors. To us, that flies in the face of
all the spin about parent power. I assumed that I would never win the
argument with the Secretary of State about giving away the power of
veto, so that local authorities could have the strategic power that
they desire to plan their own services. New Labour&#146;s commitment
to new localism has never really been about accountability.
Nevertheless, I was astonished by the arguments that were advanced
yesterday against parental ballots.</p><p><a name="06052472000009">Thirdly and most importantly, I
still do not feel that an adequate, clear vision has been set out. Is
this a competitive education model or a collaborative one? Still, we
have the Prime Minister&#146;s vision of a competitive model, rather
than the vision that, I suspect, the Department for Education and
Skills would much rather pursue: of a collaborative model that allows
real choice in the curriculum. Without that model, we will never see
the real reforms that we want&#151;reforms that give schools the
freedom to teach what young people want to
learn.</p><p><a name="06052472000010">In our view,
this Bill is a missed opportunity. It is a timid Bill with hidden
dangers, and for that reason we will vote against it
tonight.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06052472000615">6.47

Sheerman:</b> It with reluctance, almost, that I rise to

of consideration of this Bill in Committee; however, my Select
Committee did carry out a virtual pre-legislative inquiry when we
examined the White Paper.</p><p><a name="06052472000012">I welcome the Bill and I will
support it on Third Reading, as will the vast majority of my Labour
colleagues. I will do so because it builds, as the Secretary of State
said, on what we know works. The longer that I have chaired the Select
Committee, the more that I have come to realise that it is not dogma
that will deal with the problems that we encounter in our schools
throughout the country. Some of my colleagues like dogma. A small group
of them would still like to nationalise the top 100 companies, for
example, and will vote for any of those old dogmas if they are given
the chance. <i> [Interruption.] </i>Well, they do not like it, do

Sheerman:</b> I am supporting this Bill, Mr. Speaker, because
it is based on the principle of judging the evidence of what works in
our schools. As the Chairman of the Select Committee, I visit at least
one school a week, and I know that what works on the ground is not some
high-flown dogma from the past or, indeed, the future. We need to sit
down with our teachers, governors, parents and students and work out
what will improve education on the ground.</p><br><notus-date day="24" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>24 May 2006 : Column 1595</b><br><p><a name="06052472000015"><b><a name="06052472000625">Paul

Bill is not radical or revolutionary; rather, it builds on the steady
progress achieved&#151;dare I say it?&#151;under previous
Conservative Governments as well as this Labour Government. That is the
truth that we sometimes dare not speak in this House. Education is too
important an issue for one party to make changes on taking office, and
for the other then to reverse them on taking office. However, such a
consensual approach is not good enough for some of my colleagues. What
I want to do is to make steady progress, which probably sounds a little
Oakeshottian to some of my colleagues. We have worked for nine years to
improve the education of our children throughout this country, but that
is not enough. There is a long way to go, and this Bill will take us
further along the path of good, steady progress.
</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06052472000616">6.50
pm</h5><p><a name="06052472000017"><b><a name="06052472000627">Clive
Efford:</b> There is much in the Bill that deserves to be
supported and I accept the efforts that have been made by my right hon.
Friend the Secretary of State and his team, and their predecessors.
However, the Bill provides the opportunity for schools to break away
from the school community in a locality. The danger of that is that the
local authorities will lose direct control of and influence over those
schools. That would mean that the local community would lose influence
over those schools.</p><p><a name="06052472000018">I
hope that my right hon. Friend, in further proceedings on the Bill,
will take on board that it should not diminish the role of local
authorities. The overarching strategic responsibility for developing
education in an area should remain with the local authority. We need a
dynamic relationship with local communities, in which the local
authority has a responsibility to consult with the whole school
community&#151;parents, head teachers, governors and everybody else
involved in education&#151;to develop an education plan that it can
then publish and against which the performance of schools can be
measured. Local parents will then have a clear framework for education
in their area, against which they can measure the performance of
schools and the delivery of education. The issue is providing
information that parents can understand about education in their area
that will allow them to make informed decisions about
education.</p><p><a name="06052472000019">Even more
importantly, local authorities have to be given the opportunity to
identify areas of deprivation and of special educational need so that
they can direct resources to those areas to raise standards. I said on
Second Reading that as we came to power in 1997 the league tables for
schools were being published. Although we have improved standards
enormously across all schools, the schools are in the same positions in
the league tables. That is true for my area and for areas across the
country. I would have liked to have seen it stated in the Bill that we
intended to identify areas of deprivation and need by setting the
necessary criteria, so that we could direct the resources to them and
finally, once and for all, give those kids who have not had the
opportunity of having a decent education 
<br><notus-date day="24" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>24 May 2006 : Column 1596</b><br>the resources needed to give them that. The Bill has been more about
structures than about providing support for the very people at the
sharp end of doing that very
job.</p><p><a name="06052472000020"><b><a name="06052472000628">Ms
Angela C. Smith:</b> Does my hon. Friend acknowledge that the
Government have already done a great deal to direct resources to
deprived areas? Excellence in cities is a good example of the
Government directing resources to where they are
needed.</p><p><a name="06052472000021"><b><a name="06052472000629">Clive
Efford:</b> I fully accept that and I made that point in my
opening remarks. Indeed, the education action zone in my area worked
because it provided extra resources and the freedom for staff and
governors to direct those resources to improve standards.</p><p><a name="06052472000022">The White Paper said that the
Government would make an announcement about that subject in the autumn,
but why is it not part of the Bill? That is what I am arguing for. If a
future Government did not want to invest resources in that way, they
would have to explain to parents why it is no longer part of the local
education plan that resources would be directed to schools in that way.
That is what I wanted from the Bill. I accept that some hon. Members
will say that that is what we want to achieve, but that is light years
away from the rhetoric surrounding the Bill when it was published and
from some of the statements made later.
</p><p><a name="06052472000023">I have outlined my
concerns about these proposals. Unfortunately, I cannot support the
Bill this
evening.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06052472000617">6.55
pm</h5><p><a name="06052472000024"><b><a name="06052472000630">Dr.
Blackman-Woods:</b> There have been some very interesting
discussions and deliberations over the past two days. However, I
suggest to the hon. Member for Brent, East (Sarah Teather) that
consensus in the best interests of our children is something to be
applauded rather than
denigrated.</p><p><a name="06052472000025">It is
perhaps unfortunate that we could not spend more time on some of the
excellent proposals in the Bill. I shall highlight a few of them
briefly, beginning with the duty that the Bill places on local
authorities in the provision of services and facilities for young
people. That is a huge step forward and it will help a lot of young
people, in my constituency and others, to access a range of services
that are not available at present.</p><p><a name="06052472000026">The Bill also moves forward the
education of 14 to 19-year-olds. The availability of new diplomas and
the right to study for specialised diplomas are essential for many of
our young people and will contribute to the promotion of vocational
education. In addition, local authorities will have new opportunities
to provide free school meals to all children in their areas. That will
transform the quality of food available to students, who will be able
to eat good food at lunch time. I hope that the Government will
encourage local authorities to take the option
up.</p><p><a name="06052472000027">We have not had an
opportunity to explore what personalised learning will mean for young
people. However, I have seen it at work in some schools in Sweden, and
I hope that the Bill will help its delivery in this country. That is
one reason why I urge all colleagues to support the Bill&#146;s Third
Reading.</p><p><a name="06052472000028">Other good
provisions in the Bill include the new procedures to help improve
discipline in schools, but 
<br><notus-date day="24" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>24 May 2006 : Column 1597</b><br>before I conclude I want to mention the greater ability that this
measure gives to local authorities to intervene in failing and coasting
schools. That will raise standards for all our young
people.</p><p><a name="06052472000029"><i> Question

Andrew Love (Edmonton) (Lab/Co-op):</b> It would be remiss in
starting this Adjournment debate not to welcome the Sri Lankan cricket
team to this country and to wish its players the best of luck, because
I think that they may need
it.</p><p><a name="06052472000568">The
primary reason why I have called the debate this evening is to report
to Parliament on a recent delegation to Sri Lanka that the hon. Member
for Northampton, South (Mr. Binley) and I headed at the beginning of
April this year. I shall report what we saw on our visit and some of
the issues and concerns that were raised with us.</p><p><a name="06052472000569">I want to focus on the rapidly
deteriorating situation in Sri Lanka and on the action that both the UK
Government and, through them, the international community are taking to
address the increased number of suicide attacks, random killings and
assassinations and to move towards the resumption of the talks that
were cancelled in
April.</p><p><a name="06052472000570">I thank all
those who were involved in arranging our visit, of whom there are too
many to mention in this debate. I particularly want to thank those who
were involved in facilitating our visit to the north&#151;we flew to
Jaffna and visited parts of the north that are under Government
control.</p><p><a name="06052472000571">Before we
made the visit, my constituents and members of the Sri Lankan community
throughout the country expressed their concern to me, as chairman of
the all-party group on Sri Lanka, that tsunami aid was simply not
getting through to the north and east of the country. As a result, I
raised two questions with Ministers in the Department for International
Development. Despite the reassurances that I received, people still
expressed concerns that nothing was happening in the north and east. I
was thus relieved to receive a letter from the Sri Lankan high
commissioner, who detailed at some length several of the projects that
were being undertaken in the north. I shall cite a representative
example from the letter. She wrote that the World Bank was spending
just over $32 million</p><a name="06052472000614"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;to
rehabilitate small irrigation schemes damaged by the
tsunami&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06052472000572">and providing
support for &#147;community capacity building reconstruction&#148;
in the north and
east.</p><p><a name="06052472000573">Even with that
letter, it was still difficult to persuade those who made
representations to me, so our visit to the north was welcome because it
allowed us to see three sites, two of which were just outside Jaffna
and one that was at Point Pedro, which is the most northerly point of
the Sri Lankan island. During our visit, we saw the work of an Italian
non-governmental organisation called Movimondo, which had completed
work on 36 houses and built a school just outside Jaffna. Right
adjacent to that was a World Bank scheme involving 111 houses. A lot of
the houses were in the early stages of construction, but quite a few
had roofs on. I have no doubt that they will have been completed by
now. We also visited a site that was 
<br><notus-date day="24" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>24 May 2006 : Column 1603</b><br>organised by Caritas, another NGO. There were to be 68 houses on the
site. Although they were in the early stages of development, we could
at least see the foundations of the houses that would be
there.</p><p><a name="06052472000574"><b><a name="06052472001157">Mr.
Sadiq Khan (Tooting) (Lab):</b> I congratulate my hon. Friend
on securing such an important and worthy debate. I have also heard
reports from the Sri Lankan diaspora in my community&#151;the Tamil
diaspora&#151;of the intimidation and harassment of NGO workers. The
White Pigeon charity in my constituency and the Tamil Rehabilitation
Organisation in Sri Lanka have complained especially about the recent
kidnapping of workers. When my hon. Friend was in Sri Lanka, did he get
the chance to speak to NGO workers and find out from them whether they
were being intimidated in the work that they were
doing?</p><p><a name="06052472000575"><b><a name="06052472001158">Mr.
Love:</b> We had the opportunity to speak to some of those
involved in the three schemes in the north, but focused our attention
primarily on the work that they were doing to rehabilitate and
reconstruct following the tsunami. In all honesty, we did not get on to
concerns about kidnapping, although I have heard similar reports to
those cited by my hon.
Friend.</p><p><a name="06052472000576">During our
visit, we also spoke at length to the reconstruction and development
agency in Sri Lanka. It confirmed that, although there had been complex
negotiations, it was confident that the tsunami relief efforts were
beginning to show in the north and east, so I hope that I can provide
reassurance to those who are concerned about
that.</p><p><a name="06052472000577">Through the good
offices of the ministry for resettlement, we were able to visit
Puttalam, which is in the western part of the island. We met some of
the internally displaced people, who are primarily Muslims, who exist
in 35 camps in the region. They have been in the camps for nearly 16
years. What we found was an absolute disgrace. The shelters were
threadbare. The food supplies that the people received were
intermittent and the food was basic, to say the least. People had to
walk two miles to get water that they could drink and more than a mile
just to get a bath in the morning. There were few employment
opportunities for the people. Education was non-existent and
discrimination was rife among the local
people.</p><p><a name="06052472000578"><b><a name="06052472001159">Mr.
David Drew (Stroud) (Lab/Co-op):</b> I congratulate my hon.
Friend the Member for Edmonton (Mr. Love) on securing the debate. The
sad thing about Sri Lanka is that religious intolerance is still bad.
The conflict between the Sinhalese and the Tamils is one thing, but the
undercurrent of religious intolerance is just as bad. Did he see any of
that on his
visit?</p><p><a name="06052472000579"><b><a name="06052472001160">Mr.
Love:</b> In relation to the Muslim community, a great deal of
the discrimination described to us was partly based on religious
differences. I have heard reports of other minority religions being
discriminated against. It is of concern, but it was not our primary
focus on visiting the island.</p><br><notus-date day="24" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>24 May 2006 : Column 1604</b><br><p><a name="06052472000580">We spoke to a number of the
people in the camps and were surprised to discover that they did not
want to return to their original homes in the north and east. They felt
safe where they were and had been living there for a considerable time.
It was very much the strong feeling of both members of the delegation
that they had been forgotten by everyone&#151;by their Government and
the international community. It was part of our wish on returning to
raise their profile and see whether something could be done. I note
that the Department for International Development has been involved in
innovative programmes on internally displaced persons. In former
programmes, it has tried to assist people to return to their original
homes. It could construct a similar programme so that people can
rehabilitate themselves within the district of Puttalam and establish
employment opportunities. Perhaps the Minister can pass that request on
to his
colleagues.</p><p><a name="06052472000581"><b><a name="06052472001161">Mr.
Brian Binley (Northampton, South) (Con):</b> I congratulate
the hon. Member for Edmonton (Mr. Love) on obtaining the debate and
thank him for his great companionship on the trip. I support what he
says about those unfortunate people in Puttalam. Frankly, their plight
shocked me to the core. One of our objectives was to get the British
Government to raise the matter in a slightly more active way. I
recognise that Ministers are aware of the situation and are
compassionate about it, but I make a plea to extend those efforts and
to raise the profile of those people, who have been forgotten in
relation to the tsunami, the troubles and so on. Does he agree that
that would
help?</p><p><a name="06052472000582"><b><a name="06052472001162">Mr.
Love:</b> I agree with the hon. Gentleman and endorse
everything he says. I hope that Ministers will read our debate tomorrow
and take those issues up on our
behalf.</p><p><a name="06052472000583">The main
reason for having the debate this week is because of the concern that
exists throughout the international community, but primarily on the
island itself, about the major escalation in violence following the
breakdown of the ceasefire agreement talks in April. That had been
coming for some time. The two sides were on the slippery slope.
Although there had been a so-called ceasefire agreement since 2002, the
violence never stopped. If we look back at the history of that
agreement, we see that, although intensive talks took place between
2002 and 2003, they soon ran out of steam. There has been little or no
political progress since then. The situation between the two
communities has deteriorated and violence has flared up.</p><p><a name="06052472000584">A combination of events led to
that position, such as the assassination of the former Foreign
Minister, Mr. Kadirgama, the collapse of the post-tsunami operational
management structure&#151;P-TOMS&#151;agreement, which would have
allowed both communities to be involved in tsunami relief, and the
split in the Tamil Tigers, with the Karuna faction actively engaged in
violent activities, mainly against the other part of its own community.
Human rights violations have been perpetrated with impunity in the
north and east of the island. There was euphoria when the talks began
in February, but that was soon replaced by the same old problem of lack
of trust and 
<br><notus-date day="24" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>24 May 2006 : Column 1605</b><br>confidence between the two communities, with the result that tit-for-tat
violence led to the current situation.</p><p><a name="06052472000585">Talks broke down after the
Tamil Tigers walked out, because in their view the Government did not
help to facilitate meetings between commanders in the north and east of
the island. They claim that those talks have not been abandoned. I hope
that that is the case, because the re-establishment of genuine talks is
one of our few hopes of progressing to negotiations. The situation is
serious&#151;indeed, it is much more serious than it was. In a recent
speech, the Minister highlighted the attempted assassination of the
army chief, General Fonseca as an example of the escalating violence on
the island. There have been many incidents, but recently, a suicide
attack on a navy gunboat killed 18 crew members and injured many
others. Many people who were on the boat used by the attackers were
also killed. </p><p><a name="06052472000586">In
April, 191 people&#151;some of them were soldiers but many were
civilians&#151;were killed on both sides of the conflict. The
violence has been condemned and there has been a flurry of diplomatic
activity. Norway has actively engaged in the task of trying to bring
people together. What are the British Government doing on behalf of
Parliament to try to bring the parties together to reduce the violence
on the island? For example, have they pressed for a resumption of the
talks between the two parties on a ceasefire agreement? What action has
been taken by the United Nations and the European Union to try to
support efforts to engage the parties? We are in a unique
position&#151;we have a long historical connection with Sri Lanka,
and many Sri Lankans live in the UK&#151;so are we assisting Norway
with our expertise?</p><p><a name="06052472000587">At
the end of the month, major donors, including the EU and the UK, will
meet in Tokyo. What action will they take to try to reduce the violence
on the island? People across the country who are interested in Sri
Lanka often raise the issue of whether the UK Government could and
should play a more central role in offering assistance. We all know the
historical record: the Indian Government and the United Nations have
been involved, and Norway is currently involved. We accept that there
are difficulties, but Britain can play a special or unique role. I hope
that the Minister accepts the urgency of the
situation.</p><p><a name="06052472000588"><b><a name="06052472001163">Mr.
Khan:</b> Today, I received a letter from Mr. Seevaratnum at
my local Sivayagum temple. He feels frustrated and let down by the
British Government. He believes that they have failed to take enough
action to make people aware of what is happening in his homeland and
that they should be more interventionist and help their kin in Sri
Lanka. Does my hon. Friend empathise with those
feelings?</p><p><a name="06052472000589"><b><a name="06052472001164">Mr.
Love:</b> I hope that the Minister can respond, as I have
certainly heard such feelings expressed on many occasions. We are doing
what we can, but I am sure that the Minister will offer reassurance to
the House and the communities that are listening to our debate so that
they can be confident that we are doing everything that we can to help
Sri Lanka at a time of extreme
need.</p><br><notus-date day="24" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>24 May 2006 : Column 1606</b><br><h5 align="left"><a name="06052472000619">7.29
pm</h5><p><a name="06052472000590"><b><a name="06052472001165">The
Minister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office (Dr. Kim
Howells):</b> I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for
Edmonton (Mr. Love) on securing the debate. These are difficult times
for Sri Lanka, and I welcome the opportunity to discuss how the United
Kingdom is engaged in Sri Lanka to help improve the prospects for all.
We should remember that Sri Lanka is not a small, faraway island. It is
a substantial country of 20 million
people.</p><p><a name="06052472000591">The Indian
ocean tsunami caused wide-scale loss of life and devastation last year.
Hopes that the process of tsunami recovery and reconstruction would
help develop greater long-term harmony among communities were
unfortunately not realised. Over the past year, there has been a steady
and deeply worrying deterioration in the security situation in the
country. Sri Lanka&#146;s development is again in danger of being
overshadowed by its long- running ethnic
conflict.</p><p><a name="06052472000592">The
appalling assassination of the Foreign Minister, as we heard from my
hon. Friend, was followed by the attempted assassination of an army
commander, regular attacks on military personnel, grenade attacks
against civilians, extra-judicial killings, disappearances and
intimidation, mob violence and violence by paramilitary groups. The
cycle of violence has contributed to an atmosphere of extreme mistrust
and polarisation, which has fuelled further antagonism and
violence.</p><p><a name="06052472000593">For a
lasting peace to be possible, the violence must abate, and the parties
must discuss in earnest and honest terms the issues that matter to them
and find a way forward. No one else can do that for them. That is a
statement which I know my hon. Friend understands. He has visited Sri
Lanka, together with the hon. Member for Northampton, South (Mr.
Binley), and seen it for himself. I saw it for myself on my visit
there. </p><p><a name="06052472000594">Only Sri
Lankans can secure a peace for Sri Lanka. All sectors of Sri Lankan
society need to contribute positively to the quest for peace. The Sri
Lankan diaspora in the UK and elsewhere in the world, like any
diaspora, needs to allow the parties the appropriate space to make
progress towards peace, and we must try to help with
that.</p><p><a name="06052472000595">However, as my
hon. Friend made clear, the international community has an important
role to play in the peace process by supporting and encouraging the
parties on that journey, and creating an environment conducive to
building a sustainable peace that will benefit all the peoples of Sri
Lanka. Within the international community, the UK uses its
long-standing and good relationship with the people of Sri Lanka to
work to that end. I am sure the House supports that
aim.</p><p><a name="06052472000596">In response to
the worsening situation in December and January, the international
community urged the parties to talk. As presidency of the European
Union, Great Britain played a big part in those efforts. The co-chairs
of the Sri Lanka donor group&#151;the EU, the United States, Norway
and Japan&#151;put great pressure on the Sri Lankan Government and
the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam to put an end to the violence and
fully respect the ceasefire.</p><p><a name="06052472000597">Those efforts brought results,
when the Sri Lankan Government and the LTTE got round the table in 
<br><notus-date day="24" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>24 May 2006 : Column 1607</b><br>Geneva in February for the first time in three years. All of us had
great hopes at that moment. The Government pledged that no armed group
or person other than Government security forces would carry arms or
conduct armed operations, and for their part, the LTTE pledged to take
all necessary measures to ensure that there would be no acts of
violence against the security forces and the police. Both sides made a
commitment to ensure that there would be no intimidation, acts of
violence, abductions or
killings.</p><p><a name="06052472000598">I am sure my
hon. Friend and hon. Members will agree that the resurgence and
subsequent escalation in violence since that moment is all the more
disappointing. Since the beginning of April, as my hon. Friend reminded
us, at least 300 people have died, more than half of them civilians.
That is a terrible
situation.</p><p><a name="06052472000599">We know
that the LTTE are responsible for many of the violent acts. Our
position on the LTTE is clear: they are a proscribed organisation under
the Terrorism Act 2000. Along with the international community, we have
urged them time and again to move away from the path of violence. Our
concerns go beyond high profile attacks on the armed forces. There is
an established pattern of LTTE involvement in killings, torture,
detention of civilians and denial of freedom of speech. For many
Tamils, any expression of opposition to the LTTE is not an option. That
is the sad truth. We remain deeply disturbed by the LTTE&#146;s
continuing recruitment of child
soldiers.</p><p><a name="06052472000600">But the LTTE
is not the only source of violence. I have to make clear, too, our deep
concern at the plight of civilians in Government-controlled areas, who
are regularly subjected to brutal attacks by paramilitary groups, often
acting with apparent impunity. There are also reports that Government
security forces may be involved in some of those
killings.</p><p><a name="06052472000601">So what
needs to happen next? My hon. Friend asked some very pertinent
questions. In my view, the answer is clear. It is vital that both sides
return to the negotiating table and live up to the commitments that
they made in Geneva in February. We shall continue to offer political
and practical support to the peace process in whatever way we can.
Violence is not the answer. The only way forward is a negotiated
settlement that satisfies the concerns and legitimate aspirations of
all Sri Lankans and preserves national unity and integrity. I am sure
that the House will join me in expressing the hope that all parties go
down that road, and soon, and that we shall finally see Sri Lanka
fulfil its very considerable potential. As the hon. Member for
Northampton, South has told me, it is potentially a tourist paradise.
It should be one of the wealthiest countries in southern Asia, but it
is rapidly becoming one of the poorest. It is a disgrace that that has
been allowed to
happen.</p><p><a name="06052472000602">What are we in
the United Kingdom doing? The British Government continue to urge the
Sri Lankan government and the LTTE to fulfil the obligations that they
made at the Geneva talks in February, to do all they can to stop the
violence, and to return to talks. We have given our full support to the
efforts of the Norwegians, who have the difficult task of facilitating
this process. We very much admire their continued determination and
inexhaustible work in the face of much public dissension. The Norwegian
interlocutors who are doing this work always pay us the privilege of 
<br><notus-date day="24" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>24 May 2006 : Column 1608</b><br>calling into the Foreign and Commonwealth Office so that they can keep
us abreast and we can find out from them what we can do to help. We
have continued to do that. We also continue to support the work of the
Sri Lanka monitoring mission, now led by a Swedish general, in
monitoring ceasefire violations.</p><p><a name="06052472000603">On a practical level, we
contribute to peace-building in Sri Lanka through the implementation of
a peace-building strategy that has been agreed across the Department
for International Development, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and
the Ministry of Defence. It focuses on such themes as greater adherence
to human rights standards, preparedness for peace negotiations, and
strengthening civil society. DFID has contributed &#163;2.6 million
towards de-mining activities in Sri Lanka, which is a very serious
issue that my hon. Friend did not have a chance to discuss;
&#163;6.25 million to UNICEF&#146;s children affected by armed
conflict programme, which is another very serious issue; almost
&#163;2 million to civil society organisations to promote conflict
transformation; &#163;3.5 million to Oxfam to reduce the number of
children suffering as a result of the conflict; and &#163;3.3 million
to Save the Children Sri Lanka to increase respect and realisation of
child rights.</p><p><a name="06052472000604">Let me
deal with the issue of internally displaced persons&#151;I am
grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Edmonton and the hon. Member
for Northampton, South for raising it. Internally displaced persons
should be protected and assisted by their Governments in the first
instance. However, if a Government are unable or unwilling to do that,
the international community should provide support. There has been much
debate about that in the United Nations recently. We must carefully
examine what the international community can do to help in those
circumstances.</p><p><a name="06052472000605">In Sri
Lanka, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees is mandated to
assist internally displaced persons. In 2005, the British Government
gave &#163;30 million to UNHCR, of which &#163;20 million was DFID
core funding, and we would like at least some of that money to be spent
on alleviating the problems of internally displaced persons in Sri
Lanka. Like my hon. Friend and the hon. Member for Northampton, South,
we support the principle that every internally displaced person has the
right to liberty of movement and freedom to choose his or her
residence.</p><p><a name="06052472000606">Internally
displaced persons should have conditions established by competent
authorities, which allow them to return voluntarily, in safety and with
dignity to their homes or habitual residence, or to resettle
voluntarily in another part of the country. I hope that my hon. Friend
and the hon. Gentleman understand that the Government are concerned
about that important issue. I am glad that they raised
it.</p><p><a name="06052472000607">Since the tsunami,
a great deal has been achieved and assistance is reaching most victims
of that terrible natural disaster. However, with so many independent
non-governmental organisations active throughout Sri Lanka, there are
wide differences between districts in the standards and quality of
relief work. The immense size of the reconstruction task is stretching
the capacity of central and local government to manage and 
<br><notus-date day="24" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>24 May 2006 : Column 1609</b><br>co-ordinate assistance. Assistance has been reaching some communities
more quickly than others.</p><p><a name="06052472000608">The Government and donors,
including DFID, are working to make the administration as efficient as
possible and to remove any bureaucratic hurdles that constrain
non-governmental organisation activities. With that in mind, DFID has
recently approved&#163;1.5 million for the north-east
provincial council&#151;NEPC&#151;to increase its capacity to
deliver services to affected communities. The NEPC is responsible for 
<br><notus-date day="24" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>24 May 2006 : Column 1610</b><br>some 70 per cent. of the area damaged by the tsunami. Despite the
difficulties, the achievements to date have been substantial.
Assistance is reaching communities throughout the country and making a
genuine difference. Sadly, the recent escalation in violence has led to
a suspension of the programme and some other DFID activities in Sri
Lanka. I greatly hope that an improvement will occur in the security
situation and allow those activities to resume.</p><p><a name="06052472000609"><i> Question put and agreed
