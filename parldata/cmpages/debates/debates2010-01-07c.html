 I am grateful to my hon. Friend-and it has not taken me five years to dream up an answer. First, this is not a question of greenhouse gases. The scientific interest that followed the grounding of the aircraft was do with the issue of contrails, which are the evaporation and condensation trails emitted by aircraft. We do not know the science of contrails very clearly, but there are two possible effects: first, that they reflect radiation back beyond the earth, and therefore have a cooling effect-or, secondly, that they become cirrus clouds and trap radiation, and therefore have a warming effect. The phenomenon that was observed was thought possibly to be due to the absence of contrails leading to a heating effect. However, the Department has followed subsequent studies, and we now believe that there is no evidence that contrails, or the lack of them, were responsible for the temperature rise observed at the time, and that it was a natural fluctuation.</p>

 This is a line that the Opposition like to peddle, but it is absolutely untrue. One need only look at what has happened since 2007.

Hundreds of pages of applications have come into our Department and are being scrutinised, as one would expect in any procurement project. We have a CCS levy before this House; we have agreement in Europe for up to 12 demonstration projects, pushed by the United Kingdom; we have a commitment in this country to four demonstration projects, which we have not had before; and we have legislation in the Energy Bill for the storage of carbon dioxide from CCS projects.

 Obviously, we will look at any proposals that come forward, but I say to the hon. Gentleman-maybe he has not followed the matter as closely as he might have done-that we have unveiled the most environmentally stringent conditions for new coal-fired power stations of any country in the world. We consulted on them and we have now put them into national policy statements. The proposals have been widely welcomed, both by the green groups that he mentions and by energy companies, as striking the right balance. A plant-level emissions standard could also have a role. As I understand it, the Environment Agency already has powers to introduce one, but we will examine any proposals that come forward.</p>

 I think I am right in saying that the Peterhead proposal was for a gas-fired power station. Our concentration in spending significant amounts of money has been on coal-fired power stations. However, my hon. Friend is right that pre-combustion has an important role. We have said that of the four demonstration projects up to two will be pre-combustion, precisely because we recognise the importance of that technology.

 I am grateful to the Secretary of State for that answer, but he will know that, especially in cold spells such as the recent one, it is those in the most energy-inefficient homes, which tend to be the hardest to treat, and those who use expensive sources of heating off the gas grid such as heating oil and liquefied petroleum gas, who suffer most. Despite the warm words about such homes and about the people who use those energy sources, precious little has been done to warm them up. They tend to come at the end of the queue. What can the right hon. Gentleman say to assure me that in future, people in hard-to-treat homes off the gas grid will come at the front of the queue?</p>

 I recognise that that is an issue to consider throughout the country, including in the hon. Gentleman's constituency, and I shall try to explain our strategy to him. First, we have said that social price support will be focused on electricity bills, to ensure that everyone gets the benefit of it, not just those on the gas grid. Secondly, we have recently increased the amount that poor households off the gas grid can get under Warm Front to a £6,000 maximum grant for oil-based or renewable heating systems. Thirdly, the renewable heat incentive is being introduced, precisely to encourage the take-up of different forms of heating by those who are not on the gas grid, and fourthly, the community energy-saving programme will work in rural areas to see what can be done to provide whole-house efficiency. There is more that we can do, but we are trying to make a difference to the households that are difficult to reach.</p>

 Would my right hon.

There seems to be some concern that it is taking up to six months. In this weather, that is six months too long.</p>

 My hon. Friend asks an important question. The amount of money allocated to the Warm Front programme was due to fall next year. Thanks to the Chancellor-in tough times-making the decision to allocate another £150 million to it, the amount of Warm Front money will be significantly enhanced next year. That should help with some of the queuing issues to which my hon. Friend refers. Warm Front is a very popular programme-lots of households want to take advantage of it-and it is good that the Chancellor recognises both its importance and its success, and has provided more resources for it.</p>

1.5 million homes a year are being insulated and getting the help they need. The Warm Front programme, which did not exist before, has helped 2 million homes since its inception. There is more to do.

We must ensure, for example, that the fast-track financing for developing countries comes on stream and we are going to make our own contribution of up to £1.5 billion on that. We also need to establish the high-level panel to look at the $100 billion financing proposals for 2020 and beyond, and we need to support the Danes in getting a critical mass of countries to support the accord.

 As has been mentioned, those households that do not have the benefit of mains gas are more liable to suffer fuel poverty because of the cost of alternative fuel. Historically, the liquefied petroleum gas market has been very uncompetitive, but the Office of Fair Trading has now introduced regulations to bring more competition into the market. Unfortunately many consumers do not realise the opportunities that they now have to reduce the cost of fuel. Will the Secretary of State consider a publicity programme so that those consumers can understand the opportunities they have and reduce their fuel costs?</p>

 During this period of exceptionally prolonged severe weather, staff across the transport industries and national and local highways authorities are working extremely hard to minimise the disruption caused. The Highways Agency has its fleet of 500 salt spreaders and snow ploughs out in force and has been successful in keeping the vast majority of the major road network running, helping to prevent the formation of ice and build up of snow.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o18"><a name="100107-0004.htm_para2"><a name="10010724000196">Following the severe weather in February 2009, the UKRLG-the UK Roads Liaison Group-recommended good practice of having at least six days of heavy salting capacity in the winter period, alongside a package of wider recommendations to improve resilience. The UKRLG noted that the Highways Agency was already holding a minimum of six days' continuous heavy salting capacity in winter periods. The Highways Agency entered this winter period with 13 days' capacity, and we regard this as the right response following last year's events.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o19"><a name="100107-0004.htm_para3"><a name="10010724000197">For the local road network, it is the responsibility of local authorities to decide how to respond to the UKRLG recommendations. We have kept in close contact with local authorities across the country to check how they are dealing with their own local road networks. Local authorities have told us that they increased their salt stocks at the start of the winter season compared with last year. The Local Government Association estimates that the equivalent of about 600,000 miles of road have been gritted by council gritting teams in the past 14 days, using about 38,500 tonnes of salt.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o20"><a name="100107-0004.htm_para4"><a name="10010724000198">The Department for Transport and devolved Administrations have been regularly monitoring salt supplies and stock levels across the country with the help of their agencies, local authorities and the companies that supply salt. Alongside this, mutual aid arrangements between local authorities and the Highways Agency can help to relieve areas that are experiencing particularly tight stocks of salt. The Government and the devolved Administrations have also decided that owing to the exceptional weather affecting the country, they should work in partnership to advise salt suppliers on priorities for deliveries. The LGA will assist with that process. A group started the national prioritisation work this week. That will help to ensure that stocks of salt are supplied to where they are most needed.</p>

As far as I can tell, not a single pavement has been gritted by my Conservative council in East Sussex-not even those around doctors' surgeries, bus stops, supermarkets or anything else.

I am conscious that in my local primary care trust area, and in the acute trust in Brighton, which has done very well, about 1,500 people have been through the system with injuries such as broken wrists that might not have occurred had pavements been properly gritted. As a public policy point, we ought to assess the cost to the health service of the failure of some councils to use grit properly.</p>

 I thank the hon. Gentleman for his sensible points and the questions that he has raised. Let me deal with each of them, starting with salt supplies. As he is aware, there are two main salt suppliers in this country, and the supply is governed by where salt can be mined  <br>

or excavated. I am not sure whether he is suggesting that I should nationalise the industry or start procuring or producing salt. I can tell him that the Prime Minister has spoken to the chief executives of both those companies this morning to impress on them the importance of trying to excavate as much salt as possible and to get it out from the factories. The Highways Agency has procured salt from Spain and from companies in the USA, and some local authorities have been innovative in procuring it. There is a problem with salt storage. Some local authorities have problems with salt barns and with the amount of salt they can store for a long period of time, and so are governed by lack of storage space rather than not being sufficiently geared up to get as much salt as they can.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o33"><a name="100107-0004.htm_para17"><a name="10010724000215">On the hon. Gentleman's points about what has happened in his local communities, I must tell him that it is for local authorities and locally elected councils, which know their communities best, to decide where salt and grit should be laid down. The hon. Member for Meriden (Mrs. Spelman) suggested that perhaps we in Whitehall should have a map and decide which roads should be gritted. If there are problems in some areas, it is important that councillors make sure that the right parts of their communities are gritted. Clearly, there is a problem with the amount of grit available in relation to the extreme weather that we are having, and so priority assessments will need to be made. Those parts of the community that are a priority will need to be gritted.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o34"><a name="100107-0004.htm_para18"><a name="10010724000216">The hon. Gentleman's final point is important. The cost to us of bad weather, not only in financial terms, to business, but in human terms, with operations being cancelled and school hours being lost by children, is immense. However, the weather is, on all objective assessments, the worst that we have had for almost 30 years, and so a sense of perspective is required.</p>

 Perhaps I can answer the hon. Gentleman's question this way: we know that public safety demands that local authorities clear and grit certain roads; and we know that the Highways Agency is ensuring that motorways and trunk roads are gritted. However, local authorities are responsible for pavements, and it is for them to decide the priority areas in their communities. Some authorities may decide that pavements leading to and from a school or a GP's surgery are a priority, but I am not sure that I should advise local authorities on which parts of their communities need to be gritted. I am certainly not keen on any politician in Whitehall telling me or the leader of Wandsworth borough council which parts of Wandsworth need to be gritted. Local council leaders and officers in town halls know which parts of their community deserve to be gritted. However, when there is a shortage of grit, priorities need to be established and decisions made about which areas are gritted, and some inevitably will not be.</p>

 Does the Minister accept that in the guidance given by central Government, the criteria mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Basingstoke (Mrs. Miller) must be complied with? It is no good suggesting that local authorities alone can make these decisions if national suppliers are involved, as the chairman of the Highways Agency in Staffordshire, Mike Maryon, has made clear.

 I am not sure what the hon. Gentleman is suggesting we do. The salt suppliers are private companies who produce and sell salt, and local authorities decide what they need for their communities. The good practice advice given to local authorities is that there should be supplies of at least six days' worth, and they can follow that advice or not do so. Some local authorities stockpiled many weeks' worth of grit because they took the sensible course of action. The Highways Agency decided that there should be 13 days' worth of grit in our stocks. If he wants us to consider the possibility of those private companies being taken over by a public company, and therefore local authorities being told how much supply they should keep, I would not recommend that. We should work with the Local Government Association, the Highways Agency, the devolved Administrations and the salt suppliers to ensure that those parts of the country that need salt the most get it the quickest.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman's final point is a very good one. Some local authorities in rural parts of the country use farm buildings such as barns to store salt. If there are to be further prolonged periods of bad weather over the coming years, the storage of salt will be a big issue and we will need to consider whether we can set up central depots or points where it is stored and can be reached. In October, we surveyed local authorities to find out how much salt each of them had. Those that responded told us that they had at least six days' worth of salt supply. Some of the anecdotal evidence from the experience of colleagues around the country leads me to believe that that was not necessarily the case. We are looking into how much salt some local authorities had and whether they were inaccurate when they told us in October that they had six days' worth, because some clearly did not. The hon.

 The hon. Gentleman makes a good point. Bellwin funding is available, and local authorities know that the Department for Communities and Local Government can assist them in relation to that.

She was so involved in her own business that she could not even vote yesterday afternoon for a House motion that was tabled in her own name.

 I would like to add to the right hon. Gentleman's comments thanking the staff of the House. The House did not rise until about 11 o'clock on Tuesday, which left it very late for Officers and staff of the House to get home. We ought to pay tribute to them for the fact that the House has continued to operate, not least so that we could hear the urgent question answered today about the efforts that need to be taken to help people carry on with their work as usual during the cold weather.</p>

We heard the Prime Minister reassure the country again at Prime Minister's Question Time yesterday that we would ensure that we have a secure recovery, that we do not pull the plugs on the recovery, that we tackle the deficit by having fair tax measures and that we make sensible and fair choices about public spending. The public can be reassured that that is the Government's position, even though there is something of a muddle about the matter on the Tory Benches.</p>

As the right hon. Gentleman reminded the House, we have already had a 90-minute debate in Westminster Hall on 15 December, in which 17 colleagues participated. We made some progress in the motion that the House adopted last night, which he mentioned. We have not stood still, and the direction of travel is clear. It was I who tabled the motion to take the matter forward on behalf of the Government. It is a complex matter on which the Government will have to take views, but it is not for us to dictate to the House on it. It is for us to facilitate progress on a consensual basis, which is what we will do. We want further progress to be made.</p>

I said before Christmas, and reiterate today, that we want to be absolutely sure that the House can hold Ministers to account and that there can be debates so that views can be put forward. A lot of concern was raised in business questions in December about the need to have a substantive debate on Afghanistan in January. Although I have not been able to announce it today, I am aware of the time scale that the shadow Leader of the House pointed out. I reassure colleagues that I am determined that we will have a substantive debate on Afghanistan before the end of the month.</p>

That is all part of the action that has necessarily resulted in an increase in the deficit. Who would say that it was not worth increasing the deficit to make sure that we protect not only people's deposits in Icelandic banks, but confidence in financial services by the action that this Government have taken? All those things are part of what has built up the deficit. The next time anybody says that we should not have allowed public debt to rise, they should say where they think we should not have taken the action that has been so important. We will carry on with our bilateral work between not only ourselves and Iceland, but our European colleagues, to make sure that Iceland plays its part in paying back what it owes to the Government and people in this country.</p>

Quite apart from that discourtesy to the House, surely we should have a discussion in this Chamber about the document, which talks about the future of farming, food production and the food chain.

 I do not think that it matters where an urgent question comes from. If it is an important urgent question, on which Members from all parts of the House want to join in and ask questions, and if it is granted by the Speaker, it can be a positive contribution to debate in the House. It is no skin off anybody's nose for that to happen. There will be an opportunity next week to discuss energy security on an Opposition day motion. In anticipation of that debate, I can say that the National Grid Company has said that because of the cold weather there is unprecedented demand on our energy supplies, as one would expect, but that it is confident that supplies will be sustained. Indeed, the important work of repairing energy lines that are affected by falling trees cutting energy supplies is also an issue. However, there is no reason why there should not be an opportunity to ask questions in the meantime, and to debate them further next Wednesday.</p>

That would result in increased mortgage and borrowing costs for the whole UK economy.</p>

 That is an important point that I will address directly in a moment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o91"><a name="100107-0008.htm_para12"><a name="10010724000392">First, let me return to the question of the level of detail, because the House is right to ask how the sums will add up in 2013-14. In framing my remarks, I should like to draw on the excellent report from the Treasury Select Committee and the evidence presented to the Committee by the Chancellor and by Her Majesty's chief economic adviser.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o92"><a name="100107-0008.htm_para13"><a name="10010724000393">Our judgment is that the deficit must fall from £178 billion this year to £96 billion in 2013-14, a fall of £82 billion. We anticipate that £25 billion of that sum will come from growth, and the return to business as usual, including the reversion of the VAT rate, but, as the Chancellor said to the Treasury Committee, £57 billion must come from discretionary action-in other words, decisions. As the chief economic adviser said to the Committee, we have decided to deliver two thirds of that sum through spending, and one third through new taxes. On decisions on tax, we have set out plans to raise £19 billion from new taxes, which we have sought to introduce in a fair way by ensuring that 60 per cent. of them are paid by the top 5 per cent. of earners in this country. That leaves £38 billion to be secured from spending cuts.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o93"><a name="100107-0008.htm_para14"><a name="10010724000394">Capital investment must fall, as it safely can, from today's historically unprecedented level. In the 2008 pre-Budget report and the 2009 Budget, we announced substantial reductions to the overall capital spending budget, and that is set out on page 189 of the pre-Budget report book. Yes, Departments will have to cut back, which is why we have reduced our plans for current expenditure from 2011 onwards.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o94"><a name="100107-0008.htm_para15"><a name="10010724000395">That is why this pre-Budget report, together with the command paper "Putting the Frontline First", announced £20 billion of cuts and efficiencies. If the House will bear with me, I think that it will be helpful if I run through them. They include: £8 billion to be delivered by 2012-13, identified across the public sector through cutbacks in Whitehall through the operational efficiency programme; £600 million from the greater use of online systems to deliver public services; £650 million from cuts in consultancy, marketing and communication spending across government; £550 million from cutting back on quangos and arm's-length bodies; £550 million from local government, including reducing the costs of inspection; £140 million from cutting senior civil service costs by 20 per cent.; £1.4 billion from ending temporary employment measures as unemployment falls; £850 million from delaying things that can wait, or from cutting back systems such as the NHS IT programme; £900 million from asking businesses and students to pay a little more for training; £360 million from reforming the criminal justice system and legal aid; and £730 million from focusing regeneration and transport spending on areas where it is needed most.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o96"><a name="100107-0009.htm_para1"><a name="10010724000397">The House will rightly ask how such windfalls will be put to use. I will state the position bluntly, by repeating what the Chancellor said to the Treasury Committee. He said that, in the event that growth turns out to be more robust than in his forecast, borrowing would naturally fall faster, and that it would then be possible to reduce the structural deficit further in the medium term.</p>

 I received some figures this morning from my local authority. They show that, in August 1985, the youth unemployment rate was 19.1 per cent. My right hon. Friend has made a good point about people getting back into work and no longer claiming benefit. We have to have cuts and efficiency savings, but we do not want to go back to those unemployment rates.

 My hon. Friend is absolutely right. The fact that unemployment is so much lower now is a result of many of the actions that we took to ensure that businesses had flexibility over cash flow and that there was guaranteed new help for young people after nine months. We were, however, conscious of the need to do more than that, which is why we said in the pre-Budget report that no young person should be out of work for longer than six months without being offered a job, training or community service.</p>

It sets out how we will maintain our leadership in the low-carbon sector, how we will boost investment in our national infrastructure and skills, and how we will support our world-class high-tech industries. Over the next year or two, we will extend by £500 million the amount of lending available to small and medium-sized enterprises, through a 12-month extension of the enterprise finance guarantee scheme. We have created a new growth capital fund, with a new £325 million. We have created Infrastructure UK, which will help to accelerate private sector investment in new infrastructure. We are proposing to introduce a patent box, which is a reduced rate of corporation tax applying to income from patents from April 2013. We have also proposed £200 million for the strategic investment fund, of which £150 million will be routed to support low-carbon investment. We are doubling the UK's commitment to funding carbon capture and storage demonstration sites from two to four. We are increasing support for low-carbon vehicles and setting out additional funding for low-carbon industries and energy efficiency, including Warm Front.

We have heard a lot about the intentions of PIMCO and some of the quotations bandied around the House to date have, of course, been a bit selective and one-sided, if I may say so. PIMCO, reflecting on the flight to safety that brought buyers to UK bonds and brought gilt rates so low is naturally thinking about divestment into riskier assets as the world economy returns to its former state. This is not a new notion, as that was said last July.</p>

 I am trying to avoid taking the House through what would be a quite complicated economic equation, which no one will be surprised to hear I have not brought with me this afternoon. The hon.

He will know that when we have such a large structural deficit because of the action we have taken to protect the country from the worst of the economic storm, it is vital to set out for members of the public and for taxpayers, as well as for people who buy our bonds, exactly how we plan to reduce that deficit. We have set out the fastest deficit consolidation plan in the G7. Without that clarity in place, it would be quite possible for long-term interest rates to begin to rise, which would also be damaging to the success of investment in this country in the years to come. The Chancellor has thus set out a central scenario, clarifying what we think is the right judgment to make on public finances and what the consequences for growth will be.</p>

The truth is that the Conservatives have been love-bombing every audience they can find within easy reach of a press conference, and with that love-bombing has come a new lexicon of ambiguity. Thus, instead of a straight "promise", we now have a "pledge", an "aspiration", a "commitment" or a "No. 1 priority".</p>

According to the Treasury's figures, the economic recession accounts for about a quarter of Britain's deficit-that is the cyclical part of the deficit, which economic recovery will eventually eliminate-but three quarters of it is structural, and requires a structural response. The truth is not that the financial crisis has caused the fiscal crisis, but that for many years the global financial boom masked the scale of the underlying fiscal problem as this profligate Government spent the tax receipts that were the proceeds of a series of bubbles in financial assets, and property in particular, as if they were permanent features of the economic landscape. The real structural crisis that needs to be addressed is not caused by the Government's support for the banking system, as they like to imply. In fact, none of this year's £178 billion deficit is directly attributable to support provided for the banks.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o111"><a name="100107-0009.htm_para16"><a name="10010724000439">The pre-Budget report was the Government's last chance to set out a credible path to fiscal stability, to put our economy back on the road to sustainable growth and enduring prosperity, and to ensure our triple-A credit rating. They blew that chance, and now the country knows beyond doubt that only a change of Government can deliver the economic change that Britain needs. The present Government have shown themselves to be unfit for office by shirking their task in the nation's hour of economic need.</p>

 I am following the hon. Gentleman's remarks with great interest, and I am grateful to him for giving way so early in his speech. He appears to have changed tack slightly in his critique.

 It sounds as though the Chief Secretary has not been listening over the last few months.

<p><a name="stpa_o119"><a name="100107-0010.htm_para7"><a name="10010724000465">Britain's fiscal history over the past decade and a half is pretty simple. My right hon. and learned Friend created the golden legacy of low inflation, stable growth and falling unemployment, a legacy that the current Prime Minister inherited in 1997. He exploited that legacy to create a formidable image as a "prudent" Chancellor even while he was pumping up the bubble that was the root cause of the fiscal crisis that we now face. However, when the legacy ran out, he carried on spending, focused as always resolutely on the short term, spending the proceeds of his unsustainable bubble and then borrowing some more-spending and borrowing his way through the illusion of a boom. Apparently, that is his idea of building an economy that is best placed to withstand the slow-down and ready to lead the world out of the recession.</p>

 The reality is that the so-called golden legacy was an accidental consequence of sterling's ejection from the European monetary system in the early 1990s after a previous unsustainable bubble. The hon. Gentleman wants to deal with facts and figures. What estimate has he made, given that the Conservatives want to cut faster, of the effect of that on domestic demand and therefore on the recovery of our economy?</p>

 We come to the crux of the disagreement between us and the Government. If there were no factors other than the level of demand implied by fiscal stimulus, the hon. Gentleman would have a point, but the fact is that what has kept Britain going through this recession and what will see Britain grow in the recovery are continued low interest rates and relatively loose monetary policy. We do not have an automatic option of maintaining a fiscal deficit at the level that the Government would like to maintain and still being able to keep monetary policy as loose as it is now. That is the crux of the disagreement between us. In my view, there are many members of the Government who understand that perfectly well, but the Prime Minister has chosen, for electoral reasons, to ignore those voices and to insist that he maintains his fiscal stance until after the general election.</p>

 I have indicated to the hon. Gentleman that we would expect to start the process of cutting the deficit, or of reducing Government spending, in 2010-11. This Government are proposing to go on increasing Government spending. The cumulative impact of starting early, even in a modest way, is quite significant. Of course, Labour Members want to try to reduce this to a very simple issue. It is a complex balancing act. I totally accept that. Reducing the deficit is going to have to go on over many years until we get ourselves back into balance. It can go a little bit faster if the economy is growing more strongly. It needs to be mindful of the monetary policy position that the Bank of England is able to offer at any given time. It needs to be mindful of wider macro-economic circumstances.</p>

Citibank, which provides one of the highly qualified commentators quoted by the hon.

How does he explain the case of Japan in the 1990s? It followed exactly that policy. When recovery started, it raised the sales tax and reduced expenditure, and it went into a double-dip recession. How does he also explain that Roosevelt through the new deal expanded the economy, and as it began to come out of the slump, as a result of increasing taxes and reducing public expenditure, it went into a further slump that did not end until the war?

 The right hon.

that Treasury paper setting out the reality of 17 per cent. cuts in all other Departments, and I asked the Chief Secretary twice on Tuesday to deny the existence of that internal paper, but neither of them could do so. Instead, they got their civil servants to engage in producing costings of a bunch of fantasy policies, which Labour party officials then worked into a dodgy dossier-that fell apart even more quickly than the pre-Budget report did.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o154"><a name="100107-0011.htm_para14"><a name="10010724000540">So let me ask the Chief Secretary now-I will happily give way to him-whether the Government are going to address the biggest gap in their credibility by publishing a comprehensive spending review or departmental spending allocations for 2011-12 and 2012-13 before the general election. Will the electorate be told how the Government plan to deliver the fiscal consolidation that they have set out in aggregate in this pre-Budget report and that they claim is the proof of their commitment to restoring fiscal discipline? Or will we have to guess?</p>

 Let me deal with the hon. Gentleman's second point first. I have set out clearly in my presentation to the House this afternoon how we see £82 billion of deficit reduction taking place. Some £25 billion will come from growth measures and £57 billion from discretionary measures-tax will account for £19 billion of that and the rest will have to come from cuts and efficiencies in public spending. As he will recall from 1998, when comprehensive spending reviews were introduced, the whole point of them is about certainty; they are designed to give public service leaders and managers certainty about budgets for a period of three years. If a £4 billion or £5 billion margin of error remained because one cannot be clear about how fast unemployment will fall, that would be bigger than the budgets of four or five different Departments. If one cannot provide certainty about how much money is available, that defeats the object. We are happy to provide certainty, where that is possible. We know that the Conservative party is more than happy to provide four or five different positions on departmental budgets over the course of a day, but that is not an example that we wish to emulate.</p>

 So, as I said, we are expected to believe that it is possible to be absolutely precise about the protected budgets but not about the budgets that will be sacrificed. In addition, I did not hear the Chief Secretary answer the question about the paper on 17 per cent. cuts. That is important because in terms of defence, a 17 per cent. cut is equivalent to more than the entire pay and pensions bill for all the armed forces or a staggering 150 new Chinook helicopters every year. In terms of transport, it represents the entire budget for London and the south-east: for trains, roads, bus subsidies and the tube. For the Ministry of Justice, a cut of 17 per cent. of the budget is the equivalent of 50,000 prison places-that is 60 per cent. of the UK's total gone. No wonder the Chancellor thinks that this is not a time for a spending review. The Chief Secretary may not like my examples, but if he will not spell out the consequences of his plans, it will fall to us to do so. The Government want the political gain of setting budgets in certain Departments without taking the political pain of recognising the consequences of that ring-fencing for other Departments. That is dishonest and disreputable, and it will ultimately backfire on them.</p>

everyone understands that it is very difficult for a Government, at this point in the cycle with the opinion polls where they are and with the Prime Minister insisting on his ridiculous dividing lines, to send reassuring signals to the market. The trick-the task for an incoming new Government-will be to reassure the markets sufficiently to finance the debt and keep interest rates low and to do the absolute minimum that is necessary to maintain interest rates at that level. That is a constant balancing act, which requires constant trimming and tacking.</p>

Friend the Member for Macclesfield (Sir Nicholas Winterton) earlier-that although market confidence matters for Governments, it also matters for our public services. We must not lose sight of that point. Next year, we will spend £44 billion on interest payments on the national debt. By 2013, that figure will have risen to £63.7 billion if interest rates stay as they are. But interest rates on British Government debt have already started to rise. By 2013, for every extra 1 per cent. of interest cost that we face, another £14 billion of public spending cuts will be needed to finance it. We are already spending more than the schools budget on debt interest, and by 2013 we will be spending double that budget on debt interest.

<p><a name="stpa_o169"><a name="100107-0012.htm_para11"><a name="10010724000588">This pre-Budget report is the dying gasp of a weak, divided and incompetent Government. [Hon. Members: "Here we go."] Yes, here we do go. This is a Government led by a Prime Minister who has betrayed the office he holds by blocking the tough action to deal with the deficit that the Treasury has advised is necessary. He is placing the prosperity of millions of British people in jeopardy for the sake of his wretched dividing lines, and he is gambling on their jobs to try to save his own. There will be £789 billion-worth of extra borrowing over the next six years, doubling the national debt again to nearly £1.5 trillion. There is no credible plan for dealing with the deficit, no honesty on spending and certainly no spending review. There will be a higher deficit in 2013-14, as a percentage of gross domestic product, than when Denis Healey went to the International Monetary Fund.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o170"><a name="100107-0012.htm_para12"><a name="10010724000589">As Labour is too weak to take the action necessary to tackle the deficit, it has had to admit in the PBR that a Labour victory in the general election would mean, as has already been announced, an extra £7.8 billion-worth of taxes, which is £370 per family. The vast majority of that money will come from the national insurance tax increase, which will affect everyone who earns more than £14,000. It would also mean a further £30 billion-worth of tax increases, which are shown in the figures but unexplained. That is another £925 per family being hidden from view until after the election.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o171"><a name="100107-0012.htm_para13"><a name="10010724000590">Despite the Government's best efforts at obfuscation, this PBR has made crystal clear the reward that the people of Britain would get if they were to re-elect this Government: higher taxes and higher interest rates. The PBR is an admission of surrender; it is the capitulation of new Labour. Labour is abandoning any pretence of being serious about restoring the public finances to health and getting Britain back on the road to prosperity. It is abandoning all those who are working, striving and saving for a better future for themselves and their children. It is retreating to its core support and turning its back on aspiration. It is failing the country in its hour of economic need. If the Prime Minister does not have the courage or the competence to deliver the change that Britain needs, let him at least do the decent thing and call an election at the earliest opportunity and let somebody else try to undo the damage that this wretched Government are doing to Britain's credibility and creditworthiness, before it is too late.</p>

 I strongly welcome the Government's decision to accept the Treasury Committee's recommendation to hold a full day's debate on the pre-Budget report. That is an important step in parliamentary scrutiny of public finances. In that respect, I thank the staff of the Treasury Committee. We took evidence from the Chancellor, his officials and experts in the last week before the Christmas recess, and work was done to write the report during the Christmas recess. The report was agreed only on Tuesday and printed on Wednesday. I thank both the staff and my colleagues on the Committee for that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o172"><a name="100107-0012.htm_para14"><a name="10010724000592">The main issue that we considered was the macro-economy, which is best described by the word "uncertainty". Uncertainty is certainly present in the economy, whether in bank lending, the future path of unemployment or even GDP growth. We noticed that that is causing some businesses to delay making important decisions that  <br>

could benefit the economy, such as investing and hiring staff. Mention has been made of the scepticism among some economists about the 2011-12 growth forecast, given the considerable degree of uncertainty. It is therefore critical that the Treasury should provide more quantitative information on the risks in relation to its forecasts, especially on economic output.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o173"><a name="100107-0012.htm_para15"><a name="10010724000593">As has been mentioned, there has been some good news. Unemployment has been substantially lower than was expected for such a severe recession, and there have been fewer repossessions than expected. Business insolvencies are also far lower than would have been expected in previous recessions, and the recent manufacturing statistics show promise. Much of that is due to the Government's policy of supporting households and businesses through the recession with fiscal measures. It is obvious that the fiscal input has worked in such cases; without them, the recession would most certainly have become a depression.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o174"><a name="100107-0012.htm_para16"><a name="10010724000594">However, we must be vigilant about a further weakening in the labour market. As we feared, young people in particular have been hit by the recession. In November, youth unemployment in the UK reached a record high of 943,000, or 19.8 per cent. So, I welcome the Government's measures to support youth employment, but I urge them to do more to ensure that young people who are unemployed have the opportunity to get into the labour market, because statistics show that if young people are unemployed for a considerable time, their life chances are impaired as a result.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o175"><a name="100107-0012.htm_para17"><a name="10010724000595">House prices have also settled, but at a historically high loan-to-income ratio that may be unsustainable, especially if monetary policy eventually tightens. The concern over repossessions means that the Government must remove support in this area very carefully. The Committee urges them to report in this year's Budget on the housing market's sensitivity to future fluctuations in employment and interests rates.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o176"><a name="100107-0012.htm_para18"><a name="10010724000596">As we have known for quite a long time, bank lending, sadly, remains uncertain. As a Committee, we do not want a return to easy credit, but neither do we want the economy to be crippled by a lack of access to credit. That is particularly important for those businesses that still cite the lack of finance as their most pressing problem. I still receive communications on a regular basis from businesses telling me about their difficulties with the banks in that respect. There is a danger, therefore, that bank lending may not support recovery in the private sector, and the Treasury has assured the Committee that it will remain vigilant in this regard.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o177"><a name="100107-0012.htm_para19"><a name="10010724000597">The Government have put in place measures to improve businesses' access to finance, and that is commendable. However, I would like future measures to be aimed at encouraging non-bank sources of finance for businesses, and especially for small and medium-sized ones, so that they are not so dependent on the banking sector in the future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o178"><a name="100107-0012.htm_para20"><a name="10010724000598">Adam Posen, a recent member of the Monetary Policy Committee, appeared before the Treasury Committee and said that the UK lacked a spare tyre for when the banking sector goes into crisis-a lack that means that any future recovery will be threatened. Posen compared the UK to Japan, saying:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o179"><a name="100107-0013.htm_para0"><a name="10010724000599">due to the concentration of banking in a few large firms, and the comparative lack of non-bank sources of finance for companies. The UK's banking structure, he said,</p>
<a name="100107-0013.htm_brev1"><a name="10010724000800"><ul><p class="tabletext">"could impede the return of trend growth in the UK to its previous rate, and...could if things worsen put on persistent deflationary pressure",</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o181"><a name="100107-0013.htm_para2"><a name="10010724000601">Economies with up-to-date banking systems, or which have alternatives to bank lending, are the ones that recover faster and stronger. The need to reform our banking system is hugely important. We cannot continue with just five or six big companies: that spare tyre is needed, and it is needed urgently.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o182"><a name="100107-0013.htm_para3"><a name="10010724000602">Going forward, we need to rebalance the economy away from consumption. Before the crisis, there was a steady decline in the household saving ratio, from over 14 per cent. in 1981 to zero in 2007. The recent bounce in the saving ratio up to 8.6 per cent. must be maintained if we are to have a strong economic recovery. Increasing household saving may not be achieved through macro-economic policy alone. I believe that we will need to widen access to savings products, and introduce new products appropriate for groups who were not targeted before.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o183"><a name="100107-0013.htm_para4"><a name="10010724000603">The Treasury Committee has welcomed a number of Government measures in this area, such as the Saving Gateway, and I hope that further measures will be brought forward. I well remember the report that we published in 2004-05 on restoring confidence in long-term savings, in which we said that savings was a middle-class industry. A lot of people do not have access to savings and are not being encouraged to save, and that is an issue for the Government to take up.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o184"><a name="100107-0013.htm_para5"><a name="10010724000604">On the public finances, there is a fine judgment to be made over fiscal consolidation, especially given the macro-economic uncertainty. The Committee said that withdrawing fiscal support too early could plunge the country back into recession, with dire consequences for growth and employment that would cost the Exchequer more in the long run.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o185"><a name="100107-0013.htm_para6"><a name="10010724000605">The Governor of the Bank of England told the Committee that we needed to act "at the right time" but, as we all know, there is no consensus on what the right time for fiscal consolidation is. The Committee pored over that very question, but more clarity will be required to achieve that consensus.</p>

<p><a name="st_o367"><a name="10010724000606"><a name="100107-0013.htm_spnew0"><a name="10010724001212"><b>Ms Keeble:</b>
 Does my right hon. Friend recall that, when the Committee considered the scale and speed of fiscal consolidation, all the experts from whom we took evidence agreed that faster or deeper fiscal tightening would hit support for pensioners? Would that not be the unacceptable price of tighter spending cuts?</p>

tackled after the next election. We also feel that the Treasury could provide more quantitative information on the public finances. As the shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury has said,</p>
<a name="100107-0013.htm_brev2"><a name="10010724000801"><ul><p class="tabletext">"there is a sense that the Treasury are using uncertainty to suit themselves."</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o187"><a name="100107-0013.htm_para8"><a name="10010724000609">The PBR gives some forecasts to as far ahead as 2015, and illustrative projections to as far ahead as 2018, despite any worries about uncertainty. It could therefore be considered arbitrary that the Treasury fails to produce projections of future expenditure, or at least of the split between departmental expenditure limits and annually managed expenditure.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o188"><a name="100107-0013.htm_para9"><a name="10010724000610">The Treasury must also provide more quantitative information on the risks around its forecasts for the public finances, given the degree of uncertainty surrounding them. We realise that the Fiscal Responsibility Bill will tie the Government into a fixed time scale for managing the deficit. The fact that that will require close parliamentary monitoring makes transparency all the more important.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o189"><a name="100107-0013.htm_para10"><a name="10010724000611">The Committee notes the risk, however small, of another uncovered gilt auction and yields rising. Quantitative easing is slowing, and there will still be large gilt auctions in 2010-11. However, we also note the methods now employed by the Government to reduce the risk of uncovered auctions, and welcome the fact that there have been no further uncovered auctions since our Budget 2009 report.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o190"><a name="100107-0013.htm_para11"><a name="10010724000612">The Treasury Committee report, like many earlier reports, also mentions child poverty. As a Committee, we remain convinced of the continued importance of the commitment to eradicating child poverty, despite the difficult economic circumstances.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o191"><a name="100107-0013.htm_para12"><a name="10010724000613">Given the recent slowdown in progress on the child poverty targets, and the likelihood that this year's target will be missed, it is vital that the Government set out a credible plan to tackle child poverty, going forward. It is vital that the Government set out the steps that they propose to take to achieve the 2010 target, and to achieve the elimination of child poverty by 2020-a very bold but also a very proud manifesto commitment in 1997.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o192"><a name="100107-0013.htm_para13"><a name="10010724000614">I turn now to the question of the bank payroll tax. The Treasury Committee has been at the forefront in calling for change in the culture of banking, but estimates suggest that the Treasury now expects to receive about £3 billion or £4 billion from the tax when it originally expected only £500 million. That shows that the banking culture has not changed-that banks have simply gone ahead and paid out the bonuses. That is hugely important, because there is public anger about this matter. People are not fooled, and they realise the extent of the bank bail-out. I made that point yesterday to the Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee of the Scottish Parliament, when I was giving evidence to its inquiry. It is important that we remind ourselves of that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o193"><a name="100107-0013.htm_para14"><a name="10010724000615">The Treasury purchased £37 billion of shares in RBS and the Lloyds Banking Group; it gave indemnity to the Bank of England for £200 billion of quantitative easing; it has also agreed to guarantee up to £250 billion of wholesale borrowing by banks; it provided about £40 billion of loans and other funding to Bradford &amp; Bingley and the Financial Services Compensation Scheme; and it insured banks' assets to the tune of £280 billion. The National Audit Office, in a recent report, suggested that the net cash outlay for the purchase of shares in banks  <br>

and the lending to Northern Rock will be about £117 billion, with a gross outlay of £131 billion. As a result, the Government's commitment to banks is 60 per cent. of GDP, and the value of that is 83 billion working days. The consequences for the UK are stark, but so are the consequences for the world. The International Monetary Fund says that 10 per cent. of global GDP will be lost for ever as a result of the banking crisis.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o194"><a name="100107-0013.htm_para15"><a name="10010724000616">The banking crisis, which prompted the financial crisis, is at best halfway over. The IMF estimates the total non-performing assets in the world to be worth $3.4 trillion, of which only $1.7 trillion has been written down. So a second bank bail-out will not be tolerated in the United Kingdom or in other European countries. I have visited Germany, Austria and Belgium in the past few weeks, and I got that message. It will also not be tolerated in the United States, which I visited, too. Now is the time to fix the banking system, and I think that we have four to five years to change the financial architecture. That is why the Treasury Committee announced a few weeks ago that it would be undertaking an exercise on the "too big to fail" issue, which seemed to be brushed under the carpet last March, but has since been revived.</p>

 The right hon. Gentleman is making a powerful point about the action that would need to be taken either to reduce the size of banks or to ensure that they were not too big to fail. Why does he think that, despite his Committee's report last year, his many comments and his input over the past year, the Government have not taken any action to deal with the issue that he highlights?</p>

<p><a name="st_o370"><a name="10010724000618"><a name="100107-0013.htm_spnew3"><a name="10010724001215"><b>John McFall:</b>
 The Government have taken some action, but the issue is complex nationally and internationally. We see that from the tax on bank bonuses, whereby we have had a kick-back from the City, because some companies have said that they want to relocate. However, there is an international dimension, too. Given that we exist in a globalised world, we need to fix the matter globally, and that is a very difficult job. Like the Treasury Committee, others have taken to the stage and commented for a considerable period.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o195"><a name="100107-0013.htm_para16"><a name="10010724000619">For example, the Governor of the Bank of England, who has appeared before our Committee, has been explicit on the issue. When we visited America, we met Paul Volcker, a former chairman of the Federal Reserve, who said that there was an issue that needed to be tackled. Indeed, he went further than any of us by saying that he wanted sound evidence from the banking sector that any financial innovation in the past 20 years had led to economic growth. The only financial innovation for which he gives the banking system credit is the ATM. There is deep scepticism.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o196"><a name="100107-0013.htm_para17"><a name="10010724000620">Nicholas Brady, a former US Treasury Secretary under Ronald Reagan, had an article in the <i> Financial Times </i>this week, in which he said explicitly that the "banking system is unsound." Core reforms are essential if we are to provide the system with safety and soundness. People want safe deposits. One of the hardest questions that I asked the bank chief executives when they appeared before the Committee was, "Do you agree with the 'Oxford English Dictionary' definition of a bank, which is an institution for the safe keeping of people's money? If you do, you have screwed up." That is the issue: the consumer wants trust and confidence in the banking system to be restored.</p>

 My point was, given everything that the right hon. Gentleman says, which people widely recognise, the Government are responsible for ensuring that the banking system works better than he describes.

The Governor of the Bank of England came before the Committee and made this very point. It is a one-way bet for the banking system: if people do well, they get big rewards; if they do badly, they get big rewards. The Government need to go further on the issue of incentives in the banking system, because the incentive structure has distorted the long-term health of the banking institutions. People have had short-term returns but long-term instability. That is why we have joined with all these eminent people such as Mervyn King, Paul Volcker and Nicholas Brady; no doubt I will add the hon.

 The hon. Gentleman should take his colleague, the hon. Member for Windsor, for a quiet tutorial and make that point to him. The banking community has been absent from this debate; people have put their heads under the radar. If they do not want inappropriate legislation and heavy regulation, they will have to engage in this issue and ensure that we get a system that works-that we go back to a market system that operates in the interests of everyone in society.

 We have had two debates on the economy this week. I judged, wrongly, that this would be the centre of attention, but the Chancellor and the shadow Chancellor clearly took a different view. Nevertheless, I persist in my belief that this is an important debate, for several reasons. First, it centres on the pre-Budget report, which was a very important event, however we judge it. As the Chairman of the Treasury Committee pointed out, the debate represents an advance, albeit a small one, in parliamentary accountability, because it represents an acceptance that the PBR should be subject to debate. Moreover, we now have access to the Treasury Committee's review of the PBR, which we did not have on Tuesday.

<p><a name="stpa_o200"><a name="100107-0013.htm_para21"><a name="10010724000629">I want to say something about the deficit and the controversies surrounding it; something about the issue that dominated the PBR but has now largely been forgotten-the banking tax, and what has happened to it; and something about the long term, because we are very preoccupied with the short-term fiscal position. There was an interesting half one-liner in the PBR about the creation of an infrastructure bank and a vision of how the economy could develop in the very long term, and we need to refocus some of our attention on long-term structural issues.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o201"><a name="100107-0013.htm_para22"><a name="10010724000630">I start with the deficit. This debate has been a good deal less emotional than bits of the one that I heard on Tuesday, in which the right hon. Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field) among others proclaimed that the fiscal crisis was comparable to the crisis in 1940. Other speeches were at a similar level of emotion. Today everybody has been a little bit calmer, but we clearly have a serious problem and it is helpful to start by stating what the deficit problem is.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o202"><a name="100107-0013.htm_para23"><a name="10010724000631">There are two linked problems: a deficit or borrowing problem and a debt problem-a cash flow problem and a balance sheet problem. The problem of debt and the balance sheet is clearly serious, because the situation is deteriorating rapidly. However, as is often pointed out from various parts of the House, as things stand the level of British public debt in relation to the economy is actually one of the lowest in the developed world and much lower than at various periods historically.</p>

Friend the Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood) and my hon. Friend the Member for Braintree (Mr. Newmark) have made that the figure is not £850 billion, as is suggested. The true figure, which I believe is now endorsed by our Front Benchers-it certainly appears to be-is nearer £3 trillion, and maybe more. If the measurement is out by a factor of three or four, does the hon. Gentleman not agree that that underlines all the difficulties about what the deficit is and what the definition of net debt should be?</p>

 I am sure it does but, equally, other developed countries have the same problem of incorporating public sector pensions. However, I accept the hon. Gentleman's broad point that there is clearly a problem. A more acute one is the borrowing problem. Some 13 to 14 per cent. of GDP is currently being borrowed, and it is being done in a very artificial way because the Government are buying up their own debt in the current strange monetary circumstances. The level of borrowing is unprecedented, I believe, and it is the highest in the developed world except possibly the United States, which is in the rather different position of being able to borrow in its own currency. There is a serious cash-flow problem, which we must take seriously and which is at the heart of the debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o203"><a name="100107-0013.htm_para24"><a name="10010724000636">Two policy issues come out of that problem, both of which have been touched on. There is the historical problem of how we got into this situation and who is to blame, and the forward-looking problem of what we do next and how we manage what we all accept to be a difficult balance. The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond) summarised in numbers how we got here and why we have our public financing problem. Roughly a quarter of the problem is accounted for by the cycle, the ups and downs of the economy and the recession, and three quarters is structural. The problem is that the word "structural" is bandied around, but it is never terribly clear what people actually mean when they use it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o204"><a name="100107-0013.htm_para25"><a name="10010724000637">I know that the Conservative argument has always been that the structural problem is the "hole in the roof" showing the neglect of the budget over many years. That argument is partly true, but the problem with it is that the hole in the roof was actually quite small. I have been doing this job for five or six years now, and I remember debating the matter with the predecessors of the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge, the right hon. Member for West Dorset (Mr. Letwin) and the former Member for Arundel and South Downs, who had an unfortunate slip-up at the last general election. When we talked about the structural deficit then, we were talking about roughly 1 per cent. of GDP. Now we are talking about something rather different-an over-dependence of the economy on the banking sector and to some extent on the ups and downs of the housing market as a source of revenue. It is quite right that we now talk about how to adjust the level of public spending down to one that relates to stable sources of revenue. That is what we mean by the structural debate.</p>

Treasury Committee touched on this, but it is a fact that in the British economy, the balance sheets of the banks together account for about four times gross domestic product, which is about four times as large as in France or Germany, and much more than in the United States. We cannot sustain that position and it must be changed. Equally, our economy has become highly over-dependent on people's belief that property prices rise and rise, which we also need to address. That is the real structural debate, but we are not having it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o206"><a name="100107-0014.htm_para1"><a name="10010724000639">On the background and the history, it is certainly true that the bulk of the problem we are now dealing with is structural rather than to do with the cycle of recession. It is almost unique to Britain and it is not shared by the US and other countries. That takes us to what we do next and how we manage the situation. I was struck that in the more temperate passages of the speeches from the Government and Conservative Front Benchers, there was an acknowledgement that that is a very tricky balancing act.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o207"><a name="100107-0014.htm_para2"><a name="10010724000640">It is certainly true that unless action is taken quickly, or at least unless action is seen to be taken quickly, there is a real risk of a sovereign debt crisis, with all the consequences that that brings-higher interest rates and the downgrading of credit worthiness, which is a real issue, not just a hypothetical one. On the other hand, we must balance that against the fact that precipitant action before private consumption and private investment get going risks aggravating and prolonging the recession, which in turn would make the public financing problem even worse. Getting that balance right is incredibly difficult, and nobody should pretend that there is any simple dogma that gives the correct solution.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o208"><a name="100107-0014.htm_para3"><a name="10010724000641">The Government and Conservative Front Benchers quoted economists on various sides of the argument. The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge cited the <i> Financial Times </i>survey of 80 economists that was taken over the new year period. The result was rather predictable: they were roughly divided 50:50 on what we do about the problem. Some were predictably in the half who argued that we should just get on with the job and start slashing the deficit-it included Professor Patrick Minford and Ruth Lea, and Philip Booth of the Institute of Economic Affairs, who have an ideological dislike of the public sector. However, it is fair to say that that half also included sensible, balanced people, of no obvious ideological inclination, who believe, for perfectly good economic reasons, that we must get on with the job.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o209"><a name="100107-0014.htm_para4"><a name="10010724000642">The other half, who were equally reputable, interesting and varied, said, "Actually, we have got to be very careful, and it would be rather foolish to embark on big cuts in public spending before 2011." It is worth while going through some of the names in that half: David Blanchflower and Sushil Wadhwani, former members of the Monetary Policy Committee; Julian Le Grand of the London School of Economics; George Magnus of the UBS bank; Sir Samuel Brittan; John Philpott of the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development; Andrew Hilton of the Centre for the Study of Financial Innovation; and Peter Spencer of the Ernst and Young ITEM Club. I have no idea of the politics of many of those people, but they are all arguing on good economic grounds that it would be dangerous to embark too rapidly on slashing public spending. The argument is therefore finely balanced.</p>

 The hon.

 I do not think we should rush into rapid cuts. One of my areas of disagreement with the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge is that I do not think there is a strong case for that. It is a difficult issue and there is a balance to be struck, but rushing into expenditure cuts in 2010-11 would carry a greater risk of precipitating deeper recession. My party takes the view that the Government's eight-year plan, with a four-year halving of the deficit, is a reasonable starting point.

 I do not think that Scotland is fundamentally different from the rest of the UK. We all face the same problem and we are all experiencing the beginning of cuts. For example, I am meeting the Minister for Science and Innovation in a few days' time about the impact of cuts in that sphere. We cannot have an indiscriminate approach to public spending reduction, and my argument is not that the cuts should not happen, in Scotland or anywhere else, but that they have to be much more carefully thought through and targeted.

I would add the additional, and most serious, criticism that the Government have mobilised to raise taxes-£113.5 billion over four years-but instead of using that money to consolidate the budget, as they will surely have to do as they themselves acknowledge, they have committed it to additional spending. That is surely wrong and has sent all the wrong signals.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman will accept that a judgment has been made about the right level of deficit in the next financial year when the economy will still be growing at a rate below trend. In the subsequent year, there will be a sharp fiscal tightening, but that will be at a time when the economy will be growing at above trend. There is an element of judgment involved, and the Government have made a decision about the right level of deficit commensurate with the forecasted level of growth in the economy.</p>

<p><a name="st_o385"><a name="10010724000654"><a name="100107-0014.htm_spnew5"><a name="10010724001230"><b>Dr. Cable:</b>
 I am sure that that is right: the extent and timing of the fiscal contraction have to reflect the state of the economy. I have suggested five tests that might be used to ensure that, one of which is-obviously-the rate of growth. Another is the growth of unemployment. Another one has to be the state of the borrowing markets.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o216"><a name="100107-0014.htm_para11"><a name="10010724000655">I hope that the Government are right about the expectations of economic growth. I hope for rapid economic growth because hundreds of thousands of people's jobs hinge on it, but one has to be realistic: an awful lot of factors are holding back growth, and are likely still to be doing so in a year. Private consumers are unlikely to embark on another spending splurge when they are heavily in debt. We have an underlying problem that British consumer debt in relation to the economy is the largest in the developed world, and certainly the largest in our history for a very long period. It would be surprising-and probably unwise, in many cases-were people to rush out and start spending.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o217"><a name="100107-0014.htm_para12"><a name="10010724000656">Private sector business investment is unlikely to take off rapidly. There is an enormous amount of spare capacity, but as the Chairman of the Treasury Committee just reminded us, there is a severe credit squeeze. That will be even more the case once we enter a period of expansion, because the banks are over-reacting to the crisis and not lending to sound British companies. We will not get any growth from public spending, whether consumption or investment. The entire expectation of economic growth rests on exports, but actually they are a relatively small part of the British economy. It will require a near miracle to achieve the kind of growth for which the Government, and indeed all of us, hope. Frankly, we have to be realistic about that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o218"><a name="100107-0014.htm_para13"><a name="10010724000657">I want to comment on two other aspects of the PBR that have not today received the attention they probably should have done. One is the Government's tax on bank bonuses, which was put together in a hurry. Given that it is a fairly short-term tax, I hope that, in the conclusion to the debate, the Chief Secretary or his colleague, having had a month's reflection, can summarise what,  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="7 Jan 2010">

in their judgement, has been the impact of the tax. Furthermore, how are they meeting some of the criticisms that have been thrown at the tax, of which there have been several? The first was advanced from the Liberal Democrat Benches. We were very sceptical about the ability of the tax to capture bank bonuses because of the numerous opportunities for potential avoidance, through multiple payments of bonuses, payments in salary and payments in kind, and it would be useful to have an assessment of how far the Government think they have plugged those various potential holes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o219"><a name="100107-0014.htm_para14"><a name="10010724000658">Secondly, the Government themselves argued that the main purpose of the tax was to change the behaviour of the banks, to discourage them from paying out bonuses and to encourage them to build up their capital reserves. Are the Government in a position to estimate how much capital reserves will be changed-improved, from the Government's standpoint-as a result of the measure? It was all done in a hurry and we did not get much analysis at the time. Can the Government now tell us what they think?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o220"><a name="100107-0014.htm_para15"><a name="10010724000659">Thirdly, we are being told by the banks themselves, rightly or wrongly, that they are all now stumping up the money, that they are paying it and that the Government will receive a lot more than £500 million. What is the current estimate of the amount of money that will be raised? Finally, over the holiday period, we heard many rumours and much speculation about banks running off to Switzerland and other places because they object to paying this high tax and other things. I suspect that much of that is rhetoric and an attempt to blackmail the Government.</p>

 Indeed, I think I was the first person to advocate that, and I am certainly willing to go along with other people who say the same thing.

 Yes, although I think the hon. Gentleman is making several different points. The short-term intervention in the form of the bank tax must not obscure the much bigger issue of how bank bonuses will be regulated in future in such a way that banks do not take excessive risks.

about the bank tax. In view of what appears to be its rather greater success in raising revenue than some of us predicted, do the Government now intend the tax to be a permanent feature or, as was implied at the time, does it merely cover the period up to the end of March this financial year?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o221"><a name="100107-0014.htm_para16"><a name="10010724000664">My final point relates to a small detail in the PBR, but none the less an important one in the long term, which is the concept of an infrastructure bank. We must not constantly be sucked into negative thinking about cuts in the short run, overlooking the problem of how we create a more viable and balanced economy in the longer term. Several serious people-not just in the engineering industry, but in the insurance industry-have surfaced in the past few weeks to indicate that this area represents both a big challenge and a big opportunity. The chief executive of Legal and General, for example, has pointed out that he has hundreds of billions of pounds sitting in his institution in annuity funds, much of which is currently going into buying American corporate bonds. He has asked, "Why can't I put this money into British infrastructure?", to build railways, barrages or other forms of useful infrastructure on a commercial basis, albeit with some Government pump-priming.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o222"><a name="100107-0014.htm_para17"><a name="10010724000665">Although the Government's proposal is modest-there is a suggestion of a co-ordinating body in the Treasury-I wonder whether the Financial Secretary could set out in his conclusion to this debate how they envisage what seems to me a constructive and sensible idea evolving in future years. What scale of operation are we thinking about? What might the Government's role be financially? The insurance companies are not asking for guarantees; they are asking for Government equity in any funding. How can that be done on a sufficiently large scale to make a difference and help to create a more balanced economy?</p>

 In the light of the disaster that we have just experienced on the economic front with the banks, just as we did in the 1850s, does the hon. Gentleman not agree that his line of reasoning perhaps leads to the idea of companies similar to the water, gas, electricity and even railway companies of the 19th century, which were supported by debenture stock, so that the elements of loan that he has mentioned are in place, but focused on companies that are not exclusively under Government control?</p>

 That is exactly the idea being promoted. The problem that we start from is that it is not now possible to envisage making large-scale investments in British infrastructure. The banks will not do it, because they are de-leveraging, and the stock markets will not do it, because of their short-term perspective in most cases, while private equity companies are worried about over-borrowing. The only mechanisms are likely to be what we now think of as new ideas, but which have a precedent in the 19th century, as the hon. Gentleman said.

the only function of Government after the forthcoming general election will be to cut public investment to reduce the current deficit. Needless to say, the Tories have been backed up in that by their friends in the news media and their friends in the finance industry, whose bail-out caused most of the problems in the first place. The deficit needs to be reduced. However, it should not be allowed to take priority over the continuing duties of Government to ensure that the people of this country have jobs and homes, schools and hospitals, pensions and policing, and transport and other local services at home, and peace and security abroad. However, this debate is substantially about the deficit, so I shall concentrate on that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o224"><a name="100107-0014.htm_para19"><a name="10010724000670">There were three main causes of the present financial crisis. The first was the need to find the money to bail out and prop up the banking system. I would remind the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond) that most of those people whom he has described as wise and wonderful and able to prognosticate the future would not have a job if the taxpayer had not bailed out their businesses and propped them up to prevent them from collapsing.</p>

 Just for clarification, may I remind the right hon. Gentleman that not one penny of the deficit projected for the coming year will be used for direct financing support for the banks? The money that the Government have put into the banks is of course cash, but it does not form part of the revenue deficit that the Government face.</p>

<p><a name="st_o394"><a name="10010724000672"><a name="100107-0014.htm_spnew14"><a name="10010724001239"><b>Frank Dobson:</b>
 I do not think that we needed that explanation, and I did actually understand it.</p>



<p><a name="stpa_o225"><a name="100107-0014.htm_para20"><a name="10010724000673">The second cause of the crisis was the cost of the measures to counter the recession that the banking crisis has brought about. The third was the loss of tax income that resulted from the recession, which was caused by the bankers. So it all goes back to the bankers. This is all the inevitable result of the worldwide banking crisis, and it is no use the Tories and their friends, or the bankers and their apologists, trying to blame this Government in general or the Prime Minister in particular. It is also true to say that, at almost every stage in this crisis, those on the Tory Front Bench have opposed the crucial measures that the Government have taken to save the banking industry from catastrophe, to protect jobs, homes and businesses from a deeper recession, and to get recovery under way. The Tories have opposed them all. It might be the duty of the Opposition to oppose, but surely there are limits. A bit of common sense would not go amiss now and again.</p>

One reason for that is that, unlike the hysterical analysts in the City, most people running businesses live in the real world and are level-headed. They are trying to keep their firms and their work forces together so that they will still be in business when demand for their goods and services rises again. Their efforts have been backed up by the Government's determination to keep pumping money into the economy to make up for the damage  <br>

caused by the bankers. This included bringing forward investment projects, the public purchasing of goods and services from the private sector, and the quantitative easing that has poured money into the economy. It also included the temporary reduction in VAT, which was derided by those on the Tory Front Bench and their analyst friends when the Government introduced it, although it is now acknowledged as having been a considerable help.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o227"><a name="100107-0015.htm_para1"><a name="10010724000675">We all have to recognise, however, that the effects of the recession are far from over. The recovery is under way, but it is quite fragile. Yet this is the moment that the Tories are choosing to demand massive, immediate cuts in Government spending. They claim that this would reduce the Government's deficit, but it would not, because it would involve more people being thrown out of work. Throwing people out of work does not reduce the deficit. Quite the reverse: throwing people out of work increases it. Every job lost is a triple whammy for the taxpayer. First, the taxpayer has to go without the goods and services that the job-losers used to produce. Secondly, the taxpayer has to fund the benefits needed to keep the jobless and their families. Thirdly, the taxpayer has to do without the tax that the job-losers would have paid if they were still in work.</p>

That is £12,000 per person that is added to the deficit. To put it another way, throwing someone out of work is like turning a useful member of a ship's crew into a passenger who then has to be looked after by the remainder of the crew.</p>

 It will not help the job market-<i> [Interruption.]</i> Unlike the Tory Front-Bench team, I am not living in a world of fantasy. It will not help the job market, but it is a better proposition than what we have heard from the Tories. There should be no question, in my opinion, of making cuts in public investment until the economy is well on the way to recovery and the joblessness rate is way down from what it is now.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o229"><a name="100107-0015.htm_para3"><a name="10010724000681">Apart from the cost of bailing out the bungling bankers, the main cost of the recession is the result of the reduction in economic activity. We are not producing all the goods and services that we are capable of producing. The economy is not fully operational and the best way to clear the deficit is to get the economy working at full capacity again. The only way to do that at this stage is to keep on pumping public money into the system until the private sector recovers.</p>

and auditors and the infamously incompetent ratings agencies and their friends have started saying, "Well, yes, Mrs. Thatcher's policies may have been tough, but they worked. She transformed the economy." This myth-and it is a myth-is sadly subscribed to even by many people who should know better. The fact is-and it is a fact-that the average annual economic growth under the Wilson-Callaghan Governments who preceded Mrs. Thatcher was higher than the growth in the Thatcher years, so revered by the Tories and their City analysts.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o231"><a name="100107-0015.htm_para5"><a name="10010724000683">The Thatcher Government succeeded in creating a feel-good factor by spending the massive tax takings from North sea oil and gas and the huge capital receipts from the privatisation of electricity, gas, telecommunications and other industries. These one-off assets were squandered: they were not put into a sovereign wealth fund; they were not used for long-term investment in the country's future in new manufacturing industry, in science, in research or in education; and the money was certainly not invested in training, as apprenticeships were abolished. The Tory Government used it to fund tax cuts with massive tax benefits going mostly to the rich, which appears to be the Tory policy still. Contrary to free market economic theory, the Thatcher Government did not increase economic growth; they actually reduced it.</p>

 On that same point, does my right hon. Friend agree with me that during those years and as a consequence of the particular employment policies he outlined, the number of children living in poverty increased threefold? The Institute for Fiscal Studies has calculated that if the policies in place in 1997 when the Tory Government were last in office had continued until the present day, 2.1 million more children would be living in poverty than are now and that as a result of the Government's policies, including those in the pre-Budget report last week, a million children will have been lifted out of poverty by the time of the election.</p>

Needless to say, they did not keep to it. I have been reading it and it should be filed under fiction. The fact is that they did not keep their promises. They promised to honour the pensions system they inherited, yet practically the first thing they did was to cut the link between pensions and earnings. They promised, and I quote,</p>

In one Thatcher year, inflation hit 18 per cent. while over her whole period as Prime Minister, it averaged 7.6 per cent. a year and never fell below 3.4 per cent. They promised to make better use of NHS resources, yet they gave tax breaks for private medical insurance  <br>

To find out what the Tories really intend, we need look no further than what the Tory think-tanks and supporters' groups are saying. That way, we find out what the real Tory policies are.</p>

They are threatening children and young people and their parents with the abolition of Sure Start, the ending of the education maintenance allowance, the abolition of child benefit and the child trust fund, and the ending of the interest subsidy on student loans.

Reform, which portrays itself as another influential Tory pressure group, advocates penalising pensioners for the banking crisis by abolishing the winter fuel allowance, free television licences and concessionary bus fares, and ending retirement pensions, council tax and housing benefit, widows' and war widows' pensions, carer's allowance and disability living allowance for people receiving considerably less than average pay. It is also urging the Tories to impose the same eligibility threshold for maternity pay and child benefit, and to scrap the employer-supported child care scheme, the health in pregnancy grant, the Healthy Start scheme, the Sure Start maternity grant and the education maintenance allowance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o238"><a name="100107-0015.htm_para12"><a name="10010724000700">We should beware the Tories' claims to have changed. Their supporters and paymasters have not changed. The people who will be paying for their forthcoming advertising blitz have not changed. We should resist their attacks on pay and pensions. This crisis was not caused by the potential cost of pensions for postal workers or teachers. It has not come about because social workers or nurses or bank clerks are overpaid, or because refuse collectors or shop assistants or factory workers or people gritting roads today are not working hard enough. It has come about because the overpaid bankers and their auditors could not distinguish between an asset and a liability, and the famous rating agencies could not have spotted a wrong 'un even if they had been trying.</p>

The bankers should have to pay for clearing up their pollution. Therefore, I welcome the new top rate of income tax and the bankers bonus tax. I support the proposal for a tax on all international financial transactions. I urge the Prime Minister to continue to press for a Tobin tax in collaboration with his French and German counterparts and, hopefully, shame the Americans into accepting it.</p>

The bankers have shown no signs of reining back on their excessive rewards. If the self-rewarding excess of the bankers continues while everyone else has to tighten their belts, it will lead to bitterness and social unrest. As the bankers and their public relations machines deploy their wealth and influence to scapegoat others for the consequences of the banking crisis, we are already seeing a major campaign to lay the blame on hard-working people providing vital public services. Once that sort of irrationality takes hold, once scapegoating becomes acceptable, there is no knowing where it will end.

As we are focused on the economy today, we need another sign above our desks saying, "It's the deficit, stupid" and below that perhaps another one saying "It's public expenditure, stupid." Unless we focus on getting a grip of public expenditure and on eradicating the deficit more rapidly than the Government want, we will not get the economy of this country right. The supreme weakness of the pre-Budget report-some of us may have forgotten that we are supposed to be debating that today-is that it does not focus on those things.

Secondly, the Bill is a nonsense. It is not even legally enforceable. It is not even judiciable; it is one of those rare Bills that actually has a clause that effectively says that the courts may not take note of the law incorporated in it. It is imprudent, too, because it seeks to bind, albeit unenforceably, future Governments to follow a particular path when we cannot be sure what things will be like over the next four years-let alone the next eight or 10 years, as the Bill envisages. I think that we should probably pursue a fairly ambitious path, but it is foolish to try to lay down a law on what needs to be done in future. The Bill is also a displacement activity; it is a substitute for action because the Government want to avoid action and facing reality.</p>

 My hon. Friend is absolutely right. If we leave this too late and as a result there is a crisis, we will have to take much more brutal action: instead of companies simply not recruiting, they will have to sack people; instead of voluntary redundancies, there will be compulsory redundancies.

He must be the only person who thinks that PIMCO and other bond holders are selling UK bonds because they think that they are not risky enough-because they think that the Government's finances are not putting us in sufficiently great danger of bankruptcy. The truth is that they are selling them because they think that the price does not yet fully reflect the risks and dangers of financial collapse. They know that if that happens there will be higher interest rates, and they would prefer to buy them back then rather than experience the collapse in the price and rising interest rates while still holding them.</p>

after that; after all, it was several years after the recovery had begun that the double-dip recession occurred in the United States in the 1930s. That was not because action was taken in the first or second year of the recovery; the action was taken three or four years later, in 1937. Like a lot of the arguments that the Government put forward on many of their policies, it is an argument for not doing anything.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o251"><a name="100107-0016.htm_para1"><a name="10010724000716">The second reason is that the stimulus effect of a deficit is grossly exaggerated. This country has a bigger deficit than almost any other comparable country in the world, yet it is the last to come out of recession, so there has not been a vast stimulative effect. Likewise, its removal will not have a vastly depressive effect.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o252"><a name="100107-0016.htm_para2"><a name="10010724000717">The third reason is that the Government's argument ignores the fact that the effect of action to get the deficit under control on improving confidence far outweighs the impact of the loss of Government expenditure feeding into the economy if the fiscal contraction and consolidation takes place sooner. The fourth reason is that we are dealing with a structural deficit, and the way to tackle that is to make structural changes, which takes time. If we do not start thinking them through and implementing them now, we will not get the benefits until it is too late.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o253"><a name="100107-0016.htm_para3"><a name="10010724000718">So, there are sound reasons in principle for disagreeing with the Government's view that there is a great danger in starting the process of fiscal consolidation at the first possible opportunity, and there is plenty of evidence in practice. We have seen Governments do this before. This country has previously started the process of fiscal contraction before the recovery has been long established. In 1976, the Labour Government did just that-they had to, because the International Monetary Fund told them to do so. At a recent seminar in the City, players in those past crises revealed that Jim Callaghan was quite keen to do it anyway and found what the IMF said to be a useful excuse. Lord Donoughue, the head of his policy unit at the time, said that having argued internally and with the IMF about whether they could avoid taking such action, they were struck by the fact that when they did so renewed growth in the economy came much more rapidly and strongly than they had anticipated and that the effect was positive, rather than negative.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o254"><a name="100107-0016.htm_para4"><a name="10010724000719">In 1981, the Conservative Government took such action. Some 364 economists wrote to <i> The Times</i> saying that any attempt to reduce the deficit at the bottom of the recession would turn that recession into a continuous downward spiral from which there would be no hope of recovery. Almost from the day that their letter was delivered and published in <i> The Times</i><i> , </i>and, simultaneously, Geoffrey Howe-now Lord Howe-introduced his Budget, the economy started to recover.

 We should not. We started then from a very different situation, with massive over-manning in both the public and private sectors.

That happened in other countries that moved from a very socialised economy to a more liberal one, as a result of being too socialised and too syndicated in the first place-of having that mass over-manning. My point was that the contraction in the deficit produced an expansion in output of activity.

 My hon. Friend on the Front Bench makes a valid point-the country might have been holding together, but the Government clearly are not. However, let me address directly the hon. Lady's serious and important point. I do not want to return to the previous speaker and to re-fight the battles of the '80s, but my point is that the Keynesians argued that that consolidation of the budget deficit would intensify the recession and they were proved wrong. That is the simple point that I want to put across. The economy, far from going into a deeper recession, began a strong and prolonged recovery. Perhaps the hon. Lady can think of other ways in which that recovery could have been made even greater and stronger, but she has not pointed out what they might be and nor has anybody else I know. I want to allow other people to take part in the debate, because I want to hear what they have to say.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o263"><a name="100107-0016.htm_para13"><a name="10010724000733">How do we cut expenditure? We want to cut expenditure in ways that do not throw people out of work and that do not undermine public services. We have to recognise that we have one of the most expensive public sectors in the EU. It is heading for, and is set to reach, more than half of our GDP. Moreover, one of the biggest impacts within the sector has been the increase in the pay budget. I draw the House's attention to a study produced just a few days ago by the Centre for Economics and Business Research, which gives all the facts and figures and says that if the public sector pay bill had risen in line with the private sector pay bill over the past two years, then taxes, or borrowing, could have been £11 billion lower. One of the main agents of the growth in the deficit has been the fact that the public sector pay bill has been out of control in the past couple of years. It must be brought back under control in the interests both of controlling the deficit and of reducing the impact on jobs in the public sector. We do not want to lose a single job if we can help it, if those jobs are valid or if people can be moved to do something more useful.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o264"><a name="100107-0016.htm_para14"><a name="10010724000734">We must learn to say no to new ideas-that probably applies as much to Opposition parties as to the Labour party-and we must not be in the business of adding to our spending commitments. We must also learn from the private sector the lessons of lean production and how constantly to improve the value for money that one gets from any given number of people. The way to do that is not through top-down statements that we are going to change it all through a few edicts from some great man, even though we can recruit some great experts in efficiency. Ultimately, it means doing in each Department what I started to do in my Department-the Department for Social Security-and asking people at the sharp end of the Department how they could do their job more efficiently.</p>

and they came up with an enormous range of sensible ideas for improving efficiency. The target was to improve efficiency by 25 per cent.-in other words, to reduce the number of jobs by 25 per cent.-but they participated in the exercise because no one had ever asked them before how they could do their job more effectively. They knew that they were doing lots of things in very inefficient ways, and they wanted to do them better. Most people in the public sector want to do their job better and have the public interest at heart. We must do that at the micro level, through every Department, to harness the experience and expertise of the people at the sharp end of each Department.</p>

 What has been rather depressing about listening to the speeches of Opposition Members is how exclusively they seem to be concerned about the interests of the financial markets and how little concern they appear to have about the wider interests of the people of this country. All this is rather like a double-take of the Geoffrey Howe Budget of 1981, to which the right hon. Member for Hitchin and Harpenden (Mr. Lilley) has just referred. That Budget decimated the industrial economy and, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Holborn and St. Pancras (Frank Dobson) has said, produced a lower rate of growth over the relevant period than in the preceding period of the 1970s, which was extremely difficult because of hyper-inflation due to oil prices. It is rather tragic that minds seem to be closed to the idea that there are alternative ways of dealing with the deficit that will not be so socially destructive and that could be more effective in the long run. That is what I want to discuss.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o267"><a name="100107-0016.htm_para17"><a name="10010724000740">I shall focus on one crucial aspect of the pre-Budget report, which has had a little attention today but which has not been properly faced up to: the Treasury's assumptions about growth over next year and the year after. The Chancellor's view, as he expressed it, was that the worst is over. As we all know, the contraction of 4.75 percent. in 2009 is a post-war record and borrowing this year is on course to reach a peacetime record of 12 to 13 per cent. of GDP, yet the economy is forecast to rebound by 1 to 1.5 per cent. this year, rising to 3.5 per cent. in 2011-12. That would enable the Government to achieve their target of halving the deficit within four years, without the savagery of the full cuts that the Tory are clearly planning if they were to win the election. That projected growth is absolutely crucial to the PBR strategy but where is it going to come from? That is my question.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o268"><a name="100107-0016.htm_para18"><a name="10010724000741">It is true, of course, that there are some real signs of recovery.

remains to be seen. Other factors are the slowing in the increase in unemployment, which is very welcome, the lower rise in home repossessions than in previous downturns, and the greater support for youth employment brought about by the Government's present expenditure of £5 billion on job placements for 18 to 24-year olds and the increase in training and apprenticeships. However, my question remains: all that is important and useful, but will it add up to a huge surge in growth to 3.5 per cent. within two years?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o269"><a name="100107-0016.htm_para19"><a name="10010724000742">In the boom years before the crash in 2007, household consumption contributed 1.75 per cent. of growth each year, with business adding about another 0.25 per cent. for a total of 2 per cent. That, of course, was in the fat years but now-after the worst recession since the war, the collapse of large elements of the banking industry, a big drop in house prices, a record fall in investment and with tax rises and spending cuts being promised by all parties-the Treasury is looking to household spending contributing 2 per cent. to growth in 2011-12, and to business adding another 1 per cent. I simply ask again whether that is credible.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o270"><a name="100107-0016.htm_para20"><a name="10010724000743">Unemployment is still expected to rise to 2.8 million, and family budgets remain tight. Pay cuts, pay freezes and short-shift working are still spreading across the country. I ask again: where is growth on a sufficient scale going to come from?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o271"><a name="100107-0016.htm_para21"><a name="10010724000744">In my view, the essential element missing from the PBR is a major injection of demand in the public sector. The private sector will not provide that demand, because there is no prospect of profitability until there is a much more visible turnaround in the real economy. Quantitative easing even of £200 billion has not provided the necessary level of demand up to now, as the banks have used the money not to increase lending to struggling businesses but rather to consolidate their balance sheets. In any case, we understand that the Bank of England seems minded to call a halt to quantitative easing once gilt purchases hit £200 billion in February.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o272"><a name="100107-0016.htm_para22"><a name="10010724000745">Moreover, the injection of demand that we need will certainly not come from private consumption because, as we all know, the level of consumer debt is not far short of the whole of GDP. So the only way to inject the necessary demand into a very weak and fragile economy is through massive public investment in job creation: not £750 billion, which was spent bailing out the banks; and not £200 billion of quantitative easing, which has been much less effective than expected. A fraction of that could be used to underpin large-scale job creation in sectors where it is desperately needed, such as house building.</p>

that view in the speech from the Opposition Front Bencher, the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond). The story is well known, but I am embarrassed to recall that in 1997 the then Chancellor, the current Prime Minister, said that he was pursuing a regime of neo-classical endogenous growth theory. Shorn of the unfortunate terminology, it means that demand should be generated by the enhancement of supply within the economic system: from education, improvements in training, increased research and development, which is necessary, the commercialisation of science and so on. That, combined with Friedman's quantitative money theory, which was prevalent in the 1970s, certainly provided the basis for Mrs Thatcher's macro-economic policy. It is a quixotic, old-fashioned and perverse Tory theory, and regrettably-very regrettably-new Labour took it over wholesale in 1997.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o275"><a name="100107-0016.htm_para25"><a name="10010724000748">The policy works fine when other vigorous, external sources of demand such as strong export demand from other countries, major technological breakthroughs or continuing private sector investment are in place to drive the economy, as they were in the boom years of 1994 to 2007. The policy works disastrously when there are no strong external sources of demand, as there were after the infamous 1981 budget, which over the next four years pushed unemployment up to 3.2 million; and as there are now, after 2008, when unemployment is still heading towards 3 million and when even the type of fiscal expansion that in 2000 countered the downturn from the dotcom collapse is not possible because of the budget deficit. If there was ever a time for Keynesian measures to restore demand in a very fragile economy, it is now.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o276"><a name="100107-0016.htm_para26"><a name="10010724000749">The black hole in the PBR is not the opaqueness about where the cuts will fall, as the Opposition have repeatedly taunted, but the lack of any action to create the 500,000 to 1 million jobs that the economy desperately needs. Of course, the enormous budget deficit must come down; we all agree about that. But it is far better to do so by getting people off unemployment and housing benefits and back into work, where they start contributing to income tax, national insurance and VAT. The alternative, of rapidly making drastic cuts in public expenditure, clearly appears once again to be Conservative policy-but probably on a greater scale than any of us have yet realised. However, that could well have the opposite effect of turning a deep recession into a vicious spiral of decline, and prompt an even worse double-dip slump.</p>

They did that prematurely and suffered the consequences of another lost decade. It was the same when Roosevelt came to office. He was a balanced-budget man, but he saw the plight of the country and got expansion going with the new deal.

 Surely the right hon.

If we had the savings ratio of Japan or Italy, perhaps we would not be as alarmed as we all are and should be.</p>

 If we are looking at Japan and Italy, that is a perfectly fair point. The hon. Gentleman says that our indebtedness is rising quickly, and I accept that, but the question continues to be what is the best way of reducing it. The point that I was about to make-he did not give me a chance because he intervened a bit too quickly-is that the best comparison is with Britain's position during the second world war, when our debt-to-GDP ratio reached 250 per cent.-two and a half times our entire GDP. What happened after the war-did we tackle the situation with gigantic cuts in public expenditure? No, it was tackled in exactly the opposite way with large public expenditure programmes of just the kind that I am talking about to get the economy working again and to get unemployment down. I hate to say this but, in some says, that inaugurated the golden age of capitalism between 1948 and 1976. <i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> I say that ironically.

It is all very well to talk about Geoffrey Howe's Budget producing a great deal of growth-it did in the end, of course, because of growth in other countries and the rise in exports, and the end of the oil inflation of the 1970s, but it then produced another collapse in the early 1990s.</p>

I also think that the £10 billion or so for identity cards cannot be justified on a cost-benefit rationale, and that one cannot justify expenditure running into tens of billions of pounds on massive Government Department IT super-computers, which is pretty wasteful given all the experience we have had.</p>

We should end the non-dom abuse, as it is insufferable that it has carried on for so long in this country, and we should certainly introduce a Tobin tax on financial transactions. We should raise capital gains tax to the level- dare I say it?--at which Nigel Lawson left it at the end of the 1980s of up to the 40 per cent. that is the higher rate of income tax. It is only fair that there should be a rate of 50 per cent. on incomes over £100,000 and 60 per cent. on incomes over £150,000.

 I congratulate the right hon. Member for Oldham, West and Royton (Mr. Meacher), who asked exactly the right questions-how can we stimulate demand and get confidence back into the economy? We differ, however, on how to resolve it. A bloated public sector, which is already extended, is certainly not the way forward, but his central point was correct.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o284"><a name="100107-0017.htm_para6"><a name="10010726000002">There are two groups of key questions that must be asked when considering the pre-Budget report. First, what is the present and future state of the economy, is it acceptable to the capital markets and what are the threats that are facing it? Secondly, does the PBR do anything to resolve the economic mire into which we have fallen? The answers are that the economy is in a far more perilous state than the Chancellor indicated in the PBR, and that the PBR has if anything made matters worse.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o285"><a name="100107-0017.htm_para7"><a name="10010726000003">Our whole economic system is based on confidence-confidence that the currency will be stable and that what we can buy today will be the same tomorrow, confidence that a job will not be taken away and confidence that an overdraft or bank loan will be there when it is needed. That confidence keeps money flowing around the economy and keeps people in work, businesses alive and factories producing. The central question is whether the PBR has done anything to improve that confidence. Has it dealt with the real risk of a strike by the purchasers of our debt, and what would that do to our economy? Equally, has it dealt with what will happen if and when interest rates begin to rise in both nominal and real terms as quantitative easing comes to an end? Of course the £4 billion that was sold yesterday in the gilt markets for 2015 and that fact that that went well is undoubtedly good news, but investor sentiment will be tested again next week for the year 2049 and far beyond, so there is still much to be concerned about in that regard.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o286"><a name="100107-0017.htm_para8"><a name="10010726000004">At the heart of the answer to all those questions is whether the fiscal policy for the next 12 months will be credible. Our ability to borrow is the key to the market's judgment about that and will determine the outcomes  <br>

in the economy, from how much and in what terms we can borrow to how much individuals can spend. The whole object of policy should be to keep the fiscal reins sufficiently restrained so that interest rates can stay as low as possible for as long as possible. That is not what we received in the PBR-it is as simple as that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o287"><a name="100107-0017.htm_para9"><a name="10010726000005">In the PBR, the Chancellor talked about the deficit as a percentage of GDP rising to 12.6 per cent. this year. Very regrettably, that may be an underestimate. The Economist Intelligence Unit believes that the figure will be more like 14.5 per cent., by far the highest in the list of 43 countries that it monitors each week. The Government's ambition is to cut their deficit in half. When viewed in the context of any borrowing record before 1997, that makes the current forecast look unrealistic in the medium term, because it is based on some very optimistic growth assumptions. On top of that, the Treasury Committee yesterday said that</p>
<a name="100107-0017.htm_brev0"><a name="10010726000206"><ul><p class="tabletext">"although the Treasury believe the Pre-Budget Report contains sufficient detail about the way in which the structural deficit would be reduced, our expert witnesses all criticised the document for not providing enough information about how this will be achieved."</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o289"><a name="100107-0017.htm_para11"><a name="10010726000007">Why is that so fundamentally important? Owing to the huge amount of money that we have to borrow and raise each year and roll over, even relatively small changes in the interest rate offered on Government bonds could punch huge holes through our finances in future. That is the key point. That is what will make investors-at best-more cautious.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o290"><a name="100107-0017.htm_para12"><a name="10010726000008">Investor confidence in our yawning fiscal chasm remains crucial. If that fails, two things may well happen: we would have to fund the deficit through further cuts in spending or increases in taxes elsewhere, or we would regrettably find ourselves heading towards the situation that Ireland and Greece face. There is a vicious cycle of deteriorating confidence: worsening confidence leads to a further deterioration in fiscal problems, which leads in turn to a further deterioration in confidence, and so on, until we are forced to take actions that would be wholly unattractive and unacceptable to all hon. Members.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o291"><a name="100107-0017.htm_para13"><a name="10010726000009">How large are the holes that could be punched through the national finances? The Debt Management Office said that it needs to sell £225 billion of gilts this year to cover the Budget deficit, and that debts need to be rolled over. A rise in the borrowing rate, for example from 3 per cent. to 4.5 per cent., would certainly cause difficulties. As it is, the Treasury is forecasting paying more than £60 billion a year to meet interest charges on the national debt. How would the Chancellor do that? If his plans for taxation and national insurance contributions are anything to go by, he would raise taxes on jobs and undermine that very employment so as to protect unsustainable levels of spending. I hope my hon. Friends agree that it would be good if he did not get the chance to do that for electoral reasons, but there is always that risk that he will.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o292"><a name="100107-0017.htm_para14"><a name="10010726000010">That may well be the consequence of a steadfast refusal to plan for the future reduction of the deficit for the short term. In essence, that is what makes the PBR so unacceptable. The Government are refusing to publish their predictions of future interest rates costs on Government debt or say what they are likely to be.  <br>

The PBR failed to achieve the credibility that the markets were expecting, which is what led to the view that the Government are currently able to hold down the cost of servicing the nation's debt only because those who are buying our gilts expect a change of Government in the very near future, and a Government who inspire confidence in their competence. Frankly, after the shambles of their management of the economy in the last few years, it is hardly surprising.</p>

Chile and $2,000 more than it costs to insure Slovakia's debt. How do we compare to countries such as France and Germany? One would hope that Britain would be in a similar fiscal position to such countries, but we compare extremely badly. It costs just $22,000 per year to insure $10 million of Germany's debt, and $24,000 to insure France's-a third of what it costs to insure ours.

 My hon. Friend is right. We have had a dramatic devaluation of our currency, although I suppose it will ultimately be helpful to the recovery. The markets have made a judgment on our currency based on their view of our economy, and it is not exactly an A-plus judgment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o302"><a name="100107-0017.htm_para24"><a name="10010726000022">Other statistics are also revealing. Not only are we a considerably less acceptable risk than other countries, but we are less creditworthy in fact than many firms and private companies. On the same basis as I mentioned a moment ago, it would cost $11,000 per year more to insure our debt than Vodafone's, $15,000 more than McDonalds', $32,000 more than BP's and an astonishing $35,000 more than Gap's. The sad fact of the matter is that the finances of large numbers of companies, in the midst of the biggest recession in living memory, are considered more creditworthy than those of the United Kingdom. That is an incredible judgment.</p>

He steadfastly refused to go into the detail of how and where he would cut spending, or how and where he would raise more money, and therefore how, in reality, he would go about dealing with the crisis that the country faces.

According to the most recent survey by the Nationwide Building Society, in December consumer confidence suffered its biggest fall in more than a year. The proportion of consumers who thought that the economic situation would be better in six months fell to 34 per cent.-down from 41 per cent. the month before. The proportion of consumers who felt that now was a bad time to make a major purchase rose by 4 per cent. to 38 per cent. last month.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o308"><a name="100107-0017.htm_para30"><a name="10010726000028">Expectations for employment also worsened in December, with the proportion of people who thought that there would be many or some jobs available in six months falling to 25 per cent. from 27 per cent. Nationwide's chief economist said that although it is still early days, those lower expectations might foreshadow a more sluggish consumer outlook in 2010 as stimulus measures are withdrawn-we certainly hope that is not the case, but it does not look good. Consumer confidence, which is at the heart of our system, is one of the fundamental elements that the Government should be working to improve. It is what keeps money flowing around an economy and people in work. In that, I am afraid, they are clearly failing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o309"><a name="100107-0017.htm_para31"><a name="10010726000029">When we look at these statistics, we have to ask ourselves whether any of this is in the least surprising given that since last year the Government have been borrowing at the fastest rate ever and the Bank of England has printed enough money to purchase the economic output of Denmark. People are crying out for somebody to show the way out of this mess. Regaining the confidence of the British people should be the job of the Government now. That is what will decisively break the country out of this vicious cycle of debt and decline. That is what will keep interest rates in this country as low as possible for as long as possible. In turn, that will help to lead to a sustainable economic recovery. We are now borrowing net nearly £500,000 per minute. It is simply not sustainable.</p>

Of course it is a matter of some satisfaction that, for a variety of reasons-not least the growth of the public sector, but also flexibility in the labour markets-unemployment has not reached the sort of levels that some had forecast. Ultimately, however, we simply cannot deal with problems of employment, confidence or interests rates if we do not grasp that particular nettle-borrowing.

 This opportunity to debate the pre-Budget report is an excellent innovation. It should have produced an interesting debate-indeed, a compelling one-on the state of the economy, but all that it has produced is a lot of sterile platitudes about the interests of finance, which caused the recession in the first place, through risk-taking and excessive lending, as against the concerns that we on the Labour Benches have been trying to express about jobs, employment, production and the real economy of this country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o313"><a name="100107-0018.htm_para0"><a name="10010726000034">Nowhere was that contrast more typified than in the speech by the hon. Member for West Suffolk (Mr. Spring), who has just sat down. What he was saying, essentially, is that the problem is confidence. How do we get confidence? Only by returning a Conservative Government. How do we return a Conservative Government? By creating such a state of fear, alarm, panic, depression, horror and misery about this country's economic prospects that we just have to have one. That is a political strategy of knocking Britain and knocking our financial future. Frankly, it is damaging to the economy and to the jobs and the real people out there, and it is unworthy of the Opposition. What we should be debating is how to keep the economy going at a high level in the face of a recession that has been produced by the irresponsibility of the financial sector.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o314"><a name="100107-0018.htm_para1"><a name="10010726000035">This pre-Budget report is a difficult one, because it is difficult to predict the future, as the right hon. Member for Hitchin and Harpenden (Mr. Lilley) said. Indeed, we cannot predict the future-he went on to predict it in the gloomiest possible terms, but his essential point was that we cannot predict it. We are probably out of the recession now, in the technical sense of several quarters of negative growth, but its effects will linger on, in more closures, more unemployment and more economic difficulties. That is what we must combat. We cannot know now how long we will have to do that; therefore, it is difficult to make firm assumptions about the economic future in the pre-Budget report.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o315"><a name="100107-0018.htm_para2"><a name="10010726000036">The other problem with the pre-Budget report is that, because the Government feel obliged to look at the prospects for debt repayment and cutting the deficit, it predicts action in those areas. That has the result of moving the debate on to Conservative ground and the ground of a financial sector concerned with deficits and borrowing. However, in a recession, deficits and borrowing are not the problem; they are the solution. They are the only way of keeping the economy going at an effective level. In opposing deficits and borrowing, as they have done consistently for the past year, the Tories are preaching a system of economics that is not pre-Keynesian, but pre-Cro-Magnon.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o316"><a name="100107-0018.htm_para3"><a name="10010726000037">In my view-it is a personal view, but it is echoed by several Members who have spoken, or are yet to speak, on the Government Benches-the big problem in the  <br>

economy is this. Although we have provided it with a stimulus, which has undoubtedly saved about 500,000 jobs-if we had not given the economy that stimulus, unemployment would now be at Tory levels, which they achieved twice in their period of government-that is not enough. The stimulus has to continue-indeed, we need a bigger stimulus-because that is the only way that we will get back to growth. The only way to deal with deficits and borrowing is through economic growth. With economic growth, those problems fade away.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o317"><a name="100107-0018.htm_para4"><a name="10010726000038">Let us look at the amount of debt that the incoming Labour Government paid off in the first three years of their existence, in a very powerful performance. That happened because of growth. With growth now, we can achieve the same results. That is why we must stimulate the economy, to get back to the level of growth that will pay off those debts as quickly as possible. That is the crucial issue: not moaning about debt and creating imaginary threats to our credit rating to frighten the City into supporting the Conservative party financially, which is essentially what the Opposition have done, but getting back to growth as soon as possible.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o318"><a name="100107-0018.htm_para5"><a name="10010726000039">In the light of that, it is disappointing that the pre-Budget report does not envisage a stronger building performance, or a bigger spend on housing. The big expansion in housing was the main means of recovering the economy in the 1930s, before we moved on to the stimulus from rearmament. The housing drive in this country built many houses. I am sorry to say that this Government's performance on housing has been pathetic. The house-building rate is lower than it was in the 1950s; it is back at the 1920s level.</p>

 I apologise to my hon. Friend for not being here for the beginning of his contribution. Does he agree that the Government would be well advised to concentrate their spending on direct job creation, and not just on reflating demand?</p>

<p><a name="st_o427"><a name="10010726000041"><a name="100107-0018.htm_spnew2"><a name="10010726000253"><b>Mr. Mitchell:</b>
 Absolutely. That is why I am arguing for a big housing programme. Housing means jobs; it stimulates demand. People need to buy carpets and furniture to put in their houses, although, in the main, the stimulus benefits employment in the construction industry. The kind of housing that we need to build is public housing for rent, because that is where the demand is now. That is what the 1.8 million people on council waiting lists around the country need. They cannot afford to buy, even after the fall in prices during the past year or so. We need a big housing drive, particularly for council housing, which has been the main area of inadequacy in our performance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o319"><a name="100107-0018.htm_para6"><a name="10010726000042">One fifth of the population have a standard of living that is not adequate. They are, in a sense, deprived, and they need public housing. We have not built enough of it, but that is the only way of providing for the future. It is also a guarantee that, when the economy begins to recover, all the money does not go into escalating house prices as it did before. If we build a strong public housing sector, people will not be forced to buy when they cannot afford to maintain a mortgage. They will not be pushed into sub-prime ownership. What they really want and need is public housing for rent, and we provided that in the past through a housing drive. We now need a bigger housing and construction drive than the pre-Budget report proposes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o320"><a name="100107-0018.htm_para7"><a name="10010726000043">In America, a useful measure has been introduced whereby construction projects that are shovel-ready can be financed to go ahead. That is eminently sensible in a recession. In this country, 140 college building programmes were cancelled as a result of the debacle at the Learning and Skills Council. Most of those programmes were shovel-ready, including the £150 million project for the rebuilding of the Grimsby institute. That project should have been started. It would provide jobs and an economic stimulus. Why are we not doing it? The allowance for housing and construction in the pre-Budget report is inadequate. We need both in order to boost the economy, particularly in the construction industry, which is stalled everywhere.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o321"><a name="100107-0018.htm_para8"><a name="10010726000044">There is also a need in this debate on the pre-Budget report to grapple with another issue that is more basic than the deficit and borrowing-namely, the need to rebalance the economy, which has been lop-sidedly developing a huge financial sector on a shrinking manufacturing and production base. No economy can function efficiently or generate growth and jobs when it is unbalanced in that way. The process of rebalancing it will be painful, but it must be started. I hoped that the pre-Budget report would place a greater emphasis on this matter.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o322"><a name="100107-0018.htm_para9"><a name="10010726000045">We cannot pay our way in the world now, because manufacturing has shrunk so much. It has been decimated in this country over the past few decades. It has been weakened partly by the rise to dominance-even to hegemony-of the financial sector and the City of London, under whose spell I am afraid the Government fell for far too long. The rise of the City has been damaging to the real economy of manufacturing for three reasons. The first is that the City and the financial sector would rather invest in Dubai than in Doncaster. They were never concerned with the industrial needs of this country. Secondly, the City does not exercise enough long-term thinking to support the manufacturing sector, while thirdly, of course, it always wants a high and stable exchange rate. Why? So it can manipulate money around the world to acquire assets overseas. The interests of manufacturing, however, lie in a low and competitive exchange rate, which allows more exports and the selling of products on the world markets.</p>

 Does my hon. Friend also agree that it is a remarkable irony that despite the massive growth in financial services to the disadvantage of manufacturing industry, manufacturing industry still provides a bigger proportion of our overseas earnings than the much-vaunted lot in the City?</p>

 Over the last decade or so, it has provided an average of about 60 per cent. of our overseas earnings, but it cannot now support the economy or jobs in the way it did in the past-unless it is expanded, unless it is rebuilt and unless we shift the balance in the economy back to production and away from financial manipulation. That is our future, which will be bleak unless we do that; it will be a future of increasing debt in order to pay for imports that we are not currently paying for.</p>

develop a strong manufacturing sector if policy is focused on that by having a low and competitive exchange rate. That is what all the developing countries-starting with Germany, now finishing with China-have done. They started from a low exchange rate, which makes exporting profitable, building up a powerful internationally traded sector, which then achieves economies of scale and follows a process of continuous causation and improvement.</p>

 My hon. Friend correctly emphasises the importance of manufacturing. Is it not also worrying that if manufacturing is allowed to dwindle even further, recreating the necessary skills in manufacturing will be much more difficult?</p>

 That is absolutely true. We have networks of skills and surviving skills, which have been thrown on the scrapheap, but they could and should be mobilised for any expansion. It is true that we need a big training programme, as this is one of the bottlenecks in the expansion of manufacturing that needs to be cleared. That can be done through an industrial policy, which we have fought shy of for far too long, but which is necessary.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o324"><a name="100107-0018.htm_para11"><a name="10010726000051">As I was saying, the big expansion overseas, based on a competitive exchange rate in overseas countries, shows that manufacturing can expand and rebuild. It can do so by having a lower competitive exchange rate. We now have the opportunity for a 25 per cent. devaluation, which would make industry and investment in this country profitable again, which it has not been for the last few years. It was certainly not profitable under Thatcherism, which was based on the policy of destroying manufacturing to weaken the trade unions and the power of the country's workers. It was based on the assumption that as a phoenix rises from ashes, the more ashes created in manufacturing areas, the better would be the future of this country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o325"><a name="100107-0018.htm_para12"><a name="10010726000052">I am afraid, I have to say, that that destructive process was continued under Labour because our concern was to fight inflation, which was done by keeping the pound high at an uncompetitive level, which subsidises imports. That also forces industry to cut its costs and shed labour in a pathetic and almost doomed attempt to stay competitive. This destruction continued and manufacturing shrank-to our shame, while we were in power-from 20 per cent. of GDP to perhaps 12 or probably 11 per cent. now in this recession. We must revive manufacturing and get it back to what it was.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o326"><a name="100107-0018.htm_para13"><a name="10010726000053">But as I look at the policies we have adopted up to now, I see that we are not effectively achieving that. We have "saved the banks", but our treatment of the banks defies belief. Whatever happened to moral hazard? The Governor of the Bank of England goes on about it, but as soon as moral hazard is affected by the banks, brought by their own follies and excesses into a disastrous situation, we rush in with money to pour into them. Manufacturing does not get that money. We poured money into the banks-that is a large part of the borrowing that we are arguing about-and we probably had to do so in order to save the banks, but nothing is going to, for instance, the steel industry in Teesside. What has gone to Vestas on the Isle of Wight, which is the country's only remaining wind turbine producer? What has gone to the manufacturing firms that are closing down and shedding labour, making people redundant? What is happening to them? We shall need  <br>

<p><a name="stpa_o327"><a name="100107-0018.htm_para14"><a name="10010726000054">The Government have poured money into the banks, and all that the banks have done with it is build up their reserves. They have not passed it on or relaxed their credit arrangements. Manufacturing is experiencing a double whammy. Money is being poured into the organisations that caused the crisis in the first place rather than into manufacturing, which has suffered the consequences, and the organisations that caused the crisis in the first place-the banks-are starving manufacturing of credit, refusing to tide it over until it can inherit the better times.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o328"><a name="100107-0018.htm_para15"><a name="10010726000055">This is a pathetic economic policy. Even the Government's policy of printing money-which is effectively what we are doing-does not really help manufacturing. What printing money does is, by buying back Government debt, buoy up the stock market and asset prices. It helps the financial sector, which holds the debt-primarily the hedge funds that have been selling that debt back to the Government at an inordinate profit to themselves-but it does nothing for manufacturing, the sector that we need to help and support.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o329"><a name="100107-0018.htm_para16"><a name="10010726000056">All the devaluations of the past-the devaluations of 1949 and 1967, the Tory devaluation of 1972-73 and the classic devaluation of 1992, when we were forced out of the exchange rate mechanism-have boosted manufacturing. Productivity and growth have increased, and the whole economy has been stimulated. We cannot let the boost that we have provided now, with a 25 per cent. devaluation, slip away as the last few prizes of devaluation slipped away. We must maintain a competitive exchange rate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o330"><a name="100107-0018.htm_para17"><a name="10010726000057">More important, we must have an appropriate industrial policy. Exchange rate competitiveness, which means a low exchange rate, is a necessary but not sufficient condition for manufacturing revival. There has to be an industrial policy that will channel investment into manufacturing, help to see it through its difficulties, and break the bottlenecks. Whether we support planning, training, investment, research, design, development or marketing, we must help industry to move forward. We cannot wash our hands of manufacturing if we are to have a viable economy.</p>

 I am listening to my hon. Friend's speech with great interest. Like the rest of us, he will have been pleased to hear what the Engineering Employers Federation said the other day about manufacturers bringing manufacturing back to the United Kingdom, partly for the reason that he has cited-the exchange rate change-but also because of the benefits of greater reliability and better quality. Before the events of the last couple of years, engineering employers were talking of a renaissance in United Kingdom manufacturing. I think we can afford to be optimistic about the future.</p>

The first was excessive spending in the good times-not mending the roof while the sun was shining. In fact, I would add that his plans added holes to the roof, funded by taxes on the bubble of finance and housing-a bubble that could never endure.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o339"><a name="100107-0018.htm_para26"><a name="10010726000071">The second problem is excessive debt, built up not just in the public sector, but in the private and corporate sectors, encouraged by the Prime Minister's false promise when he was Chancellor of an end to boom and bust. Thirdly, there was poor regulation of financial services. At least two of those factors were present in the United States of America too, but it will not do for the Prime Minister to claim that the problems that underlie the PBR have their origins in the States or the international economy. They have their origins here, too. The Prime Minister is to blame for the crisis that this country now faces. He has earned no right to be praised, as this country has been mired in the deepest recession since the 1930s and he is part of the reason for that.</p>

We might come out of recession in the current quarter, but the fact remains that this has been a huge and severe recession. It has been a personal tragedy for many thousands of our fellow citizens, and the UK has suffered a 6 per cent. cut in the size of its economy, beaten in that regard only by Japan, Italy and, I think, Germany. We have lost that for ever; as growth returns, we will still have lost that part of our economy.</p>

Many businesses still fear a double-dip recession, and consumer and business confidence is still fragile, to put it mildly. The PBR succeeded in denting consumer confidence further. Yet, for all this, the Prime Minister wants credit.</p>

as well as a very unwelcome desire to create divisions and add dividing lines in politics in general at a time when we should be doing precisely the opposite.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o343"><a name="100107-0019.htm_para1"><a name="10010726000075">Yesterday, Lord Mandelson made a very thoughtful speech, which was occasionally devalued by political point scoring. In it, he said:</p>
<a name="100107-0019.htm_brev0"><a name="10010726000215"><ul><p class="tabletext">"We need a politics of long-termism over short-termism; of a smarter, more effective and affordable state; of a return to the values of hard work, enterprise, corporate stewardship and mutual commitment over those of dodging responsibility, making a fast buck, and putting self before others; of working together as a nation to address the shared challenges of the future."</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o344"><a name="100107-0019.htm_para2"><a name="10010726000076">I agree with that, but all we got on 9 December was short-termism by the bucket load. We got a larger, less effective, less affordable state. We got taxes on hard work and enterprise, and deliberate dividing lines designed to split us apart, not bring us together.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o345"><a name="100107-0019.htm_para3"><a name="10010726000077">Lord Mandelson was right, and the PBR was wrong. As was said in <i> The Guardian </i>recently:</p>
<a name="100107-0019.htm_brev1"><a name="10010726000216"><ul><p class="tabletext">"The Government remains at war with itself, with Brown, Balls and Cooper pursuing the line of 'Labour spending versus Tory cuts' and Mandelson and Darling favouring a pragmatic, deficit-slashing PBR. We can see who won. Lord Mandelson is apparently still seething with anger-'incandescent' at the outcome of the PBR."</p>

Friend the Member for Hitchin and Harpenden (Mr. Lilley) said in his thoughtful remarks, this Government's reaction of retreating entirely into increasing taxes rather than attacking public expenditure is the problem. The large increases in national insurance on all of us in society-including those on below-average earnings-and the 50 per cent. income tax rate are taxes on aspiration, enterprise and hard work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o347"><a name="100107-0019.htm_para5"><a name="10010726000079">Lord Mandelson tried to justify that in his speech yesterday. He said that</p>

negative impact on our competitiveness. We cannot duck that. We do not live in an isolated country any longer, and I do not see our chief economic competitors-the United States and Germany, for instance-following our lead on that matter.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o353"><a name="100107-0019.htm_para11"><a name="10010726000085">The scale of our debt mountain is great, and I find it incredible that Government members are advocating still higher debt. In this week's edition of <i> The</i><i>  Economist</i>, estimates of various countries' budget balances as a percentage of GDP for 2009 are listed. By a long chalk, Britain's is the highest, followed by the United States. Only Spain joins us in having double-digit figures. All the rest of the major industrial nations of the world, and some very minor ones as well, are running smaller budget deficits than us.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o354"><a name="100107-0019.htm_para12"><a name="10010726000086">In September-before the PBR-<i> The Times </i>illustrated that dramatically in a leader entitled, "Fainting by numbers". I had hoped to have the time to recite quite a few of those numbers, but bearing in mind your strictures, Mr. Deputy Speaker, I will not do so. I shall just use one. The article stated:</p>
<a name="100107-0019.htm_brev6"><a name="10010726000221"><ul><p class="tabletext">"The most succinct statistic is also the scariest: by the 2013-14 financial year, government spending on welfare and on servicing the national debt will total £257.1 billion. How much does that amount to exactly? Just over £1 in every £3 that will be spent by the Government."</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o355"><a name="100107-0019.htm_para13"><a name="10010726000087">In other words, these are the bills of failure. I remember what Tony Blair said when he was in opposition about what he described then as the "bills of failure". Those bills pale into insignificance by this scale; we are talking about massive borrowing and massive social security expenditure. Those are the bills of failure that have been brought about by this Government. Richard Lambert's new year message from the CBI stated:</p>
<a name="100107-0019.htm_brev7"><a name="10010726000222"><ul><p class="tabletext">"The Government has not yet established a credible path back to fiscal stability for the UK. The longer this is delayed, the greater the threat to long-term interest rates and sterling. Everyone knows that painful decisions are going to have to be made sooner or later about public spending and tax. But the timing and shape of these moves remain unclear-and that is another significant concern for business."</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o356"><a name="100107-0019.htm_para14"><a name="10010726000088">I have already said that the problem is that the Government did not fix the roof when the sun was shining, and that is true-the structural deficit is alarmingly high. It is a structural deficit; it is not the product of bank bail-outs and so on. It is the problem of systemic Government failure to manage the public finances appropriately. The Institute for Fiscal Studies wrote the following on the day of the pre-Budget report:</p>
<a name="100107-0019.htm_brev8"><a name="10010726000223"><ul><p class="tabletext">"The Treasury now believes that the structural budget deficit-the portion of government borrowing that cannot be explained by the temporary weakness of the economy-is 'only' 9 per cent. of national income this year, rather than the 9.8 per cent. it estimated at Budget time. This means that the underlying fiscal problem looks somewhat smaller than it did in March, although still huge by any standard."</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o357"><a name="100107-0019.htm_para15"><a name="10010726000089">It is indeed huge by any standard, but I must add that that is predicated on the very optimistic forecast of a return to above-trend growth rates in two or three years' time. I do not believe that forecast; I do not think we will do that well. Thus, the problem of dealing with this situation is still worse.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o358"><a name="100107-0019.htm_para16"><a name="10010726000090">I had wanted to talk in detail about one or two specific issues, but I shall just run through them very briefly. I wished to discuss the lack of finance for manufacturing and businesses in general, but that has been done and so I shall not reiterate the point-I  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="7 Jan 2010">

should just say that the situation is extremely worrying. I would have liked to talk about the comments made by those on the Liberal Front Bench about across-the-board cuts in science, but I shall not do that either.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o359"><a name="100107-0019.htm_para17"><a name="10010726000091">However, I wish briefly to mention manufacturing. I do not want to talk it down-not for a second. It is right to say that, notwithstanding the current recession, manufacturing has grown over the past 13 years under this Government, but it has shrunk massively as a proportion of gross domestic product; it has done that so much more over this period than it did under the so-called Thatcher years. The Government need to think carefully about their policies to deal with that problem and this pre-Budget report does not do that. It talks a lot about future growth, high-technology industries and low-carbon industries, but many traditional industries, for example brick making in my constituency and glass making, have been hit very hard by decisions in this PBR about alterations to the climate change agreements. We are talking about very sharp stealth taxes on traditional manufacturing industries that will lead to further manufacturing job losses in this country, the import from abroad of the products that would have been made here and carbon leakage-no gain, just loss. I urge the Government to think a bit more about traditional industries, as well as about future industries.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o360"><a name="100107-0019.htm_para18"><a name="10010726000092">I also urge the Government to examine the reasons for the failure of the automotive assistance programme, which has still not delivered a single penny to any automotive business in the United Kingdom a year after it was launched. I welcome the extension of the enterprise finance guarantee scheme, despite the cynic in me thinking that it may have something to do with the fact that the scheme has not got money out of the door quickly enough and the money is still left in the bank, so the Government are extending the period in order to use the same amount of money over a longer time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o361"><a name="100107-0019.htm_para19"><a name="10010726000093">The one other issue that I wish to raise is that of a windfall-there is some good news-about which I know the Financial Secretary to the Treasury is aware. It comes from the digital dividend review. I am talking about the sale of the spectrum, which will result in the digital dividend. That spectrum is used largely by television, but it is also used by radio microphones, which are crucial to community halls, outside broadcasting, music, theatre and a range of interests. The Government originally promised to compensate such interests in full for evicting them from the spectrum. The cost of that eviction is about £70 million to £75 million, but it should unlock a windfall of £2 billion for the Treasury. I hope that the Government will stick to their promises, and I have received some encouraging answers from the Minister, who was wearing both of his hats this morning-operating as a Department for Business, Innovation and Skills Minister and as a Treasury Minister-to suggest that they might just do that. I hope that he will stick to that, because that £75 million is the permission to unlock a £2 billion windfall for the Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o362"><a name="100107-0019.htm_para20"><a name="10010726000094">We are not out of the woods yet. The international banking crisis could still get worse. Net lending to companies is still shrinking and we face huge structural problems, but I believe that they can be faced in the lifetime of the next Parliament. As Richard Lambert put it</p>

 First, Mr. Deputy Speaker, may I apologise for the fact that I will be unable to stay for the closing speeches? It has been a pleasure to listen to the debate and some excellent speeches have been made.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o364"><a name="100107-0019.htm_para22"><a name="10010726000097">The PBR represents firm action to help secure recovery, to go for growth and to halve the deficit in four years while protecting key services, and the subject of key services and public services in general will form a major part of my speech. I believe that the PBR offers a balanced package, and the best economic approach for long-term stability. The Government are taking tough decisions to halve the deficit and to make a range of savings and efficiencies that we know, in some cases, will be very difficult indeed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o365"><a name="100107-0019.htm_para23"><a name="10010726000098">I particularly welcome the commitment in the PBR to spending on schools and to NHS expenditure, the increase in the basic state pension and the child element of the child tax credit.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o366"><a name="100107-0019.htm_para24"><a name="10010726000099">I also want to highlight the issues to do with the tax on bank bonuses, which is very important. We should not be put off by scaremongering. Many of my constituents welcome that tax, as do most people in the country. Some people in the banks got off very lightly indeed. I also welcome the measures to do with tax evasion and tax avoidance, which are very important for fairness and will raise a significant amount of money. They will play an important role in ensuring that we get that money in and that we stop people avoiding and evading tax.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o367"><a name="100107-0019.htm_para25"><a name="10010726000100">I want to spend some time discussing the issue of employment. I was pleased to see in the PBR that £300 million will be brought forward to offer a job, training or a work placement to every 18 to 24-year-old who has been claiming jobseeker's allowance for six months. Unemployment is a great concern and many people in my constituency have suffered from the economic downturn. However, unlike the Opposition, we have not walked away from that and we are doing all we can not just through the fiscal stimulus but through the other methods that I shall come to shortly. When the Opposition were last in government, they said that unemployment was a price worth paying. We should never forget that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o368"><a name="100107-0019.htm_para26"><a name="10010726000101">In Halton in the 1980s, almost one person in five in my constituency was unemployed. Many were pushed on to incapacity benefit. Let me give some figures that I mentioned before. For instance, in August 1985 19.1 per cent. of the 16-to-19 age group were unemployed. In August 2009, 6.7 per cent. of that age group were unemployed. That is still obviously too many, and we have to do more, but the fact that one in five of my constituents were unemployed for many years shows the massive scale of the problems that we faced then.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o369"><a name="100107-0019.htm_para27"><a name="10010726000102">We should also not forget the record interest rate of more than 15 per cent. Rates were very high for a very long time, and many people lost their homes. We saw record levels of repossessions with no help from the Government of the time. I am pleased that we are doing more on that. We have helped people to stay in their  <br>

homes and I hope that the Government will continue to do more. Of course, it is still a personal tragedy for those who lose their homes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o370"><a name="100107-0019.htm_para28"><a name="10010726000103">I also want to welcome the improvement in support for debt counselling and advice services and access to them. The PBR provides extra money for citizens advice bureaux, which have helped many people to stay in their homes and to get their debts under some sort of control. Only this week I had a call from a constituent who thanked me for helping her by putting her in touch with the right people to get debt advice. She was then able to get an agreement with the mortgage provider and can now stay in her home. That is not untypical of what has been going on during this economic downturn.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o371"><a name="100107-0019.htm_para29"><a name="10010726000104">The stimulus has been very important in dealing with unemployment, but my right hon. Friend the Financial Secretary will not be surprised to hear that infrastructure projects are one of the big areas in providing employment and stimulus. May I remind him of the proposed new Mersey crossing? It is a £400 million project and the report of the inspector's recommendations and the inquiry that took place last year is due to land on the desk of the Secretary of State in the next few weeks. The crossing will provide hundreds of construction jobs over the next few years, if it is approved, and about 4,000 or 5,000 jobs thereafter through the economic benefits that it will bring. So, as well as improving the congestion problems in my constituency, and in Merseyside and Cheshire, it is very important for jobs. I hope that when the report lands on the Treasury's desk, the project will get the quickest approval possible.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o372"><a name="100107-0019.htm_para30"><a name="10010726000105">I want to spend a little of the short time available to me talking about public spending, which the Conservative party sees as a great evil. There have been massive improvements during Labour's time in government; Labour Government expenditure has brought great improvements throughout the country, not least in many public services in my constituency. Many people now take those services for granted, and it is worth reminding them what has happened. The greatest contrast is between hospital waiting lists now and previously, when it was common for people to wait two years or more for an operation. Those waiting times are now down to a few months or even weeks in some cases. That has been a massive turnaround. If anything shows the differences between now and previously, that change is it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o373"><a name="100107-0019.htm_para31"><a name="10010726000106">Other benefits in my constituency are the modernisation of many schools with the provision of new buildings and sporting facilities. There have also been tremendous improvements educationally, with many great improvements in exam results. There have been improvements in transport and significant improvements in local health services and access to such services. Whiston hospital, for example, which serves many of my constituents, has received investments of £250 million. There are many private rooms in that hospital. We would like to know what the Tory promise is on private rooms, because they seem to be backtracking again. That brand-new, modern facility will serve my constituents and the wider area, replacing the Victorian buildings that the Tories always thought were okay for treating our people in. There are also improved cancer services, and more doctors and nurses.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o374"><a name="100107-0019.htm_para32"><a name="10010726000107">Let me make a point about the current weather situation and public expenditure. We should not forget the cold weather payments that are being made. The winter fuel allowance is particularly important to pensioners  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="7 Jan 2010">

and the disabled. I want to make that point very clear. The free bus pass for pensioners and the disabled is another thing that is often taken for granted now, and is another example of good public expenditure.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o375"><a name="100107-0019.htm_para33"><a name="10010726000108">It is important to remind people what life was like under a Conservative Government. We have only to remember Black Wednesday and what happened to the pound then. There were record unemployment rates of more than 3 million, two recessions, long NHS waiting lists, as I have mentioned, and record numbers of repossessions. That is what life was like under a Conservative Government. Even on tax, the Conservatives' record was dodgy. It took them almost 18 years to reduce the tax burden-that was a long-held promise that they made early on in their years of power-so even they had trouble doing that. We should remind people about that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o376"><a name="100107-0019.htm_para34"><a name="10010726000109">I believe that our approach to the economy is the right one, and that the Conservative approach lacks credibility-whatever that approach will finally be. The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond) refused to give a date for when he wanted the deficit to be halved when I asked him to do so. He was asked about that two or three times. It is clear that a Conservative Government would revert to type, would introduce massive cuts in public expenditure and would not support public services or maintain the improvements that the Labour Government have made.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o377"><a name="100107-0019.htm_para35"><a name="10010726000110">Any Government will have to make significant savings, but the speed and scale of the savings will be crucial. That is the difference between the Conservatives and us: we will continue to put whatever stimulus we can into the economy and will also improve public services. The scale of cuts could be horrendous under the Conservatives, but we do not know what the full scale would be because they are not being open and honest about what they intend to do. I believe that we have the right approach to deal with the situation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o378"><a name="100107-0019.htm_para36"><a name="10010726000111">I also believe that the people of this country will not be fooled by what the Conservatives are saying. They know what the Conservatives are like and what will be reintroduced if they get back into power. I believe that they will stick with and trust the Labour Government, having seen Labour's good management of the economy. The economic downturn has been handled well, and we have been seen as a world leader in that regard. The downturn has been very difficult for millions of people in this country, but by having a stimulus, by improving public expenditure in certain areas and through good stewardship, we can continue to bring improvements for the future of this country, its public services and the economy.</p>

They captured the headlines, along with the tax rises, the return of VAT to 17 per cent., and the introduction of the 50 per cent. top rate of income tax.

<p><a name="stpa_o379"><a name="100107-0020.htm_para0"><a name="10010726000113">Those were the things that captured the headlines. The Government concede that their total package of measures, and the tax rises in particular, will make up about one third of the £57 billion deficit reduction that they need to make after growth, with the remaining two thirds coming from cuts.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o380"><a name="100107-0020.htm_para1"><a name="10010726000114">Labour has already announced cuts worth £800 million to the Scottish budget, but it is the cuts to UK spending Departments that will almost certainly have a huge impact across the UK and in Scotland. Those cuts have been hidden due to the lack of a comprehensive spending review, which will not now happen until after the election.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o381"><a name="100107-0020.htm_para2"><a name="10010726000115">However, the Chancellor did say many things in the PBR. He said that his task was</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o382"><a name="100107-0020.htm_para3"><a name="10010726000116">Yet the PBR and its measures will do no such things, as they will apply the swingeing cuts in public investment that are to come. The Fiscal Responsibility Bill confirms the total level of the cuts, which will do nothing in the short term to secure recovery and promote longer-term growth. Quite the reverse: the cuts-dishonestly presented without a CSR-will suck the lifeblood out of the economy, and make recovery more difficult.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o383"><a name="100107-0020.htm_para4"><a name="10010726000117">I suspect that there are few people left in the House who fail to understand that it was the 2.2 per cent. increase in Government consumption that pumped some life into the economy at a time when household expenditure fell by 3.6 per cent., business investment fell by 22 per cent, and gross fixed capital formation declined by 17 per cent. I want to spend a little time on the latter point: it is not much spoken about, but it is vital.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o384"><a name="100107-0020.htm_para5"><a name="10010726000118">Gross fixed capital formation is the investment in capital assets such as the plant, machinery and technology that will be needed in the future. So where were the plans to help that grow? There were few, or none, in the PBR.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o385"><a name="100107-0020.htm_para6"><a name="10010726000119">The problem is not just with this PBR and what the Government are planning in the middle of the recession, but that the Government's track record when it comes to encouraging investment in gross fixed capital formation has been so weak. Since 1997, the UK has had the lowest average investment of any G20 OECD 12 country. Our investment has averaged 17 per cent., while the OECD G20 group has averaged over 21 per cent. For the six years between 2003 and 2008, our investment in capital formation was the lowest of any of the G20 countries. Between 1997 and 2007, only Russia spent less, and between 2001 and 2002, only Turkey invested less.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o386"><a name="100107-0020.htm_para7"><a name="10010726000120">Even in the broader list of G2O countries as a whole, only Argentina and Brazil have invested less than this Labour Government have since they came to power. Indeed, since 1997 there has not been a single year when the Prime Minister-either as Prime Minister or Chancellor-has seen a UK investment level that was not below the EU average. That demonstrates that the problem is not confined to now or this PBR, as we have had a systemic problem of under-investment in productive capacity since this Government came to office.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o387"><a name="100107-0020.htm_para8"><a name="10010726000121">Why is that important? Many hon. Members who have spoken today have said that we have to get back to inventing, developing and making things, and providing  <br>

the jobs in manufacturing-of all sorts- that our people need. I agree: to paraphrase what the Chief Secretary said earlier, we need to rebalance the economy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o388"><a name="100107-0020.htm_para9"><a name="10010726000122">This is all about jobs and, to be fair to him, the Chancellor spoke about jobs and employment a great deal in his PBR speech. He did not tell us that unemployment now is higher than it was under the Tories in 1997, when Labour came to power, and he glossed over the problem of the 943,000 youngsters who are unemployed under Labour now. That is a higher figure than when Labour came to power in 1997.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o389"><a name="100107-0020.htm_para10"><a name="10010726000123">However, those are not the key things. The key question is: what is the Chancellor's plan? The plan, it would appear, is to slash public investment too quickly and so weaken the chances of recovery. The result of that will be that tackling the deficit and the debt will be rendered more difficult, as will creating employment and jobs-especially if the heroic growth rates fail to materialise, or if we tip back into a double-dip recession. I am afraid that unemployment will keep on rising, as it did for two years after the technical end of the 1991 recession and for three years after the technical end of the 1980-81 recession.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o390"><a name="100107-0020.htm_para11"><a name="10010726000124">In the pre-Budget report, the Chancellor said that</p>

software and games sector is not just because it is important to Dundee, but because it is an export business; it generates revenue for the UK. In the PBR the Chancellor said that export trade had been hit hard, and boy was he right.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o396"><a name="100107-0020.htm_para17"><a name="10010726000134">We have a total trade deficit of £37 billion last year, and a colossal £93 billion deficit in the trade in goods-all that, as others have said, at a time when sterling was down massively against the dollar and the euro. As a result, GDP growth was suppressed by about 1.5 per cent., but there was nothing in the PBR specifically to stimulate export activity other than the statement's vain hope that demand from the US and the euro area might pick up.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o397"><a name="100107-0020.htm_para18"><a name="10010726000135">The Red Book suggested that GDP would be enhanced by about 0.5 per cent.-that there would be a 0.5 per cent. contribution to GDP growth from 2010 onwards. But, given that, on average, the balance of trade deficit suppressed such growth between 2000 and 2007, I hope that that is not Government wishful thinking.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o398"><a name="100107-0020.htm_para19"><a name="10010726000136">I am conscious that other people want to speak, so I shall make three final brief points. First, the Chancellor said:</p>
<a name="100107-0020.htm_brev4"><a name="10010726000229"><ul><p class="tabletext">"We must continue to support the economy until recovery is established."-[<i> Official Report</i>, 9 December 2009; Vol. 502, c. 359-60.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o399"><a name="100107-0020.htm_para20"><a name="10010726000137">But on Tuesday he said that we are still in recession, yet the cuts have already been announced, so that makes no sense.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o400"><a name="100107-0020.htm_para21"><a name="10010726000138">Secondly, the Chancellor said:</p>
<a name="100107-0020.htm_brev5"><a name="10010726000230"><ul><p class="tabletext">"To cut support now could wreck the recovery. That is a risk that I am not prepared to take."-[<i> Official Report</i>, 9 December 2009; Vol. 502, c. 360.]</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o401"><a name="100107-0020.htm_para22"><a name="10010726000139">However, the International Monetary Fund has confirmed that the UK will be the only G7 economy fully to withdraw its fiscal stimulus measures in 2010.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o402"><a name="100107-0020.htm_para23"><a name="10010726000140">Finally, on the low-carbon economy, the Chancellor said that he was determined to build on strengths today by maintaining what he called the UK's</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o403"><a name="100107-0020.htm_para24"><a name="10010726000141">However, we have heard it all before. The 2005 Budget stated:</p>
<a name="100107-0020.htm_brev7"><a name="10010726000232"><ul><p class="tabletext">"The Government is...examining how it might support the development of CCS"-</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o404"><a name="100107-0020.htm_para25"><a name="10010726000142">carbon capture and storage. The 2005 pre-Budget report stated:</p>
<a name="100107-0020.htm_brev8"><a name="10010726000233"><ul><p class="tabletext">"Carbon capture and storage protects the environment from carbon emissions by containing them at source."</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o405"><a name="100107-0020.htm_para26"><a name="10010726000143">In the 2006 Budget statement, the Chancellor said that following a joint study with the Norwegian Government, the Government were going to take measures on carbon capture and storage, and the same thing was repeated in the 2006 pre-Budget report and the 2007 Budget statement. We had one such statement after another up until early 2007, and by 23 May BP had pulled out its £500 million investment in Peterhead and taken it to Abu Dhabi because this Government could not make a decision. That shows the systemic problems that we have. There is talk about investing in digital, and then disappointment for those in the sector; talk about not withdrawing the stimulus before the recovery, and then doing precisely that; and talking a good game on the low-carbon economy, and then failing to deliver. That has been the hallmark of this Government over many years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o406"><a name="100107-0020.htm_para27"><a name="10010726000144">At its heart-this is a tragedy, because there is a big job of work to be done to tackle the problems in the economy-the PBR was an invented political dividing line whereby the Government pretended that one party was not cutting and that another one or two parties might do so. The truth is that whether it is a Labour cut, a Liberal cut or a Tory cut, making it too early and too quickly will damage everybody's chances of recovery.</p>

 This is a general debate on the pre-Budget report, but it is a good opportunity for Members in all parts of the House to get various points across on a very important issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o407"><a name="100107-0020.htm_para28"><a name="10010726000146">For me, the PBR was about whose side the Government are on. I believe that the Chancellor proved in his statement that they are on the side of the people from hard-working families who were left behind in previous recessions because unemployment was seen as a price worth paying. This Government do not believe that it should be the function of financial markets to make money out of other people's misery. The PBR was about making choices and naming priorities. The Government's whole economic strategy, since the global economic crisis started in autumn 2008, has been to be on the side of the people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o408"><a name="100107-0020.htm_para29"><a name="10010726000147">In my constituency, unemployment currently stands at 2,361. Yes, it has gone up during the recession, but it is still half what it was during the 1980s, when 5,500 people in my constituency were out of work-40 per cent. of them, or more than 2,000, for more than 12 months. Today, about 88,000 people in the north-east are out of work; in the 1990s, at the height of the recession, the figure was more than 100,000, and in the 1980s it was more than 200,000. Today, 1.5 million people are on jobseeker's allowance; in the 1980s, more than 3 million were claiming the equivalent benefit. Today, youth unemployment, if we strip out those young people who are in full-time studies, stands at 9 per cent.; in the 1990s, it was 12 per cent., and in the 1980s it was 13 per cent. Some people expected home repossessions to go through the roof; they have not, but they did in the 1990s. People thought that businesses would go to the wall more rapidly, but they have not, unlike in the 1990s. Today, 70 per cent. of people who are out of work find a job within six months, and the future jobs fund will guarantee that every 18 to 24-year-old receives training after six months. A package of £5 billion is being spent to ensure that our young people get through the downturn. Some people would not have spent that money because they believed the recession should have been allowed to take its course, but surely this initiative is underpinning the economy by helping consumption, which in itself helps to create growth.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o409"><a name="100107-0020.htm_para30"><a name="10010726000148">However, things are still tough. It was right that the Government intervened to introduce the fiscal stimulus, which has prevented the economy from entering a second great depression; the rest of the world is doing something similar. We are able to borrow money to aid the recovery because before the global economic crisis our debt levels were lower than those of a lot of our competitors. In the Fiscal Responsibility Bill, the Government have said that over four years they intend to cut the deficit by 50 per cent. from 12.6 to 5.5 per cent. They have identified billions of pounds of savings through "smarter Government" reforms. There is a new 50 per cent. tax  <br>

band, an increase in national insurance, and a payroll tax on bank bonuses. Because of the fiscal stimulus measures taken by the Government, growth will also enter into the equation eventually.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o410"><a name="100107-0020.htm_para31"><a name="10010726000149">The Tories lack the political judgment that is needed in tough times. They were wrong on the recession and they are wrong on the recovery. To me, that is a fundamental dividing line between the Government and the Opposition. The Conservatives are the only main political party that aspires to government in any of the 186 states of the IMF that actually believes the fiscal stimulus was a mistake.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o411"><a name="100107-0020.htm_para32"><a name="10010726000150">The Opposition want to do away with dividing lines, and they have started to say that the Government are using class war. That is not the right attitude to take, and in a democracy it is the wrong way to approach politics. The success of this Government is based on a broad coalition of beliefs in the country and cuts across so-called class divides, which is why in a few months' time we will win the next election. The other reason is that my constituents are deeply concerned about what would be taken away from them if ever the Tories got into government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o412"><a name="100107-0020.htm_para33"><a name="10010726000151">In all my years of political involvement, the only evidence of class war that I have ever experienced was the division created within, and the ultimate closure of, the communities that I grew up in by the Conservative Government during the 1980s. Communities were closed and left behind. To me, the backdrop of "Billy Elliot" is not just a west end show; it is something I lived through. I will never believe the Leader of the Opposition when he purports to be a progressive Conservative until he apologises for the callous behaviour of his predecessors. Class war should remain back in the 1980s-I actually agree with the right hon. Member for Hitchin and Harpenden (Mr. Lilley) about that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o413"><a name="100107-0020.htm_para34"><a name="10010726000152">Since then we have had 13 years of a Labour Government, and now we have something called the "progressive Conservatives" because the Opposition know that to stand any chance of getting elected, they have to prove that they have moved on and been reincarnated into a more cuddly version of their former selves. But they have not changed. We now see dividing lines that they interpret as class war. I do not really care whether the Leader of the Opposition went to Eton; my predecessor went to Fettes college, which was seen as being the Eton of Scotland. However, I must say that as a parent I would be really disappointed if I spent all that money on my children's education and they still turned out to be Tory MPs. At least my predecessor obviously learned something.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o414"><a name="100107-0020.htm_para35"><a name="10010726000153">I understand that there are something like 15 Etonians on the Conservative Front Bench. What would they say if there were 15 Members on the Government Front Bench at any one time who had attended, let us say, Sedgefield comprehensive school or Wellfield community school in my constituency-two perfectly good schools with excellent teachers and pupils-or any other state school, for that matter? What would be the reaction of some? That it was a conspiracy and that the old school network had penetrated the highest echelons of the establishment. Surely that should not be allowed to happen.</p>

That is why this Government have invested so much in education and the Opposition have opposed it. Any pupil of any school should be allowed to aspire to serve in government, and the broader their experience the better. That is aspiration, and it is what the PBR is intended to underpin.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o416"><a name="100107-0020.htm_para37"><a name="10010726000155">For me, the PBR is symbolic of the Government's intent, and the Opposition's criticism of the report's fundamentals also speaks volumes. I am not surprised that they want to do away with any talk of dividing lines and are trying to say that it is about class war, because they are on the wrong side of the argument. For all their efforts, they have not changed. They are not progressive Conservatives at all-how can a person be? They can be either progressive or conservative. A progressive would have voted for the creation of the NHS, a conservative would have voted against it. A progressive would have voted in favour of the minimum wage, a conservative would have voted against it. A progressive would vote for investment in health and education, a conservative would vote against it. In this House, I am pleased to be on the side of the progressive. A progressive looks for consensus and acts accordingly. A conservative, in the country's hour of need, makes it his priority to cut tax for the 3,000 largest estates. In this recession, who is looking after the concerns of the many and who is looking after the vested interests of the few?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o417"><a name="100107-0020.htm_para38"><a name="10010726000156">I wish to say one thing about bankers and bonuses. I read a report in <i> The Times </i>on 4 January stating that Deutsche Bank, which incidentally lost $10 billion during the credit crunch, wants to spread its UK tax across the pot that it holds globally because, as its chief executive officer said, it would be</p>
<a name="100107-0020.htm_brev9"><a name="10010726000234"><ul><p class="tabletext">"unfair to treat the UK bankers differently".</p>

Basically, that gives us an opportunity. The Government should be acting internationally to ensure that bankers are treated the same all around the world. The problem we have is a global challenge. Economies acting in concert should consider a Tobin tax. Even if we do not have a Tobin tax, we need to create mechanisms that help to stabilise international transactions, so that financial planning is a long-term objective and transactions are not used as a means of short-term gain.</p>

In fact, on the way to half the cash raised by the Tories has come from the City. It is no wonder that one of their priorities is to cut tax for 3,000 large estates. So much for progressive conservatism.</p>

 I recognise the difficult balancing act the Chancellor faced in compiling the pre-Budget report in the most difficult economic and financial circumstances that we have faced in many years, as he will with the Budget proper. However, on fairness and taxation, I and many others believe that he has not quite got the balance right.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o421"><a name="100107-0021.htm_para1"><a name="10010726000161">Every economy will have its peaks and troughs. No Government are potent enough to abolish the economic cycle, and no Government in the free world can dictate human nature, with its swings of optimism and pessimism, and the credit cycle, which results from the expansion of banking and credit over the centuries. However, it is important that the Government recognise the dangers and weaknesses within the modern free market and act accordingly, through fiscal and monetary policy in wider economic management, and through a robust framework of regulation, and the willingness to act promptly when the public interest demands it, in the financial markets.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o422"><a name="100107-0021.htm_para2"><a name="10010726000162">Before becoming an MP, my career was in banking and then in financial journalism. Latterly, I was the City editor of a national newspaper. From the early 1980s, I either witnessed close-up or reported in detail on each major financial and economic crisis as it unfolded, including the 1987 stock market crash, the 1990s recession, sterling's ignominious exit from the European exchange rate mechanism, the problems that engulfed the Lloyd's insurance market-the so-called LMX spiral-when nobody knew where the risks really lay, and the bail-out in the late 1990s of the massive US hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management, which happened because the Clinton Administration and, importantly, Wall Street, did not know where the liability merry-go-round would stop and how much damage could be done to the global financial system. The unique problem in my working life-it forms the context of this PBR-is the current credit crunch and global recession. In this crisis, the aspects of those other crises, save for the problem of maintaining a fixed exchange rate, have descended us at the same time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o423"><a name="100107-0021.htm_para3"><a name="10010726000163">History will tell, but arguably the key individual action that crystallised the credit crunch, ignoring previous lessons from the 1990s, was the Bush Administration's decision to let Lehman Brothers go to the wall. Equally arguably, the single most important policy action to contain the damage was taken first not in the United States but here in the UK-prompt and decisive action to rescue the banking system by the Chancellor and the Government. That happened not in the bankers' interests, but in the public interest. Also in the public interest, the Government responded to stimulate demand and to contain a more damaging downward economic spiral, as any intelligent reader of history would have done. That is the background against which the Chancellor delivered the PBR before Christmas.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o424"><a name="100107-0021.htm_para4"><a name="10010726000164">The key difference between this recession and the one in the 1990s is that in this one, the Government have taken positive action to ameliorate its effects-they have not simply let events take their toll on industry and ordinary families. The key difference with the 1980s is that this recession was precipitated by a massive shock  <br>

to the financial system. True, it was not helped by over-lax financial regulation, with the Government, in good economic times, continuing the previous Conservative approach. But unlike the 1980s' recessions, it was not brought on by the Government themselves through ideological experiments in monetary policy as a dose of harsh medicine, a self-inflicted pain that harmed much of our manufacturing industry, especially in areas such as mine in north Staffordshire, and permanently blighted much of our economy and many of our local economies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o425"><a name="100107-0021.htm_para5"><a name="10010726000165">Any reasonable person should welcome the individual measures in the PBR to help industry and businesses, as well as the determination not to jeopardise recovery by cutting Government spending too far or too fast. However, I would have liked the Government to go further on manufacturing. The financial crisis has delivered the sharpest lessons on the dangers of over-reliance on the financial sector and the City of London with all its short-termism. It is vital that we have a whole new emphasis on and encouragement for manufacturing. Our major competitors-Germany, France and Japan-do this. There, it would be inconceivable that only a fraction of the machinery for one of the UK's biggest renewable energy projects-the London array-would be supplied by domestic companies. We have simply not taken enough advantage of new or existing industries.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o426"><a name="100107-0021.htm_para6"><a name="10010726000166">Anyone who had cause to go to the old Department of Trade and Industry to seek help for industry would have been dismayed by the "hands off, can't do and won't help" mentality of officialdom. That was another painful hangover, like the so-called light-touch regulation of the City, from the Thatcherite days. A whole new attitude and approach is needed. I encourage the Chancellor to take up that theme strongly when he presents the Budget proper.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o428"><a name="100107-0021.htm_para8"><a name="10010726000172">It is clear that the behaviour of City bankers has not changed, even in cases when the banks have benefited from the public purse, even given the reduced competition after the turmoil. The extra levy on banking bonuses is therefore welcome. It is only a short-term measure and it may be subject to fancy avoidance schemes, but it is important in encouraging a greater sense of responsibility in the City. I wish that the Government had done it and been tougher in action and rhetoric before. Shareholders-the major pension funds and insurance companies investing our money-should also have taken a more active stance in the past.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o429"><a name="100107-0021.htm_para9"><a name="10010726000173">In the PBR, the Chancellor also said it was important to take tough decisions on tax now. He said that he was determined that any tax increases would be guided by our values of fairness and responsibility. In a decent, civilised and progressive society, that overall philosophy is surely right. In the PBR, the Chancellor has finally recognised that a quarter of all the money spent on pension tax relief goes to the top 1.5 per cent. of earners. He will now reduce those benefits. I welcome that limited measure, but again wish that the Government had done it before.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o430"><a name="100107-0021.htm_para10"><a name="10010726000174">With respect to fairness in taxation, there is one glaring issue that this PBR, like its predecessors, does not address. That is the rate of capital gains tax which, at 18 per cent., remains lower than the basic rate of income tax and much lower than the higher rate of income tax. As such, it remains unfair: some of the lowest-paid workers will pay a higher rate on hard-earned income than many wealthy people will on unearned income. Also-this is very important-it constitutes a continuing huge incentive to tax avoidance. To eliminate that incentive, therefore, and to protect the tax base, capital gains tax should be aligned with the marginal rate of tax. I hope that the Chancellor will address that glaring anomaly in the Budget.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o431"><a name="100107-0021.htm_para11"><a name="10010726000175">We inherited that position from the Conservatives in 1997. Progressively, we reduced it under taper relief, which between 2001 and 2008 cost the Treasury an enormous amount of money-£28.1 billion. To put that into context, it is £6 billion more than the £22 billion proceeds from the 3G mobile phone licence auction, which itself reaped more for the Treasury than all previous privatisations put together. Far from taking the long view, the move has encouraged exactly the opposite: a constant churning of deals and investments. The British disease became ever more rampant, and frankly it was a huge tax break that in great part went to the City and private equity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o432"><a name="100107-0021.htm_para12"><a name="10010726000176">I do not yet have figures for how much the change to 18 per cent. is estimated to have cost. In the future, it would be useful if the Treasury could provide them and explain why we have yet to address the glaring anomaly that I have highlighted? According to the Treasury's own figures, a rise in the marginal rate of tax would raise £2 billion for the public finances. The proposal to lift the rate of national insurance by 0.5 per cent. would raise £3 billion and mean that, however regrettably, ordinary families would share the burden. In the interests of fairness, however, it is important that the anomaly be addressed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o433"><a name="100107-0021.htm_para13"><a name="10010726000177">In conclusion, I welcome much of what is in the PBR, but in many respects, particularly on encouragement  <br>

 The pre-Budget report safeguards vital investment in schools, hospitals and policing, and more importantly helps to create employment and training opportunities across the country as we prepare for the return of economic growth this year, after what was, in 2009, the most difficult year for the UK economy since 1922.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o434"><a name="100107-0021.htm_para14"><a name="10010726000179">No country has been insulated from the devastating effects of the collapse in the derivative markets, which has been the root cause of the recession. This has been the first global recession of a globalised financial system. However, the Government have taken strong action to recapitalise the banks and save the financial system through £850 billion in recapitalisations, loans and other guarantees. They have also shown strong leadership at a time of economic crisis.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o435"><a name="100107-0021.htm_para15"><a name="10010726000180">The Bank of England has also taken decisive action in monetary policy in maintaining interest rates at 0.5 per cent., and in my view the policy of quantitative easing has been broadly successful in injecting almost £200 billion into the economy through asset purchases. As the Japanese recession of 1990s and early 2000s has shown, interest rate reductions on their own cannot generate a lasting recovery. On that point, I take issue with the shadow Chief Secretary, the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond). In Japan, quantitative easing was used too late and too weakly to produce a strong stimulus for recovery. To produce a strong recovery here, fiscal policy is as important as monetary policy, which is why we need to maintain an equally bold direction in fiscal policy in 2010, to make it a steady year of recovery that benefits everyone.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o436"><a name="100107-0021.htm_para16"><a name="10010726000181">The real issue dividing the House is whether that stimulus should continue this year to allow for stronger growth in 2011 or whether we should engage in fiscal retrenchment through deficit reduction now. In my view, taking the latter approach this year would be disastrous for our prospects and run the risk of a double-dip recession. I take issue with the right hon. Member for Hitchin and Harpenden (Mr. Lilley) on this point: despite her many mistakes, which generated great hardship for my constituents in the 1980s, the noble Lady Thatcher did at least not cut public spending in the immediate aftermath of a recession, which the Conservative party is proposing to do now.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o437"><a name="100107-0021.htm_para17"><a name="10010726000182">Time is marching on and the wind-up speeches are about to begin.

I commend the pre-Budget report to the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o438"><a name="100107-0021.htm_para18"><a name="10010726000184">I will deal with the deficit and bond markets in due course. However, it is interesting that today, in the week that PIMCO, one of the world's largest bond funds, starting dumping UK Government gilts and only a few weeks after the OECD, the CBI and the Bank of England all warned that there was no proper plan in place to deal with the deficit, we have seen no response from the bunker, other than the pathetic Fiscal Responsibility Bill, which panned so badly on Tuesday. Not only is there is no plan; as I said from this Dispatch Box in October, the Government seem to be reverting to the view that there is actually no problem, returning to their position of last June, which is that there will be growth in spending after all.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o439"><a name="100107-0021.htm_para19"><a name="10010726000185">I want to digress for a moment and mention one item in the PBR that has not been mentioned today, namely the one tax cut in it, which is actually another tax con. The Chancellor has reduced bingo duty from 22 to 20 per cent., without bothering to mention that it was 15 per cent. before the last Budget. The Government claim that removing VAT offset the damage, but their sums were a mess. Even with duty at 20 per cent., bingo players today are paying more.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o440"><a name="100107-0021.htm_para20"><a name="10010726000186">Listening to the Back-Bench speakers, I noticed a curious tale from those on the Government Benches. Perhaps they thought better of it, but on Tuesday there were no Government Back-Bench speakers whatever, on the Government's flagship Fiscal Responsibility Bill. Clearly the Whips put out the call today, and the call was answered. The first three speakers were, again, mainly opponents of the Government, which I think is a sign of Labour's lurch to the left. Perhaps the Whips decided to bring them in here to prevent them from plotting.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o441"><a name="100107-0021.htm_para21"><a name="10010726000187">We heard similar themes from the right hon.

Member for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell)-real "Back to the 1980s", old Labour socialism. We even heard an incredible and wide-ranging attack on the financial services industry as a whole from the right hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras, which I found remarkable coming from the man who not so long ago ran to be Mayor of London.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o442"><a name="100107-0021.htm_para22"><a name="10010726000188">We also heard from two or three other Government Back Benchers who were perhaps a little less opposed and a little less socialist.

eloquently outlined the challenges ahead if the Government do not get a grip on the deficit. Indeed, his insights on financial matters will be much missed in the next Parliament.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o444"><a name="100107-0021.htm_para24"><a name="10010726000190">My hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Worcestershire (Peter Luff), who has had to go back to Worcestershire, also made a good speech-a real tour de force-about the PBR, and in particular about how it affects industry. I should also mention my hon. Friend the Member for Putney (Justine Greening). She tried to get in, but there was simply too much demand for speakers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o445"><a name="100107-0021.htm_para25"><a name="10010726000191">The hon.

<p><a name="stpa_o447"><a name="100107-0021.htm_para27"><a name="10010726000193">To return to the deficit, the British people clearly get the message that they have over-borrowed. According to the most recent figures that I have seen, new consumer borrowing per household has fallen, from £11.11 a day in January 2008 to just 34p a day in October 2009. The equivalent figures for new Government borrowing over the same period have risen from only £3.65 to a staggering £18.44 per household per day. I applaud the efforts of the British public to get to grips with their own debt. As the shadow Chancellor said, we are all in this together. Imagine our dismay, therefore, that the good work done by the British consumer to repair his or her own balance sheet has been submerged by the explosion in Government borrowing overseen by those on the Treasury Bench.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o448"><a name="100107-0021.htm_para28"><a name="10010726000194">There is a link between consumer credit, our disastrously poor savings ratio over the past 10 years, and the all-important bond markets. The Financial Secretary to the Treasury, who is going to wind up the debate, knows that I used to work in the international fixed income markets, so he could take heed of my warnings. Official and market interest rates are currently very low, but great care will be needed in the future. Forward interest rates-the indicator of where the market thinks rates are heading-are much higher than short-term rates. In fact, the multiplier of headline long-term rates, at about 8 times the level of short-term rates, could represent a historical record. It is worth remembering, as I have said before in this place, that a half per cent. increase in interest rates is far more significant when rates are low than when they are high.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o449"><a name="100107-0021.htm_para29"><a name="10010726000195">So the market is already anticipating substantial rises in interest rates. Even before any such rises have taken effect, debt interest is projected by the Treasury itself to rise from £22 billion this year to £67 billion in 2013. Obviously, the debt interest bill will rise substantially if interest rates rise significantly. That is another reason why fiscal responsibility is so important. If the Government continue to borrow uncontrollably, not only will the interest bill rise substantially, and potentially unsustainably, but the public sector will crowd the private sector out of the credit market. Members on both sides of this House rightly urge that more credit be offered to small and medium-sized enterprises, but this will be made much harder if we do not get a grip on the public finances and, at the same time, do all that we can to keep interest rates low.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o450"><a name="100107-0022.htm_para0"><a name="10010726000196">Our deficit is the worst of any major country. As I pointed out earlier in an intervention, the overall amount of debt in countries such as Italy and Japan is higher, but they have the saving grace of having a significant savings market. This country does not have such a market, due to the appalling decline in our savings ratio over the past 10 to 12 years. This is also where the public finances link in to our consumer debt problems. The crucial point is that if we divide the percentage of GDP that each country's outstanding debt represents by its domestic savings ratio, we find that we are actually in a far worse position than other countries-possibly even than Japan.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o451"><a name="100107-0022.htm_para1"><a name="10010726000197">We are already highly dependent on foreign demand, which means that we have to keep an eye on our currency strength as well as on our international credit rating. There has been a great deal of talk in recent months of credit rating downgrades and the possibility of gilt buyers' strikes. Neither of those risks should be underestimated, but another risk is that uncontrolled borrowing will lead to higher interest rates, both for the Government and for the wider economy, almost regardless of what happens to our credit rating. The market could make borrowing much more expensive than should ordinarily be the case, and the Government could end up paying large premiums for their borrowings. So whether long-term Government borrowing rates are at 4 per cent., 6 per cent. or 8 per cent. will make a huge difference to the public finances and to how much we can spend on our cherished public services.</p>

When it comes to spending and the deficit, the Government are behaving like a set of habitual drinkers, gathered around a table in a dingy pub as chucking-out time approaches. Everyone else in town, even those in the pub, can see that it is time for them to be slung out, but they are discussing going for one last binge. The way to avoid the hangover, they say, is to carry on drinking to the end. The worst offender is the boss himself, sat there with his two mates. Suddenly, the slightly more responsible Chancellor, who is actually the designated driver, weakly suggests that it might be time to stop. Heated discussion ensues: the Chancellor suggests that it is time for the boss to give up entirely, but suddenly, the boss's best mate of all returns from the bar clutching two bottles of whisky. Last orders are approaching for these people. The binge needs to end, the Government need to sober up and the whole country can see that it is time urgently to change course.</p>

 We have had a good debate. My right hon. Friend the Chancellor delivered the 2009 pre-Budget report after a very difficult period for the world economy. As we see signs of recovery, new confidence has been achieved through co-ordinated action by Governments and central banks around the world, co-ordinated successfully through the UK presidency of the G20. Britain's Prime Minister deserves enormous credit for that achievement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o460"><a name="100107-0022.htm_para10"><a name="10010732000003">What we can now do is compare the effect on jobs and families of the recessions of the 1980s and '90s-home-grown problems those, as my hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle-under-Lyme (Paul Farrelly) pointed out, not worldwide ones-with the recession that we have just been through. Those comparisons are made in the Treasury Select Committee report before us and they were also made by a number of contributors to the debate, including my right hon. Friend the Member for Holborn and St. Pancras (Frank Dobson), who rightly set out in sombre terms the consequences of some of the policies urged by Conservative party supporters.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o461"><a name="100107-0022.htm_para11"><a name="10010732000004">In the 1990s, home repossessions reached 75,000 a year. The Council of Mortgage Lenders forecast 75,000 repossessions again in 2009. A few weeks ago, it cut that estimate by more than a third because the policy of protecting home owners through the recession has worked. The alternative policy urged upon us-of letting the recession take its course-would have led to far more repossessions, such as we saw in the 1990s.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o462"><a name="100107-0022.htm_para12"><a name="10010732000005">In both the 1980s and 1990s recessions, the number claiming unemployment benefit reached 3 million. Many of us remember all too well the damage to our communities that resulted. We heard about that in the excellent speeches by my hon. Friends the Members for Halton (Derek Twigg) and for Sedgefield (Phil Wilson). Today, the number is just over half that-less than 1.7 million. In the most recent figures, it went down. The increase in unemployment has been half of what was forecast. Our policies of supporting the economy and supporting jobs have been working.</p>

team are exactly the policies applied by the Tory Government in the 1980s. The difference between us is whether those policies were successful or not. The right hon. Member for Hitchin and Harpenden clearly takes the view that that was a successful experience of management of the economy, but I have to tell him that that is not the country's view. As my hon. Friends have said, the realities of that experience should be taken to heart by Conservative Members.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o464"><a name="100107-0022.htm_para14"><a name="10010732000007">We have not seen in this recession the big increases in long-term unemployment that were so damaging in the 1980s and 1990s, or the big rise in the number receiving sickness benefits, which was in some ways the worst aspect of the 1980s recession, when jobcentres were incentivised to move people from unemployment benefit on to sickness benefit. Quite a lot of those people who went on to sickness benefit in the 1980s never worked again. We are still paying the price for the way in which that recession was managed by the Tory Government. As we have heard, businesses are failing at about half the rate that we saw in the earlier recessions. To put it bluntly, Labour policies have worked a great deal better than Tory policies did.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o465"><a name="100107-0022.htm_para15"><a name="10010732000008">The pre-Budget report, however, did not look back; it looked forward. Big challenges remain in the world economy, and our challenge now is to secure the recovery. That is why, in the pre-Budget report, my right hon. Friend the Chancellor decided to continue support for the economy now, which is what we should be doing. My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, North-East (Mr. Bain) was right to underline that point. We must continue to invest in services on which people rely, and in industries that will support our future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o466"><a name="100107-0022.htm_para16"><a name="10010732000009">The pre-Budget report also spelt out our commitment to halving the deficit over four years. The shadow Chief Secretary, the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond), appeared to edge towards agreeing that that was the right period in which to tackle the task-which would constitute a striking U-turn, given all the U-turns, forwards and then backwards, that the Conservatives have performed this week. The Conservatives have demanded greater detail from the Government, but we still have not heard their target for the deficit.</p>

He was right to spell out the dangers of precipitate spending cuts, and I welcomed his assessment of the PBR stance, which I think he described as reasonable. He asked whether the bank bonus tax should be made permanent. My answer is no, it should not. It is a one-off measure. For the long  <br>

Friend the Member for West Dunbartonshire (John McFall), spoke of the importance of keeping an eye on the problem of child poverty. We announced in the PBR that households receiving full tax credits and with incomes up to around £16,000 a year would qualify for free school meals for children of primary school age. That will boost the incentive for parents to obtain work and will reduce child poverty. The Select Committee was right to underline the continuing importance of our goals in that regard.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o469"><a name="100107-0022.htm_para19"><a name="10010732000012">As my right hon. Friend the Chancellor has observed on numerous occasions, support in the downturn goes hand in hand with steps to rebuild our fiscal strength once recovery is firmly established. The right hon. Member for Hitchin and Harpenden suggested that the pre-Budget report had not had much to say about that. He was entirely wrong. Across the world, countries are borrowing more. Stabilising the banking system and supporting the economy impose costs, although those costs will be much lower in the long run than they would be if we decided to let the recession run its course. Now, support during the downturn needs to be followed by steps to restore the public finances once recovery is established.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o470"><a name="100107-0022.htm_para20"><a name="10010732000013">We have set out clear goals for the consolidation. We have specified in the pre-Budget report how much we expect to spend in each year up to 2014-15 and how much we expect to receive in tax payments in each of those years, given the tax measures that we have announced and published. As a result, the deficit will fall to 5.5 per cent. of GDP by the end of that period, less than half the current level. Given further consolidation thereafter, debt as a share of GDP is projected to fall in 2015-16. To secure consolidation, the pre-Budget report announces tax rises for those with the greatest ability to pay, while ensuring that those on the lowest incomes will be protected.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o471"><a name="100107-0022.htm_para21"><a name="10010732000014">The pre-Budget report was right to support the economy in the way that it did and we were right to support the economy during the downturn, but now, as the economy starts to emerge from the crisis, we must not think that the job is finished. We have a great deal more to do over the next few years. The pre-Budget report set out actions to secure the recovery, to restore the public finances as we must, and to build our future.

 It is a great pleasure to have secured this Adjournment debate. I think that I was the first Member to raise the issue of umbilical cord blood as a private Member's Bill, and subsequently I raised it with other hon. Members during the passage of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 2008. Courtesy no doubt of Google word searches, my interest has led to a number of academics contacting me about their research into cord blood. I imagine that this debate will keep me at the top of the umbilical cord blood search page. However, my concern is to increase the understanding and application of cord blood.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o475"><a name="100107-0022.htm_para25"><a name="10010732000019">After I first raised the issue, several hon. Members spoke to me of their previous ignorance of umbilical cord blood. It is an ignorance that I shared, despite being a parent of six children and living close to one of the NHS hospitals that collects umbilical cord blood.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o476"><a name="100107-0022.htm_para26"><a name="10010732000020">Like the majority of parents in Britain, my wife and I thought that the umbilical cord once clamped was simply a waste product. We were totally unaware of the potential benefits of donating our children's umbilical cord blood. My understanding has grown over the years, aided by some excellent individuals in the charitable, private and public sectors who are passionate about cord blood. I pay tribute and thank the Anthony Nolan Trust and UK cord blood working group for their work and assistance and for rubbing off some of their passion on me. What inspires me to keep flying the flag for umbilical cord blood is meeting those children who are alive because of cord blood. This is a subject that can be literally a matter of life and death.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o477"><a name="100107-0022.htm_para27"><a name="10010732000021">Patients in the UK requiring a bone marrow donor currently have a one in four chance of survival. Only 50 per cent. of those looking for a donor will find one, and of those only 50 per cent. will survive. For those who find a bone marrow donor, many get their donor too late in their disease for the treatment to achieve success and that contributes to the 50 per cent. failure rate. Greater provision of cord blood could help those patients to get treatment faster and improve their chances of survival. For those who currently have no bone marrow donor, a larger provision of cord blood would give many of them a potentially life-saving option.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o478"><a name="100107-0022.htm_para28"><a name="10010732000022">Despite an increase in the awareness of those reading or listening to this debate, I feel that a short explanation of umbilical cord blood is in order. The baby's blood which is left behind in the umbilical cord contains many different types of cells. Some of these cells are stem cells, which have been shown to have a number of medical applications. Over the past 20 years, collected cord blood has been used for transplantation in the same way as bone marrow. It has been used to treat patients suffering from diseases such as leukaemia, sickle-cell diseases, immune deficiencies and others. Currently, there are over 85 treatments based on cord blood and there are more clinical trials in the pipeline.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o479"><a name="100107-0022.htm_para29"><a name="10010732000023">Researchers believe that cord blood has the potential to treat many more diseases, once adult stem cells are properly understood. There have been trials that show  <br>

that cord blood may be helpful in treating brain injuries in children. It is also being developed for other possible treatments such as diabetes, liver therapy, multiple sclerosis, testicular cancer and to regenerate damaged heart cells. The medical and financial value of cord blood should not be underestimated. Early indications from research conducted in the UK suggests that many of the patients currently receiving enzyme treatments at a cost of well over £100,000 per annum to the taxpayer, could find a cure through a cord blood transplant.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o480"><a name="100107-0022.htm_para30"><a name="10010732000024">Cord blood is particularly valuable in the treatment of leukaemia. It can be used as an alternative to bone marrow transplants. Collection of umbilical cord blood is a far less invasive procedure than extracting bone marrow. Units can be collected, frozen and then stored for years. That leads to fewer complications and makes transplants more readily available than bone marrow. Most importantly, it is easier to find matching stem cells from cord blood than from bone marrow. A properly developed infrastructure for the collection and storage of cord blood will do much to alleviate the severe shortage of life-saving stem cells needed for transplantation and facilitate research.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o481"><a name="100107-0022.htm_para31"><a name="10010732000025">Cord blood is a natural, safe, ethical and sustainable resource. It offers many advantages over using traditional bone marrow transplants from adult donors and would offer researchers an alternative to using embryonic stem cells.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o482"><a name="100107-0022.htm_para32"><a name="10010732000026">The previous time cord blood was debated in the House was during the passage of the HFE Act in the context of allowing so-called saviour siblings. I took part in the debate, and an irony was revealed in it: the contrast between the Government stretching ethical boundaries to accommodate so-called saviour siblings, but restricting the natural, safe, ethical and sustainable life-saving resource of cord blood, with 99.5 per cent. of umbilical cords thrown away.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o483"><a name="100107-0022.htm_para33"><a name="10010732000027">However, it is important to be charitable, and over the years there has been success and progress in the field of cord blood. The NHS was one of the first bodies to recognise the potential importance of cord blood, and some of the most important breakthroughs were made here in Britain. The NHS cord blood bank was established in 1996, and at the time it was one of only a handful in the world. Last year, the fifth umbilical cord blood collection facility, at St George's hospital in Tooting, was opened. The NHS CBB has moved into a state-of-the-art facility in Filton, which provides greater capacity and the flexibility to meet future clinical standards. I have visited one of the collection hospitals at Barnet, near my constituency, and I was impressed by the professional service, with all donations collected ex utero in a separate room so that the focus remains upon the care of the mother and baby.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o484"><a name="100107-0022.htm_para34"><a name="10010732000028">As of October 2009, the NHS CBB had banked approximately 14,000 donations and provided 279 units of cord blood to British patients, with 34 per cent. coming from black and minority ethnic communities. Given that there is only a 30 to 40 per cent. chance of a BME patient finding a matched unrelated donor, it is right that there is a focus on increasing cord collection within these communities.</p>

of donating their baby's cord blood. Even parents who have a history of blood-related disorders are not properly informed and have limited options to have their cord blood collected. Last year, an Enfield resident whose family had suffered from a rare anaemic disease contacted me in a desperate state. Her daughter was due to give birth any day and she had only just discovered by chance the value of collecting the cord blood. Fortunately, they lived near Barnet hospital, which collects cord blood, but only at certain times; they were told that unless the birth happened between 9 and 5, Monday to Thursday, the collection would not take place. Therefore, even if someone is fortunate enough to live near one of the five NHS collection hospitals, and even if they are fortunate enough to be fully informed about the potential life-saving value of cord blood to their child if they are at risk of developing a family blood-related disorder, the cord blood may still be thrown in the bin.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o486"><a name="100107-0023.htm_para1"><a name="10010732000030">At a time when the health service is so mindful of the need fully to inform patients about their health care, the issue of the collection of a mother-baby's cord blood does not seem to get the same level of attention. The principles of full information and consent do not seem to apply to cord blood, which is generally treated as a waste product, unbeknown to the parent apart from in exceptional circumstances.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o487"><a name="100107-0023.htm_para2"><a name="10010732000031">These circumstances of collection are more often dictated by the NHS collection targets than the wishes of the parents. It is hardly surprising that private companies come in to fill the void. Competition and tight regulation by the Human Tissue Authority have ensured that good practice predominates, but at a financial cost to parents. Private banking has its place, but what is lacking is access to sufficient cords available for public benefit from whatever source.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o488"><a name="100107-0023.htm_para3"><a name="10010732000032">In previous debates, I have said that the NHS bank of 14,000 blood cord units is too low. Last year, academic research confirmed that for a truly effective transplantation infrastructure to operate in a country of the UK's size and population, we will need to bank about 50,000 units of cord blood, and some people think the bar should be raised even higher. Either way, there is an urgent need for a sound projection of what is required, which should form the foundation of a comprehensive strategy for cord blood in the UK.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o489"><a name="100107-0023.htm_para4"><a name="10010732000033">At present, many patients-particularly those from ethnic minorities-who need transplants are unable to find matches. That has resulted in the NHS importing cords from the continent. The Anthony Nolan Trust has responded by collecting cords at King's College hospital, and has plans to extend this to 10 collection centres in maternity units around the country. At the request of the Government, a funding bid was submitted last June. The cord blood working group is also putting together the clinical and economic case for expansion. Will the Minister give a view on the progress of these plans?</p>

Our NHS cord blood bank is smaller than those of countries of a similar size, such as France. Greater attention and resources are paid to this issue in other countries such as Spain, Italy, Germany and the United States. At present, cord blood can be used only to treat a fairly narrow set of illnesses, but scientists believe that with more research and investment it could be used to treat a much wider range of illnesses. Research in this important area has been hindered by  <br>

lack of public awareness and by embryonic research crowding out other forms of research into stem cells. As a result, leading figures in this field such as Professor McGuckin and Dr. Forraz have left the UK to pursue their research in other countries that are more open to the possibilities offered by cord blood research.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o491"><a name="100107-0023.htm_para6"><a name="10010732000035">A key difficulty with cord blood transplants is the problem of engraftment where the body rejects the transplants, particularly in adolescents and adults. Until recently, UK transplanters have tended to opt for other established treatments because the reported results of cord blood usage have not been as promising. Indeed, I received news today of a health commissioner asking for a business case to be made for a prospective cord blood transplant-perhaps the Minister would comment on this worrying case.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o492"><a name="100107-0023.htm_para7"><a name="10010732000036">However, recent overseas advances in the use of cord blood and the launch last month of the first UK clinical trials of cord blood have greatly encouraged clinicians. At the instigation and under the management of Dr. Rachael Hough of University college London hospital, two clinical trials are running across the UK. The aim is to establish the safety and efficacy of using unrelated cord blood to bridge the engraftment problem, and to establish conditioning protocols. For example, it may be that by increasing the amount of cord blood stem cells-given the unique mobility involved-unrelated cord blood can provide safer and more effective life-saving treatments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o493"><a name="100107-0023.htm_para8"><a name="10010732000037">The scientific development and application of cord blood in other countries has reached a point where it would be neglectful for the UK not to embrace to the full this exciting option. It is becoming clear that having a large range of cord blood donations available for patients to find compatible transplants would save both lives and money. It is not just the Government who need to keep up with progress in the field of umbilical cord blood; the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists' last word on this was a 2006 report in reaction to perceived problems with some private operators, but the umbilical cord blood world in the public, charitable and private sector has made significant advances since then.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o494"><a name="100107-0023.htm_para9"><a name="10010732000038">To its credit, the Department of Health agreed to undertake a review of the collection and use of umbilical cord blood, and seminars and discussions have taken place. However, the progress of the review has been very slow. In October 2008, I asked the Secretary of State when the conclusions of these studies would be published. I was assured by the relevant Minister that the report would be made available later that year. When that did not occur, I asked the same question again-this time in March 2009-and the relevant Minister replied that these conclusions would be published in due course. It is now January 2010-happy new year-and the Department of Health has still to publish its findings.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o495"><a name="100107-0023.htm_para10"><a name="10010732000039">It is not sufficient for the Minister simply to rely on the report published by the consultant Technopolis. Indeed that report made the point when it concluded:</p>
<a name="100107-0023.htm_brev0"><a name="10010732000076"><ul><p class="tabletext">"No explicit national policy has been formulated on cord blood banking in the UK, either as part of health or science policy or as part of blood bank policy."</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o496"><a name="100107-0023.htm_para11"><a name="10010732000040">It went on to say:</p>
<a name="100107-0023.htm_brev1"><a name="10010732000077"><ul><p class="tabletext">"We recommend that the UK...consider... Creating a high-level advisory committee to provide the Minister and policy teams with advice on the detail of such a policy."</p>

I hope that we will hear something of the Government's conclusions from their review but will the Minister at least accept the long-standing invitation to speak to the all-party group on umbilical cord blood and adult stem cell, which I have the privilege of chairing?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o498"><a name="100107-0023.htm_para13"><a name="10010732000042">May I also ask the Government to provide regular updates on how many units of cord blood have been collected, stored and transplanted in the UK? The Government must make their views clearly known. Do they recognise the need to collect 50,000 units of cord blood? Does the Minister have a view on plans to increase numbers of blood cord transplants? I hope the Government will demonstrate a clear commitment to funding cord blood research and to the many lives that it could save.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o499"><a name="100107-0023.htm_para14"><a name="10010732000043">In September 2008, the then Health Secretary opened the Anthony Nolan Trust's excellent storage facility for cord blood with a stem cell research centre in Nottingham.

<p><a name="stpa_o500"><a name="100107-0023.htm_para15"><a name="10010732000044">in terms of cord blood. There is an opportunity for more lives to be saved, for valuable scientific research to be undertaken and for the UK to become a centre for excellence in cord blood. Two people die every day waiting for a stem cell transplant and 65,000 litres of cord blood are discarded every year. Will the Minister assure the House today that the Government are taking advantage of the wonderful opportunity offered by cord blood rather than, as seems to be the case, literally throwing it away?</p>

 I congratulate the hon. Member for Enfield, Southgate (Mr. Burrowes) on securing this debate. I well know of his interest in this matter as chair of the all-party group and I look forward to taking up the invitation that he has generously extended to me. I understand his passion about and interest in the subject and I have come to share them as I have become more familiar with it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o501"><a name="100107-0023.htm_para16"><a name="10010732000046">This is a very interesting and extremely exciting time for the people who stand to benefit from the possibilities held out by improving science and clinical practice. New approaches to stem cell transplantation hold out fresh hope for patients with leukaemia and other blood disorders and, of course, cord blood is becoming an increasingly important source of stem cells, particularly for those with rare tissue types not served by the bone marrow register.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o502"><a name="100107-0023.htm_para17"><a name="10010732000047">Our knowledge of the potential of cord blood is growing year on year as a result of the Government's investment in research and our commitment to supporting those who seek to find new answers for those who seek transplants and, because of this, the use of cord blood is increasing in terms of numbers and is broadening in scope. For example, it is likely that more adults than children will receive cord blood treatments this year for the first time, just one sign of how these treatments are evolving in use. I agree absolutely with the hon. Gentleman: cord blood can play an important role in treating blood disorders and cancers in the future and we want to be in a strong position to take advantage of these breakthroughs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o503"><a name="100107-0023.htm_para18"><a name="10010732000048">I know that the efficient and co-ordinated collection and storage of cord blood are crucial to that ambition and change. Our NHS cord blood bank is a world leader, holding the second largest inventory of unique tissue types in the world, and it is the world's fourth largest bank. As we have heard today, the bank will shortly be entirely based at the new £60 million blood processing facility in Filton, Bristol, which will be the largest facility of its kind in the world. Our current focus is on collecting from groups that are under-represented on the bone marrow register, because this is where we believe cord blood can make the most immediate and biggest contribution by extending new hope and providing life-saving treatment to those who have difficulty finding an appropriate tissue match.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o504"><a name="100107-0023.htm_para19"><a name="10010732000049">In England, we now have five NHS hospitals that can collect cord blood, all chosen because they serve families from a diverse multicultural mix, as was correctly pointed out by the hon. Gentleman. In October, I had the pleasure of opening the newest site at St. George's hospital in Tooting. While I was there, I was lucky enough to witness the collection of a cord blood unit. My officials told me that I could not have chosen a better time, as a woman had conveniently just given birth, and she donated cord blood while I was there. I was struck by how such a simple procedure could provide such a valuable resource, and it left me absolutely determined to promote cord blood collection and use.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o505"><a name="100107-0023.htm_para20"><a name="10010732000050">We have taken massive strides forward in recent years, but I am conscious that there is more to do. That is why we have agreed to provide a further £10 million to increase the size of the cord blood bank to 20,000 stored units by 2013. That reflects our commitment to support cord blood treatments into the future.</p>

<p><a name="st_o454"><a name="10010732000051"><a name="100107-0023.htm_spnew0"><a name="10010732000086"><b>Mr. Burrowes:</b>

 In a moment. I have listened carefully to the hon. Gentleman's arguments about the need for a larger bank. I understand his points, and I will keep an open mind on whether further expansion may be necessary. Before I take his intervention, though, I want to add that the issue goes even deeper, because we cannot settle on an optimal size for the bank until we have a clear view of how cord blood fits within the whole landscape of stem cell transplantation.</p>

<p><a name="st_o456"><a name="10010732000053"><a name="100107-0023.htm_spnew2"><a name="10010732000088"><b>Mr. Burrowes:</b>
 Those comments help with my question. Is it not the case that we need a comprehensive strategy to deal with all aspects of collection, storage, use and transplantation? We need to consider those issues and come to a settled view on what should be the optimal level, which might well be more than 20,000 units. I should like to know whether the door is open to consider the established academic figure of 50,000 or more.</p>

<p><a name="st_o457"><a name="10010732000054"><a name="100107-0023.htm_spnew3"><a name="10010732000089"><b>Gillian Merron:</b>
 Perhaps if the hon. Gentleman allows me to continue a little, he will be pleased with some of my comments about how we should move forward. I hope that the all-party group will be part of that moving forward.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o506"><a name="100107-0023.htm_para21"><a name="10010732000055">The hon. Gentleman argued that we should move towards the routine collection of cord blood. Again, I understand the point about widening the range of collection, but there is not a strong call for that approach from the research or medical communities.</p>

 Let me clear up this point. I have called not for routine collection but for the routine provision of information. It should be a matter of routine that all expectant parents are advised about cord blood, its value and benefits, and where it can be collected.</p>

<p><a name="st_o459"><a name="10010732000057"><a name="100107-0023.htm_spnew5"><a name="10010732000091"><b>Gillian Merron:</b>
 I thank the hon. Gentleman for that clarification, and I understand his point, but we need to give routine information that is linked to a whole approach to dealing with cord blood collection. Our priority has to be a focus on quality rather than quantity. That means finding good matches to treat those with rare tissue types.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o507"><a name="100107-0023.htm_para22"><a name="10010732000058">If we want to go further in utilising the benefits of cord blood, we need to understand how it best complements other sources of stem cell transplants, most notably bone marrow. We have to decide what the future of stem cell transplantation should look like, and what resources we will need to support it. Only when we have that can we make an informed decision on the size and scope of the NHS cord blood bank. I know that the hon. Gentleman is concerned about that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o508"><a name="100107-0023.htm_para23"><a name="10010732000059">The hon. Gentleman mentioned the Technopolis report on cord blood that the Department of Health commissioned in 2008. That report was an important starting point, and I am happy to support many of its recommendations. Since its publication, departmental officials have been in lengthy discussions with NHS Blood and Transplant, the Anthony Nolan Trust and other players to take forward many aspects of the review. We are now working closely with the recently established umbilical cord blood transplant working group, and I believe that that will give us real insight into what is really holding back cord blood collection and use. It will delve into the practicalities of improving clinical awareness and the need for better patient information, which the hon. Gentleman has called for. It will also help us to understand where the latest research may take us in future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o509"><a name="100107-0023.htm_para24"><a name="10010732000060">The key recommendation that came out of the Technopolis report was the need for a national strategy on cord blood. As I have said, we cannot approach the issue of cord blood transplantation in isolation. We have to think about how bone marrow and cord blood collection can complement each other and about the challenges facing us, now and in future, in relation to those sources of stem cells. We also need to define the role for all key partners, and start to bring together the various systems and structures that support stem cell transplantation to ensure even closer working. There are, of course, many different interest groups involved and I want to be absolutely sure that their views are fully represented as we take things forward, but we all have the same, singular objective-to help to save more lives.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o510"><a name="100107-0023.htm_para25"><a name="10010732000061">That is what this work is really about. We can discuss bank size, the pros and cons of one system over another or who is best at doing what-and those are all important discussions and decisions that we have to make-but all that really matters is whether we can make the difference between a person living or dying. We have to make choices that will make the biggest difference to those patients so, for me, that is what will drive our work in the future.</p>

 Do we not need some form of mechanism, as well as the regular reports, for making information available-for instance, about the number of units of cord blood that have been collected or are in storage or used in transplants?
