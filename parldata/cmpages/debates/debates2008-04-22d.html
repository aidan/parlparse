I am completely committed to ensuring a level playing field for UK hauliers and foreign hauliers. It was absolutely right that we considered the so-called vignette scheme, which proposed a daily charge for non-British lorries that use UK roads, although even the haulage industry decided that that was probably too complex and costly to implement.

 We have taken a long detailed look at the issues, not just in government, but through our work with the road haulage industry, to see whether it would be possible to introduce a scheme that would take account of the infrastructure and maintenance costs for British roads.

 My hon. Friend makes an absolutely excellent point. I am determined to ensure that rather than automatically jumping to the conclusion that extra capacity is needed on British roads, we think first and foremost about the best use of our existing network. That might mean bringing the hard shoulder into use, and if we decide to do so, we should think about how that extra space is used. One possibility is that we reserve it for car-share lanes, but we could also think about whether crawler lanes might be appropriate for longer heavier vehicles. We will review, motorway by motorway, the use of extra capacity to ensure that it is used to best effect.</p>

 The regional transport board has responsibility for prioritising the regional funding allocation and it decides the priority for allocations to roads such as that mentioned by the hon. Lady. In the proposals on the sub-national review, transport comes under the auspices of the regional development agencies, and the agencies and the regional assemblies are responding to those proposals and determining how they would like such strategic transport issues to work.

 My hon. Friend is quite right. That was why the Government introduced local transport plans&#151;for which, incidentally, funding has doubled since 2001&#151;which made local authorities responsible for taking an integrated approach on local transport. The Local Transport Bill, which is now going through Parliament, will give local authorities more powers to introduce quality partnership schemes and quality contracts, which have been widely welcomed by local authorities in all parts of the country, and, incidentally, by all political parties.

It is right that we examine these matters on a scheme-by-scheme basis across the country, and that we consider how we can move freight around in the most efficient way possible and how we can do that with the minimum impact on the environment. That is why last year we invested the single biggest sum for a generation&#151;&#163;150 million&#151;in encouraging rail freight infrastructure and why, in the rail White Paper, we committed ourselves to investing another &#163;200 million in the strategic freight network. Those investments will provide real benefits to the freight industry, and I hope that they will keep the lid on road container traffic and encourage more vehicles off the roads and on to rail.</p>

 No comparative assessment has been made. Safety cameras and vehicle-activated signs are used to tackle different road safety problems. Safety cameras are effective in tackling excessive speed&#151;speeds over the posted speed limit. Vehicle-activated signs are generally used to tackle inappropriate speed, and have proven particularly effective when used to warn drivers of approaching hazards on rural roads.</p>

 The cost of a speed camera, including installation, is about &#163;50,000, whereas the cost of a vehicle-activated sign is only &#163;1,000. The Department for Transport&#146;s own figures say that 2.2 accidents are estimated to be prevented by a speed camera in one year, whereas vehicle-activated signs are estimated to prevent 3.1 accidents. Does the Minister therefore agree that the Department&#146;s own figures show that not only are vehicle-activated signs more effective in improving road safety, but they are very much better value for money? Will he consider introducing a policy that vehicle-activated signs should be given preference over speed cameras wherever the location is appropriate?</p>

 The decision about which type of camera to deploy and where is very much a matter for local road safety partnerships, which receive &#163;110 million extra a year to do that. I am not sure where the hon. Lady found her figures. The four-year independent evaluation report on the 4,100 speed camera sites, published in 2005, recorded a 42 per cent. reduction in serious crashes a year, meaning 100 fewer deaths and 1,600 fewer seriously injured&#151;as opposed to the two or three that she mentions. Our figures are at variance and I would be happy to discuss them with her, because I know that the objective for the whole House is to reduce the numbers needlessly killed or seriously injured on our roads.</p>

 It is easy to answer that question by simply saying yes. Speed cameras are delivering road safety targets that we all want to see. Some 3,000-plus people die and nearly 30,000 are seriously injured every year on our roads. Speed cameras are demonstrably helping to reduce those figures, and anybody who is selfish enough to damage the cameras because they have been careless enough to have been caught breaking the rules should feel the full weight of the law.</p>

I am sure that he will appreciate that biofuels account for only some 2 per cent. of total food production and that other international factors are involved, such as recent droughts and an increasing demand for meat in preference to crops. Our system for supporting biofuel production in the UK must be sustainable. That is why we have introduced a world class sustainability reporting mechanism and the renewable transport fuels obligation at the cautious level of 2.5 per cent. It is why we are determined not to go beyond the level of 5 per cent. in 2010 without making sure that there are mandatory sustainability standards in place. My hon.

We are going to need in this country both aviation, which will serve the interests not just of London but of the wider UK economy, and a decent rail service, at prices that people can afford.</p>

A problem clearly exists, therefore, although owners can use a peel-off part of the certificate to remind themselves about when renewal falls due.

<a name="80422-0004.htm_brev0"><a name="08042260000298"><ul><p class="tabletext">That leave be given to bring in a Bill to make provision about the content of driving tests; to create offences relating to dangerous driving; and for connected purposes.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o19"><a name="80422-0004.htm_para0"><a name="08042260000163">In introducing this Bill, I wish to make specific acknowledgment of the work of the children and young people&#146;s think tank &#147;Kids Count&#148;, and of the &#147;Drive to Survive&#148; campaign. I also want to recognise the work of Inspector Toby Day of Leicestershire police and of the all-party parliamentary group on child and youth crime. I want to thank all of them for their assistance on the matters that I am bringing before the House this afternoon.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o20"><a name="80422-0004.htm_para1"><a name="08042260000164">In 2006, the last year for which figures are available, 3,200 drivers, passengers and pedestrians lost their lives as a result of road accidents, but no figures, numbers and statistics can convey the underlying tragedy of each case&#151;the loss of friends, family members and loved ones whose lives have been cut short, and the lifelong impact on those left behind. The headline figures mask some disturbing trends and patterns of behaviour. Although the total number of fatalities has decreased over the past five years, the number of fatalities among young drivers under 25 has gone up from 537 to 606&#151;an increase of 13 per cent. The number of young drivers under the age of 25 convicted of driving while intoxicated due to drink or drugs also increased in that period.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o21"><a name="80422-0004.htm_para2"><a name="08042260000165">There is also the serious issue of deaths arising from high-speed chases. In 2006-07, some 155 people were killed or seriously injured as a result of road traffic collisions on public roads during emergency responses and police pursuits. Some of the recent headlines say it all. A police officer was injured after his patrol car collided with a stolen caravan during a chase on the M6, a woman was killed and four people taken to hospital when a car collided with a Mercedes that was fleeing police in east London, and friends of a teenager who died in a car that crashed after it was involved in a police pursuit have been paying tribute to him ahead of his funeral. At the end of last year the Independent Police Complaints Commission published its two-year review of road traffic incidents involving police vehicles that resulted in a fatality or serious injury. It made 29 recommendations about how police practice could and should be changed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o22"><a name="80422-0004.htm_para3"><a name="08042260000166">More should be done to reduce the number of deaths and injuries arising from accidents involving young drivers and pursuits. That will partly involve prevention through demonstrating, and bringing home very clearly, the reality of being involved in a serious car accident. I was moved by a recent presentation organised by Drive Survive, a multi-agency partnership based in Cheshire. Partners involved in the project and the presentations that Drive Survive offer include the police, the fire brigade, the Highways Agency, the ambulance service and hospital accident and emergency services. By dramatically highlighting the consequences of inappropriate driving and vehicle control, Drive Survive seeks to educate young people aged between 16 and 25 of the risks involved in driving dangerously or recklessly, and to prevent serious injury or worse.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o23"><a name="80422-0004.htm_para4"><a name="08042260000167">Having sat through part of the presentation, I can confirm that the content is deliberately graphic and hard-hitting. It shows real-life images of accident scenes and direct testimony from those who do an amazing job in responding to emergency call-outs. Most importantly, it includes personal accounts from families affected by the loss of a relative in a car crash. The project has received very positive feedback from local colleges and other stakeholders, who testify to the impact that it has had. I believe that such education, understanding and recognition of the consequences of dangerous driving could have a wider impact and could start to change attitudes, altering the approach of young, normally male, drivers who think that it is impressive or the right thing to do to try to show off to their mates about the limits of what their cars can do, or indeed of what they can do behind the wheel of a car.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o24"><a name="80422-0004.htm_para5"><a name="08042260000168">My Bill would amend the Road Traffic Act 1988 by including a specific reference in the driving test to the impact of being involved in an accident involving a motor vehicle, and in relation to the powers of the Secretary of State and local authorities to provide road safety information and training. I believe that that small change to the law would assist, encourage and facilitate a national programme to temper the behaviour of young drivers through hard-hitting education and training programmes focused on the reality of driving dangerously. By providing such a real-life context as part of the theory exam in the current driving test, it will make the test more relevant and emphasise other existing safety aspects of the theory requirements.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o25"><a name="80422-0004.htm_para6"><a name="08042260000169">This approach is intended to build on the current Arrive Alive road safety programme conducted by the Driving Standards Agency, and to extend the concepts of what happens when an accident occurs&#151;the types of injuries sustained, the likelihood of survival, and so on&#151;so that they form an important part of the preparation for learning to drive.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o26"><a name="80422-0004.htm_para7"><a name="08042260000170">The second part of my proposals addresses the legal sanctions available in circumstances where there is a pursuit. To date the focus has been on dealing with the effects of pursuits, instead of the cause. Pursuits are inherently dangerous and are difficult to manage and contain operationally. If drivers did not make off from the police, there would be no reason to pursue them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o27"><a name="80422-0004.htm_para8"><a name="08042260000171">The instant that drivers decide to accelerate away from police vehicles to avoid capture, for whatever reason, they make the decision to enter an extremely high-risk arena where a number of lives, including their own, are put at risk. Many of them have driven vehicles at horrendous speeds along public roads for up to an hour before they are stopped, and are prepared to take any steps to evade arrest, yet even when they are caught, most walk away with little or no punishment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o28"><a name="80422-0004.htm_para9"><a name="08042260000172">A number of pursuits occur when offenders choose to make an escape having committed relatively minor offences. Research has shown that the main reason why offenders flee in a vehicle is that they are not deterred by the low level of punishment that they perceive will result from their actions. Some reports indicate that the prospect of a custodial sentence would cause offenders to abandon their vehicle at an early stage and make off on foot. Although current sentencing guidelines for the offence of dangerous driving allow for evading arrest  <br>

to be taken into account, this approach is not acting as a deterrent, and in my judgment is not working well in practice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o29"><a name="80422-0004.htm_para10"><a name="08042260000173">My Bill would therefore create a new offence aimed at someone refusing to stop when requested by a police officer and then engaging in sustained and extreme dangerous driving. It would achieve this by creating an aggravated driving offence punishable by an unlimited fine, mandatory disqualification and up to three years&#146; imprisonment. A key part of the new offence is that it would require intent; in other words, where someone is asked to stop, knowingly fails to do so and then drives dangerously, an offence would be committed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o30"><a name="80422-0004.htm_para11"><a name="08042260000174">This approach has the support of the Association of Chief Police Officers and the Police Federation. Too many lives continue to be lost on our roads. We need to cut the annual death toll. The measures that I have outlined are practical, proportionate and deliverable.

 It is a pleasure to join hon. Members to debate the Bill on Report. The Bill has been marked by a considerable degree of consensus not only among parties in the House, but among those outside the House, who have contributed enormously.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o39"><a name="80422-0004.htm_para20"><a name="08042260000186">This group of new clauses and amendments relates to the application of the employer duties established by this Bill. Three groups require special provision&#151;the Crown, the armed forces and the police. New clause 17 brings the Crown sovereign and executive within the scope of the employer duty. As a result, workers employed by the Crown will have the same opportunities as other workers to save for retirement under the reforms. Of course, I reassure the House that, in accordance with long-established principles of constitutional law, the Crown will not be exposed to criminal sanctions. Instead, this amended provision enables the regulator to apply to the High Court or to the Court of Session for a failure by the Crown to comply with duties set out in clause 40(1) to be declared unlawful. That follows the approach adopted for most modern employment legislation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o40"><a name="80422-0004.htm_para21"><a name="08042260000187">As trailed in Committee, new clause 18 excludes the armed forces and the reserve forces from the reforms set out in the Bill. It also excludes cadet force adult volunteers from the scope of the reforms. Members of the armed forces have a special position in law. They are subject to service law rather than general employment law, except  <br>

in specific circumstances relating to discrimination in relation to race and sex, but not to age or disability. For that reason, and in view of the 100 per cent. take-up of pension saving by the regular forces, the Government consider it appropriate to exclude the armed forces from the reforms. Members of the regular armed forces are automatically enrolled in non-contributory pension schemes, and the Ministry of Defence has no record of anyone opting out: there isn&#146;t a problem, so let&#146;s not mess with it. Of course, references to the armed forces in pensionable service include not only regular forces, but those undertaking certain forms of service while mobilised or undertaking full-time reserve service.</p>

 Obviously, how much someone gets depends on the length of time for which they contribute and the pot that they build up, so there is not a straight answer to that question. I will ask my officials to consider the balance, because many soldiers will serve for less time than many employees will have to build up a pension pot in regular, non-military employment. I will examine the figures carefully and write to the hon. Gentleman, who has asked a reasonable question.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o41"><a name="80422-0004.htm_para22"><a name="08042260000190">Reservists may accrue benefit under the reserve forces pension scheme, if they enter full-time reserve service. That is also one of the options available to mobilised reservists. Another option is remaining with their existing pension scheme&#151;their employer scheme&#151;in which case the Ministry of Defence would pay the employer contribution. Separately, cadet force adult volunteers offer their time without receiving a wage or pension contributions. Although they may receive occasional remuneration for training, this clause makes it clear there will be no access to pension saving.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o42"><a name="80422-0004.htm_para23"><a name="08042260000191">Finally, new clause 19 brings members of the constabulary and police cadet forces of Great Britain within the scope of the reforms. It is necessary, because some police officers are &#147;office holders&#148; and do not therefore routinely fall within the definition of &#147;employee&#148; or &#147;worker&#148;. Accordingly, those members who are not employed under an employment or worker&#146;s contract are included by being treated as workers. We include constables and trainees appointed by the chief officer of police as &#147;police cadets&#148;. Police officers in a Home Office or Scottish force become members of the police pension scheme. The great majority are members of the 1987 scheme, but since April 2006 entrants have become members of the new police pension scheme 2006. Both schemes are defined-benefit pension schemes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o43"><a name="80422-0004.htm_para24"><a name="08042260000192">The officers&#146; contribution rate for each scheme is relatively high. Although we think that it provides good value for money, it can and does cause a very small number of officers to opt out, particularly during early years of service when earnings are lower. The new clause will ensure that any officer who opts out of the police pension scheme will receive the same protection as others in employment&#151;that the employer retains the duty to seek to re-enrol non-participating officers at key  <br>

 I have a question on a separate issue, although it is related to the points that the hon. and learned Gentleman has just made. He is describing particular sections of the public sector work force that will be excluded from the Bill&#146;s provisions. Yet further on in the Bill, as the Minister will obviously know, a procedure is laid out for occupational schemes to exempt themselves from applying personal accounts because they already have in place occupational schemes of satisfactory quality. Why have the Government decided to take a different route for these public sector employees by making them specifically exempt in the Bill, rather than just allowing them to follow that exemption procedure, as private sector firms will be required to do?</p>

 I would give a comprehensive answer to the hon. Gentleman, but that would take an awfully long time. I am afraid that there have been lengthy negotiations with the armed forces, for example, about whether they wanted to be included or not. The Ministry of Defence has had various discussions with us at different stages. Our original view was that it would be better for the armed forces to be in, but now we have taken the view that they want to be out. In respect of the long-term impact, I should say that all the armed forces sign up to the pension scheme anyway. That  <br>

scheme works very well and we do not want to mess with it. If the MOD wants this exemption, I am happy to go along with that. Broadly, I try to deal with the issues raised in relation to the Bill by looking at them on their merits. Over a period, we have seen that the views of some of the stakeholders have changed. That is the case with the armed forces, and I am happy with the position that we have now got to.</p>

 I thank the Minister for that reply. I suppose that the underlying concern behind my question is that many private sector firms are worried that the process for opting out is over-complicated, and some would like it to be simplified. I completely applaud the Minister&#146;s reasons for why one would want to exempt the groups that he has just described. However, if an exemption is given to public sector firms through a different mechanism, the private sector people concerned about that extra complexity will be worried that they are not being treated fairly, and that there is not a level playing field.</p>

 Early in the consideration of the Bill I picked up some concerns from employers about the complexity of the provision to exempt them from having to enrol in this form of personal accounts. We kept it very simple. Essentially, they must have a provision that matches personal accounts and makes a minimum 3 per cent. employer contribution, with a 4 per cent. contribution from the employee. The exemption is very straightforward, and they should be able to identify whether they may be exempt. Certainly, the pension providers who provide the pension to employers should be able to say immediately whether their scheme is exempt. It will not apply to some schemes because the contribution levels are too low, and we have been clear that we want to increase those contribution levels where that is the case.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o45"><a name="80422-0004.htm_para26"><a name="08042260000205">By and large, I have not picked up any recent concerns. The CBI, the Federation of Small Businesses and others have been broadly supportive of the way in which we have undertaken this. The hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare seems to be flashing some document at me. If it is from an organisation, I have met most of the organisations concerned and we have had broad support for the Bill as a whole, although there are specific concerns. We have tried to keep the issue of exemption as simple and straightforward as possible. We are conscious that the Bill will apply to small-scale employers such as the chippie down the road or the hairdresser round the corner, who may employ just a couple of people, and we wanted to ensure that the provisions were not so complex that they would have to do an awful lot of reading or examination of the issues. Concerns have been expressed to me about one problem that we will no doubt come to later on&#151;how earnings are calculated. That can get quite complicated, but we are looking into technology to try to deal with that for some of the smaller-scale employers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o46"><a name="80422-0004.htm_para27"><a name="08042260000206">These specific exemptions are included in the Bill primarily because they deal with public sector employees who have their own particular provisions. On that basis, they are justified and I hope that the House will support them.</p>

 May I take the Minister back a few moments, to when we were discussing the armed forces? I fully appreciate that most members of the armed forces would not wish to opt out, least of all those who serve 22 years-plus. However, there is a group of people who leave the armed forces early and wish to transfer their rights into another scheme. For instance, when I left the armed forces&#151;the Grenadier Guards&#151;I transferred my rights into the fire service. I appreciate that the Minister may not be able to answer me now, but this is a very important issue for those of our armed forces who are not going to serve for 22 years but have a pension provision to take with them. Will any parts of the Bill affect their right to transfer into other schemes?</p>

<p><a name="st_o115"><a name="08042260000208"><a name="80422-0005.htm_spnew1"><a name="08042260000464"><b>Mr. O'Brien:</b>
 To some extent, but it would not affect the sort of situation that the hon. Gentleman identifies with people transferring from the armed forces into the fire service. Because there are restrictions on the amount that can be transferred into personal accounts, the person concerned would not be able simply to transfer in a certain amount. One of the approaches that we have taken is to say that there is no transfer in and no transfer out of personal accounts, so amounts are not transferred in in that way. Many employers who currently have pension schemes will continue with those schemes. The personal accounts scheme is there as a default scheme for employers who do not have an adequate occupational pension scheme. Our intention is that employers who already have good-quality occupational pension schemes should continue with those schemes.</p>

 The point that I was trying to make is that there are tiny amounts frozen within the armed forces schemes, which are useless in the long term as regards when people will get their pensions, but would be useful if they could be transferred into the personal accounts scheme.</p>

 I have a considerable degree of sympathy with that point. As part of the process of developing a consensus, we arrived at the &#147;no transfers in and no transfers out&#148; rule. However, I have repeatedly been told that some employees, including members of the armed forces, have quite small pension pots and that leaving them there is a hassle, so getting them into personal accounts or another scheme would be a better way.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o47"><a name="80422-0005.htm_para0"><a name="08042260000213">However, some of the providers of pensions, and particularly insurance-based products, have concerns about the provisions that allow transfers in, even of small pension pots. We have said that at the start, transfers will not be allowed into personal accounts. However, we will review the situation in 2015, with a view to ensuring that we look at the matter again. My personal view, which is not reflected in the Bill because it is not part of the consensus, and we have reached an agreement, is that it should be possible to transfer in small pension pots, because it will just be a hassle if that cannot happen. There is no such provision in this Bill, but there will be a review in due course, and at that point, I hope that the practice will be allowed.</p>

 I begin by echoing the Minister&#146;s opening remarks. I thank all members of the Committee&#151;some of whom have retained their enthusiasm for the Bill, while others clearly have not&#151;the officials, Clerks and everyone else involved. I pay particular tribute to my hon. Friend the Member for South-West Bedfordshire (Andrew Selous), who sadly cannot be with us today because of ill health. He made a signal contribution in Committee, and as a former officer in the Territorial Army, he did so in particular on the provisions concerning the armed forces and reservists.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o49"><a name="80422-0005.htm_para2"><a name="08042260000218">New clause 17 seems fairly clear to me; I suppose it might be called the &#147;Backstairs Billy&#148; new clause, dealing with those employed directly by the Queen or members of the royal family. Sadly, Backstairs Billy is no longer with us, so he will not be able to benefit from the provision. It is right that the Crown&#146;s direct employees are swept into this provision. My right hon. Friend the Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood) made a point about enforcement a moment ago; as I understand it, the best that the Pensions Regulator can do is apply to the courts for a declaration that the Crown has failed to comply with any of the duties set out in clause 40(1), which concerns the enrolling of employees into the system of personal accounts. There is no criminal liability at all. I believe that the matter is based on legislation concerning the working time directive. I guess that we will just have to rely on the sovereign doing the decent thing when such a declaration is made.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o50"><a name="80422-0005.htm_para3"><a name="08042260000219">The important issue of reservists was raised in Committee by my hon. Friend the Member for South-West Bedfordshire, who felt quite strongly that the distinction between regulars and Territorials has been eroded in recent years. Many Territorials spend a great deal of time on active service in Iraq, Afghanistan or wherever, and therefore they should not be treated any differently from regular members of the armed forces. It was helpful to hear both what the Minister said and what he set out in the letter he wrote to the Committee in February, in which he made clear that reservists can accrue their own benefits under the reserve forces pension scheme.</p>

assume is, in all essentials, a non-contributory defined- benefit scheme. It is important to see not only what the likely benefits will be over a given period, but what contribution the taxpayer will make.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o52"><a name="80422-0005.htm_para5"><a name="08042260000221">I am sure that the Minister would agree that, broadly speaking, the benefits obtainable under that scheme should be at least as good as those that would be available under personal accounts, albeit without the contribution from the employee, in this case a member of the armed forces. I suspect that if there is any inadequacy in that comparison our colleagues in the Lords will wish to come back to the issue at some stage. Broadly speaking, however, we have no difficulty at all with the new clauses or the amendments in the group and would be happy to see them in the Bill.</p>

 I should like to delay the House briefly to comment on what the Minister said. I understand that he has reached a consensus on people opting in or out of the provisions in the Bill and that he feels it difficult to move from that until 2015. However, the armed forces are an exceptional group of people, the vast majority of whom do not serve their full 22 years&#151;or these days up to 30 years. When welcoming members of the armed forces from my constituency back from Afghanistan, I met someone who has just agreed to do another five years after serving for 22 years and who even hopes to do another five after that, making 32 years&#146; service in the armed forces. However, that is quite rare. The vast majority of men and women in our armed forces serve for between three and five years. The amount of money in the pension pots that they accrue is minuscule. The administrative costs on the state&#151;in this case on the MOD&#151;of running those schemes from within, rather than their being opted out of, into another Government scheme that could be administered separately, are huge as a proportion of the benefits of the scheme.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o53"><a name="80422-0005.htm_para6"><a name="08042260000223">I would like the Minister to look into the issue again and to reconsider that exceptional group of people earlier than 2015, to see whether he could reach a consensus among the members of the other groups with which he has been dealing. I am sure that they would understand that our armed forces are particularly affected. There could be groups of people who have served for short periods in the armed forces&#151;perhaps they served only in training, but were injured through no fault of their own and had to leave the armed forces. It seems ludicrous that there should be a tiny pot that will sit until they are 60 years old, but which could be brought into such schemes quite easily.</p>

and we heard various views on it. The concern among some stakeholders is that there will be a transfer into personal accounts of a significant number of pension schemes, which some of those running such schemes are concerned might lead to what is called a levelling down of the quality of provision. To avoid that, we have said that that should not happen at the start. That provision will run on, and we will look into it when we hold the review.</p>

In any event, there will be a three-year running-in phase. Reaching the compromise involves precisely the problem that the hon. Gentleman has identified; I do not dispute anything that he has said. Some people will end up with very small pension pots not being transferred in, although it would be better to do so. However, this is part of getting broad consensus and support and, although it is not what we might otherwise have wanted, it is a price worth paying to get everyone to sign up to agreeing that this is the right way to proceed. I understand the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point. Indeed, it was discussed in Committee. Having said that I sympathise with him even though I cannot deliver exactly what he wants, I hope that he will none the less offer his support to the new clause.</p>

 It is a great pleasure to commend to the House new clause 1 and the associated new clauses and amendments in this group. This group falls neatly into two distinct categories, and it is important for hon. Members to understand that there are two major issues involved. One is the commencement of the personal accounts system. The second is what was referred to in Committee as the level playing field issue, namely the extent to which personal accounts will or will not compete on equal terms with existing alternative pension provisions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o74"><a name="80422-0005.htm_para27"><a name="08042260000252">For once, I can say with hand on heart that there is no shadow of a doubt about the Government&#146;s policy. It is that the new system should commence in 2012. Of course, even that is a couple of years late, because the Turner commission originally foreshadowed personal accounts as a new system to be set up in 2010. None the less, the Government have made it abundantly clear&#151;as did the Minister in Committee&#151;that 2012 was to be the start date, and that continues to be the Government&#146;s firm intention.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o75"><a name="80422-0005.htm_para28"><a name="08042260000253">We might therefore wonder why a similarly worded amendment in Committee did not find favour with Ministers.

would not be ideal, but the prospect of the start date being postponed is almost as difficult to contemplate. The Secretary of State, who is sadly no longer in his place, made a rather good speech a while ago about the sort of planning blight that affects people&#146;s saving for their retirement; they may have read that something is going to happen in 2012, which might be taken as a reason for not doing something now. On any view, a gap of several years, which can never be redeemed, for some people who could and should be saving for their retirement, is unfortunate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o81"><a name="80422-0006.htm_para5"><a name="08042260000259">One particularly interesting thing that emerged from Committee debates was that a review was going on, as Mr. Jones accepted in the Radio 4 interview. Having been brought into the new job, he was carrying out a review, as we would expect, of how practical all this would be. There was some to-ing and fro-ing between the Minister and myself about whether Mr. Jones would produce a report at the end of the process. We know that PADA currently employs some 100 different consultants, presumably trying to get the right answers to these questions, but there seemed to be some doubt&#151;at least in the Minister&#146;s mind&#151;as to whether, by the end of these deliberations, Mr. Jones would actually produce a report on how likely it was that personal accounts would be up and running in 2012.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o86"><a name="80422-0006.htm_para10"><a name="08042260000264">Having reflected on the issue since, I still take the view that it is inconceivable that Mr. Jones, in view of his meticulous nature and experience in these matters, will not produce a pretty hefty report for somebody&#151;presumably his chairman and/or Ministers&#151;at the end of the review process. We are simply saying, as part of the general air of amity and consensus that has been evident throughout most of the Bill&#146;s passage so far, that we should be privy to those conclusions. We all have a problem if there are real, practical difficulties&#151;with IT or other systems or for any other reason&#151;in delivering the project on time. None of us should underestimate the significance or the size of the challenge facing Mr. Jones and his team. I am quite sure that, because of his past experience, he is up to the job, but that is really why we wanted the matter out in the open on Report.</p>

 Is my hon. Friend a little worried that if a Conservative Government were not elected until May 2010 and inherited a mess or confusion, it would be very difficult to introduce the scheme in time if we legislate in this way?</p>

 My right hon. Friend has put his finger on the nub of the problem. It would be extremely unfair on an incoming Pensions Minister, whoever it might be, to find at the top of his in-tray or in his first red box a report, already some months or years old, saying &#147;We&#146;re sorry, mate, this can&#146;t happen in 2012.&#148; It is overwhelmingly important to all of us for whom personal accounts are the only game in town to know almost as quickly as Ministers if there is a problem, and how it can be fixed.</p>

The central issue is that of the level playing field. It has always been an absolute principle&#151;in fairness, for the Government as well&#151;that apart from some seedcorn for PADA to set itself up and perform its initial task, the personal accounts system should wash its own face in financial terms. The costs should be recovered not from the taxpayer but from the scheme itself and its members, possibly over a period of years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o88"><a name="80422-0006.htm_para12"><a name="08042260000268">What worried us in Committee was loose wording in the Bill about grants, advances and loans from the Treasury to PADA and, perhaps, its successor body, and the lack of provision for a commercial rate of interest or terms for repayment. We firmly believe that a clear line must be drawn between the set-up costs envisaged not in this Bill but in its predecessor, the Pensions Act 2007. If I remember rightly, that Act provided for an initial &#163;21 million for PADA to set itself up and get organised.

 I am grateful to my hon. Friend, and I am delighted to see that she is present today following her sterling service in Committee. The short answer to her question is that I do not know. I hope that the Minister does, however, and that he will share that with the House. Once Report and Third Reading are out of the way, I hope to organise a meeting&#151;which has been envisaged for some time&#151;with Mr. Jones and his chairman, Paul Myners, and perhaps we can get to the bottom of some of this. However, if costs are running at such a level, it can mean only two things. The first of them is that the overall projected costs will be much higher than forecast. It also suggests&#151;unless the consultants are, heaven forfend, not earning their keep&#151;that there are practical problems to do with the time scale for delivery of personal accounts by 2012 about which we are currently ignorant, and I do not think we should remain so for much longer.</p>

No one can underestimate the complexity of the introduction of personal accounts. Even the largest occupational pension scheme is unlikely to have more than 10,000 members. However, we are talking about a scheme that could have up to 5 million members and, as the Minister said, that could include the local hairdresser and their staff as well as large companies, so this is a mammoth undertaking. The Government have committed themselves to a commencement date in 2012.

It is worrying if costs have rocketed to such an extent at this early stage, so I hope that the Minister will assure us that there will be regular reporting back, as envisaged under amendment No. 9, and that any escalation of costs will be properly reported. I do not underestimate the complexity of the task, but I am concerned that Reuters is reporting such an escalation of costs when we have not even finished considering the Bill.</p>

If the long-term objective is for the scheme to be self-funding, money will have to be borrowed in the initial stages and then recouped as the fund grows. If that is not done, the people who are contributing at the beginning when the scheme is set up will pay a much higher proportion in respect of what they are putting into the pot than those who are involved later on, which is why it is inflexible to set an upper limit. That might well be a long-term objective, but it will not be achievable to start with. Restricting the ability to borrow money&#151;albeit that it will be expected to be paid back&#151;is not a sensible option.</p>

 I agree. It is important that the Minister answers the point about cost overrun and addresses how it will be met. My point was made in response to the totality of the amendments and the fact that the Bill allows grants or loans to be made&#151;or at least provides for some flexibility within the consultation that is taking place. Rather than Parliament imposing a structure on the industry, which is far more expert on such issues than we are, it is important that the industry is allowed to suggest the most cost-effective approach.

 I was about to come to the distinction between grants and loans. There is only one area in which a grant may be appropriate. We had some discussion in Committee about the provision of information and advice, but such advice would be generic, not specific to particular saving. There is an argument for saying that the Government should encourage the provision of generic information and advice, and it might be appropriate for a grant to be made to set that up. It would not be set up to compete with existing provision, nor would it provide information that would allow someone to make a choice between an existing private scheme and personal accounts.</p>

It would be ludicrous to stand here and say that there are not uncertainties, risks or events around the corner that might change how we see things. We must not lose sight of the fact that it is not just Tim Jones, the Pensions Regulator and the Government who need to deliver to make some of the reforms a success. For instance, the date for Royal Assent for the Bill is, to use a Donald Rumsfeldism, an example of a &#147;known unknown&#148;. We do not know when the Bill might be delivered. We have made good time in scrutinising it in Committee, but I cannot be sure, even with the best will of the House, of the exact date of Royal Assent. That means that I cannot be sure of the exact date that PADA will get the legal authority that it needs to begin to implement the personal accounts scheme. I anticipate that that will not have much impact on the delivery of the IT or the systems supporting the personal accounts scheme, but we will need to understand the impact on a range of supporting activity, including when we can deliver the information needed by employers and pension schemes so that they have time to prepare.</p>

The pension accounts scheme will be unlike any other scheme in that it will be the largest occupational scheme in the UK, with 4 million to 7 million active members, and it will interact with nearly 1 million employers. It will be specifically targeted at a part of the market that, by and large, existing providers find uneconomic to serve. No other scheme has restrictions like a contributions cap, and it will be required to admit anyone eligible to join, irrespective of whether the revenue that they might bring in will cover the cost of their account. So although some of the infrastructure needed will already exist in the market, some of it will need to be developed.</p>

There will always be issues that we must examine, not least when the Bill finally becomes law, and all of them will have to be factored into the management of any project date.

 If the hon.

That is when the Personal Accounts Board&#151;the trustee corporation, in effect&#151;will take over and start to deliver a pension scheme. The aim of PADA is to create the mechanism that will deliver the scheme. The Personal Accounts Board, which will control the trustee corporation, will then provide a personal accounts pension scheme.

 There will be an overlap. There will not be a sudden cut-off of PADA and then creation of the Personal Accounts Board. There will be a period when the board runs alongside PADA in a shadow process. When PADA goes live&#151;when it starts taking in money and building up a pension scheme&#151;that is when we will know that the handover has in effect taken place. PADA may have to continue to exist for a short period thereafter before being wound up, so that we can ensure that the processes are properly carried out; there may be some advice given to it, and there may be services that it is providing. However, it is envisaged that PADA will start to wind up around 2012. I do not have an end date for it, but it will not go on long after that. It will then hand over completely to the Personal Accounts Board and the trustee corporation, which will run the pension scheme.</p>

The unique nature of personal accounts will present a challenge in developing a funding strategy. Before any decisions can be taken, the authority must first complete the design of the scheme and commercial negotiations with private contractors. It cannot do this until after Royal Assent. The measures in the Bill provide it with a degree of flexibility in developing funding options.

<p><a name="stpa_o118"><a name="80422-0007.htm_para11"><a name="08042267000030">However, we have been absolutely clear that any funding strategy must meet a core set of aims.

We want to ensure that the scheme is commercially viable, consistent with European law and not unfairly advantaged.</p>

As I have explained and for the reasons that I have given, the authority is not yet in a position to provide all the detailed answers. Our intention is that the costs of setting up and operating the scheme would ultimately be recouped from revenues from membership charges. However, during the period of set-up and in the early years of operation, membership charges will not cover all costs. The Bill therefore contains provisions to allow the authority and trustee corporation to bridge the gap through borrowing, and for the Secretary of State to provide financial assistance through grants, loans, guarantees or indemnities. This does not mean that any of these specific provisions will be used, but it does mean that the authority&#146;s ability to maximise value in its commercial negotiations will be strengthened.</p>

However, that would be prevented by amendment No. 15, which is why I cannot accept it. New clause 5 and amendments Nos. 11 and 28 would require any loans from the Government to the authority or the trustee corporation to be made on a commercial basis. If there is any funding from the public sector, it is intended that that would not provide an unfair advantage and would comply fully with European state aid rules. This is a guiding principle of the funding strategy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o122"><a name="80422-0007.htm_para15"><a name="08042267000034">Amendment No. 16 appears to be designed to ensure that the independence of the trustee corporation&#151;the Personal Accounts Board&#151;is not compromised by the requirement to gain the Secretary of State&#146;s consent for any borrowing or investment.

However, as a non-departmental public body, the trustee corporation&#146;s financial arrangements would be taken into account in the Department&#146;s budget. It is therefore right that this should be subject to scrutiny by the Secretary of State to ensure that the wider interests of the taxpayer are taken into account.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o123"><a name="80422-0007.htm_para16"><a name="08042267000035">The hon. Member for Rochdale had a brief exchange with me on the subject of grants. There are some areas of the authority&#146;s work that he is right to say envisage giving advice to Government and others, and providing services which, because of the sheer scale of the undertaking, would be unlike those that other commercial bodies have to operate. Grants from Government to the trustee corporation may be necessary in the future&#151;for example, if the Government asked the trustee corporation to provide advice or information to help them and Parliament to assess the success of our overall public policy ambitions. As this would not directly benefit scheme members, it would be unfair to expect them to meet the cost. I therefore cannot accept amendments Nos. 27, 10 or 12.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o124"><a name="80422-0007.htm_para17"><a name="08042267000036">At this point I would like to reassure Members that the costs that the regulator incurs in establishing the compliance regime will be borne by the Government. That will be done through existing powers, achieving the same aim as new clause 3. I have made it clear that low charges will be at the heart of the personal accounts scheme. However, difficult trade-offs will need to be made between the initial level and structure of charges and how quickly the scheme becomes self-financing. That is one of the issues that PADA is exploring in its public consultation on the best charging structure for the personal accounts scheme.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o125"><a name="80422-0007.htm_para18"><a name="08042267000037">New clause 4 and amendments Nos. 13 and 14 demonstrate why we should wait for PADA&#146;s advice before taking decisions in this area. New Clause 4 and amendment No. 14 would require the scheme to repay the costs of establishing the personal accounts scheme within five years. That would be likely to lead to unreasonably high charges for the first cohort of members, impacting adversely on their savings and potentially leading to high levels of opt-out at the time when we most need to establish the confidence of savers. I am not saying that it is a wrecking amendment, but it is not far off it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o126"><a name="80422-0007.htm_para19"><a name="08042267000038">Amendment No. 13 would initially cap charges at an annual management charge of 0.3 per cent. It therefore pre-empts PADA&#146;s charges consultation and risks inappropriately extending the time that it will take for the scheme to become self-financing. I am not prepared to pre-empt decisions on the funding strategy in this way and therefore cannot accept the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o127"><a name="80422-0007.htm_para20"><a name="08042267000039">Finally, the hon. Member for Rochdale asked for various reports. Amendment No. 9 would require the authority to report on the financial management of the scheme within 12 months of Royal Assent. The financial position of PADA and the corporate trustee as non-departmental public bodies will be reported to Parliament on an annual basis. Further, as a trust-based pension scheme, the trustee corporation will be required to provide annual statements to its members. I see no reason to add to those reporting requirements, which would involve additional bureaucracy.</p>

I have always said that we envisage that the scheme will start to deliver in 2012, but this is a big project and I cannot guarantee that it will happen. There are tight time scales, and some of the things are not in the control of either the Government or PADA, so we must be realistic.</p>

They have given us their proposals to deliver in the broad terms of the Government&#146;s policy on 2012, which is what I want to allow them to do. I have acknowledged that they may have to take all sorts of issues into account, if certain matters do not work out precisely as envisaged in the plans, which is always the case with a project on this scale.</p>

 I am not minded to press the new clause to a vote, but that does not mean to say that I am wholly satisfied by what the Minister has said. In an attempt to be reassuring, he kept telling the House that the introduction of personal accounts is not going to be a big bang. I am delighted to hear that, but as has been said, we do not want a terminal 5 moment, either. Terminal 5 was a massive project of its sort, and it was not a big bang&#151;it was phased in, but phase 1 turned into an unmitigated disaster.</p>

Is the report in such a condition that it can be placed in the Library or made available in what lawyers call a &#147;redacted version&#148;, so that we can at least see the highlights? The issue is not as simple as whether we will get from now to 2012 in one piece, as it were. Presumably, there is a series of triggers, or things that have to happen by a certain date between now and then, hence the charts to which the Minister referred. Once those deadlines start not to be met, the whole thing begins to slide off schedule. That is the key, and without wishing today to detain the House for any great time on the issue, I should say that that is the sort of thing that we will look for.</p>

Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Jim Cousins) reminded us that the measures are part of the Turner package. According to Turner, they were to have been delivered two years earlier, in 2010. We have had this debate on other parts of the Turner package, such as on decoupling, and I hope that we shall come to the issue of restoring the earnings link, which is another key part of the package. Such things, including increasing the state pension age, all go together and we let the timings of the essential ingredients of the Turner package start to drift apart at our peril.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o135"><a name="80422-0008.htm_para7"><a name="08042267000048">I was surprised that the Minister put a lot of emphasis on Royal Assent. Technically, of course, lots of things can happen only when the Bill gets Royal Assent. I do not want to be churlish, but the Bill has been a long time out of Committee and only now are we having Report stage and Third Reading; moving a bit faster was in the Government&#146;s gift. However, leaving that aside, I should say that the Minister talked about contracts of substantial value being put out for tender. I accept that. However, unless he is making out that the Reuters report is a complete fabrication, it should be clear that lots of people&#151;allegedly 100 consultants&#151;are already working night and day to do something. They are not waiting for Royal Assent, and nor will their bills. What are they doing in the absence of Royal Assent, and how much is it costing? One or two distinguished members of the Select Committee on Work and Pensions are here; it is not for me to say, but perhaps the Committee thinks it is important to look into the potential costs overrun and how the project is being managed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o136"><a name="80422-0008.htm_para8"><a name="08042267000049">That brings me to the Donald Rumsfeld&#151;the &#147;known unknowns&#148;&#151;point. We do not expect Mr. Jones, and certainly not the Minister, to walk on water. We expect Mr. Jones and his team to deal with the known unknowns, and I presume that the things that he knows are outside his control are clearly flagged up in the report. Even on the Conservative Benches, we do not expect him to be aware of the unknown unknowns, about which the Minister was also concerned. No one expects the Minister to guarantee absolutely April 2012 as the start date&#151;all sorts of things could have happened by then, not least to the economy as a whole.</p>

However, it is clear that costs are being incurred, Royal Assent or no Royal Assent, and we need a clearer notion of what rate and level they have already reached.</p>

 On the face of it, new clause 2 looks fairly straightforward and inoffensive. It merely says that the Secretary of State should publish projections of the numbers of people likely to be subject to means-tested benefits, including housing benefit, which is particularly important, and to be in so-called at-risk groups following the introduction of personal accounts. It touches on one of the big concerns about personal accounts; the other one is often referred to as levelling down. Those are the two big question marks hanging over the system. To be blunt, in the past we have made it clear as an Opposition that if we cannot square the circle on means-testing, that could affect the likely success of the whole system. There was a time when that was not the consensus view, but I am delighted that it now seems to be so. This has to be addressed, not necessarily during the Bill&#146;s passage through this House, but through a process that has already started, which I very much welcome. That is what new clause 2 does. The Liberals&#146; amendment No. 38&#151;I am sure that they will speak about it themselves&#151;would require an annual report on the impact of means-testing.</p>

In this country, rightly or wrongly&#151;that is not the purpose of this debate&#151;we have gone down a path whereby means-testing has grown very fast. Nearly half of pensioners retiring now do so subject to means-tested benefits. People might well be auto-enrolled who will not be receiving specific advice, because the nature of the Turner settlement means that they will receive so-called generic advice. They might be specifically advised not to auto-enrol into personal accounts, and may save a not insignificant pensions pot as a result, but then end up no better off&#151;or even worse off.</p>

It is pretty clear that just about everyone who could be considered a serious stakeholder in the process now agrees with that proposition.

Friend has put on record the fact that our party was the first to talk about the issue, and it is good that there is now more widespread agreement that it needs to be considered. It is also worth putting on the record the fact that we already receive representations from constituents with personal pensions, who were therefore probably higher up the income chain in their working lives to be able to save for them, who feel extremely aggrieved that, say, their neighbour or someone else they know is accessing benefits from which they are excluded because of that income. Now that we are going further down the chain of income, that problem will become much more acute and affect people with much more modest savings, incomes and pensions. We do not want to undermine the idea that everyone should save for a pension by arousing widespread resentment, so I welcome the greater interest that the Government are showing in the matter.</p>

 I am grateful to my hon. Friend, who makes a fair point. Almost by definition, the 6 million, 7 million, 8 million, 9 million, 10 million or however many people who, it is hoped, will be attracted into personal accounts will be those who are currently outside existing pension provision. Many may simply be seen as unattractive propositions by the pensions industry and will be in a marginal situation as to whether the scheme will be good or bad for them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o151"><a name="80422-0008.htm_para23"><a name="08042267000075">My hon. Friend&#146;s key point, to which I was coming, was about confidence. At one time, the argument was advanced that there would not be a problem until 2020 or even later, when it would become apparent to people, after they had saved for some years under personal accounts following the assumed start date of 2012, that they were not receiving the returns that they had been led to expect. It has been clear to our party, and it is now clear to everyone, that in the run-up to 2012, and not later, journalists and others, whether we like it or not, will be writing a story to the effect that some people in similar situations will be benefiting and others will not be. If, as journalists say, that story has legs, it could cause untold damage to confidence in the system, not least as a tool for the unscrupulous employer who wants to persuade people not to auto-enrol in the first place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o152"><a name="80422-0008.htm_para24"><a name="08042267000076">Now is a good moment to pay full tribute to the Pensions Policy Institute, which has done so much work on that and the other big issue, the so-called levelling down, to which we shall come. The PPI set the foundations of the work that will now be carried forward by identifying the at-risk groups of people&#151;whether low, medium or high risk&#151;under the proposals. The PPI came up with the expression &#147;the funnel of doubt&#148; to refer to the likely level of means-testing even after the reforms.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o153"><a name="80422-0008.htm_para25"><a name="08042267000077">There is no doubt at all that the level of means-testing will fall somewhat when the reforms are introduced. However, there is still a difference between the Government and the PPI and other experts on what that level will be. As John Hills and others have picked up, it is particularly difficult for people at the beginning of a career or a lifetime of work to predict where they will end up, with respect to a broken work record, marital break-up or whatever else. It is important that we should consider carefully the likely effects of the interaction between means-tested benefits and personal accounts.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o154"><a name="80422-0008.htm_para26"><a name="08042267000078">No matter how much work has been done by outside bodies, particularly the PPI, all are now at the point at which they can make progress only by having access to the sort of model that the Department for Work and Pensions uses&#151;the Pensim2 model, as it is called. I am particularly pleased that, as a separate and parallel process to the passage of the legislation, we are now all engaged in an attempt to establish the size of the problem, within certain parameters, and to run a slide rule over the suggested solutions. The Minister has been extremely helpful in allowing people access to Pensim2, and in putting together a series of meetings, seminars and all those wonderful things that come to us who are involved in the pensions world. The initial phase has involved ensuring that we are all signed up to the basic assumptions that go into any proposition that is run through the model.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o155"><a name="80422-0008.htm_para27"><a name="08042267000079">There has already been one big step forward, for which I claim no credit whatever because it was nothing to do with me. There was a problem, as despite its no doubt excellent other characteristics, the Pensim2 model did not take any account of housing benefit. I am told that that is no longer the case, and that it does now incorporate housing benefit. Why does that matter? It matters enormously because one of the major factors in the at-risk groups identified by the PPI is the question whether people rent their home in retirement. That makes a massive difference to many of those people.</p>

Assumptions are made about take-up rates, the likely success of personal accounts and the whole question of behavioural reactions to the new policy. This is not an easy task, and we have always said that we did not necessarily expect it to be resolved within the lifetime of this legislation. We did expect, however, that the process should start off in a serious fashion, and in a way that we could sign up to during the passage of the Bill. So far, so good. There is clearly a lot of work still to be done, however, and we might not agree on all the parameters and the options and how they should be looked at.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o157"><a name="80422-0009.htm_para1"><a name="08042267000081">I hope that the Minister will say a few words on this issue in a moment, but I think that I am right in saying that the ultimate aim is to produce a document&#151;perhaps a report that will be available to all and sundry&#151;at the end of the process, possibly in the autumn, which will try to nail some of the uncertainties that are in the system at the moment. Perhaps it will admit defeat on the known unknowns, to go back to Rumsfeld, but it should at least set out some of the options more clearly and possibly eliminate some of them, if that will be helpful. This will not be a problem for this Government, but it will be one for future Governments of whatever political colour, and it is important that we tackle it now.</p>

 I am not trying to tempt the hon. Gentleman on to some rather difficult rocks here, but is it not possible that, unless we get this right, many people will seek to take a double advantage of the new system by using the trivial commutation rules? That could well involve the people who have very small pension pots because they have very small incomes, and a lot of unscrupulous people could target those people precisely to get them trivially to commute their small pension pots. We need to be clear about this point if we are to achieve integrity in the new system.</p>

 That is an important issue that we need to guard against. Furthermore, it is clear from the work carried out by the PPI that there is a whole tranche of people&#151;we do not know how many there are&#151;who would be better off taking a lump sum and spending it as quickly as possible. That rather goes against the public policy aim that we all hold, which is that people should save for their retirement and have that money available for when they retire. The hon. Gentleman makes an important point, but that is just one of many issues that we need to grapple with.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o158"><a name="80422-0009.htm_para2"><a name="08042267000084">I said earlier that there was now a kind of reverse consensus on this issue. It is a big issue that needs to be addressed and we have all joined up in addressing it. I was therefore just a trifle taken aback the other day when I saw the reported remarks of the new chairman of the Personal Accounts Delivery Authority, Paul Myners. In a speech to the National Association of Pension Funds conference in Edinburgh, he was reported to have compared this situation to the introduction of mandatory seat belts in cars. He is reported to have said:</p>
<a name="80422-0009.htm_brev0"><a name="08042267000117"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;There are a small number of people whose injuries are increased and even some people have died because they were wearing seatbelts&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o159"><a name="80422-0009.htm_para3"><a name="08042267000085">He went on to make the point that that did not outweigh the point of having compulsory seatbelts. I think that we can all agree with that in the context of seatbelts. I took the trouble of finding out how many people are injured each year because of wearing seatbelts as opposed to not wearing them. According to the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents, about 1,100 people a year are injured in some way because they are wearing seatbelts rather than the opposite, but compared with the number of people with driving licences, that is a tiny proportion. I am a bit worried about whether anyone making the kind of assumption that Mr. Myners appears to be making would realise that such a tiny proportion was involved.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o160"><a name="80422-0009.htm_para4"><a name="08042267000086">The real issue here is that nobody knows. The numbers in the at-risk groups could be hundreds of thousands or millions. I suspect&#151;this is my own hunch&#151;that the figure is in the high hundreds of thousands, but we simply do not know, and we will not know until the modelling has been properly done. We are all working to that end. This is not a problem that can be dealt with head on by saying, &#147;Well, just because there is going to be some rough justice for some people, it does not mean to say that it is not a good idea.&#148; Yes, the prize is that, hopefully, millions will be drawn into saving for their retirement, admittedly by the use of inertia in most cases, when they are not doing so now. That has to be a major prize, but it cannot be achieved at the price of large numbers of people, often on very low incomes, being worse off or no better off.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o161"><a name="80422-0009.htm_para5"><a name="08042267000087">That is why the issue is important and why I greatly welcome the Government&#146;s change of heart, if I may put it that way. I am looking forward to our playing our full part in the process. It does matter, not just to the credibility of and confidence in the new system of personal accounts, but to all these people, however many there are, who are involved.</p>

 I agree with what my hon. Friend is saying. Presumably, in looking at the flowcharts and projections for the numbers of people who will be affected by the means test, researchers will also have to make assumptions about the minimum income guarantee. In the past, that has also been an issue for means-tested benefits, as it poses the question of the reliability of the Government&#146;s promises that the minimum income guarantee will continue to rise in line with earnings&#151;until time ends or whenever it might be. I presume that that will make a big impact on the projections for how many people will fall foul of the means test.</p>

 My hon. Friend is absolutely right. For the time being at least, the Government are committed to increasing pension credit in line with earnings, but a whole series of assumptions will, of course, have to be made and spelled out in the making when the calculations are done. One has to make assumptions some way out into the future about a range of things&#151;not least the level of means-tested benefits available under successive Governments of the same or different political colours. That is an important issue, but dealing with it is a bit like trying to put up a tent in a high wind: unless we nail down one corner, we will not make a lot of progress, so a shared set of assumptions will have to be agreed so we can move forward. There will still be the known unknowns, but that is the way it is always going to be.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o162"><a name="80422-0009.htm_para6"><a name="08042267000090">To make one final point, on the basis of all the research done so far, I am utterly convinced that the starting point has to be the at-risk groups identified and then refined by the PPI, and then identification, within parameters, of the numbers of people likely to fall into each of those categories, why they are likely to do so and what can be done to help them. Failing all that, we will have to see what can be done within the system of generic advice to ensure that people opt out if it is in their best interests to do so. There are some massive questions here, which makes this one of the two biggest single issues underlying this entire legislation. We are certainly keen to play our part in finding a solution if there is one.</p>

 I agree with the hon. Member for Eastbourne (Mr. Waterson) that means-testing is a vital issue. We need some clear answers on it before the legislation becomes operational in 2012. I need not remind the Government of the mess that they have got themselves into with the abolition of the 10p income tax rate to illustrate what happens when Governments fiddle with benefits and charges. When that cut was announced last year, we were not told that 5.2 million people would end up worse off. That is not the figure that we were given. I doubt that members of the Government would have supported the then Chancellor, now the Prime Minister, as readily had they known how many people would be affected.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o163"><a name="80422-0009.htm_para7"><a name="08042267000092">As for the 5 million to 7 million people who may save for their pensions with personal accounts, it is vital for us to understand the impact of their benefits on their pensions. It would clearly be wrong for us to encourage people to enter into a scheme enabling them to save money and make contributions if, on retirement, they would find that the Government had given with one hand and taken away with the other. That often happens as a result of the current benefit trap, and it is a powerful disincentive for many people to go back to work. That is not the purpose of the Bill; it is intended to encourage more people to save and become prosperous in retirement. Cutting their benefits will defeat the object. I presume the Government can assure us that the Bill is intended not to save money for the Exchequer in terms of the benefits paid out, but to ensure that pensioners are better off.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o164"><a name="80422-0009.htm_para8"><a name="08042267000093">I agree with the hon. Member for Eastbourne that we owe a great debt to the Pensions Policy Institute for its estimates in this vital area. The number of eligible pensioners who are means-tested to establish their entitlement has risen dramatically under the present Government, from 37 per cent. back in 1997 to around 57 per cent. today. We know what the effects of the means-testing system have been. Although the Government laud the benefits of pension credit, we know that a large number of pensioners&#151;some 1.5 million&#151;are not claiming it. We also know that council tax bills have already risen by 87 per cent. under the present Government.</p>

 I am giving a broad figure. At the same time, only 53 per cent. of pensioners who are eligible for council tax benefit claim it. If pensioners who have saved find that as a result of their saving, the benefits to which they are entitled are dramatically reduced, incentives to save will be eroded and the Bill&#146;s objective will be destroyed.</p>

Single people are likely to be worse off because they generally do not save as much for their retirement, and they may well rent their properties. There are medium-risk groups, such as those in their 40s and 50s who are not currently saving for their retirement. They could well lose out, although that will depend on what happens when they retire.

I admit that it will be impossible to tell someone in their 20s or 30s, &#147;By the time you get to retirement, it won&#146;t be worth you saving,&#148; but we need to be able to advise people in the medium and high-risk groups at the beginning that they ought to opt out. If we cannot do that, we will be misleading people. I do not agree with the hon. Member for Eastbourne, who said, &#147;It&#146;s a seat belt, and some people have got to be worse off.&#148; We must give two pieces of advice. We must make amendments to the benefit system to ensure that people are not disadvantaged&#151;and we must be clear in our analysis of what changes need to be made to deliver that&#151;or we need to advise people that they had better not save through a personal pension scheme, because they would be worse off.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman&#146;s comments highlight a crucial point about all future pensions. It is to do with confidence. The people in the schemes, many of whom will be at the lower end of the income bracket, must have the confidence to look forward. This is a Government-sponsored scheme, and if they do not get this advice we may well find 20 years from now that the ombudsman is looking at Government advice yet again; we have already had the debacle with the occupational pension schemes. It is crucial that people have the information, in order for them to build confidence so that they are willing to invest in their pensions.</p>

When we address some later clauses and look at the earnings link, it will become clear that in terms of pensions this country is the poor relation in Europe. We are almost celebrating 100 years of the pension, but we are not delivering what our forefathers originally intended. So, I hope that the Minister will accept that we all have serious concerns about this issue. It is important that the information is shared and that, over time, we have a strategy that delivers the overall aim of ensuring that all pensioners are better off. It is unacceptable to say that small numbers might not be. Although we cannot legislate for every possibility, we must have the flexibility to be able to guarantee people that saving in this way will benefit them; if that cannot be delivered, we should not be encouraging them to save.</p>

It is true that we are dealing with a group of people who will not be able to afford to take independent advice, and thus will be reliant on generic advice. Generic advice will not be good enough to overcome the problem that we will encounter if nothing is done. We can all remember the mis-selling scandals of the past, and I fear that we might be sowing the seeds of mis-selling today, unless something certain is put into the Bill to deal with the problem.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o170"><a name="80422-0009.htm_para14"><a name="08042267000104">The other alternative, if we do nothing, is that very large numbers of people will be advised in the media and elsewhere to opt out. That would defeat the whole object of the Bill; we want people to save for their retirement and to have better financial security. If they are being advised in their newspapers that they would be mad not to opt out, who would blame them for deciding to opt out? The hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Jim Cousins), who is well versed in these matters, made it clear that even those who stay in the scheme may opt for trivial commutation, which would be almost equally bad as opting out in many cases. It is incumbent on us now to put into the Bill something that will deal with the problem.</p>

We can play around with all sorts of formulae, but some element of disregard is the only true way to encourage people to save in that way. Only if they know that they will inevitably be better off staying in the scheme rather than opting out, and if that is reinforced by the newspapers they read and by television and radio programmes, will they not opt out. We can argue about how the disregard should operate&#151;whether it is an absolute disregard, whether it is a mechanism,  <br>

 I promise not to delay the House for too long. I support new clause 2. I was fascinated to hear the common-sense approach that, yet again, the Minister took to the issue. The nature of means-testing means that we are dealing with the most vulnerable people in our society: those whom the state feels are below the threshold that we would all like people to be at, without needing a means-tested benefit. As a result, such people are the most ill-informed and cannot purchase the information that Members of this House and other members of the public could; such people will not receive independent financial advice.</p>

If the tabloid press start saying that opting out is probably people&#146;s best option because it will be safer, and that people should not worry because they can always fall back on means-tested benefits because they might not be better off, that would make this part of the Bill, at least, fall apart. The Minister would probably agree about that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o173"><a name="80422-0009.htm_para17"><a name="08042267000108">It is therefore imperative to put as much basic information as possible into the public domain as early as possible, to enable people to make a conscious decision to stay in the scheme, because there could be an exodus. I remember that back in the 1980s, it was &#147;opt in, opt out&#148;; lots of different schemes were in operation and things were very complicated. Financial representatives phoned people up to say, &#147;I think you should opt out of SERPS,&#148; or, &#147;You should opt in to SERPS.&#148; We made decisions about that specific matter, many of them wrong. I made wrong decisions, but I was persuaded to do so by a financial representative.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o174"><a name="80422-0009.htm_para18"><a name="08042267000109">What worries me enormously is that because we are dealing with the most vulnerable people, who we are trying to get off benefits and into a pension scheme that prevents them from needing means-tested benefits as they reach their more mature years, all the hard work, everything that has been going on with all the different consortiums and all the consensus that has been built up could fall apart so easily, and even more people might end up on means-tested benefits. None of us would look forward to that situation.</p>

It is clear that we all have constituents who are on pension credit, yet they have a second pension. How we are able to predict which people are likely to end up in that position, whether we are able to do so and what advice such people should be given if the circumstances that they will find themselves in are not always predictable are complex matters. Personal accounts will not create such a new circumstance that we are not already, in a sense, facing it. A large number of people are automatically enrolled into a pension scheme. Tesco has its own automatic enrolment scheme&#151;I understand it to be a reasonably good defined-benefit scheme&#151;and it is therefore allowing people to build up pension pots. There is no guarantee that those people will be able to have an uninterrupted career at Tesco and that they will never fall on pension credit.</p>

 I certainly agree with the hon. Gentleman about restoring the earnings link in due course, and I will come to that in a moment.

 The point that I was trying to make earlier is that we must give our best shot at predicting what will be in the pot in the years ahead. That is obviously very difficult, but if I went to a private insurance company and said that I wished to invest &#163;30,000 in a scheme, the actuaries would make some sort of prediction about the outcome, and the state pension would be included in that. It is therefore incumbent on the Government to give their best shot at prediction. I accept that it will be difficult. We cannot predict the future, but it has always been the job of actuaries to try to predict the size of the pot. That is why it is important not to guarantee more&#151;it would skew the whole market if people were guaranteed a greater amount than they would get from a separate pension scheme&#151;but to provide a knowledge base and give people some idea of how much they will get. People must have that information.</p>

 My hon. and learned Friend mentioned providing an unfair advantage, but it is an important principle that people&#146;s savings should not undermine their ability to collect state benefits. As he says, that point will be discussed when we come to the issue of the earnings link, but it is an important principle in reducing means testing. He mentions taxpayers&#146; money, but the people who take up the scheme to save for their pension will be low paid. They are taxpayers too, and the fairness agenda means that we must also be fair to those on low incomes who are putting small amounts of money&#151;whatever they can afford&#151;into such schemes. We must ensure that they do not miss out on state benefits later.</p>

 My hon. Friend is right, especially about trying to ensure that we have a state system that provides a proper basis for people. One of the key aspects is the restoration of the link. One argument for restoration arises from this very debate. If we did not restore the link, we would end up with some 60 per cent. of pensioners on pension credit, and we do not want that to happen. We can reduce the numbers on pension credit by about half if we restore the link and provide opportunities for private savings so that people can build up a pension pot that will increase the amount that they would get just by relying on pension credit. The reforms in the state sector are part of the process, and the private sector changes will also help to ensure that pensioners get a better deal&#151;and get more money in the end.</p>

 I accept that the scheme cannot compete unfairly with providers in the private sector or companies&#146; schemes, but we are talking about persuading some of the poorest people in society to save. Even though they may be saving small amounts, they will be giving up a large&#151;to them&#151;proportion of what they are earning. We are also talking about people who are unlikely to be especially attractive to the commercial sector, because the costs of their business would outweigh the benefits&#151;we know already that the commercial sector turns down small amounts&#151;so we are talking about a special group.

 I hear what the hon. Gentleman says. The issues of savings incentives, disregards and trivial commutation can all be considered. We discussed some of them in Committee, and the Government have decided to set up a Government-led work programme to consider the whole issue, evaluate the evidence and consider the interaction between pension savings and income-related benefits in a reformed system. The programme will examine the incentive effects, the balance that we need to strike between alleviating poverty and incentivising savings, and the cost constraints that we face. It is important that people accept the responsibility to provide for themselves and also that the pension credit safety net is there if needed.</p>

That would deny many individuals the real benefits of starting to save early. The reforms represent the last piece of our pensions puzzle and it would be folly to delay introduction on that basis.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o180"><a name="80422-0010.htm_para2"><a name="08042278000017">The effect of amendment No. 38 would be to require the annual publication of our projections of the impact of means-testing for members of the personal account scheme and those whose pension savings might be subject to marginal deduction rates of 40 per cent. or higher. We have already published our projections of entitlement to pension credit until 2050, and are currently finalising a fact sheet of projections of entitlement to all income-related benefits for the pensioner population.

every job holder. That is because the decision to remain enrolled will be straightforward for most people. The employer contribution means that most people will benefit and enjoy a more prosperous retirement. Good information is important and the DWP and other organisations, such as Citizens Advice, the Pensions Advisory Service and the Financial Services Authority, already provide some elements of advice.</p>

As Members will be aware, there is at present no legal requirement for individuals to receive any one-to-one advice before they are automatically enrolled on an occupation pension scheme. Giving people a new legal entitlement to one-to-one advice could give them a misleading impression that automatic enrolment is either a risky and complex process for which they must have that advice, or could lead to their making erroneous decisions. We therefore take the view that the best approach is to ensure that people know the basic information about automatic enrolment and what it means for them.</p>

I do not want to create a system whereby we have to load on a lot of advice for personal accounts in particular, because the cost will end up being paid by people who are enrolled into personal accounts.

 I thank the Minister, and I apologise for chuntering at him. The reason why I was muttering was that Otto Thoresen has said that his report does not cover the kind of generic advice on personal accounts that the Minister is describing. He came before the all-party Work and Pensions Committee a few weeks ago, and I asked him that question. He said that it does not cover that. The Government might need to re-examine the issue with some care. Ministers have been saying such things for some time. They came to the Select Committee and said, &#147;We will see the results of the Thoresen review, which will tell us how to provide generic financial advice.&#148;</p>

 I hope that the hon. Gentleman will forgive me, but I am not sure that there is a great deal of difference between us. My point was that Thoresen shows in his report that personal accounts do not present entirely new issues. As far as Thoresen is concerned, the need for generic advice in certain circumstances when people are auto-enrolled into pension schemes&#151;that is happening today&#151;is not substantially changed by personal accounts, and so new issues are not brought up. There are issues of scale, but they are not new when it comes to the details of individuals who sign up or do not sign up.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o188"><a name="80422-0010.htm_para10"><a name="08042278000029">I can pray in aid the report in the sense that Thoresen has identified some ways in which money guidance can be piloted and considered, and we are examining those proposals at the moment. That might&#151;I deliberately use the word &#147;might&#148;&#151;provide some element of guidance on personal accounts and a range of other issues such as when individuals, who are often on low incomes, have to enter into substantial financial dealings, including mortgages and a pension scheme.</p>

Thoresen&#146;s references to personal accounts, even though they were brief, did not identify specific points or go into any detail. He basically said that the problems that we will have are much the same as those that we are having on a range of other issues. Providing generic advice is therefore one way to help people to make some of the important decisions that they have to make.</p>

 This is another group of amendments that is rather like one of those cars that can be bought at certain scrap yards that have the front of one car and the back of another. The amendments refer to two distinct issues, so I shall separate them immediately. New clause 6 and all but one of the amendments are concerned with levelling down, which is the other massive issue that lurks throughout the Bill. I shall come separately to amendment No. 29, which is on another matter that was important in Committee: workplace pensions and group personal pensions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o204"><a name="80422-0010.htm_para26"><a name="08042278000049">What do we mean by levelling down? We mean a scenario whereby, with the advent of personal accounts, finance directors advise their board that participation in their own defined-benefit pension scheme could double almost overnight, with the cost implications that that would carry. Companies that had not already closed their existing defined-benefit schemes to new or even existing members, assuming that there were any such companies by that stage, would then take the opportunity to say, &#147;Well, we are closing our scheme now, but there is a perfectly good new scheme called personal accounts, backed by the Government, that we would point you in the direction of.&#148;</p>

There is almost an unwillingness to engage in the issues. At almost every seminar to which I am kindly invited, some academic seems to get up and say that he or she has done a study and come to much the same conclusion&#151;that the vast majority of people in this country do not really engage in the pensions issue. Almost any effort from any quarter to try to improve that situation has to be welcomed. However, when the moment comes, many employees may simply not inquire whether it would be sensible to move from a DB scheme run by their employer, in which the level of employer contribution may be much higher than is envisaged under personal accounts, and what difference it would make to their pension.</p>

different views, including those of the CBI and all sorts of others. However, let us remember that an overall contribution level of 8 per cent. will not deliver a very comfortable retirement. It is a massive step forward for people who have no provision at all at the moment and should have, but there is concern that the mere arrival of personal accounts will have an effect on existing, more generous pension provision.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o207"><a name="80422-0011.htm_para1"><a name="08042278000052">The point of new clause 6 is straightforward: to say that there should be a duty on PADA to minimise the effects of the introduction of personal accounts on existing pension provision. I cannot really see why the Government should not accept a new clause along those lines with alacrity, because it has been pretty clear since the Turner report that we are all on the same wavelength and believe that we should focus on the so-called target group set out by Turner, which is predominantly people who have no existing pension provision. It will be the ultimate tragedy and irony at the same time if, after this process, we end up increasing the number of savers but not the amount of savings, and if all we do is recycle roughly the same amount of savings in the pensions system, or even worse. I shall come to that possible scenario in a moment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o208"><a name="80422-0011.htm_para2"><a name="08042278000053">Our approach in Committee, and to some of these amendments, has been shot through with attempts of all sorts to erect a kind of Berlin wall between personal accounts and existing pension provision, whether by banning transfers in and out or by banning contributions above a certain level. It is still a matter of regret that the figure of &#163;3,600 a year, which is firmly on the record as being the Government&#146;s position on the maximum annual contribution, is not in the Bill, but so be it. We have tried to put it in the Bill and, in true form, have failed dismally at every attempt. In other ways, too, we have tried to ensure that there will be no interference with existing provision by the new personal accounts system.</p>

should not add the new clause to the Bill, but if we do not, will he give the House, the country and, more importantly, future pensioners assurances that there will be protection for those already in a scheme?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o233"><a name="80422-0011.htm_para27"><a name="08042278000082">I am told that I pick on Tesco too often, so I shall refer not to the Tesco pension scheme, which the Minister mentioned, but to another one, on to which people are automatically enrolled; they are on very low earnings, and may be working part-time. One can easily see how that sort of scheme, which has very low premiums going into it, could easily be drawn backwards and be subject to the levelling down to which my hon. Friend the Member for Eastbourne referred, making it simpler for employers to let someone else take the responsibility. That would be disastrous for the Bill, and for the many people whom we are trying to encourage to have faith in pensions. We have to be honest with ourselves; we know from our constituencies that there is not huge faith in pensions. We know all too well how many people who come to our surgeries are concerned about the issue. That is true not just in my constituency, which has been affected by the Dexion situation and occupational pension scheme issues. Pension schemes in general are not the flavour of the month.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o234"><a name="80422-0011.htm_para28"><a name="08042278000083">The purpose of the provisions is to encourage more people to come into the pensions arena and to have confidence in pensions. If we are to do that, we need new clause 6, or something very similar that will allow people to believe that those who are already in low-income and low-premium schemes will be protected. At the same time, the personal accounts scheme that we are talking about should have the benefit of keeping people out of means-tested benefits. I accept that the Minister is in a very difficult position, as he is trying to bring that about with the consensus that he has managed to get. That would all be lost if we ignored the concerns that have been raised. I will not read out the comments of all those who have lobbied us on the issue; some of them have already been read out. There is a genuine argument to be made, and there is genuine concern that it is all too easy to slip backwards, instead of going forwards, which is what we all want to happen as a result of the Bill.</p>

It is worth remembering that, for several years, employer contributions to pension schemes have fallen, not because of the Government&#146;s plans for personal accounts, but because of other external factors, partly economic and partly to do with changes in pensions and tax laws. As a result, occupational schemes are already suffering from a degree of levelling down. It is crucial that we do not accelerate the decline and push contributions even further down to the residual, basic level that will be established by the personal accounts. It is crucial that the issue is not left to chance, and that we do not just trust to hope on that point.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o236"><a name="80422-0011.htm_para30"><a name="08042282000003">Let us imagine the scene in any company&#146;s boardroom when the topic of the establishment of personal accounts arises. Companies with occupational schemes could do one of four things in the face of the personal accounts legislation. They could decide not only to make their existing occupational scheme available to everybody in the firm, as the rules require them to do, but to increase the contributions for each of those people. That would be a marvellous solution; I sincerely doubt that many people will opt to do that, but it is a theoretical possibility.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o237"><a name="80422-0011.htm_para31"><a name="08042282000004">Companies could also opt to keep contributions at the same level, but to broaden coverage to everybody in the firm. That would obviously increase the total cost of the company&#146;s pensions contribution, potentially very substantially. I do not know whether that would count as remaining the same; I suspect that we should count it as levelling up, because it would extend existing high-quality coverage to more people. I suspect that everyone, in all parts of the House, would welcome that outcome hugely.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o238"><a name="80422-0011.htm_para32"><a name="08042282000005">As a third option, a company could decide to maintain its overall pension contribution at current levels, in pound terms, while spreading that benefit among a wider range of people&#151;that is, while extending the scheme to cover everybody in the firm. That would not reduce the total pension contribution made by the company, but it would reduce the amount received by each employee. I do not know whether we are counting that as levelling down. Clearly, on a macro-economic scale, it is not levelling down, but would be maintaining pension contributions at existing levels. I suspect that many of us would not regard that as a bad result; it would extend the coverage of occupational pensions significantly, while keeping them at a high level of quality.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o239"><a name="80422-0011.htm_para33"><a name="08042282000006">The fourth option is the one that we are all worried about: a company may decide not to keep its existing level of contributions constant, but absolutely to reduce its contributions, while extending the coverage of the scheme to all employees. We need to be clear that that is the worst possible scenario. I suggest to the Minister&#151;I shall be interested to hear his views&#151;that any of the other three options would be at least acceptable, if not an outright victory, and would allow us to consider that we had avoided levelling down. I hope that he will oblige us by explaining precisely what he would, and would not, regard as acceptable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o240"><a name="80422-0011.htm_para34"><a name="08042282000007">There is an argument that the design of personal accounts is, in itself, a good weapon against levelling down. Personal accounts are the budget airline solution to pension coverage; the legislation deliberately sets out to create an ultra-simple, ultra-cheap, no-bells-and-whistles, no-frills product that is not terribly flexible&#151;a good, basic, plain vanilla product that will suit a large number of people who are not currently covered. It can be argued that that in itself will distinguish personal accounts from existing occupational schemes, because those occupational schemes tend to be higher-cost, to require higher contributions and to be a great deal more flexible. They also have a fair number of additional features that personal accounts will not have.</p>

Airways 10 years ago, &#147;Don&#146;t worry, your market is safe because there is no competition, and by the way, there is a budget airline that is going to do Paris for &#163;15 and Barcelona for &#163;14&#148;, BA would have laughed at him. What happened, as we know, is that budget airlines have been a huge success and millions of people who were flying with the big airlines and paying a fortune have gone over to those airlines. That is my fear in the pensions context.</p>

 My hon. Friend anticipates the point that I was coming to. There is an argument that because personal accounts are an ultra-cheap, ultra-simple alternative, they will not compete with existing occupational schemes because they are designed in a different way and they do not provide the additional flexibility and levels of outcome that occupational schemes provide. However, that assumption has not, to my knowledge, been tested anywhere. As my hon. Friend points out by using the airline analogy, it is possible that there will be a knock-on effect, as budget airlines had on full service airlines.</p>

If it does not, and we do not have that concrete evidence, trusting to the differences in design will not be enough to ensure that there is no levelling down. We will need more. If that is not new clause 6 and its associated amendments, then what is it? We must have solid guarantees or solid evidence that the differences in design will make a material difference. I hope the Minister will be able to offer us those assurances.</p>

I propose to suggest an amendment in due course, to be tabled in another place, in order to ensure that those who are affected in that way can get some sort of help.

<p><a name="stpa_o242"><a name="80422-0012.htm_para1"><a name="08042282000014">We all want to achieve the aim of getting more people saving, but we need to address the issues arising from the combination of individual inertia and commercial viability, which have resulted in large numbers of moderate to low earners currently not saving enough for their retirement. The Bill provides for the establishment of what has been described as a budget airline type of pension scheme. I am not sure whether I want to follow that analogy too far&#151;<i> [Interruption.]</i> The hon. Member for Hemel Hempstead (Mike Penning) suggests that all the budget airlines have been successful, but Freddie Laker might have disagreed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o243"><a name="80422-0012.htm_para2"><a name="08042282000015">We want to provide a basic scheme that will be of sufficient quality to enable people to save for their future and provide them with a reasonable income. The key problem is what happens in relation to the current better employers&#146; schemes&#151;not all of them are better&#151;where the employer may be making a bigger contribution and may find that with personal accounts, the minimum contribution will cost him less. The employee may even be making a bigger contribution to an existing scheme and may find a smaller contribution to a personal account temporarily advantageous to him and his family.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o244"><a name="80422-0012.htm_para3"><a name="08042282000016">How are we to prevent levelling down? The straight answer is that we cannot prevent it. We can reduce the likelihood that it will happen and take reasonable steps to mitigate the factors that might cause it. We have already discussed one of the ways of doing that: restricting transfers in and out of personal accounts. Someone with a current pension scheme will not be able to transfer in at the start of personal accounts in order to level down. Also, we are not looking to have people transferring out of personal accounts. Preventing people messing about and transferring in and out is a mechanism to reduce the likelihood of levelling down.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o245"><a name="80422-0012.htm_para4"><a name="08042282000017">Also, there is a maximum contribution annually that people can make&#151;&#163;3,600. Many people will want to make a higher contribution, but we have indicated that on 2005 figures that is the level of annual contribution that we want. We have carried out surveys of employers to ask what they are likely to do if they have the option of continuing with their current scheme or moving to personal accounts. Surveys suggest that most employers would stick with what they have. No doubt some employers will see an advantage in levelling down, and I cannot give the guarantee that the hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare (John Penrose) seeks from me, that it will not happen. However, the scheme designs that we have put in place will reduce the likelihood of its happening and hopefully mitigate the possibility of its doing so on a significant scale.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o246"><a name="80422-0012.htm_para5"><a name="08042282000018">The other way in which we have tried to deal with the matter is keeping the scheme simple. The hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare said that it was important to keep these things simple, and I agree entirely. So does Paul Myners, the chairman of the Personal Accounts Delivery Authority. In his evidence to the Committee, he said:</p>

pension scheme. If the scheme on offer is kept simple, and if it will provide some of the bells and whistles with a higher contribution, we envisage that they are likely to stay with it.</p>

We want to ensure that we get considerably more people saving. The aim&#151;we need to look at the ambitious end&#151;is to have up to 9 million more people saving, and up to &#163;10 billion more saved. If, as the hon. Member for Eastbourne (Mr. Waterson) has suggested, more people were saving but no more was being saved, it would not be a successful outcome. We need more to be saved, and we need more people saving. We need outcomes where pensioners are basically better off, which is why we are all involved.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o249"><a name="80422-0012.htm_para8"><a name="08042282000021">The Bill makes it clear that PADA is primarily tasked with setting up the scheme. The principles provide the operational framework within which it will carry out that task, and they are fundamental to how it will design the scheme. The hon. Member for Eastbourne has acknowledged in the drafting of new clause 6 that the authority cannot be tasked with achieving each principle in absolute terms. The principles are there to guide it in setting up the scheme.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o250"><a name="80422-0012.htm_para9"><a name="08042282000022">The combined effect of the principles and the package of proposals elsewhere in the Bill is to focus personal accounts on the target group I mentioned and to provide safeguards in scheme design that will minimise adverse effects on existing good-quality provision. In setting out those principles, we are asking the authority to consider the effect on future members of the personal accounts scheme, the overall additional burdens on employers and the impact on the broader pension industry, including members and prospective members of qualifying pension schemes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o251"><a name="80422-0012.htm_para10"><a name="08042282000023">We must be realistic. Inevitably, there will be competing priorities, and the authority will need to make judgments about the suite of principles that it needs to deal with to provide the best solution in the circumstances, which is why we have used the phrase &#147;have regard to&#148;. For example, the authority will need to evaluate the various options for investment fund choices in the light of members&#146; preferences for fund choices and membership costs. It will need to consider the options carefully, so that the provision of investment choices does not get in the way of our aspirations for a low-cost scheme.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o252"><a name="80422-0012.htm_para11"><a name="08042282000024">Clearly, we cannot predict precisely how individuals, employers and industry will respond to the introduction of those reforms. We are seeking to ensure, in so far as it is possible, that we get the best impact out of personal accounts without experiencing the problem of levelling down. It is an important issue, which is why we have always made it clear that personal accounts are being introduced to complement, rather than replace or undermine, other good-quality pension provision. The Bill will introduce an additional pension product.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o253"><a name="80422-0012.htm_para12"><a name="08042282000025">This is the core of our ambitions, so the principles require the authority to have regard to encouraging and facilitating participation across the qualifying schemes.  <br>

However, other individuals who are not quite in the target market, such as the self-employed, may find in particular circumstances that they want to contribute as both an employer and an employee and build up a pension pot and personal accounts. We are happy for the self-employed to do that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o256"><a name="80422-0012.htm_para15"><a name="08042282000029">There is an issue about people who are not employed. At the moment, they would not be able to use personal accounts. We want to see whether we can get a situation where we can prevent levelling down and make sure that we keep the current provisions for employers, so pension schemes continue. There is an element of employer inertia as well as employee inertia&#151;we expect most people who are in pension schemes to stay in them. Employer inertia means that if an employer has got a pension scheme, we expect them by and large to stick to it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o257"><a name="80422-0012.htm_para16"><a name="08042282000030">On workplace personal pensions, amendment No. 29 relates to the treatment of insurance-based products. I want to make it clear that that is an issue for Ministers and Parliament to decide and does not relate to PADA principles. Workplace pensions are an important and growing part of the pensions market. As the hon. Member for Eastbourne has said, membership of workplace personal pension schemes forms around 47 per cent. of current private sector pension membership, which represents around 3.3 million employees involving a total contribution of around &#163;6.7 billion each year. There are 2.1 million members of workplace pension schemes with an employer contribution of 3 per cent. or more.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o258"><a name="80422-0012.htm_para17"><a name="08042282000031">We are currently in the process of seeking clarification from the European Commission that from 2012 automatic enrolment into workplace personal pensions is compatible with European consumer protection legislation. We continue to support the Pensions Commission&#146;s aim of automatic enrolment across all employers and all workers, and we hope that the work that we are doing with the European Commission will allow us to maintain that position. However, it is difficult to be precise about the timetable for resolving this issue with the European Commission. It is therefore essential that we retain flexibility within the discussions with the Commission. That is why we have a provision in the Bill to enable us to create an exemption, as the hon. Member for Eastbourne has indicated, from the employer duty automatically to enrol employees using workplace personal pension plans. If activated, that exemption would provide employers who meet the prescribed requirements and offer their jobholders membership of a qualifying workplace personal pension with relief from the duty automatically to enrol, provided that they use an enrolment process prescribed in the regulations.</p>

 I am grateful to the Minister for his summing up, particularly his helpful summary of amendment No. 29, which raises some important issues. On levelling down, I am pleased that he has conceded that the aim is to produce not only more savers, but more savings. We must keep our eyes on the ball, because it would be an utter disaster if we were to end up with the same amount of savings or, even worse, with the Pensions Policy Institute scenario in which fewer savings are redistributed around the system.</p>

Technically, that is true, but it is equally true to say that at the moment there is nothing stopping levelling down from happening. The real concern is whether the introduction of personal accounts will encourage levelling down when it is coupled with other issues, such as the pensions regulator&#146;s consultation on longevity assumptions. One of the PPI scenarios is absolutely disastrous: the one that shows personal accounts reducing the pensions savings pot, which would be an appalling result.

 We come to one of those totemic pensions issues. Whatever audience I am speaking to in whatever part of the country, somebody will always raise the issue of the earnings link and its breaking in 1980. I could go into a history lesson about why that happened when it did, and talk about the fact that the earnings link was a relatively new concept that had been around for only a few years before the change. However, doing so would not be particularly profitable. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o266"><a name="80422-0012.htm_para25"><a name="08042286000013">What is important is that there is now a consensus that the earnings link for the state pension should be restored. Indeed, I remind hon. Members that that was in our manifesto at the last election. Now that the Government have joined that consensus, nobody is arguing the opposite&#151;except conceivably, I suppose, the Liberal Democrats, who are still peddling their citizens pension concept. We will no doubt hear more about that in a little while.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o267"><a name="80422-0012.htm_para26"><a name="08042286000014">This debate is particularly timely, given that issues of pensioner poverty are very much at the forefront of the news. There is, of course, the controversy over the 10p rate of income tax and the effect on some 5.3 million people, a significant number of whom are pensioners, particularly women pensioners. There is also a question of whether the official inflation rate is relevant to pensioners. Some experts think that pensioners face a rate of inflation that is more like 9 per cent. because such a large proportion of their income is devoted to utility bills and council tax, which has gone up by 120 per cent. in my constituency in the past 10 years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o268"><a name="80422-0012.htm_para27"><a name="08042286000015">The other day, during Work and Pensions questions, I made the point that a significant and growing number of pensioners are using their winter fuel allowances to pay for soaring council tax bills and basic foodstuffs. I also made the point, although it seemed to annoy the Minister somewhat, that, according to the latest European Union figures, Britain is fourth from bottom of the poverty league in Europe and that only pensioners in Spain, Latvia and Cyprus are more likely to fall into poverty.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o269"><a name="80422-0012.htm_para28"><a name="08042286000016">Given that restoring the earnings link is a matter of consensus, its time has presumably come&#151;the Government should certainly consider it seriously. What is their current position? Their stated position is that they intend to restore the link</p>
<a name="80422-0012.htm_brev3"><a name="08042286000062"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;subject to affordability and the fiscal position&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o270"><a name="80422-0012.htm_para29"><a name="08042286000017">in 2012. At the very latest, the link will be restored</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o271"><a name="80422-0012.htm_para30"><a name="08042286000018">that is, by 2015.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o272"><a name="80422-0012.htm_para31"><a name="08042286000019">It is important that I come back to a point that I made in a different context a little while ago about the Turner package of reforms that has emerged from the Pensions Commission: there is always a danger in decoupling the provisions. It is important to remember that Lord Turner and his colleagues proposed that uprating should begin in 2010.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o273"><a name="80422-0012.htm_para32"><a name="08042286000020">The feeling in the Conservative party&#151;and in others as well, it would appear&#151;is that the time has come for Ministers to make a decision on when the restoration of the link will take place. Will it be in 2012 or 2015? Is the get-out clause of affordability still relevant, and is it likely to become more relevant as the economy moves in a downward direction?</p>

 We are, of course, not committed to restoring it immediately, because we are currently in opposition.

One can see the arguments for that in isolation. However, these matters were not proposed in isolation. They formed a carefully organised package of measures, including restoring the state pension&#146;s link with average earnings.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o275"><a name="80422-0013.htm_para1"><a name="08042286000027">What makes it easier for Ministers is that we have already legislated on the issue. The great thing about this job is that another pensions Bill is always just around the corner. Section 5 of the Pensions Act 2007 sets out the mechanism to restore the link and how that could be calculated. No further legislation is required and no Government time in the House need be allocated. That being the case, why have the Government been so coy about making the announcement? One has to wonder whether they propose to go into the next election campaign without making it. To follow up the point made by the hon. Member for Vauxhall (Kate Hoey), whatever may or may not be in our manifesto, I have a sneaking suspicion that, one way or the other, the issue will be in the Government&#146;s next election manifesto.</p>

There is a general feeling that the issue needs to be tackled, and tackled soon so that people at least know where they stand. The National Pensioners Convention has made the point that, sadly, some 3 million pensioners will have passed away by 2015. Even if the Government are not going to restore the link tomorrow or the day after, giving people the certainty of knowing when they intend to do it would be welcome.</p>

 If one were feeling very cynical, one might think that the link with earnings, as opposed to prices, rather depends for its efficacy in delivery on whether prices are going up faster than earnings or vice versa. Perhaps the Government cannot make up their mind about which will go up faster and are hedging their bets.</p>

<p><a name="st_o216"><a name="08042286000032"><a name="80422-0013.htm_spnew6"><a name="08042286000077"><b>Mr. Waterson:</b>
 As my hon. Friend says, one would have to be cynical to take that view. I could not possibly comment, save to point out the historical fact that one of the myths surrounding the earnings link is that pensioners were worse off for ever after 1980 because their pensions were not going up in line with earnings, whereas there were years when prices were roaring ahead, until we got them under control.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o279"><a name="80422-0013.htm_para5"><a name="08042286000033">If there is a legitimate reason for holding up this announcement, it can be only because of the Government&#146;s worries about the economic and fiscal future over the coming months and years.

If Ministers now feel that it will not be affordable because of other problems in the economy, they should come clean, as well as telling us why they will not make the announcement at this precise moment.</p>

Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Jim Cousins), among others. On reflection, I am more attracted to his new clause than my own. It was my intention, subject to what else might be said in the debate, to withdraw new clause 7, but to seek, if possible, to press new clause 16 to a Division. I will be interested to hear whether the hon. Gentleman is sufficiently reassured by the honeyed words of the Minister not to wish to press new clause 16, but even if he were, perhaps I may say at this stage that I would intend to seek permission to do so myself.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o281"><a name="80422-0013.htm_para7"><a name="08042286000036">That would only be a first stage in restoring the value of the pension to where it should be.

of the pension as a percentage of earnings has declined. In 1950 the pension was worth 18.4 per cent. of average earnings; today it is worth 15.9 per cent. When we look around Europe, as the hon. Member for Eastbourne (Mr. Waterson) said, we see that we are the poor relation. Why should we be compared with the likes of Cyprus and Latvia? We consider ourselves to be the fourth largest economy in the world, yet we are unable to give our pensioners a decent state pension. Our state pension is worth only 45 per cent. of pre-retirement earnings compared with 57 per cent. in Germany, 75 per cent. in Poland and 105 per cent. in the Netherlands.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o282"><a name="80422-0013.htm_para8"><a name="08042286000037">It is high time that the Government restored the link and got the value of the pension back to what it should be. I know that the Minister will reiterate, because we hear it whenever we raise this issue, &#147;Well, there&#146;s pension credit,&#148; but as he knows, 40 per cent. of all eligible pensioners do not claim that. It is also far more expensive to administer. It is much easier to give people what they are entitled to, and have earned, without making them go through what many of them perceive to be a demeaning process of being means-tested to get what they have worked for all their lives.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o283"><a name="80422-0013.htm_para9"><a name="08042286000038">We should be doing this. We have had a commitment from the Government, but it is open-ended. We want to set a date. As the hon. Member for Eastbourne said, this provision was agreed in last year&#146;s Pensions Bill. The Minister will ask how it is to be paid for. National insurance contributions are in credit at the moment, and there is absolutely no reason why that surplus money cannot be used to restore the link. It can happen now, and I want the Government and the Minister to give a clear indication that it will. If we vote on nothing else tonight, we should divide the House on this new clause to see whether the Government&#146;s commitments and promises are more than warm words. I give notice that if neither new clause 7 nor new clause 16 is pressed to a vote, we will want to press our new clause 21, because we believe that the Government have had enough time to deliver on this commitment, and we want to see it implemented now.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o284"><a name="80422-0013.htm_para10"><a name="08042286000039">As I said, this would only be the first stage. We want a citizens pension. Instead of setting the bar at which pensioners can have an income at &#163;30 below the poverty line, as is currently the case, that bar should be set at the poverty line. The Government have made a commitment on child poverty. It is a testing target, but in the last two Budgets they came forward with proposals showing that they are delivering. Why can the Minister not deliver on this promise? These people have worked all their lives for us; many of them fought during the second world war to ensure that we could be here now. They deserve that right. It is wrong to say that another 3 million of them are going to die before the promise is kept. It must be kept now, as is appropriate in the state pension&#146;s centenary year. The Minister could not deliver a better speech at the TUC national pensioners convention in the constituency of the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Jim Cousins) than to say, &#147;We&#146;ve delivered on our promises.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o285"><a name="80422-0013.htm_para11"><a name="08042286000041">I pay great tribute to my right hon. Friend the Member for Barrow and Furness (Mr. Hutton), because in many respects the package consisting of this Pensions Bill and the Pensions Bill that preceded it last year is very much his package, implementing the findings of the Turner commission. I have no doubt that he saw the restoration of the earnings link as being a vital part of that package. In his opening statement on these issues, he referred to the long-term damage caused by the eroding effects of our present system of indexation of pensions. The restoration of the earnings link is an absolutely essential component of the credibility of the Government&#146;s new pensions proposals in the Bill regarding personal pension accounts. The credibility of personal pension accounts depends on the restoration of the earnings link so that people are assured that they are not paying money into a scheme whose ultimate effect will be simply to save the Government money, in the form of the benefits that they would otherwise have received.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o286"><a name="80422-0013.htm_para12"><a name="08042286000042">Another important part of the package is that by restoring the earnings link we build a bridge between tomorrow&#146;s pensioners, who we hope will benefit from the introduction of personal pension accounts, and today&#146;s pensioners, who in every other respect do not benefit from the proposals in the Bill. The restoration of the earnings link must not be delayed. It is essential for the delivery of the Government&#146;s pension reform package, and it must not be subject to the daily volatilities of the political and economic environment in which we all operate.</p>

Member for Eastbourne (Mr. Waterson) mentioned that for the Government the reintroduction of the link to earnings would be subject to affordability and the fiscal position. The current situation is a little different from the one that we were in last year. There is more uncertainty about the fiscal position of the Government, and when we see their accounts at the end of the financial year, we will see, rather remarkably, that they have observed their fiscal rules simply because a large number of people who were entitled to means-tested benefits did not claim them, thus saving the Government money. That is a difficult situation for any Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o288"><a name="80422-0013.htm_para14"><a name="08042286000044">The point must be made that the longer the restoration of the link with earnings is delayed, the more today&#146;s pensioners will end up in relative hardship and depending on the complex rules of pension credit. Indeed, the provision in the previous Pensions Act that pension credit should increase in line with earnings, even when the basic rate of state pension does not, has now become a machine that remorselessly, year by year, draws larger numbers into a state of dependency on means-tested benefits. Once they get there, there is no possibility of retrieving the situation. Parliament should not allow that to continue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o289"><a name="80422-0013.htm_para15"><a name="08042286000045">Of course, we ought to seek simplification of tax and pension credits. We may well have an opportunity to consider some of those issues quite soon, which would be welcome. But in the meantime, we have to protect people from being drawn into dependency on means-tested benefits where that is not necessary. Let us recognise that the people who do not claim the means-tested benefits to which they are entitled are often old people&#151;often women&#151;who live on their own in social isolation. It is entirely wrong that we should not move to protect such people.</p>

 My hon. Friend is right, but I would go further. I do not agree with means-testing as part of the pension. I want it eliminated entirely, with a quick restoration of the pension for everyone, to at least the minimum poverty level and beyond. We ought to consider restoring the pension for all to the level that it would have reached had the earnings link not been broken. That means that the pension would be roughly 25 per cent. of average earnings&#151;40 per cent. higher than the current level. Even then we would still have one of the lowest pensions in the whole of Europe, and certainly in western Europe. Our basic state pension is disgracefully low. We must do more than just restore the link; we must go beyond it and look towards a much higher, non-means-tested basic state pension.</p>

They have a sense of pride in what they have achieved and they do not want to be demeaned by being forced through the means-testing system.

 Although the national insurance fund gets money in, it would not be sufficient to deal with the particular expenditures going out as a result of the change. That will have to be provided by the taxpayer. There is a surplus in the theoretical national insurance fund, but once it is spent, it is gone. It is just gone; that surplus will be spent fairly quickly. Although there will be some money coming in, the amount will not be sufficient to pay this off. In the end, it has to be a political judgment taken by a Government to say that it is a sufficient priority for them to ensure that, year on year and in the long term, pensioners are better off. We need to identify the time for that in the context of the overall state of the economy and the way in which public finances are going. We need to see how we can put all that together as part of a package. Our package involves the state changes coming into place in 2010, after which we will put in place further changes in the private sector in 2012. They are important changes.</p>

 I thank the Minister for giving way. We all heard the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor) that the group who will inevitably lose out the most are older pensioners, because for all sorts of reasons they will not see the benefit of the retying of the earnings link. Is there some possibility, given the surplus in the national insurance fund, of targeting that older group, not necessarily through the Bill? The Government ought to be considering that group. I wonder what my hon. and learned Friend has to say about that.</p>

 As my hon. Friend is aware, we have made the provision of help for older people a key part of our expenditure. In the recent Budget, announcements on the winter fuel allowance prioritised pensioners because of the circumstances arising from increased fuel costs. The Budget means that next year&#146;s winter fuel payments will increase to &#163;250 for households with someone over 60 and &#163;400 for those with someone over 80. That is a significant contribution to older people&#146;s winter fuel bills.</p>

It is also the case that we have introduced things such as free eyesight tests and free TV licences for the over-75s and we have outlawed age discrimination. We have taken a whole series of steps showing that this Government regard older people and pensioners as a priority&#151;not only in financial terms, but by making changes to how our society operates and dealing with discrimination against older people in the work force. I am working at the moment on another small but symbolic step to ensure that we have an older people&#146;s day to show our respect for their role and contribution to our society. All those things are part of our commitment.</p>

 We are still trying to tease out the Government&#146;s thinking on why they will not move on this measure. Will the Minister explain&#151;or even give a reference or place information in the Library&#151;the Government&#146;s calculations and assessment of the impact of this level of expenditure on the overall economy? What macro-economic impact would it have if the new clause were accepted? Most of us believe that it would actually have a directly beneficial economic impact not just on individuals but, by increasing demand and thereby expenditure, on the overall economy. At the same time, will the Minister give us some indication of the actuarial calculations of how many existing pensioners will not benefit from any change of policy by 2012 or 2015 because they will no longer be alive?</p>

 The additional cost of earnings uprating of the basic state pension from 2010 in 2007-08 prices is as follows: in 2010, &#163;0.8 billion; in 2011, &#163;1.5 billion; in 2012, &#163;1.6 billion; in 2020, &#163;2 billion.

We have written on four or five occasions over the course of the last year to people who we think might be entitled to pension credit in order to try to get them to make those claims. We are working enormously hard to increase the numbers of people who are on pension credit. It is a Government priority to ensure that we deal with issues around fuel poverty, particularly for pensioners, and around broader pensioner poverty, too.</p>

 I agree with my hon. and learned Friend that the Government have done a great deal for today&#146;s pensioners. Of course, it is too late for them to save for their retirement, so my concern is that we are not doing enough to incentivise future pensioners sufficiently to save. The Minister is absolutely right that it is all about priorities. Last year, for example, the Government chose to spend &#163;1 billion on reducing inheritance tax to benefit some of the more affluent members of our society, so is it not time that the Government gave priority to this now? We could find money from other areas&#151;for example, from the huge proportion of money going in tax relief to higher-rate taxpayers on their contributions to pension schemes.</p>

 As my hon. Friend knows well, we made additional provision for pensioners in the recent Budget in the form of winter fuel payments. That not insignificant contribution will go to every pensioner household in the country with someone over 60. We recognised that pensioners faced increased bills and we made provision for it. Our priorities for helping pensioners are therefore very clear from the last few months.</p>

It is essential to our policy delivery, and to the action that we wish to take to help older people. It is not an optional extra; it is not something that we might do if the circumstances were just right. It is something that we must do.

 The Government have a clear commitment to the policy that I have set out. There is no &#147;get out of jail free&#148; card. We have put in place a package of measures that requires that this measure be put in place. We are not going to jeopardise everything that we have put in place in order not to make this change; that is complete nonsense.

 I do not want to reopen old wounds, but had we won the last election we would already be implementing this promise. That is history, however.

Lest anyone have any illusions, when pension credit was first introduced, the Treasury&#146;s assumption was that 1.4 million people would never claim it. It always assumed that it would have the money in its back pocket whatever happened, because at least 1.4 million would never claim it.</p>

We have legislated for the future raising of the state pension age. We are dealing with personal accounts. It is all part of the same package.

we are Conservatives, so we understand the need for business not to be fettered by unnecessary red tape or bureaucracy. However, surely PADA and its successor could reasonably be expected to reflect current best practice&#151;the Pension Protection Fund is already signed up to the UN principles, as are various comparable bodies around the world. The new clause would, however, still leave some flexibility to those running the personal accounts system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o341"><a name="80422-0015.htm_para25"><a name="080422109000087">Two approaches are possible. We know&#151;because that is the way life is&#151;that the default fund will far and away be the biggest fund, as people will not make a conscious decision to invest in a particular type of fund and therefore by default will end up in that default fund. One option is to apply the UN principles right across the board, and particularly to the default fund. Another option would be a specific fund based on those, or comparable, principles. It seemed to be accepted without debate in Committee that there would be a fund&#151;possibly out of only five or six altogether under personal accounts&#151;that would be subject to sharia law. There is a lot of sense in that; it is important that we make that kind of provision. However, why should we not also have a fund based on ethical principles&#151;perhaps Christian principles? Within a limited number of funds&#151;I think the number should be limited for all the practical reasons debated in Committee&#151;there should be that element of choice.</p>

All we are asking to do is to put in the legislation the fact that the authority must have regard to the UN principles for responsible investment. That is not an unreasonable thing to require. When personal accounts are up and running, the funds will be a substantial part of investment in this country. That will be the case for the default fund in particular, for reasons that I have mentioned.

It is perfectly legitimate for Mr. Jones and his colleagues to consult on the way in which this matter is delivered&#151;I have given a couple of possibilities&#151;but not on the overwhelming principle. It is perfectly reasonable for this House to say that the principles should apply and to leave the detailed work to the authority.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o347"><a name="80422-0016.htm_para2"><a name="080422109000093">Amendments Nos. 25 and 26 approach things from a slightly different angle. By proposing to include the word &#147;needs&#148; and the question of &#147;disproportionate cost&#148;, as we tried to do in Committee, the amendments make the point that even where people have their own preferences as to how their money should be invested, both their preferences and their needs should be taken into account. That is because people sometimes make slightly bizarre investment decisions, often for the best possible ethical reasons, when they would be better advised doing something slightly different, or at least spreading the risk in a different way.</p>

We are not looking at anything remotely like the Swedish model, which I believe has about 200 to 300 different funds, and I commend new clause 12, and amendments Nos. 25 and 26, to the House.

 The hon. Member for Eastbourne (Mr. Waterson) outlined a number of issues. Although the subject was well debated in Committee, there is a reason to return to it now, so I shall thus discuss new clause 12 and amendment No. 39.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o349"><a name="80422-0016.htm_para4"><a name="080422109000096">Taken at face value, it is easy to misunderstand what the UN principles for responsible investment involve. That is why I concur with a comment made by the hon. Gentleman; although Tim Jones&#146;s letter in response to the Minister&#146;s drawing to PADA&#146;s attention the Committee&#146;s debate certainly suggested that PADA was interested and would wish to consult on the proposal, it is important to recognise that the UN principles for responsible investment are not a set of strongly binding prescriptive principles that must be followed in every detail or else. Rather, they are about having in place the correct toolkit to examine the range of responsible investment issues.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o350"><a name="80422-0016.htm_para5"><a name="080422109000097">Rather than saying precisely how the toolkit should be used, the principles provide a range of tools for use, and there would, of course, then be an obligation on PADA and, therefore, potentially on the variety of funds themselves, to take the principles into account in making investment decisions. If such a toolkit was not in place, fund managers, for example, would not be able to work effectively with investee companies or to command public confidence that due diligence was being practised.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o351"><a name="80422-0016.htm_para6"><a name="080422109000098">There is significant public concern about this, and the Minister has rightly recognised that in relation to the  <br>

availability of a sharia law-compliant fund. There was a great deal of public concern in respect of the use of environmental green funds and about the operation of other funds of responsible investment. One of the interesting facts to emerge from the briefing and other material that has been provided for this debate&#151;other analyses also confirm this&#151;is that developing a capability to monitor and manage environmental, social and governance issues, all of which are covered under the UN principles, can also increase both returns and financial security.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o352"><a name="80422-0016.htm_para7"><a name="080422109000099">That business case has already persuaded asset owners and managers with approximately $10 trillion of assets under management to become signatories to the UN principles for responsible investment. Included in that are state funds in France, Norway, New Zealand, Canada and Ireland. As the hon. Member for Eastbourne said, the signatories also include our own Pension Protection Fund, some UK pension funds and a number of major UK asset managers too. That set of principles has not emerged from nowhere, nor is it so outlandish that it could not be adopted. In fact, the principles have been widely adopted by other organisations in the UK and across the world.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o353"><a name="80422-0016.htm_para8"><a name="080422109000100">Of course the issue of cost in following the UN principles of responsible investment has rightly been a concern for PADA throughout the deliberations on this Bill. The evidence that we have is that the cost to fund managers is relatively insignificant, consisting of the costs of employing a small number of staff to examine the environmental, social and governance issues that might arise. Many fund managers already employ staff in that capacity. Other costs might include subscribing to environmental, social and governance research services, and the UN PRI itself asks for a voluntary contribution, although it is perhaps worth noting that the majority of signatories do not pay. Therefore, the costs to beneficiaries of personal accounts would be relatively small and, given the examples that we have of investments in such areas achieving good returns, could be outweighed by the gains.</p>

I am sure that is why the Pension Protection Fund, among others, has signed up to the principles. Many would consider it to be very strange if a flagship scheme established by legislation&#151;as we hope personal accounts will be&#151;did not sign up to the principles. I look forward to hearing from the Minister why it is that he is not willing to push the issue a bit harder with PADA at this stage.</p>

One of the key issues that we have considered on personal accounts is the need to ensure that they complement rather than compete with current provision. We also want to ensure that personal accounts do not have advantages over and above other schemes, which is one reason why I was sceptical about some of the proposals made in relation to pay-as-you-save.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o357"><a name="80422-0016.htm_para12"><a name="080422111000004">However, nor do we want to create a situation in which there are disadvantages. Would the application of the UN principles be a disadvantage? It would be interesting to find out whether the Conservatives regard them as an advantage in some way. If the principles would oblige this particular pension scheme to apply the principles, would they oblige all other pension schemes to comply with them? We have taken the view that the principles are very worth while, but it should be a matter for the trustees to consider, for each individual pension scheme, whether they wish to apply them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o358"><a name="80422-0016.htm_para13"><a name="080422111000005">The Conservatives seem to be suggesting that we should oblige a particular pension scheme to take on those principles&#151;in fact that we should oblige not only the pension scheme to take them on, but PADA, which is a delivery authority that does not run a pension scheme but merely sets one up. I am perplexed about what the Conservative party&#146;s policy now is. If we are to oblige this particular pension scheme to have this provision, why not all public sector pension schemes&#151;why not all private sector pension schemes? Is that now Conservative party policy? I would be interested to know.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o359"><a name="80422-0016.htm_para14"><a name="080422111000006">My view remains that which we set out in Committee. The principles are good and valuable, and we want to see pension schemes take account of them when the trustees regard that as appropriate. We will not force pension scheme trustees to adopt them. We are happy to say to those who are setting up personal account schemes that they should consider the principles. Indeed, we have had a positive response from people who have said that they will consult on the inclusion of the principles in their pension schemes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o360"><a name="80422-0016.htm_para15"><a name="080422111000007">We have played a positive role in promoting that approach.

in the setting up of one of the biggest pension schemes, if not the biggest, ever created in this country. The aim is that there should be widespread public consultation for the precise reason why up to 9 million people, many of whom are not currently saving, will be signing up to the scheme. If the scheme is to be treated in an entirely different way from any other scheme so that the trustees cannot make decisions about what investment principles they will operate under, that is quite a significant step.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o362"><a name="80422-0016.htm_para17"><a name="080422111000009">In a sense, I am with the hon.

However, signing up to the UN principles would require active management of funds, which is more expensive than passive management of funds. It must be for the trustee to decide whether the additional costs are in the members&#146; best interests. Otherwise, we will effectively be telling the trustees that they must manage their funds in a particular way and ensure that the principles that the UN has put forward are complied with. Let us be clear about this: we will be saying that if there is any extra cost in doing so, it will fall upon the people who contribute to the pension scheme.</p>

We are creating a pension scheme for low and moderate income people.

 It should be a matter for the trustees of the pension scheme to examine the various options that they wish to make available to its members. As Paul Myners, the chairman of PADA, quite clearly said in his evidence to the Committee, each additional whistle that is attached to the scheme will have a cost for the members. Keeping it simple is the key to effective delivery of personal accounts. If we do not do that, and if we do not create a scheme that people can know all about without having to make a detailed examination of the principles that will be applied in this scheme but not in others, we will create a whole series of problems for ourselves.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o368"><a name="80422-0016.htm_para23"><a name="080422111000017">The law already requires the trustees of all occupational pension schemes to state the extent to which social, environmental and ethical considerations have been taken into account in their statement of investment principles. They have to do that now. The legal requirements will apply to the trustee of the personal accounts scheme just as they will in any other scheme.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o369"><a name="80422-0016.htm_para24"><a name="080422111000018">It is possible today for the trustees of various schemes to choose to adhere to the UN principles in the statement of investment principles that they set out. We would applaud them for doing so, but the Liberal Democrats and the Conservatives appear to be advocating that a significant further step should be taken. Effectively, it would rewrite much of trust law. We all agree that the UN principles are good ones, but the Opposition parties seem to believe that the proposed scheme must be required, by law, to adhere to them, even though no other comparable scheme has to do so. I say to the hon. Member for Rochdale (Paul Rowen) that in every other scheme, it is left to the trustees to decide what is contained in the statement of investment.</p>

 The Minister once again misinterprets the UN principles. They are a toolkit&#151;that is, a set of values to which trustees should have regard&#151;and not a prescription for investment. The two things are very different.</p>

 I accept that; it is why I was able to write to Tim Jones and ask him whether he would accept that the toolkit was something that he should bear in mind when he carried out the consultation later this year. However, if the hon. Gentleman believes that the principles do not have implications, I have to tell  <br>

 I am sorry for suggesting that the hon. Gentleman might be trying to appeal to such people, but the proposals would look good in a <i> Guardian</i> article. On inspection, it is clear that they would oblige people on low incomes to comply with something that people with higher incomes and better pension schemes would not have to comply with. Opposition Members need to think carefully, as what might look good in <i> T</i><i> he </i><i> Guardian </i>for one day could have significant implications for pension scheme members for a long time to come.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o371"><a name="80422-0016.htm_para26"><a name="080422111000026">Amendments Nos. 25 and 26 would amend the PADA principles in the Bill to require it to consider the needs of members. Moreover, when carrying out its work on investment, PADA would also have to consider whether members&#146; preferences would result in disproportionate costs. Those are interesting ideas. In preparing its recommendations, the delivery authority will be required to consider the full range of guiding principles set out in what is now clause 70. That clause is at the core of the Bill, because it sets out what we are trying to achieve. It carefully sets out the balancing obligations to which PADA must have regard when we set up and run personal accounts.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o372"><a name="80422-0016.htm_para27"><a name="080422111000027">We have always been clear that although PADA will be obliged to meet those obligations, when the Personal Accounts Board and the trustee corporation are actually running a pension scheme, the trustees will have to take a view on what principles they believe that they need to comply with in order to protect the members of that pension scheme. That is why we took the view that although PADA will be obliged to comply with the principles in clause 70, we will not impose broad-based principles on the trustees without their consent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o373"><a name="80422-0016.htm_para28"><a name="080422111000028">Clause 70 means that the trustees will take into account the investment preferences of potential members when PADA sets up the scheme, but they will have to balance that consideration with other principles, including that of encouraging participation, minimising the charge to members and respecting diversity; there was broad support for those principles when we discussed them in Committee.</p>

and as a whole they ensure that members&#146; needs will always be embedded in the authority&#146;s work when it prepares the scheme&#146;s draft investment strategy. Further changes to the principles are simply not necessary.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o375"><a name="80422-0017.htm_para1"><a name="080422111000030">We want to set out the way in which personal accounts will develop. The hon. Member for Eastbourne pretty much implied that the UN principles would apply to one investment account only, and not to the whole operation of the pension schemes. What we are looking at is a default scheme that will have a very limited number of additional options to which potential pensioners can sign up. Paul Myners said that he did not want all the bells and whistles put on; he just wants to ensure a simple, basic scheme, although there will be some options.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o376"><a name="80422-0017.htm_para2"><a name="080422111000031">After consultation, some members of the Personal Accounts Board may well take the view that they want an option that will enable ethical investment, and decide that the principles for ethical investment have to include the UN principles that we have discussed. I would applaud such a decision, but I want things to be done in a proper, sensible way, through consultation with potential members and stakeholders, and I want discretion to be given to the trustees in due course. The Conservatives and Liberal Democrats are wrong to seek to deny them that discretion.</p>

 I am amazed at how tetchy the Minister has been.

Has he not noticed that politics has changed dramatically in the last 18 months? It is time that he adjusted to it.</p>

 I beg to move, That the Bill be now read the Third time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o388"><a name="80422-0018.htm_para4"><a name="080422119000488">I say that with a certain amount of d&#233;j  vu, because I said exactly those words almost a year ago. I also said then that we were implementing the most ambitious reform of our pension system in modern times, and with the Bill then&#151;now the Pensions Act 2007&#151;and the Bill that we are debating tonight, that is exactly what we are doing. That d&#233;j  vu also applies to the many hon. Members in the Chamber who have followed the Bill right the way through and given such great service on the Committee. No one has as much a sense of d&#233;j  vu as the hon. Member for Eastbourne (Mr. Waterson). I believe that this is his fourth Pensions Bill. I do not know what he did in a previous life to deserve this fate, but I am sure that serving on four Pensions Bills is enough to have expunged whatever was wrong with his karma.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o389"><a name="80422-0018.htm_para5"><a name="080422119000489">I also want to pay tribute to my colleague, the Under-Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, my hon. Friend the Member for Warwick and Leamington (Mr. Plaskitt), who has taken through many of the clauses of the Bill. In particular, I want to pay tribute to the Minister for Pensions Reform, my hon. and learned Friend the Member for North Warwickshire (Mr. O'Brien), who has a wide range of admirers and who has commanded support and compliments for the effective and consensual way in which he has taken the Bill forward, building on the achievements of his predecessor but two&#151;my right hon. Friend the Member for East Ham (Mr. Timms)&#151;and correcting the many mistakes of his immediate predecessor, whose advice he has been wise to avoid all the way through.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o390"><a name="80422-0018.htm_para6"><a name="080422119000490">So, why is this reform needed? It is needed because of the changes to pensions over the last 20 or 30 years, and it has been built on the recommendations of the Turner commission. I am sure that everyone in the House would like to pay tribute to the commission for its work. It has laid the foundations for the Bill that is reaching completion in this House this evening. Many commissions see their work languish on a shelf. Indeed, some people predicted that that might happen in this case. Tonight, however, we are now putting in place the second stage of the legislation for these reforms. Last year&#146;s Pensions Act was the first side of that coin. It made pensions  <br>

simpler, fairer and more generous, and it built a more solid platform on which people could save. This Bill will make it easier for people to save on the basis of that platform. It also puts in place what I believe will be seen as a genuinely historic change: the right for everyone to have an occupational pension scheme.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o391"><a name="80422-0018.htm_para7"><a name="080422119000492">Why did the Pensions Commission make its recommendations? It did so for two reasons. It recognised the progress that had been made since 1997, stating that</p>
<a name="80422-0018.htm_brev1"><a name="080422119000523"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;average pension income today compares well with that of previous generations&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o392"><a name="80422-0018.htm_para8"><a name="080422119000493">And so it does. The National Audit Office has also recognised the &#147;real and substantial progress&#148; that has been made towards helping the poorest pensioners. We are proud of having taken more than 2 million pensioners out of absolute poverty and 1 million out of relative poverty, and to have achieved a situation in which pensioners are now no more likely to be poor than anyone else in the population. That is a remarkable achievement, when we consider that everyone else can rely on their wages going up.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o393"><a name="80422-0018.htm_para9"><a name="080422119000494">The Pensions Commission also said that there was a compelling case for further reform, for two clear reasons. The first was what it called the fool&#146;s paradise of &#147;irrational exuberance&#148;, in which the exceptional equity returns of the 1980s and 1990s&#151;when people saw their investments increasing at a very great rate&#151;allowed many schemes to</p>
<a name="80422-0018.htm_brev2"><a name="080422119000524"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;ignore the rapid rise in the underlying cost of their pensions promises&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o394"><a name="80422-0018.htm_para10"><a name="080422119000495">People were making promises, but they were not putting away enough money to fund them. The Pensions Commission said:</p>
<a name="80422-0018.htm_brev3"><a name="080422119000525"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;When the fool&#146;s paradise came to an end...companies adjusted rapidly...A reduction in the generosity of the DB pensions promises which existed in the mid-1990s was inevitable.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o395"><a name="80422-0018.htm_para11"><a name="080422119000496">That is the first reason why change was necessary. We needed to address that fool&#146;s paradise.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o396"><a name="80422-0018.htm_para12"><a name="080422119000497">The second reason, which has not received so much comment, is that final salary schemes, even at their best, only ever benefited a minority. It was always the case that the majority of people did not benefit from them, and tonight&#146;s historic change corrects that.</p>

<p><a name="st_o280"><a name="080422119000498"><a name="80422-0018.htm_spnew0"><a name="080422119001000"><b>Mike Penning:</b>
 One group of people who were not living in a fool&#146;s paradise consisted of the 125,000 pensioners who had their pensions stolen from their occupational pension schemes. Seven hundred of them are from my own constituency. I am pleased that after five years, the Government eventually came forward and gave them 90 per cent. of the pension to which they were entitled, but I have two questions for the Minister about part 4 of the Bill. First, can he confirm that the pensioners who were without their pension for nearly five years will not be taxed on the lump sum? Some of my constituents, such as Mr. Peter Humphries, will be charged 40 per cent. of their lump sum, although he had to go to work to pay for his family&#146;s upkeep when his pension failed to come through for five years. Secondly, have the Government seen sense enough to wrap the financial assistance scheme up with the Pension Protection Fund? It seems ludicrous to have the two; what plans does the Secretary of State have for the FAS?</p>

 The Secretary of State will not be surprised to hear that I am going to raise a point about new clause 23, which we were unable to debate today.

 I have been in my place since Prayers to ask this question, so I hope that the Secretary of State will bear with me if I press him again. I asked whether my constituents and other FAS members would be taxed on the lump sum. The Secretary of State alluded to the fact that the matter had been addressed at oral questions. Since then, however, we have discovered that some are going to be taxed on the lump sum because it is coming through in the form of a lump sum, and because they had to work to keep going during the five-year wait for compensation. Will the Secretary of State confirm that my constituents will not be taxed on the lump sum for which they have waited for five years, and which is the pension that they were entitled to in the first place?</p>

 I believe that we have addressed that issue: those people will be taxed in exactly the same way as if the situation had not occurred and they had been paid regularly&#151;but we shall be happy to write to the hon. Gentleman to set that out.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o397"><a name="80422-0018.htm_para13"><a name="080422119000506">Tonight&#146;s changes address the two key problems&#151;that only a minority had access to a private pension, and that even those were unaffordable, so radical reforms were needed. In addition to paying tribute to the Pensions Commission, we should pay tribute to the stakeholders who have carried the Bill all the way through, and have been prepared to make trade-offs to ensure that that happens. The consumer representatives and the unions have accepted that the state pension age will be higher; the employers and the Association of British Insurers have accepted that there will be compulsory contributions  <br>

from employers and the new low-cost personal accounts scheme. Because people have been prepared to make those trade-offs, the consensus has been solid throughout the Bill&#146;s passage. It means that, tonight, the combination of giving everyone access to personal accounts or to a private pension, combined with automatic involvement, will enable us to turn on its head the inertia that currently stops so many people from saving.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o398"><a name="80422-0018.htm_para14"><a name="080422119000507">In conclusion&#151;we have little time, and I want to ensure that everyone who wants to speak can do so&#151;we need to keep the word &#147;consensus&#148; at the forefront of our minds. Consensus is important not just as a political device, but in order to help people to save. If people are thinking about putting money away for 20, 30 or 40 years, they will be more likely to do it if they are confident that there is a consensus between political parties, which will ensure stability in the framework.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o399"><a name="80422-0018.htm_para15"><a name="080422119000508">In thinking about that, it is interesting to look back to a previous debate on the Social Security Pensions Bill 1975, which I read about this afternoon. I do not think that the hon. Member for Eastbourne had much to do with that particular Bill, although I am sure he will know how Barbara Castle felt when she said in opening her speech that it was the third time in just over five years that the Secretary of State for Health and Social Security, as she was then, had brought a pensions Bill before the House. If she is looking down on the hon. Member for Eastbourne now, I am sure that she will feel much sympathy for him.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o400"><a name="80422-0018.htm_para16"><a name="080422119000509">The interesting thing about that debate is that Barbara Castle said very clearly that she wanted to build her reforms on the basis of consensus. She said that she intended them to command general acceptance, and hoped they had succeeded in that regard. Later the Conservative spokesman&#151;Lord Fowler, as he is now&#151;said that his party believed consensus was possible. I think that on Third Reading there was no Division. Both sides hoped that the Bill would command a consensus that would continue, yet within years that consensus had fallen apart.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o401"><a name="80422-0018.htm_para17"><a name="080422119000510">The key thing that we should tell ourselves tonight is that by legislating we are not completing the reforms, but merely establishing the start of the process. If we believe, as I think Members in all parts of the House believe, that this is an important reform which is in the interests of millions of people&#151;particularly low and moderate earners&#151;I think we should say tonight that we are not satisfied for the consensus to be merely legislative, and that we will work together over the next few years to ensure that the hopes we have for the Bill will be realised in practice. We need to continue to make trade-offs, and to work together to improve the chance of millions of people to have decent incomes in retirement.</p>

Member for Rochdale (Paul Rowen); and all those who served on the Committee, who have dealt with the detail of the debate in a good and constructive manner.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o402"><a name="80422-0018.htm_para18"><a name="080422119000512">We have just heard the Secretary of State describe the Government&#146;s reform plans in glowing terms, but it is important for us to remember that we have been here before. Tonight I have been reading the report of a debate on the introduction of stakeholder pensions which took place in the House in 1999, led by the then Secretary of State, who is now the Chancellor of the Exchequer. The Government said that 4 million to 5 million people would benefit from stakeholder pensions, and described them as an appropriate vehicle for people on low earnings which had been almost universally welcomed. So we are not exactly at first base when it comes to major pension reforms, and this time it is important for us to get it right.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o403"><a name="80422-0018.htm_para19"><a name="080422119000513">We are not without reservations about the detail of the Bill, and we feel that work remains to be done on the reforms, although it is true that few Bills generate such a general desire for them to succeed. We want this Bill to succeed, because it is in the interests of the nation to have a pensions system that works, but, as I have said, we have been here before. On 11 May 1999, the present Chancellor of the Exchequer said:</p>
<a name="80422-0018.htm_brev4"><a name="080422119000526"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;I am confident that, by the end of this Parliament, pension provision and structure will be set on a firm footing that will serve this country well for generations to come.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o404"><a name="80422-0018.htm_para20"><a name="080422119000514">That did not actually happen. Now, the second time around, it really does need to work. Like the Secretary of State&#146;s favourite football team, the Bill demonstrates plenty of promise, but in the end, lacks the depth to deliver the results. We have had widespread discussions with different stakeholder groups, and, as the right hon. Gentleman said, the Government have received plenty of helpful advice from within the House and elsewhere. However, there has been little change in the detail, and little in the way of actual response to the concerns that have been raised.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o405"><a name="80422-0018.htm_para21"><a name="080422119000515">Means-testing has been a big issue&#151;and again, we have been here before. In 1999, the present Chancellor of the Exchequer said:</p>
<a name="80422-0018.htm_brev5"><a name="080422119000527"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The Government are aware that, because of the present capital and income rules, many pensioners who have modest savings or a modest income stream are adversely affected by the benefits system. We said in the Green Paper that we are determined to tackle that&#148;.&#151;[<i> Official Report</i>, 11 May 1999; Vol. 331, c. 132.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o406"><a name="80422-0018.htm_para22"><a name="080422119000516">Here we are, nine years later, discussing the same issues&#151;in this of all weeks, when the Government are having problems in dealing with the issue of financial support for people on low incomes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o407"><a name="80422-0018.htm_para23"><a name="080422119000517">We have argued throughout that the issue of means-testing is potentially fatal to these reforms. I am grateful to the Secretary of State&#146;s predecessor, the Minister of State, for initiating the debate on the subject, but I have to say that we expected more by now. We set out specific issues to be processed in Pensim2, but we have not yet received a detailed response. We have seen no detailed information about the sensitivities surrounding take-up if the means-testing issue is not addressed, but we have had private warnings from some of the groups involved that Ministers are not taking the issue as seriously as they expected. It is extremely important for this review to be more than just a way of postponing bad news  <br>

until a later date. It must not be a case of &#147;What happens now?&#148; We need a detailed document in the autumn, a debate in this House and an open and grown-up discussion about what can be done and when, and we need to accept that the cost of getting this right might not exceed the cost of getting it wrong; the cost of not getting this right in years to come might be a much bigger bill for the taxpayer and a much lower take-up of personal accounts, and it might undermine the reforms.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o408"><a name="80422-0018.htm_para24"><a name="080422119000518">We are equally disappointed that the Government have not yet fully addressed other key issues, such as auto-enrolment into GPPs. We do not want that. We have heard in the debate about the dilution of existing provision. It is extremely important to preserve existing provision&#151;the Bill must add to, rather than undermine, what is already there. As the Bill leaves this House, Ministers still have little answer to some of these basic questions. It is extremely important that they be addressed. I hope that they will be addressed as the Bill progresses through the other place, and that their lordships will have the opportunity to put these questions time and again, and if necessary to change the Bill to ensure that they are answered.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o409"><a name="80422-0018.htm_para25"><a name="080422119000519">We have other key questions relating to the cost of the scheme. It will not work if the costs are too high. We talked earlier about rumours in circulation about what the costs are; it is extremely important that Ministers lay those to rest.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o410"><a name="80422-0018.htm_para26"><a name="080422119000520">It is also important for us to hear more from the Government over the next few weeks about what they will do to address the concerns of small employers in particular. Ministers will be aware that a number of pressure groups are asking for more information about what the Government intend to do, and it is important that we hear from them about that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o411"><a name="80422-0018.htm_para27"><a name="080422119000521">I have said that we want to get things right&#151;indeed, I said on Second Reading that we want this to work properly&#151;and that is why we have attempted to engage in constructive debate. We want to get things right not least because there is now a good chance that it will fall to us to implement the reforms. Given Labour&#146;s trials and tribulations, it appears ever more likely that that will be the case. Indeed, the Secretary of State is already positioning himself to become the next Leader of the Opposition. The Conservatives are making sure that we are ready to take over Government, should the circumstance arise in 2010. We are still not convinced that the Government have got everything about these reforms right. If they do not address the issues as the Bill continues its progress through Parliament, we are ready and prepared to make the necessary changes in 2010 after the next election, in order to ensure that when the reforms come through in 2012 they deliver a system that really will, as the Chancellor said nine years ago, last a generation and do us proud for the future.</p>

Therefore, it is important to look at the two sets of measures together. This is a complicated Bill; there is a lot in it, and there is a lot of work still to do. As an Opposition, we have tried from the start to maintain the consensus, but to raise issues where we feel that there is a need for more information, more work or greater transparency.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o413"><a name="80422-0019.htm_para1"><a name="0804236000011">As the Minister for Pensions Reform knows, we still have several concerns and want work to be done on certain areas. Mention has been made of means-testing; I referred earlier to the Government&#146;s difficulties with the 10p tax rate, and we do not want that to be repeated in terms of means-testing. This is a groundbreaking reform that will ensure that many low and middle-income people save properly for their pension. It would be tragic if they were to get their pension and then lose it because the benefits system was not flexible enough. Again, we wait to see what the outcome of the review will be, and we hope that the Government will address this matter. I know that my colleagues in the other place will also be looking at this, and will perhaps be subjecting the matter to further scrutiny.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o414"><a name="80422-0019.htm_para2"><a name="0804236000012">We have raised the issue of generic advice and our concerns about the level of it. The Thoresen review has dealt with some of those matters, but we nevertheless again give notice that we have issues and concerns. We are disappointed that the Minister is only now having a consultation about the open-market option, because we share the view of much of the pensions industry that that should, and could, by now be in the Bill, and that it would have been a useful tool that could have benefited many people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o415"><a name="80422-0019.htm_para3"><a name="0804236000013">We are disappointed with the fact that although the Minister can filibuster about the United Nations ethical principles, the Government have done little to implement them. This is not just for readers of <i> The </i><i> Guardian</i>; this is about ensuring that investing ethically benefits pensioners as well as those who receive the investment. Nevertheless, the Bill is important and will benefit many people. If it ensures that pensioners have a decent income, that is to be welcomed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o416"><a name="80422-0019.htm_para4"><a name="0804236000014">Finally, I am disappointed that the Government have failed, in the centenary of the introduction of the old- age pension, to say categorically that they will reintroduce, from next year or whenever, the link with earnings. The hon. Member for Epsom and Ewell (Chris Grayling) quoted the Chancellor&#146;s statement that many pensioners who are entitled to pension credits do not claim them. We want pensioners to have a guaranteed income, and all the issues about means-testing would be much better for that. Nevertheless, I welcome the Bill, which is a step in the right direction. I look forward to my noble Friends in the other place tabling amendments that we can perhaps consider on another date.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o417"><a name="80422-0019.htm_para5"><a name="0804236000016">I have made many speeches in this House before this Secretary of State and Minister of State&#151;the Minister for Pensions Reform&#151;as well as before previous Ministers of State, calling for justice for the 125,000 pensioners whose pensions were stolen from them when their occupational schemes were wound up. I shall repeat again that more than 700 such people come from my constituency. I was ever so pleased when, after five years of campaigning by many hon. Members across this House, we thought we had reached the conclusion and we thought that those people would receive their compensation. We all fought for 90 per cent., and that is what they will get through the financial assistance scheme.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o418"><a name="80422-0019.htm_para6"><a name="0804236000017">I told my pensioners at our public meeting in my constituency on the Saturday when many members of the team who have been working with the Government Front-Bench team on the issue were present&#151;people such as Peter and Jacquie Humphrey, Dave Allen and Ros Altmann&#151;that we must examine the small print. I am worried not by the Front-Bench team who are present, but by their paymasters in the Treasury, who have always worried me and who have frankly been holding this back for many years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o419"><a name="80422-0019.htm_para7"><a name="0804236000018">I am pleased that the Secretary of State has promised to write to me about the two points I raised in my intervention. Perhaps he would be kind enough to write to me about a couple of others, too. The first relates to pensioners who should have been getting their pension but who had to receive benefits because the FAS has not paid out. Will the Government guarantee&#151;will the Secretary of State guarantee this to me in writing, if necessary&#151;that benefits paid to pensioners in schemes while they have been waiting will not be claimed back? It seems obvious that they would not be, but successive Governments have often claimed back moneys paid in benefits when people have received compensation. That often happens in respect of injury compensation where people have been on income support. <i> [Interruption.] </i>I am sorry that Members on the Government Front Bench are not willing to listen to a debate in which some of us have participated for seven hours, but if they could bear with us for a few more minutes, they would then be able to go off to the bar and have a laugh. This is a serious matter. Many people are worried about whether they will have to pay back the benefits. There is a track record of that happening, and I seek assurances from the Government that that will not happen to these pensioners.</p>

My constituent Dave Cheshire died about two and half years ago and his widow, Marlene Cheshire, does not know what will happen. If the claimants had still been alive, they would receive the full compensation package, but their widows may be in a difficult situation. When the Secretary of State was the Minister of State, he met a delegation of widows from all over the country and he promised to look at the situation then, but it is still a big issue now and of grave concern.</p>

worried about how much money they will get from the scheme. They want to know whether they can enter the scheme early because they are disabled. It is a technical point, but it is important. If they are not available for work because they are disabled, can they enter the scheme early or do they have to wait for the full version?</p>

The Secretary of State mentioned 12 million people who could join the scheme, but they will not go anywhere near it if they do not have any trust in it. I have been canvassing in the London elections and it is an issue on the doorstep. People are concerned about their futures and whether they can trust anybody with their pension schemes, especially with the banks and the current credit squeeze.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o424"><a name="80422-0019.htm_para12"><a name="0804236000023">Many people who lost trust in traditional pension schemes, especially when the occupational schemes started to be wound up, looked to investment in property. A crisis is happening there, alongside the crisis of confidence in the pension scheme. In the eloquent words of Ros Altmann, who was a Government adviser before she helped the occupational pension scheme groups, we have a pension crisis today that could well become a pensioner crisis tomorrow, unless we address the issue of confidence in the pension system.</p>

They have been the driving force on this issue, but&#151;as Conservative Front Benchers have said today&#151;we have heard it all before from both Labour and Conservative Governments. They have claimed that whatever they are proposing is the panacea to the pension problem and will mean that more people will have a decent pension. However, even if this scheme works, we will not solve the problem unless we address the issue of means-testing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o426"><a name="80422-0019.htm_para14"><a name="0804236000025">Earlier on, we heard of the millions of people whom the actuaries assumed would not take up the means-tested benefits. The Minister of State said that he had written numerous times to those who had been pinpointed as the sort of people who should be getting pension credit. After writing a third or fourth time, the Government should take the hint: those people will never apply for pension credit. They see it as a handout and as taboo, and they would be ashamed to claim it. There is no other reason why they should fail to claim it, if the Government have written to them&#151;<i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> Ministers are googling away on the Government Front Bench, but if they had listened to the debate they would have heard about the thousands of pensioners who do not take up the pension credit because they see it as a stigma to do so. It is not because of the complicated forms; that is a certain area. It is not because they have not been informed enough; that is a certain area. There are whole areas of this country where pensioners will not take up the credit because they feel that they are going cap in hand. We should have a link to earnings, which should come forward now.

 I welcome the new Children and Young Persons Bill, which aims to reform the statutory framework for the care system and to ensure that children and young people receive high quality care and support. The Bill also aims to improve the outcomes for children in care compared with those of their peers and to improve placement stability. I want to focus tonight on a crucial tool for helping to improve outcomes for children in care and the quality of inspections of children&#146;s homes. I have felt strongly about the importance of robust inspection for many years, ever since I was a social worker in the 1980s. In 1984, I introduced a ten-minute Bill to ensure that children&#146;s homes of fewer than four children were properly registered, which they were not in those days.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o446"><a name="80422-0019.htm_para34"><a name="0804236000051">There are about 6,500 children in children&#146;s homes and hostels in England, which is 11 per cent. of the total number of children. The latest data show that those children tend to be older&#151;14 per cent. are aged 10 to 15 years and 23 per cent. are 16 and over. Many of them have complex needs and display challenging behaviour. If we are to improve outcomes for them, it is all the more important that we have high quality care. We need rigorous inspections of children&#146;s homes so that poorly run homes can be made to improve or close. It is only with a good care environment that young people will achieve better educational outcomes. Without the support of their corporate parents, that will not be possible. That means not only the social worker but the care home.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o447"><a name="80422-0019.htm_para35"><a name="0804236000052">I welcome the measures in the Children and Young Persons Bill to enable registration authorities to issue compliance notices to children&#146;s home providers who are failing to meet required standards, and to impose a notice preventing new admissions to an establishment where they are deemed inappropriate. That will make it easier to enforce minimum standards. In order to get to the stage of taking action against homes, however, we need more rigorous inspection regimes to be introduced. We have to ensure that children&#146;s homes provide the standards of care necessary to improve outcomes for the children looked after.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o448"><a name="80422-0019.htm_para36"><a name="0804236000053">All children&#146;s homes are required to be registered under the Care Standards Act 2000. Ofsted is now responsible for the inspection of children&#146;s homes, having taken over the role from the Commission for Social Care Inspection in April 2007. Children&#146;s homes are subject to detailed statutory regulations and national minimum standards. The framework for inspection reports is the five outcomes in Every Child Matters, which formed the basis of the Children Act 2004. The five outcomes by which children&#146;s homes are inspected are being healthy, staying safe, enjoying and achieving, making a contribution and achieving economic well-being. I believe that particularly in relation to children&#146;s welfare and running away, some of the minimum care standards and how they translate to the five Every Child Matters outcomes are too general. That can lead to inspection reports that do not show the forensic detail that is needed.</p>

<notus-date day="22" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><b>22 Apr 2008 : Column 1287</b><br>

<p><a name="stpa_o449"><a name="80422-0020.htm_para0"><a name="0804236000054">I became interested in inspections after I was recently alerted by my local community safety team in Stockport to concerns that it had about what it saw as the inadequacies of Ofsted inspection reports on some children&#146;s homes in my constituency. The team had catalogued numerous instances of problems involving children at the homes, and felt that the inspection reports did not reflect the true picture of what was actually going on there. The team provided me with evidence of large numbers of children running away, going missing, repeat offending and committing assaults and criminal damage, which was not reflected in the reports under any of the general inspection headings. That antisocial behaviour was causing problems for local residents living near the homes, and the team was worried that if the incidents were not being highlighted, other agencies could not provide the interventions needed to help the young people involved to correct their behaviour.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o450"><a name="80422-0020.htm_para1"><a name="0804236000055">Stockport has a very high number of children and young people placed in our children&#146;s homes from other local authority areas. Indeed, 53 per cent. of all looked-after children in Stockport are from out of the borough, compared with a national average of 35 per cent. Many of the young people who were causing problems and had attracted the attention of the community safety team had been exported into Stockport from outside the borough. I am pleased that the new Children and Young Persons Bill addresses that problem and is intended to limit out-of-authority placements.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o451"><a name="80422-0020.htm_para2"><a name="0804236000056">I decided to apply for reports of 10 children&#146;s homes in Stockport from Ofsted, to check for myself the quality of inspections. The first problem that I encountered was getting hold of a copy of the reports, which were not available on the Ofsted website. I applied for them and received a letter saying that my request was being dealt with under the Freedom of Information Act 2000. I objected, and of course I was immediately supplied with the reports, but my point is that they are not easily accessible.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o452"><a name="80422-0020.htm_para3"><a name="0804236000057">As I have said, I had detailed statistics about the many incidents of children going missing and about assaults and criminal damage in and around those homes, committed by the residents, yet those statistics were not reflected in the reports. Even without that important information, four of the homes were officially classed as &#147;inadequate&#148;, three as &#147;satisfactory&#148; and only three as &#147;good&#148;. My point is that the reports contained no context or overview about how often children were getting into trouble or going missing. Without that, we cannot truly assess whether the care provided by the homes helps to manage or stabilise the behaviour of young people, or whether the homes are meeting the standards for safeguarding children under the Every Child Matters criteria. It cannot be right, for example, that the inspection report into one Stockport home failed to mention that one young person had run away 89 times. Another report did not mention that there had been 69 cases of residents going missing, six assaults and 31 incidents of criminal damage nearby.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o453"><a name="80422-0020.htm_para4"><a name="0804236000058">Under the regulations, the home should promote and make proper provision for the welfare of children, as well as for the care, education and supervision and, where appropriate, the treatment of children accommodated there.

records of all incidents of absconding and the reasons given by the child for running away. However, there is no requirement for those incidents to be included in the inspection reports and so they are not being reflected under the staying safe criterion. I think that they should be.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o454"><a name="80422-0020.htm_para5"><a name="0804236000059">I am particularly concerned that three of the homes in Stockport&#151;all managed by the same organisation&#151;were given notice to improve last year and were classed as &#147;inadequate&#148;. Since then, two of those three homes have been inspected again and have now been classed as &#147;satisfactory&#148;. However, it is not clear to me what level of improvements have been made to warrant moving from a rating of &#147;inadequate&#148; to &#147;satisfactory&#148;. Again, the problem is that the inspection categories are too general.</p>

Since then, I have had a very helpful meeting with Michael Hart, Ofsted&#146;s children&#146;s director, and Andrew Mercer, an assistant divisional manager in the children's directorate. They assured me they had taken on board my concerns and would feed them into the on-going review of national minimum standards for children&#146;s homes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o459"><a name="80422-0020.htm_para10"><a name="0804236000064">I am also grateful to the Minister for allowing me the opportunity to raise some of those concerns at a recent meeting. I want, through this debate, to put my concerns on the record, together with what I hope will be his positive response to them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o460"><a name="80422-0020.htm_para11"><a name="0804236000065">I believe that a number of steps can be taken to improve inspections. The first point that I raised was the importance of the reports being made more freely available. I would like to see them published as a matter of course on the Ofsted website, and I understand that Ofsted is now consulting on that. At the moment, the inspection reports only go as a matter of course to the owner of the home, whether local authority or private. I believe that they should go as a matter of course to the placing authority, to the authority in which the home operates, and also to the schools and agencies responsible for tackling crime and disorder in the area. If a home is deemed to be inadequate, the placing authority should put its reasons for continuing the placements on the child&#146;s record.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o461"><a name="80422-0020.htm_para12"><a name="0804236000066">I would also like statistics to be published that show the number of homes and their inspection categories, so that we can see the impact of inspections in improving standards&#151;just as happens with the school league tables. If local agencies have a responsibility for dealing with the behaviour and education of all looked-after children in their area, they should also be aware of the quality of care being provided.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o462"><a name="80422-0020.htm_para13"><a name="0804236000067">I want the reports to be better informed, with inspectors seeking the views of local agencies such as crime reduction partnerships, community safety teams and schools in advance of their visits. I accept the usefulness of random visits but I also feel that, if the police and schools were consulted on their views about the homes and the activities of residents before the visits, the reports would be better informed and consequently more useful. Also, it would encourage homes to work more co-operatively with local agencies if they knew that those agencies would be asked for their views in inspection reports.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o463"><a name="80422-0020.htm_para14"><a name="0804236000068">Does the Minister agree that as part of the inspection process, it would be a good idea to invite comments from local crime reduction partnerships, community safety teams and other agencies about antisocial behaviour, offending and running away by young people in such homes to help inform the inspection reports? Does he also agree that it would be useful if schools were consulted about the level of support that care homes provide to pupils, the amount of communication between teachers and care home staff, and the performance of pupils in care?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o464"><a name="80422-0020.htm_para15"><a name="0804236000069">I suggest that the national minimum care standards be updated so that inspection reports contain a summary and proper evaluation of all incidents of running away, assaults and criminal damage. That would enable placing authorities better to evaluate the control mechanisms in place in the home, so that they can manage behaviour and assess whether the home properly met the staying safe criterion.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o465"><a name="80422-0020.htm_para16"><a name="0804236000070">I pay tribute to my hon. Friend the Member for Warrington, North (Helen Jones) for all her hard work on the all-party group on runaway and missing children. As secretary of that group, I know that many of the 100,000 children who go missing every year come to some harm. One in six is forced to sleep rough or with strangers, and one in 12 is harmed. I would therefore argue that incidents in which children go missing from children&#146;s homes should be recorded under the staying safe criterion of the inspection reports. I know that when some children go missing, they are just staying out late at a friend&#146;s house, but for others the result is more serious. We must find a way of assessing the seriousness of &#147;missing&#148; incidents and why they happened.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o466"><a name="80422-0020.htm_para17"><a name="0804236000071">I am concerned that, owing to the way in which inspection reports are structured, they are not effective tools for achieving minimum standards or improving standards. If we are to improve outcomes for looked-after children, we must not only enforce minimum standards but use inspection reports to drive up standards. Ofsted inspections have been a vital tool in doing that in our schools, but if care standards are to be effective in improving standards in our children&#146;s homes, they need to be more prescriptive in what is taken into account in the inspection, need to include other agencies&#146; observations, and must be widely published and available.</p>

 I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Stockport (Ann Coffey) on securing this debate, and thank her for the great interest that she takes in the subject. It is a long-standing interest, as she pointed out; she first introduced a Bill on the subject in the House in 1984. As she said, she recently met representatives from Ofsted to discuss her concerns. I am glad that that was a positive meeting. I, too, met her recently to discuss what can be done to improve outcomes for young people in care. I also thank her for her welcome for the Children and Young Persons Bill, which will come before the Commons shortly, having had its journey through the House of Lords, and having been broadly welcomed across the sector for the improvements that it tries to make.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o467"><a name="80422-0020.htm_para18"><a name="0804236000073">Of course, for a child to succeed in life, they need a stable home life, a safe place to go, significant adults taking a real interest in their life, and a strong sense of family. In short, they need to be cared about, and not just cared for. It is imperative that we focus all our efforts on trying to create that environment for children who do not live with their birth families. My hon. Friend raised a number of important points on the inspection of care homes, both tonight and in her meetings with me and with Ofsted. She mentioned that she has received information relating to specific care homes in her area and has concerns about them. I cannot refer to the specifics of her concerns about those homes, for obvious reasons, but she also raised some wider points that result from those concerns, and I hope that I can address those points.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o468"><a name="80422-0020.htm_para19"><a name="0804236000074">I will first try to answer some of the questions that my hon. Friend asked towards the end of her speech. First, on the involvement of other agencies in the inspection process, I understand her concerns about the fact that where the behaviour of children in children&#146;s homes is unacceptable and affects the surrounding community, inspection reports should reflect that, and should, as far as possible, take account of information that is available locally. Obviously, that has to be balanced with the need to take a proportionate approach to inspections. Most importantly, those commissioning places in residential provision must have the right information on which to base placement decisions, and must make sure that the placements are right for the children and young people in question.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o469"><a name="80422-0020.htm_para20"><a name="0804236000075">To achieve that, the Department is currently supporting the development of standardised contracts for local authorities to use when commissioning services, including in relation to provision in children&#146;s homes. The national framework contract for the placement of children in children&#146;s homes is underpinned by a number of performance indicators, including some relating to crime and offending behaviour among children placed in the home. The majority of local authorities are already using these contracts and over time they will start to provide the invaluable information that my hon. Friend is looking for, helping to drive up the quality of care.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o470"><a name="80422-0020.htm_para21"><a name="0804236000076">My hon. Friend asked about consultation with schools about the support provided to pupils living in care homes. That is a well-made point. In their role as corporate parents, local authorities and the services that they use have a vital part to play in supporting the education of looked-after children. The national minimum  <br>

standards that she mentioned highlight that point and set out clearly the steps that providers should be taking to make it a reality. For example, children should have a personal education plan setting out a record of their achievements, needs and aspirations, and they should be given access to appropriate educational facilities. The plan should include the names of staff responsible for liaising with schools and other appropriate bodies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o471"><a name="80422-0020.htm_para22"><a name="0804236000077">The national contract for children&#146;s homes that I mentioned covers education and includes detailed indicators designed to provide commissioning authorities with information about a home&#146;s performance with regard to the education of the children placed there. I would be happy to consider what more could be done to address my hon. Friend&#146;s concerns.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o472"><a name="80422-0020.htm_para23"><a name="0804236000078">My hon. Friend suggested a pilot to collate information from other agencies in advance of inspection. That is an interesting and innovative suggestion, and I see no reason why that could not happen. I know that she has been in touch with Ofsted to explore the benefits of collating information in advance of inspection.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o473"><a name="80422-0020.htm_para24"><a name="0804236000079">My hon. Friend also asked about recording incidents of young people missing from care as part of the inspection process. In her role as part of the all-party group in Parliament, she will know that a cross-departmental working group is looking into the issue of missing children. As part of a programme of work to deliver the &#147;Care Matters&#148; agenda and improve young people&#146;s quality of care, we will be revising the existing guidance on children missing from care, and including its requirements as part of our plan to update and re-issue guidance to the Children Act 1989 and subsequent legislation. That will provide us with the opportunity to integrate the guidance on children missing from care homes into this important new revised guidance and at the same time consider whether we need to provide more detail about managing support for especially vulnerable groups, such as potentially trafficked children, to minimise the likelihood of their going missing from their care placement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o474"><a name="80422-0020.htm_para25"><a name="0804236000080">For young people in care, selecting their provision will probably be one of the most important decisions affecting their lives, so when those decisions are made, they must reflect the young person&#146;s best interests, be conducted in a timely manner and assure a high level of quality in the provision that will be received. All those commitments were highlighted in the &#147;Care Matters&#148; White Paper.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o475"><a name="80422-0020.htm_para26"><a name="0804236000081">Clear planning processes for local authorities, rigorous inspection and enforcement processes, to which my hon. Friend referred, and a world-class care system will be the keys to success. We have already announced a number of measures to support care planning, including drawing together the care planning requirements into a single set of regulations. We will also issue accompanying guidance as part of the revision of the Children Act 1989 statutory guidance. Furthermore, we are piloting regional commissioning arrangements, to support local authorities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o476"><a name="80422-0020.htm_para27"><a name="0804236000082">To ensure that care placements are of a consistently high quality and not just the luck of the draw, the  <br>

national minimum standards are being revised as part of a wider review. As my hon. Friend rightly points out, those standards must be adhered to and maintained, with swift and decisive action if a service is underperforming. It is important that those processes are transparent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o477"><a name="80422-0020.htm_para28"><a name="0804236000083">In that context, I turn to my hon. Friend&#146;s concerns about the accessibility of children&#146;s homes inspection reports. Although social care inspection reports are available on the website of the chief inspector and the Office for Standards in Education, Children&#146;s Services and Skills, reports relating to children&#146;s homes are excluded. The reason given for that is preventing the identification of young people in residential care and ensuring that people accessing the internet with malign intentions are prevented from acquiring their address or any other personal details. While the existing legislative framework does not prevent the publication of children&#146;s homes reports, certain information is excluded, such as the address of the children&#146;s home. As my hon. Friend has mentioned, the chief inspector will shortly launch a consultation to seek the views of children, service providers and local authorities on whether children&#146;s homes reports should be published on the Ofsted website. It is important that the views of the Members of Parliament, such as my hon. Friend, are taken into account in that consultation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o478"><a name="80422-0020.htm_para29"><a name="0804236000084">Finally, we must support care staff in their roles. When I speak to young people in my role, they tell me time and again that what really makes a difference is the people who work with them and the quality of their relationships with significant adults. My Department is working closely with the Children&#146;s Workforce Development Council to develop a clear set of standards for residential care staff, which will set out the core skills that they should attain within an agreed and appropriate time scale. That will build on the CWDC&#146;s successful work, which has been funded by my Department, to develop standards for foster carers, with the expectation that those standards are met within a year of their being approved. Not only will that model help to ensure consistently high standards across the residential care system, but it will delineate clear progression paths and career development for residential care staff.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o479"><a name="80422-0020.htm_para30"><a name="0804236000085">To strengthen the quality of relationships between care staff and young people, we will test the effectiveness of social pedagogy as a method of giving professionals extra skills to improve the quality of care they provide to children&#151;an approach with which my hon. Friend is familiar and which has worked well on the continent. The pilot will run over the next three years, and we will look closely at the results to see whether we should encourage the approach more widely.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o480"><a name="80422-0020.htm_para31"><a name="0804236000086">I am confident that, through clear direction from central and local government, rigorous and transparent inspection processes and a world class children&#146;s work force, we will achieve excellence for all children in care, which we are all aiming for. I thank my hon. Friend for her commitment on the subject, and I know that she will hold us to account in that important task.</p>
