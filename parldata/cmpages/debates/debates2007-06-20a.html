 Experiencing pregnancy in the early years of life profoundly affects the resulting child&#146;s life chances. The family nurse partnership pilots, which are based on the extremely successful US nurse family partnership scheme, will help to improve parental and child outcomes through structured and intensive home visiting to mothers from early pregnancy until the child is aged two.

The pilots are currently being evaluated at Birkbeck college, and we anticipate that that will be a two-year programme.

 The nurse family partnership is one of a panoply of pilots from the Cabinet Office. As the right hon. Lady prepares to leave office, does she think that that multiplicity of pilots has contributed usefully to tackling social exclusion, or does she think that the fact that Britain is more unequal and that the lot ofthe very poorest has got worse since 1997 suggests that, for all the Government rhetoric, the reality of life for the most socially excluded has got little better during her time in office?</p>

 For many hundreds of thousands of children life has got better, because of the success of universal programmes such as Sure Start, improvements in education, the introduction of tax credits and changes to child benefit. There have been significant improvements for many children. We are the first Government to seek to identify and work with those who have simply not got to the starting gate in the past. Because no one has done that successfully in the past, the right thing to do is to pilot programmes to find out what works, which means that we will be better able to persuade taxpayers that we are using their money effectively in helping families to turn around their circumstances.</p>

 My hon. Friend anticipates the work that is going on across Government leading upto the comprehensive spending review. I have had enormous support from colleagues across Government for this particular programme. There is real interest, and many people want to visit the pilots and find out about it. One of the reasons why we are evaluating it so carefully is that our circumstances are different from those in the United States, because we already have universal services. I see that progressive universalism as a way to tackle problems. If we can make savings, we will secure the future of the programme for a long time to come.</p>

That is why we are going to evaluate things well in this country. I hope that the hon.

 As I have just explained to the right hon.

We must therefore take this temporary measure, but let us be absolutely clear: the reason there are more people in prison than ever before is that under this Government there are tougher sentences&#151;particularly for violent and dangerous criminals&#151;and there are 20,000 more prison places. We are now going to build an extra9,500 places on top of that. Most important of all, crime has fallen under this Government as a result of the measures that we have taken.

It has gone up, and his party voted against the Budget measure that introduced that. On the reasons for introducing this measure, we have said again and again that it is important that we make sure that we deal with violent and sexual offenders most severely. That is why there are 3,000 people in prison today on indeterminate sentences. If the right hon. Gentleman&#146;s party had had its way, those people would not be there.</p>

Some &#163;30 million was made available and those defences are being constructed.

Since 1997, we have invested some &#163;4 billion in coastal defences. This is an indication of how, over time, as a result of the changing climate, countries will have to invest very large sums in protecting ourselves against the changing weather.

I mentioned a few moments ago the more than 5,000 people who have been recalled to prison as a result of the breach of their licensing conditions. In 1997, that figure was around 200. People out on parole would breach their conditions, but nothing would happen to them&#151;now it does, and that is one reason why the most serious violent crime has fallen by more than 20 per cent. in the last year. In the crime partnership areas where crime has been highest, specific focus has been put on 44 of them and crime, especially violent crime, has fallen by 7 per cent. or more in the last year in those areas.

Personally, I do not believe the way to do so is to try to ban domestic travel on aeroplanes, as I think some people in the hon. Gentleman&#146;s party have suggested. I do not think that is realistic.</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o29"><a name="70620-0004.htm_para0"><a name="07062049000164">Disability benefits are complex and convoluted; they are not something that any rational person would want to spend a huge amount of time trying to understand unless they had to do so, but 6 million disabled people in the UK have to do just that, including up to 400,000 families with disabled children. For them, the benefit system is simultaneously a lifeline and a nightmare. I suggest to the House that it is time we did better.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o30"><a name="70620-0004.htm_para1"><a name="07062049000165">I will not test Members&#146; patience by going into enormous detail about the complicated differences in eligibility criteria for the disability living allowance,the attendance allowance, the disabled facilities grant, the community equipment fund, the carer&#146;s allowance, the independent living fund, the industrial injuries disablement benefit and incapacity benefit. I wondered whether the complexity of the system might be a function of the complexity of disability itself; but why, when we spend &#163;26 billion annually on benefits for disabled people, are there so many complaints?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o31"><a name="70620-0004.htm_para2"><a name="07062049000166">There are complaints from taxpayers who, despite the fact that they want their money used to support the most vulnerable people in society, constantly read stories in the media about disability benefits being claimed by people who are patently not disabled. There are also complaints from disabled people themselves, who all too often have to put up with a system thatlets them down, frustrates them and humiliates themby asking them to repeat information about their disability a thousand times over, squandering money on official error, waste and fraud, and all too often failing to reach the very people it most needs to reach: those most at risk of falling into and becoming trapped in poverty.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o32"><a name="70620-0004.htm_para3"><a name="07062049000167">In my research, I discovered that most unusual of things in modern politics: a relatively simple solution that does not cost any money. I will return to that later, but first let me give the House an example of the crazy complexity of the current system. A couple of weeks ago, I met a man who, a few years earlier, had been going to the shops with his daughter. He was walking along his local high street when a car careered off the road and crashed into him. He was carried some distance. Fortunately, his daughter was unharmed, although she had severe psychological trauma, but he ended up in a coma and when he came round he had an acquired brain injury. As a result, he was unable to continue with his job. Someone in that situation is eligible for up to eight different benefits. If he were to apply for them all, he would have to answer a total of 1,275 questions over 352 pages.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o33"><a name="70620-0004.htm_para4"><a name="07062049000168">Let me put that in context. An A-level studentdoing maths, physics and chemistry has to answer510 questions. Someone applying to do a masters in law at Harvard has to answer 54 questions. So, our welfare state, which is supposed to be the pinnacle of a civilised society, makes a man with an acquired brain injury answer more questions than our brightest  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="20 Jun 2007">

<notus-date day="20" month="6" year="2007" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>20 Jun 2007 : Column 1380</b><br>
A-level students or our most ambitious lawyers.That cannot be right. I wondered whether, because disabilities are complicated, we needed to ask all those questions, but in fact 80 per cent. of the questions are repeated. A third of the questions are repeated twice and a quarter are repeated four times. Think not about the waste of employing Department for Work and Pensions officials to process the same information over and over again. Think not about how that money could be put to much better use. Think instead of the man with an acquired brain injury and the signal that this sends to him about our willingness as a society to help him piece his life together. Think also of those parents who discover that they have a child with severe disabilities and the signal it sends to them that we ask them to answer more questions than if they were applying for a mortgage, a credit card or a bank account.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o34"><a name="70620-0004.htm_para5"><a name="07062049000169">The most pernicious outcome of the complexity is not the frustration that it causes disabled people; it is the fact that it makes it so difficult for them to get back into the world of work. All the benefits have different rules about how much work someone is and is not allowed to do. On incapacity benefit and carer&#146;s allowance, one can earn &#163;87 a week. On income support, it is &#163;20 a week. On housing benefit, after&#163;20 a week, a person&#146;s benefit is deducted at a marginal rate of 65 per cent. On council tax benefit, it is 20 per cent. The result is that for many disabled people the simplest and safest thing is not to work. That leads on to another problem: poverty. We know that, according to the Government&#146;s preferred measure, child poverty is increasing. A third of parents of disabled children say that they are put off from applying for the disability living allowance because of the complexity of the application form.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o35"><a name="70620-0004.htm_para6"><a name="07062049000170">My Bill will not solve all those problems at a stroke, but it will transform the lives of hundreds of thousands of disabled people by requiring the Department for Work and Pensions to get its computer systems to talk to each other, so that, if a disabled person consents to it, they need only supply information about their disability once and that can be used across all the different benefit streams. Every year, the Department for Work and Pensions processes 7.2 billion questions from disability benefit applicants. Nearly 6 billion of those are repeated questions. This measure will save money in administration costs, but, more importantly, it will save huge frustration and aggravation for disabled people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o36"><a name="70620-0004.htm_para7"><a name="07062049000171">The Government do not have a good record on technology projects. However, that should not obscure the fact that technology can transform the lives ofthe most socially disadvantaged. Why should the IT revolution benefit only the BlackBerry generation of adults or the MySpace generation of children? Why should it not benefit disabled people as well?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o37"><a name="70620-0004.htm_para8"><a name="07062049000172">We cannot remove people&#146;s impairments, but we can remove the obstacles that the state needlessly and carelessly puts in their way that make it more difficult for them to find a job, to live independently, or to hold their family together. Only once should disabled people have to supply information about their disability, unless or until that disability changes. Only once should a family with a disabled child have to supply information about that child&#146;s disability, unless or until that  <br>

 I returned yesterday from the General Affairs Council. Tomorrow and on Friday, the Prime Minister and I will attend the European Council, which is the final summit of the German presidency. Discussions at the General Affairs Council were wide-ranging. In that, they reflected the pivotal role that working with and through the European Union plays in meeting the domestic and foreign policy priorities of this country. Not least of the subjects discussed was the ongoing and extremely difficult situation in the Palestinian occupied territories. I expect that the topics covered by the European Council and included in the final conclusions will be equally broad. If I may, I will return to some of them a little later.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o42"><a name="70620-0004.htm_para13"><a name="07062049000178">There is no doubt that the main issue at stake at this European Council will be treaty reform.

Member for Richmond, Yorks (Mr. Hague) said that he hoped that I would enjoy his speech because he feared that I would hear it on a number of occasions, since such debates tended to be attended by the same people and to have almost exactly the same content.

The report of the discussions that the German presidency produced last Thursday showed there were still significant differences among European countries about what those next steps could or should be. In the next two days, Europe&#146;s leaders will be looking for a way to reconcile those differences.</p>

We want greater efficiency and more accountability. We want more say for national Parliaments and Governments. Above all, we want a European Union that takes action where it is needed, on issues like climate security, economic reform and energy, and leaves national Governments in charge of key areas including taxes, foreign policy, defence and the domestic economy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o46"><a name="70620-0004.htm_para17"><a name="07062049000186">In short, we want a European Union that delivers jobs, security, growth and influence in a globalised world&#151;a Europe that helps equip citizens in every member state to meet the challenges of, and to thrive in, the 21st century.

<p><a name="stpa_o47"><a name="70620-0004.htm_para18"><a name="07062049000187">Let no one be in doubt that the reason we place so much emphasis on taking the right decisions over the next two days is nothing to do with the blocking tactics that we have seen in previous years. It is the exact opposite. We want a strong and effective Europe, but we want one that is focused on delivering results, not building bureaucracy. So let me be clear on some of the specific issues that we are likely to have to resolve over the next two days.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o48"><a name="70620-0004.htm_para19"><a name="07062049000188">We support a charter of fundamental rights that brings together existing rights found in the European convention on human rights, current EC treaties and other instruments. We support qualified majority voting to unlock decision making in those areas where it is in Britain&#146;s interest. Despite ridiculous claims that are sometimes made that no change at all must be made, let me remind the House that it was Lady Thatcher who first gave up the veto, and that under her, qualified majority voting was extended to 12 articles, and under her successor, John Major, to 30&#151;three zero&#151;policy areas. I do not criticise them for those changes. They made them because they knew that sometimes it was and is in Britain&#146;s interest to do so when, for example, change that we in the House may all believe is wanted and needed might otherwise be blocked by those who resist that change.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o49"><a name="70620-0004.htm_para20"><a name="07062049000189">We are in favour of a Europe-wide response bothto organised crime and to international terrorism. I imagine that that, again, is common ground across the House. In fact, more than that, we think a Europe-wide response is a vital necessity, but we are equally clear that any EU initiatives should not affect fundamental aspects of our criminal justice system, should not undermine our ability to safeguard national security, and should not weaken control of our own borders.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o50"><a name="70620-0004.htm_para21"><a name="07062049000190">We believe in a common foreign and security policy that will boost our collective influence abroad, butnot in a single foreign policy. It must be based on consensus, by which I mean unanimity. We would support a reform of the Commission that promoted effectiveness, efficiency and strong leadership. We would like to see the subsidiarity mechanism in the current constitutional treaty proposals strengthened. We believe it will help us to find the best balance between action at regional, national and European levels, and in so doing will better connect Europe to its citizens. We would support a full-time Chair of the European Council with the same role and powers now  <br>

 For one thing, the very strong effort made by the Government over a considerable period of time, but made with particular strength in the run-up to the spring Council, to get the EU to agree to take a position well ahead of the pack in terms of energy and climate security, is exactly the kind of thing that reconnects the EU to the people of Europe. For a start, it is so clearly an area where no nation state acting alone can be effective, yet also an area that is of real concern to people when they think about their own future and that of their children.</p>

 On the subject of reconnection, do not we in this place have to look anew at how we debate EU proposals?

 My hon. Friend makes an interesting point. However, it might be rather more difficult to achieve than it sometimes sounds. I am reminded of the debate that always takes place, particularly around issues such as the environment, about whether this, that or the other policy area should be included, because surely this crosses them all. In the end, there is no substitute for having a Government and having different people who deal with the detail of what is being agreed, because otherwise we would get into considerable difficulty.</p>

 Even if we accept only part of what we have read in the media in the last few days, it is clear that the Government have a fight on their hands in defending this country&#146;s national interest in these negotiations. In those circumstances, was it not weakening our position for the Prime Minister to say that we would not be having a referendum on the results of these negotiations? Could we therefore conclude that, given that she isnow stretching out carefully the grounds where the Government are intent on not giving way, if they are forced to do so in the negotiations, the British people will be able to reconnect with the Government and in Europe in having a say in what happens?</p>

 I understand the logic of myright hon. Friend&#146;s comments. If we are able to agree an amending treaty, that will be a considerable achievement. For many member states it is a source of considerable discomfort that, having ratified a proposed constitutional treaty and having explained to their electorates&#151;and in the case of the Spanish Government having had a referendum in whichthey succeeded in obtaining the approval of their electorate&#151;that this was to their advantage, they may then have to go back to their people and say that there will not be a new constitution for Europe, but that there will be, as there has been in the past, an amending treaty. That would be no easier for them than it would be for us to say that we will go ahead with a constitutional treaty even though it has once been rejected.</p>

Secondly&#151;I hope that the right hon. Gentleman will sympathise with this argument, which I feel quite strongly about&#151;I see no reason whatever why we should have had a string of amending treaties from Conservative Governments that never attracted a referendum, no matter how much they extended, for example, qualified majority voting, but a Labour Government are somehow not allowed to do it.</p>

 The Foreign Secretary has stated that she campaigned against ratification in 1975. I was only three years old at the time, so I was unable to vote against it. Millions of people in this country under the age of 40 have never had a say over changes to our relationship with Europe.

 It was only because of a Labour Government that anyone had a chance to vote.

that I have described would not involve a decision on anything like the scale of the decision in 1972, which the British people endorsed in 1975.

We made it clear that our priority was not internal institutional wrangling, but the challenges of globalisation&#151;climate change, energy security, jobs and growth.

We have, for the first time, European security and defence policy missions beyond Europe&#146;s borders. We have, as I said, bold action on climate security and energy security.

Nevertheless, as she acknowledged at the beginning of her speech, matters have now moved on sufficiently in European affairs that we have all had to prepare a new speech for this occasion. Very important things may be about to happen in the European Union over the next few days. Tomorrow, the European Union&#146;s Heads of State and Government meet to try to negotiate a treaty of fundamental importance to the EU&#146;s future. The European constitution, which was emphatically and rightly rejected by French and Dutch voters two years ago, is in many substantial senses being revived. That constitution was, as the Belgian Prime Minister put it at the time, the &#147;capstone&#148; of a &#147;federal...state&#148;. The German Europe Minister of the time said that it was the</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o75"><a name="70620-0006.htm_para1"><a name="07062049000262">If the Government accept parts of that constitution under another guise, let us be clear that they risk taking another significant step away from what the European Union ought to be&#151;a community of nations working together intimately for mutual benefit&#151;and towards the integrated state that some in Europe honestly wish for, but that has never been the desired goal of the people of Britain.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o76"><a name="70620-0006.htm_para2"><a name="07062049000263">The Government&#146;s response to the efforts of other Governments to revive the constitution has been, in our view, truly extraordinary. As French and German leaders have proclaimed their views and sherpas have rushed round EU capitals, our Government have spent a great deal of time denying that any negotiations have been taking place. That has demonstrated neither forethought nor leadership. After the constitution&#146;s rejection there was, understandably&#151;the Foreign Secretary referred to it&#151;a pause for reflection. There has since been a debate about Europe&#146;s future to which the Government have made no notable contribution over the past two years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o77"><a name="70620-0006.htm_para3"><a name="07062049000264">I believe that this will go down in history as one of the great wasted opportunities for Britain to set the terms of debate on Europe&#146;s future. The federalists had seen their great achievement&#151;a constitution for Europe, to which this Government agreed&#151;rejected by the voters. It was clear that the goal of ever closer political union was out of tune with what many of the peoples of Europe wanted. That was the time for British leadership to push for the only model of European Union that can work for all of Europe in the long term&#151;a flexible, open Europe. It was time to look again at some failing policies.</p>

Enlargement has profoundly changed the dynamics of the European Union. Countries such as the Czech Republic and Poland do not want ever closer political union; they have been calling for a different direction. In the Netherlands, political leaders have reflected deeply on the referendum result and the relationship between the European Union and the nation state. Yet instead of taking the lead, the Government have buried their head in the sand for most of the past two years. On Sunday, the Foreign Secretary said on the BBC that she now finds the prospect of the summit &#147;nerve-wracking&#148;&#151;not something to strike terror into other  <br>

 Now we know that conversations have taken place, but they are distinct from negotiations in the Foreign Secretary&#146;s world.

My right hon. Friend refers to conversations and discussions, but we require action.

 That is another thing that people may seek. I do not claim that the Government have achieved nothing.

 The shadow Foreign Secretary has made much of an open Europe policy, which devolves power downwards. Does he accept that there are instances when power should be centred in Europe and that the way to build a new Europe is on an agenda such as climate change, on which there is agreement in Europe that sovereignty sometimes needs to be given to a greater authority? That is the way to build a new Europe&#151;on an agenda of genuine issues rather than the theoretical basis with which the bureaucrats endlessly confront us.</p>

 In that vote, we simply recognised what we understand as the constitutional position, which the Prime Minister restated last week: that the House has ultimate sovereignty. However, it is not necessary to expand on that further today.</p>

The German presidency&#146;s approach was spelled out in the questionnaire that it sent to European capitals a few weeks ago. It referred to preserving the substance of the constitution while making the necessary presentational changes. Such an approach is a profound mistake. I think that the Foreign Secretary believes that it is a mistake. Asthe Laeken declaration in December 2001 recognised, the crucial question is how the EU can be brought closer to its peoples. There can be no surer way of worsening the democratic deficit and disconnection between EU institutions and peoples than ignoring the verdict of the voters.</p>

If people do not feel ownership over the EU, they will steadily turn against it, which would not be in Britain&#146;s or Europe&#146;s interest. Further political integration must have the people&#146;s permission. In our view, political integration has already gone too far.

That is why, if there is a new treaty that transfers competences from Britain to the EU by bringing back parts of the constitution, we are clear that there must be referendum.

Labour MPs voted for a referendum on that occasion, so the argument about consistency can be made either way. Secondly, I remind the Minister that the most important thing in the treaty was the provision to join the euro if the Government wished it in the future&#151;and on that, the Government of the time offereda referendum. Thirdly, I put it to the right hon.

Perhaps the Minister for Europe will be able to expand on it when he winds up the debate. The Prime Minister has said that there will not be a referendum on the treaty. The Foreign Secretary said a few days ago&#151;despite having stood on a manifesto promisinga referendum&#151;that she preferred a model of Government without referendums. I believe that she said yesterday to the Select Committee that we would be able to tell on Monday whether it would be necessary to have a referendum, but today she has said that the Government will not agree to anything that requires a referendum in their judgment, which means, of course, that it will not be necessary to work anything out on Monday.

It is wholly illogical to claim that a treaty does not require a referendum because it fails to pass the test of characteristics, and then be totally unable to say what that test is. That is wholly of a piece with the Government&#146;s utterly confused and disjointed approach to this matter.</p>

Now, the Prime Minister says, having agreed to the constitution then, that we do not need a constitution after all and that we must &#147;listen to the people&#148;, which apparently means not asking them what they think. We now find that the constitution, which he had described as a &#147;success for Britain&#148; now needs four &#147;major changes&#148;, without which Britain will veto the new treaty, although there is no explanation of why these red lines were apparently not a problem when the whole thing was negotiated the first time round.</p>

Never before have I known three chairmen of Select Committees, all from the governing party, express such strongly and similarly worded frustration over the Government&#146;s behaviour.

<p><a name="stpa_o99"><a name="70620-0007.htm_para7"><a name="07062049000317">Indeed, when the Foreign Secretary told the European Scrutiny Committee last week that</p>

That very day, the French President told reporters how he and the Prime Minister had agreed the basis of a new treaty and the German Foreign Minister informed MEPs in Brussels how near to a conclusion he had brought the talks. Was that position reached without the Foreign Office being involved in any negotiation of any kind? That is an alarming thought, if it is true.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o101"><a name="70620-0007.htm_para9"><a name="07062049000319">When the Prime Minister set out his so-called red lines on Monday, it was the first time that Parliament or the British public had heard what the Government&#146;s view was.

His remarks deserve serious scrutiny, because what he did not mention was more significant than what he did. He said nothing about the proposed permanent EU President, nothing about a single legal personality for the EU, nothing about the proposed primacy of EU law over our laws, and nothing about the hugely important points buried in the small print of the original constitution. He said that there would be no qualified majority voting on any provision that</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o105"><a name="70620-0007.htm_para13"><a name="07062049000323">So why not put the case earlier that the Foreign Secretary, evidently uncomfortably, had to put to Foreign Ministers a few nights ago? She put the case against qualified majority voting and against an EU Foreign Minister having a diplomatic service in the European Union. The Prime Minister also said that he would not accept a treaty that allowed the charter of fundamental rights to change UK law. But would it be acceptable to give the charter legal standing so that it could change EU law, which would ultimately affect this country? He said that he would not agree to give up our ability to control our common law and judicial and police systems. Does that mean that the veto over criminal justice will be kept and that, crucially, criminal justice will remain in the intergovernmental third pillar?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o106"><a name="70620-0007.htm_para14"><a name="07062049000324">It has taken weeks, while other Governments have staked out positions, proposed new articles and campaigned for their views, for our Government to set out their so-called red lines, four days before the summit itself. Those red lines turn out not only to be red herrings but, on examination, to prove to be so carefully phrased by the Prime Minister that he could sign up to an EU treaty that transferred substantial powers to the EU and enacted much of the constitution and yet not breach his four red lines. The Prime Minister could give the charter of fundamental rights legal standing, move criminal law to community control, and agree to a Foreign Minister in all but name with an EU external action service and European embassies, a permanent President of the Council, a common asylum policy, widespread extension of qualified majority voting elsewhere and a broadening of EU competence over employment policy&#151;and still say that his red lines had not been breached. Those so-called red lines in the sand are but chaff thrown up to con the British public that the Government want simply to defend the British national interest, when their central priority is to avoid holding a referendum at all costs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o107"><a name="70620-0007.htm_para15"><a name="07062049000325">The Foreign Secretary gave the game away whenshe said that any treaty that, in the Government&#146;s judgment, required a referendum would not be signed. The idea is that the great leader will go forward on behalf of the British public, and that we do not have to worry because he would not sign anything&#151;would he?&#151;that would require the people to trouble themselves with casting their vote. That is a patronising attitude towards the electorate and a breach of the Government&#146;s election promise.</p>

speeches on these subjects&#151;and I could go on about it at even greater length than I have been doing. However, the immediate issue at hand is what will happen tomorrow and on Friday at the summit.</p>

The Foreign Secretary has mentioned one or two of the relevant points. The Dutch Government have proposed giving national Parliaments the right to block legislation that breaches the principle of subsidiarity. For far too long, and to the deep frustration of many on both sides of this House, this important principle has had no proper enforcement mechanism. The Dutch proposal at least attempts to provide it with an effective one and we urge the Government to support it, and not just to treat it with sympathy, as the Foreign Secretary said a little while ago.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o109"><a name="70620-0007.htm_para17"><a name="07062049000329">The Czech Government have proposed a flexibility clause that would allow member states to return powers to national control where appropriate. For far too long, the EU has been a one-way ratchet, taking powers from member states but unable to return them. We hope that the Government will support the Czechs on that imaginative proposal. Perhaps they should have put forward the proposal with the Czechs and campaigned for it across Europe.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o110"><a name="70620-0007.htm_para18"><a name="07062049000330">The Government declare themselves neutral on the question of voting weights, but I am not sure that Ministers have entirely thought the German proposal through. In particular, the new system, with its exact correspondence between population and voting weight, will make it harder to admit large but poor countries into the European Union. Indeed, some suspect thatit was devised with that purpose in mind. Giventhe fundamental importance of the goal of Turkish membership of the EU, that area needs to be considered very carefully indeed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o111"><a name="70620-0007.htm_para19"><a name="07062049000331">However, the biggest omission of all by the Government is that they have missed the opportunity to say what I suspect the Foreign Secretary believes, namely, that we do not need a new treaty for Europe&#146;s countries to act together. It is simply not true that a Europe of 27 is not working with the old rules. As the Foreign Secretary has admitted, the EU is coping perfectly well without new rules.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o112"><a name="70620-0007.htm_para20"><a name="07062049000332">Yes, the Prime Minister should go to the summit saying that no deal is better than a bad deal&#151;but he should also have been saying for a long time that the time for political integration is over, and that the time to look outwards to the great challenges of global warming, global poverty and globalised competition must begin. The EU&#146;s focus should be on practical issues that matter&#151;a point made earlier by the right hon. Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field)&#151;such as success in the world trade round, going further with the single market and improving the emissions trading scheme to create long-term incentives for businessto invest in green technology. Those should be the priorities and we do not need a treaty to accomplish them, as the Foreign Secretary has made clear several times.</p>

As the Chair of the European Scrutiny Committee, I believe that we have made remarkable strides in the past two years. Perhaps there was not a dialogue or a conversation, but there was certainly one-way traffic from those of us who did not think that the convention would bring in a proposal for a constitution, which was unnecessary, and that what should have been proposed was an amending treaty. That would have taken on the recommendation in the Laeken proposals to get closer to the people of Europe.</p>

There is now talk of an orange card being added to the yellow card. Anything better than a white card will suit me. The role of Parliaments should be strengthened with regard to the decisions that should be taken at this level under subsidiarity. I do not mind whether that involves repatriation on an item-by-item basis or a method of preventing the Commission from creeping&#151;a term I use often&#151;even further along with its proposals.</p>

It does need amendment, and he is wrong to think that an amending treaty is unnecessary.

Perhaps those who get tied up in European Council meetings also move increasingly close to the Commission&#146;s view. We must find a way of countering that, and the concept of a stronger card than a yellow card would deal with that. Clearly people went native on the convention, which was taken over by Giscard d&#146;Estaing and other powerful figures and members of the Commission. They produced a treaty for a constitution, which was not what we thought they were setting out to produce. That has since been repudiated by the members of the convention from this Parliament&#151;both the member representing the Opposition, who signed up to an amended treaty, and the member representing the Labour Benches. Questions have also been raised about whether the then Minister for Europe has doubts about what he signed up for.

People might want to read a good note in the Library about the concept of treaties. There is only really one treaty&#151;the treaty of Rome. Every other treaty has merely amended the treaty of Rome. Even the treaty of Amsterdam&#151;which changed all the numbering of the original treaty of Rome&#151;and the Maastricht treaty were amending treaties. The treaty proposed by the convention, however, would have been different. It would have been a new treaty, because it collapsed all other treaties and proposed a constitution.

It is irritating that we have not been able to have an open dialogue during the period of reflection of the past couple of years. At the Liaison Committee, the Prime Minister made clear what he believed those points were. I am sorry that the shadow Foreign Secretary did not think that that changed the nature of what is proposed from Europe. Those with whom I have debated the issue in the European Parliament, COSAC meetings and future of Europe debates are certainly of the opinion that if the four points referred to by the Prime Minister are taken out, it will not be the constitution that they voted for.

meeting. If so, we will be talking not about a new constitution but about another amending treaty to the original treaty of Rome, which does not do any of the threatening things that the shadow Foreign Secretary has suggested. If he were in the Government and negotiating, at any time in the future, with his European counterparts, I am sure that he would agree with most of the common-sense proposals left in the original treaty. Some of them could be stripped out, and some of them, especially proposals relating to the power of parliaments, as opposed to the power of Executives, could be strengthened; I would certainly support that.</p>

When Poland signed up to the treaty of Nice, it was given a great deal, whereby it would have 27 votes, and Germany would have 29. Of course it signed up to that. It was rather strange that the convention then brought forward a proposal that would give Germany twice as many votes as Poland. How can one ask a country to enter a new system, and then change the voting balance? A wondrous system has been suggested whereby the number of votes a country has should be based on the square root of its population. Actually, it is quite simple: if Germany had nine votes, the UK would have eight votes, and Poland would have five and a half&#151;alternatively, those countries would have 18, 16 and 11 votes respectively.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o135"><a name="70620-0008.htm_para7"><a name="07062049000360">We need to deal with those institutional matters to get a solution. Agreement should not founder, however, on the myth that if the four fundamental parts of the amending treaty are taken out, a referendum will be required. I do not like referendums; they are not a sensible part of the system of government of this country. We have a liberal press, who would run the referendum according to what they thought the conditions were. With the best will in the world, even people like me, who are Euro-anoraks, could not make people understand the complexities of what we were voting on. It would be an emotional vote.</p>

Whatever our thoughts about the future, we ought at the very least to reflect on that, and on what has been achieved in the intervening time. In the course of the expansion of the European Union from six to27 member states, communist and fascist states have been transformed, and the risks of war within Europe have been largely put behind us. Democratic values and institutions have been the priorities for many countries striving to join the European Union, and those values have become entrenched once the countries have joined. Similarly, their prosperity has increased many times as they have become embedded in Europe&#146;s trading system and economy of nearly 500 million people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o140"><a name="70620-0008.htm_para12"><a name="07062049000366">Over the last five decades Europe has learnt to work as a whole, and to tackle problems that are beyond the control of individual countries. In an era of globalisation, climate change and international terrorism, the requirement for countries to work together has not dimmed. Britain has been a beneficiary of that co-operation, not least in dealing with terrorism. We should remember that one of the suspects involved in the failed attempts to bomb the London Underground two years ago was extradited from Italy within days of his arrest in Rome. Such a fast-track process has only been made possible by co-operation in justice and home affairs. It is justone example of the importance of being part ofthe European Union. Rather than displaying the ambiguity of some in the Labour party or the barely concealed antipathy of many Conservatives, the Liberal Democrats&#146; approach recognises the importance of the European Union and the importance of the United Kingdom&#146;s playing a full part in it.</p>

Bulgaria has only emphasised the inadequacy of the current institutional arrangements. However, we need to move beyond the current navel-gazing: the time has come for the Union to refocus on the real tests in Europe and abroad. Globally, the EU&#146;s combined political and financial clout should be used to tackle global problems, not least in furthering international development as a force for good in the fight against poverty.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman suggested that the European Union could do better in the world as a collective than as a group of individual states. Surely that does not apply to aid, in respect of which Britain, for example, does a much better job than the European Union. Is there not a case for saying that although some of the very strong countries such as Germany, France, Italy, Britain and many others could work as a loose collective if they needed to, individually they can do tremendous work in the world, and indeed may be held back by the restrictive nature of the European Union?</p>

The Prime Minister and the Chancellor have allowed the media to know their views, which have been well trailed by Members who have spoken today. They are all perfectly valid, but there is a rather hackneyed feel to them. That is not surprising, as they bear more than a passing resemblance to the red lines that were set out&#151;and not breached, the Government told us, thanks to opt-outs and emergency brakes&#151;in the original constitutional treaty.

Financial aid is essential to the ordinary Palestinians, who are most affected by these events but who have least say in them. Over the past year, aid has been severely restricted as a result of Hamas winning the Palestinian elections,with the Israelis holding back tax revenues and the European Union joining others in restricting theflow of funds through the temporary international mechanism.</p>

There will have to be a new approach when the immediate priority of humanitarian aid is resolved. The United States, Israel and the European Union have already decidedto restore direct funding to the Palestinian Authority and its emergency Government, which we welcome. However, the new reality in Palestine is that there are two Governments: one in Gaza and one in the west bank. Given that the emergency Government have little or no influence in Gaza, it is essential that the European Union explore ways to ensure that vital aid reaches the desperate and impoverished people there as well. That must be a priority for the European leaders later this week.</p>

 Last July, the Select Committee on Foreign Affairs published a report on developments in the European Union, in which we said:</p>
<a name="70620-0008.htm_brev4"><a name="07062049000700"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Although the Treaty is not dead, it is comatose and on life support. At some point, Europe&#146;s leaders are going to have to decide whether to switch it off. We conclude that the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe is unlikely ever to come into force, although attempts may be made to enact some of its provisions by other means.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o155"><a name="70620-0008.htm_para27"><a name="07062049000388">The Foreign Secretary yesterday told the Select Committee that many EU countries had been in denial about the facts that we pointed out. I have to say that not every member of our Government was saying last year that the treaty was dead; there was obviously a diplomatic reluctance to say so, even though everyone in this country knew that there was no prospect of a treaty that had been rejected in France and the Netherlands being endorsed in the United Kingdom.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o156"><a name="70620-0008.htm_para28"><a name="07062049000389">We are where we are, and the negotiations this weekend will be difficult. Not only have 18 countries ratified the constitutional treaty, but about three others would do so through their Parliaments if they thought that there was any point. Other Governments, including ours, are in a different situation. The French and the Dutch rejected the treaty, the Poles have a particular position and the Czech Government also have some problems. It is not only the UK that has difficulties, red lines or concerns, but it will not be easy to get agreement on the basis of what has been put forward so far.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o157"><a name="70620-0008.htm_para29"><a name="07062049000390">I have read the draft intergovernmental conference mandate document produced by the German presidency that was made available yesterday, and I have studied certain aspects of it. It is unfortunate that Members of this House and parliamentarians across Europe have had such a late opportunity to consider it. As I have already said, I believe that whatever comes out of the negotiations at the weekend, if it is decided that we in this country will not conduct a ratification process by means of a referendum, there must be thorough engagement by parliamentarians. I do not like referendums. I agree with Clement Attlee&#146;s remarks about devices of demagogues and dictators&#151;a phrase that Baroness Thatcher also used in a debate in this place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o158"><a name="70620-0008.htm_para30"><a name="07062049000391">We need Parliament to be sovereign on these matters&#151;Parliament as the expression of the popular will, able to engage in, debate and consider such provisions clause by clause. If and when we get something that can be put forward for ratification, it is essential that we have a parliamentary process leading up to the intergovernmental conference envisaged under the Portuguese presidency.</p>

If something tangible emerges next week, I will consult my Committee colleagues about how we can consider such a process, even through the recess. We have experience of that: the Minister for the Middle East came before our Committee last September, when the House was in recess. I cannot give an undertaking in that regard because my Committee will have to take the decision, but I certainly hope that Parliament will consider these proposals in detail before any ratification processis concluded, and before the intergovernmental conference is held. The long summer recess does present a difficulty, given that the Portuguese presidency starts at the beginning of July.</p>

If the Americans&#151;and then, presumably, organisations such as the Organization of the Islamic Conference and other bodies of international opinion&#151;were to recognise that, there would be a big problem within the EU.</p>

We know what happens when such events occur. We saw what happened in the Balkans with the premature recognition of Croatia and the consequential divisions among EU states. EU unity and a collective EU voice on these matters over the coming weeks and months are vital.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o163"><a name="70620-0009.htm_para4"><a name="07062049000402">I want to touch on some related matters, such as the vital role played by Mr. Solana in developments in the Balkans and in the engagement&#151;so far unsuccessful&#151;with the Iranians, as well as his general work. It is undeniable that the current foreign policy arrangements in the EU are a mess. Having an external relations commissioner as well as a representative of the Governments is confusing. The draft German treaty has an interesting formulation. It states:</p>
<a name="70620-0009.htm_brev0"><a name="07062049000701"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The terminology used throughout the Treaties will reflect&#148;</p>

Last year, the Foreign Affairs Committee was very critical of the fact that while the Foreign Office&#146;s budget was being frozen, the EU seemed to be establishing &#147;embassies&#148; in a number of areas around the world and representatives who were called &#147;ambassadors&#148;. The EU clearly needs a presence in different countries&#151;an office&#151;but it does not need a fully fledged, bureaucratic and massively staffed foreign ministry. Such a presence raises very difficult issues and, for various reasons, it is not helpful. It might be of benefit to some of the smaller EU countries that are not themselves able to have diplomatic representation everywhere in the world, but it will create great difficulties for larger countries, and particularly for those&#151;including us&#151;who are permanent members of the Security Council, and who have Commonwealth networks and other international roles.</p>

 These Europe debates are not simply formulaic; they are about the powers of this House and, by extension, of the people we represent. There has been a transfer of power, authority and decision making from this House to the European Union over many years, but if this constitution, as amended by the German proposals, goes through in anything like this form, it will be a giant step&#151;a further emasculation of the powers of this House and an erosion of national self-government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o168"><a name="70620-0009.htm_para9"><a name="07062049000410">Of course, there should never have been a constitution in the first place. The Government did not want one, and Governments of other member states never called for one. The Convention on the Future of Europe, on which I had the honour to serve and to try to represent the interests of this House, was not told to write a constitution for Europe. We were told to simplify Europe and to create a democratic Europe closer to its citizens. It all got captured by the Brussels machine, and it forgot reform and wrote a constitution instead. That is what the Prime Minister signed in October 2004.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o169"><a name="70620-0009.htm_para10"><a name="07062049000411">As we know, that constitution was rejected convincingly by the voters in France and Holland. The Prime Minister then appeared to enter a phase of repentance. I remind the House that last year in a speech in Oxford he said:</p>
<a name="70620-0009.htm_brev2"><a name="07062049000703"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;we locked ourselves in a room at the top of the tower and debated things no ordinary citizen could understand.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o170"><a name="70620-0009.htm_para11"><a name="07062049000412">I agree with the Prime Minister on that, but he has done nothing to correct the problem. We are now back in the tower. Indeed, the situation has got worse. The Convention on the Future of Europe at least met in public, and I and others could report to the House on what was happening. The Government could also table amendments, and they tabled hundreds of them. Not many were accepted and they did not really like the final text, but at least we could discuss the British position. This time, it is all being done in secret, and that is a disgrace.</p>

Member for Ilford, South (Mike Gapes) said about the importance of parliamentary scrutiny. I will serve as best I can on his Committee to try to subject the text to proper scrutiny. I am pleased that the Committee unanimously placed a marker when we censured Foreign Office Ministers for their refusal to come to our Committee. The same was done by the European Scrutiny Committee, on which I also serve, to give its views about what is happening in Europe.</p>

 I agree with much of what the right hon. Gentleman says. Does he agree with the suggestion made earlier by the Liberal Democrat spokesperson that some of the countries in eastern Europe that have gained democracy might have it for only a short time before it is shoved upwards to the European Union? They might have only a short period of real, genuine national democracy between living under Soviet rule and the rule of the European Union.</p>

 I entirely agree with the hon. Gentleman. It is an irony that in many cases those countries have given up rule from Moscow and swapped it for rule from Brussels. Their liberation was an immensely important event in the history of Europe. However, having achieved self-government, they are now in the process of giving it up.</p>

That is false. The Prime Minister said that we would suffer deadlock or paralysis if we did not have the constitution. In fact, the pace and volume of European Union businesshas increased with every round of enlargement. The European Scrutiny Committee has to deal weekly with a blizzard of new directives, regulations, proposals and decisions from Brussels. The idea that we need more majority voting for more laws is a fantasy. Let us hear no more about why we need this new treaty, or whatever it is called, to make Europe work effectively.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o174"><a name="70620-0009.htm_para15"><a name="07062049000418">We have on our hands a massive extension of majority voting that, by definition, is a diminution in the powers of this House. It means that we will not be able to block unpleasant or unwelcome proposals. The constitution brought majority voting into 63 new areas, which is far more than any other treaty. The Single European Act, under Mrs. Thatcher, introduced it into 12 new areas.</p>

He has carefully crafted those red lines so that he can claim a triumph. However, I presume that all the other extensions of majority voting will be accepted. They are certainly not ruled out in the German document, of which we have only just received a copy.</p>

We know that the Government do not like that. It is referred to specifically in the document, which means that the present intergovernmental pillars of the European Union are to be collapsed, in favour of a single legal personality, so that such matters as policing and criminal justice would be decided by majority voting. The Home Office has recently complained about how its laws, especially anti-terrorism measures, have been overridden by the European convention on human rights, so how can the Government even contemplate any reference to the even stricter EU charter of fundamental rights&#151;also in the German document&#151;or any extension of majority voting into that area? It would be supervised by the European Court of Justice, which would decide any dispute. At a time when we are already feeling the pressure of having our judgments about our own security overridden by the European Union, the Government will apparently sign up to a further massive extension.</p>

There is nothing inthe German IGC text that suggests that the rest of the constitution is to be forgotten. Thus we will have, by the back door, the revival of the great majority ofthe constitutional text&#151;without it being called a constitution, of course. It includes such things as an energy chapter; the security and marketing of energy is to come under the EU.</p>

Then the French said no in their referendum, so the Prime Minister changed his mind and said that Britain would not have one. Then the Labour party manifesto said that there should be a referendum on these matters, but recently the party has gone back on that and said that no referendum would be held. Now, it appears that it is saying that there may be a referendum.</p>

Those are the questions that need to be answered, and they are crucial. This House is a forum where majorities come and go and Governments change, where laws are enacted and withdrawn. That is what democracy is about. Handing such matters over to another jurisdiction, irrevocably, means that we will be losing the powers of the people we represent. We should let them decide whether they want the constitution.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o187"><a name="70620-0010.htm_para1"><a name="07062049000434">The period of reflection became a prelude to the attempt to give a new birth certificate to what is nominally a new constitution. The German Chancellor, Mrs. Merkel, has made what is happening absolutely clear. She has taken away the trimmings of the constitution, and put up some sops for the British Government to knock down easily, as long as they accept the substance of the proposals&#151;which bring back the old constitution in the new form of a treaty. In fact, the old constitution was a treaty too, and the new proposals adopt the same form.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o188"><a name="70620-0010.htm_para2"><a name="07062049000435">Of course, the word &#147;constitution&#148; is not used. To my great regret, the national anthem of the EU has gone too. I have a great fondness for Beethoven&#146;s Ninth, which was also the national anthem of the failed Rhodesian state under Iain Smith. It has been misused many times, by Europe and various other entities, but I like the music and regret its deletion.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o189"><a name="70620-0010.htm_para3"><a name="07062049000436">However, dropping the trimmings means nothing, as the promised treaty creates a legal entity to which this country will surrender some of its sovereign powers. We are bringing in by the back door what the electors in France and Holland threw out by the front. Our electors, if allowed to, would do the same.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o190"><a name="70620-0010.htm_para4"><a name="07062049000437">I cannot see why the German Chancellor is going down this path, as Germany&#146;s economic problems have been caused by the euro. As the dollar falls, the euro is bound to rise, thus making German industry and exports less competitive. The funny money flowingout of the dollar will go into the euro, and the consequential economic damage in Germany, which is already precluded from having the big expansion of demand needed to stimulate its economy, will be severe. Instead of dealing with Germany&#146;s real problem, however, Mrs. Merkel is determined to go down the dead-end street that is the constitution and give the kiss of half life to the dead treaty.</p>

The EU constitution is an artefact and product of the European elite, who for a long time have imposed their views on the people of Europe. If the European people do not like the elite&#146;s views, that is too bad: if they vote against a treaty, let them have another referendum and give them a chance to rethink. Alternatively, the result of the original referendum can be interpreted as a vote on another issue, and not on the pristine beauties of the constitution.</p>

 I do not see why such a clarificationis necessary. The tenor of my argument is that the constitution is unnecessary, and that it is being foisted on British and European opinion in an attempt to reintroduce it by the back door without a referendum. If that is not clear, I despair. The argument is not about the EU: it is about whether we should go further down the dead-end street of a stultifying constitution that will increase the power of the centre and diminish the sovereignty of the EU&#146;s component parts. That is the essence of my argument.</p>

Our Government said that there are four red lines that must not be crossed&#151;ils ne passeront pas. Unfortunately, they are an attenuated version of the six red lines we laid down in 2004, and although we did not actually achieve them then the Prime Minister still accepted the constitution and signed it. Now we are down to four red lines and I fear they will be surrendered just like the others. Two of the 2004 red lines have already been surrendered by acceptance of the constitution.</p>

 My hon. Friend is exactly right. We would have been in a stronger negotiating position now if we had not been waffling about whether to have a referendum but had said adamantly that we would put the treaty to a referendum of the British people.It would have been clear that we would never getthe British people to accept large chunks of the constitution, so as unanimous agreement was needed our negotiating position would have been stronger and the demands on the British Government would have been less. Our inability to take a firm negotiating position has weakened us all along.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o199"><a name="70620-0010.htm_para13"><a name="07062049000454">I was not excited by the statement of my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary that we shall not agreeto any treaty that requires a referendum. The Prime Minister has already told us&#151;last week&#151;that the treaty does not require a referendum so there will not be one, thereby abdicating the position before we had even reached it. We should have insisted on a referendum, because that is necessary for any sacrifice of the sovereignty and powers of the British people. We are giving up their powers, not ours. We are abdicating our responsibilities to them.</p>

Our Euro-enthusiasm does not represent the people of the UK. I know that critics say that the people of this country are misled by Murdoch and Dacre, but that is to assume that the people are fools. In fact, they have basic instincts about Europe and they want no further surrender of powers. If we reckon to abdicate those powers without consulting the people we shall produce alienation and division that will tell against us in the long term.</p>

First, we shall weaken UK sovereignty and hand over to the European state powers that belong to the British people. We shall strengthen the development of a European superstate and frustrate the possibility, which exists at present, of Europe developing along a new path, of looser and more flexible associations that are appropriate to a Europe of 27, and not a Europe dominated by France and Germany as it has always been.

Britain&#146;s role in Europe. We saw that with the success of Edward Heath in getting us in and with Harold Wilson&#146;s machinations in holding his party together while Callaghan carried out the supposed renegotiation&#151;whether it was or was not&#151;and the referendum that followed. We saw it with Mrs. Thatcher&#146;s rather schizophrenic relationship with Europe. She was the person who pushed through the single market&#151;in reality, probably something more far reaching than anything that will be decided this coming weekend&#151;but at the same time she was an arch Eurosceptic. We saw it with John Major, who started out by being friends with Helmut Kohl and by saying that we must be at the heart of Europe but who ended up in the quagmire of Maastricht. Those of us who were involved remember that night without end, when the Conservative nightwatchmen, in particular, kept the House going and going&#151;quite properly&#151;using parliamentary procedures to put their case.</p>

Following the 1997 general election victory, I think he could have carried a referendum on Europe. That is also true of the 2001 general election victory. The referendum might have been on the principle of a single currency or, later on, the issue of a constitution. Either way, he would have carried the case. More lately, British politics has been largely a case of waiting for Gordon. However, with the current Prime Minister, it has been a case of &#147;Waiting for Godot&#148; in so far as European policy has been a two-act play&#151;the only problem is nothing happened twice.

I do not know whether this is deliberate or whether it is simply a cock up, but over the last week every time a Minister, from the Prime Minister downwards, has opened their mouth about a referendum&#151;this could be clever, subtle tactics, although I have to say I am not sure about that&#151;the picture has become more muddied. Every utterance seems hellbent on sowing more seeds of confusion about the Government&#146;s position.</p>

favour of the referendum on the constitution, as they are now, but that they should argue for a constitution. A constitution is the one thing that will codify properly for the first time what Europe can and cannot do, where the line of accountability falls, what the jurisdiction is and what the right of appeal mechanism for individual citizens will be if they feel that they have been let down, abused, or undermined in terms of their civic rights as a result of a European institution.</p>

The vote was split about 50:50. Interestingly, it was a generational split. People such as Russell Johnston, David Steel and Bob Maclennan voted against a referendum on Maastricht. Those of us of a slightly younger generation voted for a referendum. None the less, I took the view then and I still do now that, at some point, perhaps not as a result of this weekend&#146;s machinations&#151;we will see what if anything emerges from this country&#146;s point of view, and I endorse what my hon. Friend the Member for Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk said&#151;but as surely as night follows day, there will have to be some kind of European referendum within domestic British politics. Perhaps it will not be on this issue. There was no referendum on the currency issue. Perhaps there will be a referendum on something else in a few years&#146; time, but, one way or another, we have to lance the boil when it comes to the European issue. I cannot see how we are ever going to achieve that either in this forum, as we go about our discussions on European policy, or in the parliamentary European forum, where there are such frustrations built in.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o214"><a name="70620-0011.htm_para2"><a name="07062049000474">I hope that the new Prime Minister will provide leadership. That leadership is all the more essential, because the leadership of the Conservative party, as the second half of this Parliament wears on, is goingto veer more and more&#151;for reasons that we understand&#151;in a UK Independence party direction. That is no good for proper engagement on the issues of substance. Indeed, the most startling comment made by the shadow Foreign Secretary was an almost throwaway aside towards the end of his speech, when he said that the Conservative party saw no need to revise or revisit the existing arrangements for the27 members of Europe because the EU was working perfectly well from that point of view. Are we to understand that the British Conservative party wants to keep a rotating EU presidency while there are27 members of the EU, with perhaps more to come in a few years? Does that make sense? Do we want a Commission of that size? Have the Conservatives spoken to people in the Commission who say that one of the net effects of the way in which things are constituted with 27 Commissioners&#151;everyone must have their slice of pie and their national Commissioner&#151;in addition to the slowness and bureaucracy attached to such a large Commission, is the fact that Mr. Barroso, the President of the Commission, inevitably brings to himself more authority because the body is too big to function properly? Unless the Commission&#146;s present arrangements are streamlined, it will become less democratic than it would be as a result of implementing the practical issues that must be considered.</p>

coming discussions. A good and true friend, which our country should be to Europe, is not an uncritical one. However, simply standing on the sidelines berating everything that emerges from Brussels without a sensible reform package cannot be a good way forward, either. In the longer term, we need the broad pro-European forces in Britain to regroup and re-engage. If that does not happen, our status as a country will diminish in Europe and the world. We will thus suffer economically and politically. That would be bad for not only our domestic aims, but our wider global aims and aspirations. There is therefore a need to inject fresh energy, idealism and integrity into our domestic European debate. If we did that, it would be beneficial for UK politics in general.</p>

 At this point of the debate, hon. Members have already made many valid points. I welcomed the opening remarks of my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary, in which she outlined the areas that should remain the concern of individual nations. She also mentioned areas on which there is already EU co-operation. I do not wish to repeat the excellent clarification of the situation given by my hon. Friend the Member for Linlithgow and East Falkirk (Michael Connarty), the Chairman ofthe European Scrutiny Committee. Both he and the Foreign Secretary are aware of, and sensitive to, the need to find an appropriate level for decision making.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o216"><a name="70620-0011.htm_para4"><a name="07062049000477">The Government have recognised and implemented the principle of bringing decision making as close to the people as possible, both through the devolution settlement and the Government of Wales Act 2006, which enables the Assembly to reflect the will of the people in the new legislative competence orders. Likewise, my hon. Friend the Minister for Local Government has been working hard on both the Government&#146;s local government legislation and making the Sustainable Communities Bill workable. Again, he has the aim of practically bringing power as close to the people as possible.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o217"><a name="70620-0011.htm_para5"><a name="07062049000478">I welcome the Government&#146;s cautious approach to the EU negotiations. I am confident that my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister will not be signing away the so-called red line issues. He will be aware of the feelings of the House. I have no doubt that the negotiations will be difficult because the member states have such differing views. However, there might be room for some sort of tidying-up measures, and there is certainly a need to make the presidency more cohesive. The six-month presidency can lead to things becoming fragmented, depending on the negotiations between countries at the time of handover.</p>

Friend the Member for Caerphilly (Mr. David) said, we need to ensure that we strengthen the role of national Parliaments. At the recent COSAC meeting that I attended, we found that the Dutch and the French were strong allies on that issue. Their parliamentary delegations were supportive of the idea of national Parliaments having greater involvement. That was extremely significant because they had probably studied the constitution, as it first was, in more detail than any other EU colleagues. They clearly see the need for a strong voice for national Parliaments.</p>

We must ensure that the EU emissions trading scheme is effective. Its first phase unfortunately got a bad reputation because of some Governments&#146; lax approach to setting appropriate emissions levels. I have the privilege of being a member of the Committee that is considering the draft Climate Change Bill. We have taken evidence from a broad range of interested parties, including leaders in business and manufacturing. They welcome the framework of the Bill and its target of a 60 per cent. reduction in emissions by 2050. However, many refer to the importance of EU and worldwide attempts to limit emissions. When we took evidence by video link from California, it was clear that people there also valued EU initiatives in the field.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o220"><a name="70620-0011.htm_para8"><a name="07062049000481">The Foreign Secretary has a detailed understanding of the EU emissions trading scheme, so I ask her to use her influence with her colleagues in the Departmentfor Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and her role in Europe to help to ensure that the scheme is appropriately implemented throughout Europe so that a level playing field is created for UK industry. She will be well aware that the effectiveness of the first phase of the ETS was seriously marred by the fact that some EU countries allocated carbon quotas too generously. It is important that a Union of comparatively rich and influential countries takes a lead on the issue.</p>

Member for Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk (Mr. Moore) said. We need to use the existing channels so that we can co-operate on cross-border crime. In particular, we must tackle the despicable practice of human trafficking, the very existence of which is a real disgrace to a European Union that likes to pride itself on its progressive and civilised traditions. While it is important that we are not blind to the shortcomings of the EU, we must continue to use the existing channels to tackle the major issues that concern us all.</p>

Some do not really like the job that they are doing, but cannot think of one that they would rather do, while others cannot quite make up their mind about where they want to live.

both sides of the argument. I pay tribute to colleagues such my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory) and my hon. Friends the Members for Aldridge-Brownhills (Mr. Shepherd) and for Stone (Mr. Cash), who have always taken part in these debates. Those men know very clearly where they stand on this issue and have taken immense time and trouble over 20 years to master the brief. They have expended energy, and when their stance was not in fashion in the party they suffered due to the damage caused to their careers and the great pressure that their colleagues exerted on them. However, they have not been put off standing up to speak what they believe to be the truth that they feel they must proclaim to the House and the nation. I sincerely admire them for that; they are great parliamentarians. Other colleagues have signed some sort of petition or undertaking calling for us to get out of the European Union. Still other colleagues have not signed, but have put it about that they sympathise with that call.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o223"><a name="70620-0011.htm_para11"><a name="07062049000485">On the other side of the party, there are those of us who have a long track record in standing up for the European Union and who believe that it is themost magnificent asset created by the generation immediately preceding us, which we should do everything possible to nurture, strengthen and hand on to future generations in an even more effective and democratic state. The European Union has, after all, been the framework in which we have enjoyed unprecedented prosperity in western Europe over the past two generations. It has been a major factor for world peace and a pole of stability in the world. It is the institution that has enabled countries to make an astonishingly successful and rapid transition from communism to democracy, and it has diffused and dissolved the appalling ethnic and national conflicts in eastern Europe that have been endemic for centuries.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o224"><a name="70620-0011.htm_para12"><a name="07062049000486">It is now clear to us that the European Union is the only vehicle available to us to address the major challenges and achieve our major collective purposes in the years ahead. Among those challenges are global warming&#151;which has rightly been mentioned so often in the House this afternoon&#151;energy security, and relationships with difficult, unpredictable, autocratic Governments in countries such as Russia and Iran.</p>

There is a natural human tendency not to adapt to new conditions&#151;a natural psychological inertia. Many people are very attached to those institutions and believe that they represent the end of the story.</p>

That is the most hopeless and helpless approach to getting the best out of any relationship in life or any institution.

No more powers should go to Brussels.&#148; That is not a pragmatic view&#151;it is a dogmatic view that ill serves the interests of this country. There are many situations in which it is very much in the national interest that there should be more qualified majority voting.

bounce Britain and other member states into a legally binding constitutional treaty by another name. We have seen a week or two of spin and counter-spin in our media. There is no doubt in Chancellor Merkel&#146;s mind what she wants; she is pretty plain in what she says. She wants to get the treaty through in one form or another, either in pieces or by deception. Our newspapers have been full of leaks, I suspect from different addresses in Downing street, and perhaps the Foreign Office as well. I hope that the Prime Minister will not mind my suggesting that he has hung on as long as possible to get his deal on Europe and to dig a hole for his successor to fall into. I hope that his successor will not be taken in by that and will make his own decisions when he becomes Prime Minister in nine days&#146; time, which I look forward to very much.

Gentleman talked about what great things Europe could do, but there is no reason why we cannot co-operate to do those things without the structures that have been imposed upon us. We could perfectly well work together in this peaceful world. We have a great deal in common politically; certainly the people do. Broadly speaking there are socialists, social democrats and conservatives in Europe, and some liberals as well. We would get along without such structures and we could do all sorts of good things, perhaps rather better, if we were not corralled into this straitjacket called the EU. It would suit us all if there was no deal</p>

I do not want to be destructive in the sense of walking away and saying, &#147;A plague on all your houses.&#148; I want to co-operate with other European nations. But that campaign does have some points. The most recent figures for Britain show that there are tremendous disadvantages in our membership of the EU, which are not balanced by advantages. Our gross contribution to the European budget is &#163;12 billion a year rising to &#163;20 billion by 2013, which is a lot of money. Our current net contribution is about &#163;4.7 billion, which will rise to&#163;7 billion by 2013, largely as a result of the deal, of which I have been so critical, done by the Prime Minister at the end of the British presidency. There are other problems, too. The common agricultural policy costs us an estimated &#163;15 billion a year in food prices. We could save people a lot of money on their weekly shopping simply by not having the CAP, which we should get rid of.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o243"><a name="70620-0012.htm_para3"><a name="07062049000506">I am in favour of some regulation, but it has been estimated that European regulation costs as much as2 per cent. of GDP, which is &#163;45 billion a year and rising. That is a vast amount of money. Sensible, democratic socialist regulation would be less onerous, but it would still have an effect on the economy. Economic growth is about 0.5 per cent. less than it would be were we not constrained by the European Union. Over 10 years, that would amount to &#163;65 billion in economic growth, which is a vast sum of money.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o244"><a name="70620-0012.htm_para4"><a name="07062049000507">People often talk about how the trade balance is advantageous to us as a trading nation. We have a gigantic trade deficit with the European Union&#151;it is about &#163;2.5 billion a month and possibly &#163;30 billion a year&#151;and it is a structural deficit. One hopes that because we are not members of the euro, we may see some reduction in the value of our currency relative to the euro, which would help our trade balance. A structural trade balance strongly implies that we have a misaligned currency. At least we are not part of the euro, which means that we can do something about it.</p>

I have already mentioned agricultural policy and aid policy, and the point also applies to the common fisheries policy. We have the longest coastline in Europe, and we suffer the greatest disadvantage from the CFP. It is obviously nonsense that we signed up to the CFP in the first place.

The European Union was like motherhood and apple pie&#151;something that people went along with&#151;but people do not think that any more.</p>

Perhaps as a result of some of the debates that we have had here, people in Europe are aware that there is a choice. The French and the Dutch people have started to make that choice, which I want others to have. I want to see a much more democratic Europe to which we can all sign up, with which we are all at ease and on which we can work together democratically. I do not believe that the constant drift towards the formation of a centralised superstate with power in the hands of bureaucratic and political elites is what the people want. It is certainly not what I want. Mr. Barroso has rejected what he calls &#147;  la carte Europe&#148; in favour of a Europe that is centralised and run by bureaucrats.

 This is the first time that I have taken part in one of these debates on European affairs, not because I do not have a great interest in the subject but because there are always many Members who want to speak. We have already heard some very good speeches. I do not necessarily agree with all of them, but they have been well made and from a principled position. My right hon. Friend the Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory) more or less summed up my views. I was going to echo the point of view expressed by the hon. Member for Luton, North (Kelvin Hopkins)&#151;that Europe is more than the European Union&#151;but my hon. Friend the Member for Grantham and Stamford (Mr. Davies) stirred up something that I wanted to say when he talked about business, and how a big board could not be run in the way that the presidency is run.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o252"><a name="70620-0012.htm_para12"><a name="07062049000517">As the House may know, I am a retailer by trade with a small independent store in Uxbridge. During the past 20 years, we became a member of the Association of Independent Stores&#151;an admirable body that gives independent stores such as ourselves many advantages. For example, we can get better prices as a buying group. However, the association does not tell me everything. It does not tell me what days I can open, what hours I can open, or where I have to place three-piece suites and which ones I should buy. As an association of independent stores it works very well.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o253"><a name="70620-0012.htm_para13"><a name="07062049000518">In the past 30 years, the face of Europe has changed dramatically. We have heard about the fall of the Berlin wall. New countries have come into existence, some of which were never countries before, and some that were proud countries that had been subsumed, mostlyby the Soviet bloc. Of course, we all welcome that.The European Union has, in many ways, given those countries something to look forward to being part of.</p>

I could not let this opportunity to raise that subject pass, especially when I saw on the Front Bench a different Minister from those whohave had to listen to my Adjournment debates in Westminster Hall. That is not because I am obsessed with the subject but because I believe that it is a very important area for Europe, and because, as in the case of so many of these difficult areas, we rather want to ignore it and wish that it would go away&#151;but of course it will not.</p>

Unfortunately, its final status in the post-conflict world was never thought out properly. Forces went in, although I have a slightly differentview, in terms of some aspects, as to whether the humanitarian intervention was quite as it was portrayed. Nobody thought about what was going to happen afterwards, and now the pendulum has swung the other way as regards ethnic cleansing. Kosovo has an almost entirely Albanian population; a lot of the Serbs have been driven out. Many are waiting to go back, in refugee camps or in camps for the internally displaced. There are some very sad places in Kosovo  <br>

I say &#147;apparently&#148; because I do not understand how we can unilaterally impose a solution on any set of people, and I am afraid that that is being done. Although a solution can be imposed for a while, it simply creates a problem&#151;perhaps not for the next few years or even a generation, but for the future&#151;that will never be solved.</p>

Ten or 20 years ago, it would have been impossible to imagine the personalities whoare in Stormont today sharing power. However, that achievement has taken time and patience. At times, deadlines have been set and passed because the opportunity of achieving peace was too precious to say, &#147;Sorry, that&#146;s the end of it.&#148; I am therefore greatly concerned about the position in Kosovo.</p>

 It was far from helpful, but I understand why the President said that at the time. I am not entirely sure that, even in Europe, we understand the complexities of some of those matters. America may have competencies in many areas, but I am not sure that the Balkans is one of them.</p>

I believe that Serbia recognises that it will never get direct rule from Belgrade over the area, and that is welcome. The sticking block is that we have arbitrarily changed the boundaries of a state. Kosovo is recognised to be part of Serbia, and for us to say that that can be changed will set an awful precedent around the world. Our Government, America and the Contact group, with the exception of Russia, disagree and claim that it will be a one-off. Things do not work like that. I cannot understand how Republika Srpska would not say, &#147;You&#146;ve allowed Kosovo to become independent. We want to join up with Serbia proper. Why can&#146;t we do that?&#148; We have only to look a bit further towards the Caucasus to Abkhazia and Ossetia to find other problem areas. There is no easy answer, but we must not rush into a solution.</p>

Perhaps that just about applies on the surface, but underneath, there is a great deal of concern about what would happen if boundaries and borders were changed anywhere, but especially in Europe.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o261"><a name="70620-0012.htm_para21"><a name="07062049000528">I ask the Government to look seriously into the various possibilities.

It is the feeling of belonging to those heartlands that is so important to recognise.</p>

 Does my hon. Friend agree that one of the key considerations in any settlement should bethe right of the Serbian people to go to Kosovo, particularly in view of the incredible heritage for the Serbian people that can be seen there? The Serbian people want to be able to visit the monasteries and other sights that are so important to their nation, but that should be possible while preserving the self-determination of the Kosovars.</p>

 I agree, and I am sure that people will acknowledge that that can happen. When we travel to Kosovo and see those sacred sites surrounded by barbed wire and heavily armed international forces, it makes us realise that the reality is not the same as what is being said. I will leave it there.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o262"><a name="70620-0012.htm_para22"><a name="07062049000531">I am very concerned that when we speak of Europe in the House, we are talking about the European Union. It is, of course, fundamental&#151;and something about which many of our constituents have grave concerns&#151;but we need to recognise that there is a wider Europe. If the EU is to be of any importance, it has to grasp that fact. I cannot really see how we could ever have a single European diplomatic force with European embassies, because so many different views are represented among the different European countries. It would be a wonderful world if that happened, but I am not a dreamer and I believe that we have to be pragmatic. That is why the EU, this country and the contact group have to take a serious look at what is happening in Kosovo and Serbia.</p>

European Union, exactly where the frontier happens to be is no longer such an existential matter and problems can be resolved.

 Strangely enough, I agree with my hon. Friend, but that is a long way in the future. In the long-term future, that may well be the only solution, under which the Balkan countries could become a working group rather as the Baltic countries have become today. Perhaps the goal is for that to happen within the EU, but it will certainly not happen straight away, particularly if the EU becomes more difficult and more constricted, with more and more regulations. That is why I personally favour, for the very good reasons that my hon.

The trouble was that it became all too clear to too many of us that for many countries and Governments, including our own, it had been a period not just of reflection but of hibernation. The opportunity for the period of reflection to become a period of renegotiation and reconsideration had been lost. We are under no illusions. Chancellor Merkel has always made it absolutely clear that she wanted to resurrect and breathe new life into the constitution, and she is right to do that because it is her stated aim and it is what the German presidency is going to do.</p>

We have always been clear about the fact that the enlarged EU needs a new direction. It does not need a more centralised, more controlled bureaucratic body to which we surrender more national powers.

constitution were experiencing difficulty in going back and accepting a mere amending treaty. That may be so, but it is a matter for them. It is for us to stand up and ensure that our national interests are being protected by the Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o267"><a name="70620-0012.htm_para27"><a name="07062049000539">For many years, I worked in the City as an investment analyst, and I saw a huge amount of development in the way in which companies funded themselves. We used an analysis that we called the duck analysis: if it looks like a duck, walks like a duck and sounds like a duck, it probably is a duck. If the amending treaty has the content and the intent of the EU constitutional treaty, it probably is a constitutional treaty, and it probably&#151;no, definitely&#151;will transfer power. Any reasoned analysis will therefore have toask whether the amending treaty is inimical to the constitutional treaty, where the transfers of powerwill take place, and what negotiating stance our Government are taking to protect our national interests.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o268"><a name="70620-0012.htm_para28"><a name="07062049000540">It must be clear to everyone that the EU constitutional treaty of 2004 was a step towards greater integration. It had two aspects. The constitutional aspect would have given the EU legal personality,and given EU laws supremacy over national laws. It would also have merged three pillars into one. The institutional aspect would have resulted in an elected full-time President, and a new Foreign Minister to replace the high representative and the external affairs commissioner. Qualified majority voting would have become the general procedure.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o269"><a name="70620-0012.htm_para29"><a name="07062049000541">It is still unclear whether the amending treaty would confer legal personality on the EU. We shall have to wait and see, but President Sarkozy has suggested in recent statements that he intends to support the Spanish proposition that it should do so. There is already a proposal for an EU Foreign Minister who would have the power to speak on foreign affairs at the United Nations without the power of national veto, and the power to speak on matters beyond the common foreign policy. All the institutional input that would have resulted from the constitutional treaty is still there in this so-called amending treaty.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o270"><a name="70620-0012.htm_para30"><a name="07062049000542">The Foreign Secretary once again defined some of the characteristics of the Government&#146;s position, what would be acceptable to the Government and where the red lines would run. She said that Britain would not accept a treaty that allowed the charter of fundamental rights to change UK law in any way. She also saidthat the Government would accept a charter of fundamental rights that brought together existing laws, but she did not say whether the Government would accept a charter that changed EU laws and, through that, UK laws. Will the Minister therefore clarify what &#147;in any way&#148; means to the Government?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o271"><a name="70620-0012.htm_para31"><a name="07062049000543">The second red line relates to the acceptance of anything that displaces the role of British foreign policy. The Foreign Secretary referred this afternoon to agreeing a common but not a single foreign policy. Does she therefore agree with the Spanish position that there will be European embassies? Do we really want a tower of Babel? That must be unacceptable. Do we really want an embryonic EU foreign service to jump out of the so-called amending treaty? Again, the red line seems open to interpretation.</p>

 My hon. Friend will have noted that the Foreign Secretary said in her opening remarks that she favoured qualified majority voting where it is in the interests of this country. Does he agree that QMV per se will lead inevitably to decisions that may not be in the interests of this country, and that will be outside our control?</p>

 I do agree with that, as it is the logical conclusion of what the Foreign Secretary said this afternoon. As my right hon. Friend the shadow Foreign Secretary said, the red lines might be red herrings; they might defend British interests, butthey might also be entirely worthless. Unless the Government, in their winding-up, give some clarity on the red lines, we are entitled to say that the red lines will give us no protection whatever.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o273"><a name="70620-0013.htm_para1"><a name="07062049000547">The Foreign Secretary, in her concluding remarks, alluded to that popular television programme &#147;Deal or No Deal&#148;, when she said that the Government will not do a deal at any price. That is fair enough, but if what is in the box called &#147;amending treaty&#148; is actually a constitutional treaty&#151;I think that this is proven&#151;whatever the banker offers is not high enough.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o274"><a name="70620-0013.htm_para2"><a name="07062049000548">The House should also remember that there is huge cynicism about politics at the moment. All too often, the public believe that we say one thing, mean another and do yet another. What they want is politicians who stand up and say exactly what they mean, and then act accordingly. The Prime Minister said, &#147;Trust the people&#148;, on which we wholeheartedly support him. In 1997, he promised a referendum if powers were moved. He also said, and we accepted, that the British people wanted a referendum on the 2004 treaty. Our position is absolutely clear: we want a referendum if the so-called amending treaty transfers powers to the EU. According to any even brief analysis, it is likely that the amending treaty, even after this weekend, will transfer powers. Therefore, let us trust the people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o275"><a name="70620-0013.htm_para3"><a name="07062049000549">Finally, there is the issue of the Government&#146;s mandate to act. At the general election, the Prime Minister said that he would serve a full term. Within two years, however, we are to have a new Prime Minister, unelected and without a clear mandate. At a time when the will of the British people is that no further powers should be transferred to Europe, but the so-called amending treaty will do exactly that, there is all the more reason for the Government to trust and respect the British people, and offer them a referendum.</p>

I happen to take grave exception to the way in which it operates under sections 2 and 3 of the European Communities Act 1972, which is why I raised with my right hon. Friend the Member for Richmond, Yorks (Mr. Hague), the shadow Foreign Secretary, the question of the legislative supremacy of this House.

of the provision relating to the supremacy of Community law a criticism of this House and this Parliament, given that this House and this Parliament passed a provision in the 1972 Act accepting the supremacy of Community law?</p>

<p><a name="st_o231"><a name="07062049000559"><a name="70620-0013.htm_spnew4"><a name="07062049000981"><b>Mr. Cash:</b>
 Yes, it most emphatically is such a criticism. It was an enormous mistake to have done that in that way. An amendment of mine to the Legislative and Regulatory Reform Bill&#151;new clause 17&#151;was supported by my party in the Commons and the Lords. It proposed in certain circumstances to override the 1972 Act, and, crucially, to require the judiciary to give effect to that latest expressly inconsistent enactment passed by this House on behalf of the electorate who put us in power.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o283"><a name="70620-0013.htm_para11"><a name="07062049000560">Nothing is set in concrete forever; even the Minister will accept that things cannot remain static forever. In some circumstances, repatriation has blatantly become necessary. That is the sentiment of the British people, and it is probably also the sentiment of most other European countries. We must achieve the mechanism to deliver that, in the interests of the voters. <i> [Interruption.] </i>Is the Minister expressing approval? I think he must be, as he cannot disagree with my point. <i> [Interruption.]</i> I invite him to get up and disagree with me, by all means. We are talking about an important principle: democracy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o284"><a name="70620-0013.htm_para12"><a name="07062049000561">I do not dispute that the primacy of European law has been an established principle. That was set out under the Costa <i> v. </i>ENEL case of 1964&#151;before we entered the EU&#151;and there have been many other cases since. However, let me make my point on this subject by drawing an analogy with what happened in the 19th century, another time of enormous constitutional change. There was supremacy of Parliament before the passing of the Reform Acts, but it cannot be said that the supremacy of Parliament before the Reform Acts was the same as its supremacy after them. It was a new supremacy of Parliament, endorsed by its democratic accountability which came from everyone having been given the vote. Despite all the obfuscations and opaque and academic arguments about sovereignty that there are, the point I am making is simple. The question is whether the people of this country have the right to make the law through their elected representatives in line with their wishes in general elections.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o285"><a name="70620-0013.htm_para13"><a name="07062049000562">The draft mandate states:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o286"><a name="70620-0013.htm_para14"><a name="07062049000563">That is an unexceptional statement until that primacy is related to the new functions that are being conferred. Those new functions involve a structural changein the relationships between the United Kingdomand Europe&#151;and between the United Kingdom Government and Parliament and the electorate of our country. That is a fundamental structural change. When we impose that new primacy, although there is no repeal provision as such, the proposed constitutional arrangements are so close to the existing ones under the treaty that the Minister and the rest of his party voted for, that any distinction that was made would be a distinction without a sufficient difference. That is the key point. If that argument stands up to scrutiny, which I believe it does, then it follows that we must have a referendum.</p>

no substantial difference, to continue to pursue the idea, subject only to the Minister for Europe&#146;s saying just a couple of days ago that there might be a referendum. However, we need to make it crystal clear that there should be a referendum. Because of the nature of this treaty&#151;its accumulated text and its cumulative effect on the various functions&#151;there must be a referendum on it, as if it were a referendum on all the existing treaties. I suspect that when the text of the treaty ultimately emerges, that is more or less what we will be dealing with. My early-day motion could turn out to be the basis on which we have to proceed&#151;that there will be a referendum on all the existing treaties.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o291"><a name="70620-0013.htm_para19"><a name="07062049000572">Although the treaty under discussion is called an amending treaty, it will consolidate all the others. It tries to pretend that it is something else but fails to make a sufficiently different distinction, and, finally, presents the British people with a simple question, which the new Prime Minister&#151;the present Chancellor of the Exchequer&#151;is going to have to run with. We have been watching him appoint people such as Jon Cunliffe&#151;people who devised the five economic tests; the Foreign Office is being denuded of its influence; and the influence of people who clearly have a very Eurosceptic view is being carried into No. 10.

I have never heard so much tosh. As I said in <i> The Times</i> the other day, this is absolute rubbish. Well-established case law showsthat the charter, however it is referred to in these arrangements, will be part and parcel of the jurisprudence of the European Court of Justice.

decision was presented to the public as a free trade deal, so that was simple. But when I became a Member of Parliament, I began to read the documents and see what they actually entailed. The treaty is a clever, slowly evolving&#151;not so slowly, because it is now rapidly accelerating&#151;attempt to change the very nature of the Government of the UK. Other nations must speak for themselves.</p>

That is what we are arguing about. We went from 1972 to the Single European Act, which Mrs. Thatcher ultimately said she would not have signed if she had known what would happen. She repudiated the decision in a sense, and to begin with I did not understand the difference between a single and a common market. America is a common market. The European government, in its approach to the market, is a single market. Which do I prefer? I prefer the common market, in which each of us competes, strives and controls, within the state system, what we judge to be best. That is not the ambition of that organisation.</p>

It says that it shall be irrevocable and irreversible. Those are not words to be taken lightly. Having been told about the mutability of human life, we begin to appreciate that the treaty is a solid construction, with ambitions to be a grand and great constitution and to make the UK clearly, through usage and the passage of time, a subservient or subsidiary constituent of the union of Europe.</p>

I can reconcile my approach, because the sovereignty of Parliament and democratic Government that we now espouse and promote&#151;I am here by virtue of it&#151;began with the autocratic dictatorship of monarchy and progressed through oligarchy. Our struggle has always been to hold the Crown in check, and that is what we do in this Chamber. Unfortunately, the Prime Minister&#146;s majority means that the Crown is now with him in Downing street, but that is no excuse for us if we forget what our business is and where the trust of those whom we should serve lies.

After his time in office, he researched the extent of his country&#146;s Government, looking at some interesting figures for the total number of so-called legislative instruments that had been passed.

When I asked about that figure, it disappeared from the Cabinet Office website, but figures from the German Ministry of Justice comparing the number of legislative processes in that country between 1998 and 2004 with the amount of EU legislation in the same period found that 84 per cent. of all laws were passed in Brussels, and only 16 per cent. in Berlin.</p>

It is not a way to run any kind of business or democracy.That is why we need to rationalise. To have any hopeof building relationships with countries outside and within Europe, we need more than a six-month presidency of the European Union.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman has pointed out many faults with the European Union in the past. I am sure that having 27 members of the Commission is one of the reasons why we are not able to advance. He is much more knowledgeable than me and can come up with many more examples than I can.</p>

I often came across European countries that were extremely enthusiastic about joining not just NATO, but the European Union. They saw membership as providing access to the modern world and as a way of improving their economies and internal processes. I wish we could inspire that enthusiasm for Europe, which has existed in the past, in this country.</p>

That is extremely popular with traders, as well as visitors to the European continent. West Fife Enterprise gives access to European grants to try to provide new opportunities for young people in training and enterprise. We even have motorbike shops that trade in euros.

It is a great drink. I am sure that whisky producers in Scotland will welcome the legal recognition and that there will be the required economic boost. A slightly more negative point relates to the food supplement regulations that are being introduced. The efforts by the European Union to control the maximum limits on food supplements, vitamins and mineral are a negative step. I hope that the Minister will consider those proposals; I am sure that the Government are doing so already.</p>

that peace. Turkey is one of the immediate neighbours that we should look to engage with further and ultimately welcome into a further expanded European Union. The European Economic Community promised Turkey membership, albeit conditionally, more than40 years ago, and we have often repeated the commitment since. Turkey has been seeking integration into Europe ever since, economically and, as far as possible, politically. It has launched major internal changes to facilitate membership. Not admitting Turkey once it meets the EU standards would be extremely damaging.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o315"><a name="70620-0014.htm_para17"><a name="07062049000604">We will all be aware of the recent political troubles in Turkey involving the ruling AK party and the debate about the election of the President. Of course, Turkish membership of the European Union is not just around the corner because stringent criteria must be met for it to be able join&#151;and rightly so. The oppression of the Kurds in eastern Turkey cannot simply be forgotten, for example. However, the fact that the death penalty has been abolished is a hugely encouraging sign of progress. The issues that stand in the way of membership are not insubstantial, however, and will take time to resolve.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o316"><a name="70620-0014.htm_para18"><a name="07062049000605">The current Turkish Government have presided over a number of consecutive years of substantial economic growth. Evidently, it would be folly to rule outthe membership of such a diverse and strategically important country as Turkey. Members of the European Union should not create artificial barriers or unexpected hurdles. If Turkey fulfils its criteria, it is entitled to accession, but we should make it clear that Turkey cannot qualify on economic grounds alone and that pluralism, the rule of law and freedom of speech must be realities, not merely aspirations.</p>

They complain when other countries try to introduce more qualified majority voting in the EU, presumably because they do not wish to be railroaded by those countries, but when it comes to NATO, they attempt to railroad other countries into participating in conflicts for which there is little domestic support. I encourage members of NATO and the EU to do their fair share in conflicts such as that in Afghanistan. Such countries have often not stepped up to the plate or reduced the number of caveats to their participation. However, it is extremely unreasonable simply to require them to participate in conflicts when they have difficulties at home. The approaches on NATO and the EU seem to be converse.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman makes an appropriate point. I am talking about the approach to the organisations. I am trying to make the broad point that we seem to try to lay guilt on other countries for not playing their part in NATO, but we reject other countries&#146; attempts to encourage us to become wider members of the European Union. There is in an inconsistency in the approach.</p>

 I am sorry to challenge the hon. Gentleman, but I think that there is an inconsistency in his argument. NATO has a straightforward remit. I will be curious to hear his views on this, but if there is any concern, it is the struggle over whether member nations should participate in both NATO and the rapid reaction corps with 60,000 members that the European Union is trying to set up. I do not believe that it would be possible to be part of both. At the moment, colonels and commanders are double-hatting, but they cannot be in two places at once.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman has a great deal of knowledge about this matter, but, in principle, he is wrong. There is no reason why we must have a simple process in order for things to work. Many comparisons regarding soft and hard power have been made between the ESDP and NATO. There is no reason why we cannot work together on different conflicts to try to find suitable strengths. If it takes the ESDP to make member states take on their responsibilities outside the boundaries of NATO and the EU, we should use that route. We must recognise that countries have problems with which they must deal, so it is not appropriate simply to demand that they play a greater part.</p>

 Perhaps the hon. Gentleman is right that the European Union can play a role on soft power. However, Bosnia is a great example of the European Union failing to provide the troops or the initiative to solve a problem. It was not until America came along&#151;indeed, until NATO came along&#151;and the Dayton peace accord was signed that we got peace in the Balkans. That would not have happened if the situation had been left to the EU alone.</p>

 I recognise that these matters are not simple and that there are often system failures. The fact that NATO and the ESDP do not communicate effectively is one reason. We need to work together. Just because it may seem on the outside that there is duplication or overlap, that does not mean that the two systems cannot work side by side. There is blind adherence to maintaining NATO, without considering a similar European body. That is inappropriate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o320"><a name="70620-0014.htm_para22"><a name="07062049000615">In conclusion, we need to work together through the European Union and other international bodies so that we can advance the cause of Britain in a larger whole, rather than working on our own.</p>

I had been to 25 of the27 EU countries, excepting only Cyprus and Malta, before I was aged 30, both on personal and on business travel. My wife is half German and half Russian.

Why am I opposed to the current direction ofthe EU? Probably because I believe that it needs fundamental change. I strongly believe that we must be in Europe and make the case for a Europe that is in our mould. We have many declared and potential allies since expansion, to whom we are not talking enough. That is especially the case with the present Government. We want a grouping of sovereign nation states able to trade freely with one another, co-operating on areas of common political interest. Change is desperately needed. According to the European Commission&#146;s own figures, by 2050 Europe&#146;s share of world output will fall to only 10 per cent. The US will be on 26 per cent. at that time. That means that in just 40 years the average American will be twice as well off as the average European.</p>

 Yes. The answer is that the hon. Lady should be careful about throwing stones in glasshouses. If she looked at what the Socialist group of MEPs was presenting in terms of a deeply federal Europe, she would be genuinely alarmed. If I were her, I would more closely examine her own side first.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o328"><a name="70620-0015.htm_para2"><a name="07062049000632">I have been looking at the timetable for the past six weeks in the lead up to this crucial summit. I have been going through all the press releases put out by the German federal Government, the Bundesregierung, and comparing the movements of Angela Merkel and her wheeling and dealing to try to secure a deal on the European constitution with the complete lack of such activity by our own leaders.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o329"><a name="70620-0015.htm_para3"><a name="07062049000633">I mentioned earlier that the German Chancellor had had one to one meetings with the leaders of Poland, France, Denmark, Sweden, Ireland, Belgium, Italy, Hungary, Lithuania and so on. It is fascinating to compare what she was doing with what the Prime Minister, the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Deputy Prime Minister were up to at the same time. For example, when Angela Merkel was meeting the President of Poland, the Prime Minister&#146;s office was trailing that, as part of his legacy tour, he would loveto go back on &#147;Blue Peter&#148;. When the German Chancellor was meeting the new French President, our Prime Minister was on a plane to Washington. Obviously, going to Washington would usually be important, but as part of a legacy tour, when the constitution is up for negotiation, where was he? When the German Chancellor met the Danish leader, Mr. Rasmussen, on 22 May, our Prime Minister was doing an interview with Brian Williams of NBC, talking about how popular he is in the United States. On it goes. When the German Chancellor was meeting the leaders of Sweden, Ireland and Belgium, our Prime Minister was in Sierra Leone.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o330"><a name="70620-0015.htm_para4"><a name="07062049000634">I also had a quick look to see what the Chancellor of the Exchequer has been doing. I went to his website, &#147;Gordon Brown for Britain&#148;, which includes a section called &#147;Follow Gordon&#148; that allows people to follow his progress around the UK. The site helpfully includes a huge map of Europe that extends to Slovenia, Sweden and Italy. However, the map of Europe is absolutely blank, because he has not made a single visit to Europe or met a single European leader in six weeks, other than his conversation with Mr. Sarkozy on the telephone, because he has been too busy shadow boxing at the Labour party hustings. At a time when we have no Government to represent us and fight our corner in Europe, our right to govern ourselves is being given away.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o331"><a name="70620-0015.htm_para5"><a name="07062049000635">The Government have been incredibly evasive.Last week, my hon. Friend the Member for Stone (Mr. Cash) asked the Foreign Secretary to come clean on what discussions she has had with the Prime Minister and the Chancellor on the constitution. Her reply was brief, even by new Labour standards:</p>
<a name="70620-0015.htm_brev1"><a name="07062049000712"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;All these issues are discussed among all members of the Government at all times.&#148;&#151;[<i> Official Report</i>, 5 June 2007;Vol. 461, c. 119.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o332"><a name="70620-0015.htm_para6"><a name="07062049000636">That was an incredibly helpful and informative answer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o333"><a name="70620-0015.htm_para7"><a name="07062049000637">Germany has been saying that the EU is unworkable without a new treaty and the constitution. Again, I shall refer to the federal Government press release published on 14 June:</p>

<a name="70620-0015.htm_brev2"><a name="07062049000713"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;A new treaty is to prevent gridlock within the EU, even with 27 or more member states.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o334"><a name="70620-0015.htm_para8"><a name="07062049000638">There is significant evidence that there is no gridlock in the EU. I happen to sit on the European Scrutiny Committee, and every week we consider an enormous pile of documents, including the latest directives, Green Papers and White Papers from the Commission. I shall pick out three examples from recent weeks, because all the evidence indicates that there is no gridlock inthe EU.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o335"><a name="70620-0015.htm_para9"><a name="07062049000639">First, there are the foreign prisoner repatriation regulations. I got in there on the right of UK victims of crime to be told whether a foreign prisoner whohas been repatriated will be released, which is a fundamental part of UK law on victims of crime. Unfortunately, that particular EU document does not contain any regulations about notifying victims of crime in the event of such a prisoner being released from a foreign jail.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o336"><a name="70620-0015.htm_para10"><a name="07062049000640">Secondly, there is funding for integration and community cohesion. It stands to reason that the integration of minorities into societies and countries is, almost by definition, a job for nation states and national Governments. It is difficult to conceive how a supranational body can be in charge of integration, but there is a new EU integration fund. I agree with exchanging best practice, but for the EU to have competence on the integration of minorities is fundamentally wrong and potentially disastrous.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o337"><a name="70620-0015.htm_para11"><a name="07062049000641">Thirdly, we have already heard about the European security and defence policy. An amazing document on the progress made on the ESDP during the German presidency came before the European Scrutiny Committee last week. It mentions civilian capabilities, military capabilities, the European capability action plan, various battle groups and operational activities. A group of countries is effectively behaving like a state through the ESDP.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o338"><a name="70620-0015.htm_para12"><a name="07062049000642">I want briefly to discuss one subject other than the future of the EU, namely, our relations with Russia, which, surprisingly, have not been raised in this debate. Relations are certainly worsening, which is a problem. Last week, I was interviewed by a Russian business magazine, <i> Profil</i>, and the interviewer could not work out why people in the UK are upset about the Alexander Litvinenko affair. I had to explain that the man concerned was a UK citizen&#151;whether or not one agrees with aspects of our asylum and immigration system, he was, nevertheless, a UK citizen, and he should have been protected by the UK Government. In my view, he was badly let down. A British citizen was assassinated in cold blood in a restaurant, hotel or bar somewhere in London by the use of a radioactive isotope, which is deadly serious in every sense.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o339"><a name="70620-0015.htm_para13"><a name="07062049000643">In terms of our relations with Russia, the key area to consider is how we are engaging, or not engaging, with the countries of the former Soviet Union. Almost all the disputes that are happening between the west and Russia have at their heart countries from the former Soviet Union&#151;they concern the war memorial in Estonia, the direction of political change in Ukraine, energy through Ukraine and Belarus, Georgia&#146;s bid to join NATO, oil deliveries to Lithuania, gas pipelines, and so on. Britain and the EU need to engage alot more.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o340"><a name="70620-0015.htm_para14"><a name="07062049000644">Finally, I want to throw out an idea that brings the two things together: whether it is possible for Russia to join the EU. I think that that is fundamentally possible. Are we going to say that Russia is the only country in Europe&#151;the only Orthodox country; the only Slav country with a Slavonic tongue&#151;that cannot join the EU? We should seriously consider that, because it would do the EU an enormous amount of good, as would the accession of Turkey when the conditions are right. Obviously, an awful lot has to change.</p>

 It is a genuine pleasure to follow my hon. Friend the Member for Hammersmith and Fulham (Mr. Hands), who is, as we have all seen and heard, as educated, cerebral and dextrous a contributor to our debate as we could hope for on this important occasion.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o341"><a name="70620-0015.htm_para15"><a name="07062049000646">I confess that my starting point is somewhat different. For 34 years, under successive Governments of both colours, Britain has been a member first, ofthe European Community, and subsequently, of the European Union. That is because a judgment was made that it was in our interests to be so. My view is that it remains in our interests for two principal and highly compelling reasons, the first economic andthe second political. The economic argument has not fundamentally changed&#151;if anything, it has strengthened. The arguments made in support of initial entry&#151;the opportunity of massively expanded trade, the creation of a vast new raft of jobs, the deregulation of markets and increased consumer choice&#151;seem to me, if anything, more potent now than they were back in 1972. That is because, first, a great deal has been achieved since then in terms of liberalisation, consumer choice and competitive capitalism, and secondly, there was then a market of 250 million or 350 million people, but there is now a market of well-nigh 500 million people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o342"><a name="70620-0015.htm_para16"><a name="07062049000647">Secondly, there was and is a political reason for our membership. We were conscious, as we are now, of a huge number of challenges which, with good willand flexibility among member states, can be more effectively tackled together than if we insist on choosing to consider matters only for our individual constituent nations. In the process of trying to overcome some of the transnational problems that beset us, we seek also to promulgate and disseminate essentially democratic values that we nurture and cherish in this country, and which we recognise as underpinning the democracies of other member states of the European Union. The reality is that if one is in government, whatever the anxieties, frustrations and disappointments, one probably acknowledges that when it comes down to it and one has to make a choice, it is more sensible to be part of the European Union than not to be part of it or so to detach oneself from the mainstream as effectively to neuter one&#146;s influence. We can all make Eurosceptic speeches&#151;I have done so myself and can do it virtually in my sleep&#151;but I would politely suggest that there is a difference between what one does when one is charged with the responsibilities of government and what one does, or says, when one languishes in the impotence of opposition. My personal view is that we should put the issue of membership to bed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o343"><a name="70620-0015.htm_para17"><a name="07062049000648">Let me underline the argument for the avoidanceof doubt. Of no fewer than six Prime Ministers&#151;Ted Heath, Harold Wilson, Jim Callaghan, Margaret Thatcher, John Major and the present Prime Minister&#151;none has seriously entertained for one moment the notion of exit or departure from the European Union. That is the starting point. We need to be in there, punching our weight and making a contribution. We need to try to be constructive at all times on every issue.</p>

<p><a name="st_o259"><a name="07062049000649"><a name="70620-0015.htm_spnew7"><a name="07062049001009"><b>Kitty Ussher:</b>
 Let me try to pursue the point that I attempted to make earlier, but to which I did not get an adequate answer. Following the hon. Gentleman&#146;s chain of logic, would it not be unwise for the Conservative party to leave the European People&#146;s party if that means that the Chancellor of Germany will not speak to his party&#146;s leader?</p>

<p><a name="st_o260"><a name="07062049000650"><a name="70620-0015.htm_spnew8"><a name="07062049001010"><b>John Bercow:</b>
 That is a fascinating intervention, to which I would happily respond in appropriate detail and with all my arguments marshalled on another occasion. If the hon. Lady is interested in joining me for a cup of tea, for which I am happy to pay, I am willing to debate the matter with her at another time. However, I shall not be diverted, even by the quick-wittedness of her interventions, from the central thrust of the argument on which I should like to focus.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o344"><a name="70620-0015.htm_para18"><a name="07062049000651">The logical corollary of accepting the principle and practice of continued membership is recognition of the need to co-operate. There must be a basic pre-disposition for members of the European Union to try to co-operate. Moreover, co-operation in the European Union is not a one-off instance or an isolated act but a continuous and recurrent process, which is implicit in our commitment to membership. It is striking and interesting that several hon. Members from different parties have acknowledged the merit of co-operation but paid lip service to or genuflected at it. They have not gone on logically to develop the argument and to explain in what respects, for what reasons and in what instances co-operating is worth while.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o345"><a name="70620-0015.htm_para19"><a name="07062049000652">Let me therefore give some examples of working together on a co-operative basis, which is indispensable for the future interests of the United Kingdom, irrespective of the outcome of the forthcoming Council meeting and any subsequent intergovernmental conference. First, let us consider defence co-operation. European Union countries spend approximately&#163;250 billion a year on defence procurement. I should have thought that it logically followed from that state of affairs that it is worth trying to co-operate to achieve better value for money and interoperability of personnel and kit, and to safeguard and promote this country&#146;s defence industrial base. That argument is almost unanswerable. Perhaps that can be done under existing arrangements and does not require an extension of legislative power, but one does not need to take an absolutist stance. The issue is how to advance and bolster the UK&#146;s interests.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o346"><a name="70620-0015.htm_para20"><a name="07062049000653">Let us consider co-operation on energy policy. It is manifestly clear that it is to our advantage for energy policy purposes and in the attempt to combat climate change to try to pool our resources and hunt as a pack.  <br>

We all know that we need significantly to free up the energy market and that there is a commitment to try to ensure 20 per cent. renewables use in future. That requires collective action. We also know that there are huge gains to be made in energy efficiency. Several hon. Members have alluded to the reality that China is a growing power, that there are concerns about Iran,that India is an increasingly significant force in the world and that, as my hon. Friend the Member for Hammersmith and Fulham pertinently reminded us, there is Russia.</p>

 On defence co-operation, it is worth thinking about a project such as the Tornado fighter, which was set up by four sovereign countries. Indeed, when it was first set up, Spain was not even a member of the EU, so it is perfectly possible to have co-operation and joint effort without having the EU&#151;but my hon. Friend has already said that.</p>

 I hesitate to say this because I so rarely disagree with anything that my hon. Friend says. I am listening very carefully to his argument about the importance of co-operation. Does he agree that one of the biggest concerns of the people of this country is that all too often, co-operation within the EU is about doing deals behind closed doors? It feels to many people like decision-making power through their elected representatives is being taken away from them and becoming a process over which they have no control. Will my hon. Friend address that concern, about which many people feel strongly?</p>

<p><a name="st_o264"><a name="07062049000659"><a name="70620-0015.htm_spnew12"><a name="07062049001014"><b>John Bercow:</b>
 I understand the point, I recognise the concern and there is an extent to which I share it. I politely suggest to my hon. Friend, however, that that concern does not invalidate the merit of or need for co-operation. It underscores the importance of having greater transparency, which is partly a matter of scrutiny by this House. We need dramatically to improve our procedures in that regard and perhaps those of the EU as well.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o349"><a name="70620-0015.htm_para23"><a name="07062049000660">I would like to warm to my theme of co-operation, which I think is true in respect of a number of aspects of the challenge to tackle crime. Cross-border crime, for example, is estimated to cost the EU something in the order of &#163;20 billion a year&#151;a huge sum of money. If we ask people, &#147;Do you want the European Union to control criminal justice policy?&#148; they will say no to that, but if we break down the issue into a series of bite-sized chunks, people are much more amenable to the argument. If we ask about the exchange of data, the contribution of Europol or the role of Eurojust, I  <br>

<p><a name="stpa_o350"><a name="70620-0015.htm_para24"><a name="07062049000661">I happen to believe that asylum policy is also an area on which we should co-operate. It was referred to en passant by my right hon. Friend the Member for Richmond, Yorks (Mr. Hague), who spoke from the Front Bench about the pursuit of a common European asylum policy as though that were somehow a bad thing. Actually, as I have been arguing for the last two years in pamphlets and elsewhere, it would be a good thing. Why? Asylum is a phenomenon that confronts all EU member states and a great many other countries to boot. If we want seriously and effectively to tackle the growing phenomenon of asylum shopping, to share the responsibility for people seeking sanctuary, and to sign up to and enforce the principle of non-refoulement, we need some sort of collective agreement.</p>

Friend suggested, make a great deal of sense. Like my hon. Friend, I am a member of the International Development Committee and I believe that it is manifest and arrant nonsense for the European Union to be represented by two separate individuals giving conflicting impressions. I also think that the rotating presidency as it operates at the moment is corrosive of the interests of the EU and, yes, we can look for a simpler, better and more efficient deal in terms of qualified majority voting.</p>

worked for a telecommunications company for many years, and my job was to try to create a pan-European strategy so that we could better service our international customers. That was extremely difficult to manage, because when I tried to get those in other European countries to comply with a common pan-European strategy, they were not interested.

Today, in anticipation of this debate, I met the Estonian ambassador and three Estonian MPs. I tried as hard as possible to convince them, on the House of Commons Terrace, to be more Eurosceptic, and to be against the constitution. I failed miserably. The Estonians are very keen on the constitution, and 85 per cent. of Estonian citizens want a constitution.</p>

That is fine&#151;I understand and respect that position. But it is not the position in which our country&#151;a hugely important military and economic power&#151;finds itself. We should be able to challenge the concept of a constitution and have more sovereignty devolved down to us.</p>

Regional assemblies and regional development agencies are ideas that stemmed from Brussels. They have been imposed on the UK without our having a say in the matter. In Bournemouth, Dorset and the south-west in general, regional assemblies are having a hugely negative impact. They are imposing development plans and building 20,000 houses in our area, without our having any say. That structure has been imposed on the south-west, thereby taking power away from local authorities, simply in order to fit into a European model that I do not agree with at all.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o380"><a name="70620-0017.htm_para1"><a name="07062062000053">My hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham (John Bercow) made an interesting speech in which the discussed further integration on defence matters. He mentioned sharing defence technology. The French Leclerc, the German Leopard, the British Challenger and the American Abrams tanks are all made by different companies, and they are made better because those companies compete with each other. That point must be reconciled with my hon. Friend&#146;s desire for greater integration. I am very concerned that there is a huge overlap&#151;the Minister for Europe, who is back in his place, was partly responsible for that&#151;between what NATO and EUFOR are doing. We cannot have 60,000 troops ready to move as a rapid reaction force without taking away from NATO&#146;s ability. I am not saying that the EU does not have a role to play in, for example, peacekeeping, which it is doing in certain areas, but it cannot participate in war fighting or launching a rapid reaction ability, without jeopardising the current NATO set-up.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o381"><a name="70620-0017.htm_para2"><a name="07062062000054">A great example of that point is Sudan. There is not only a NATO operation with 60 or 70 troops, but&#151;just down the road&#151;an EU operation. They are both sending messages back to different locations in Brussels, both doing exactly the same thing. That is a complete waste of effort. Afghanistan is another example, with EU operations mimicking what NATO is doing. The EU could work much more positively,as I have suggested to the Minister before, by co-ordinating international development. It could do that in a way that no other country or organisation can. The UN is no good at that, because it does not have the might. The EU is sitting on a ton of money; it could co-ordinate the US aid money and all the other international development pots. We are failing in Afghanistan partly because of the lack of co-ordination between the international development groups. The EU could take the lead if it had a robust level of authority and people were allowed to work only through it. That would be a positive role for the EU.</p>

On the issue of energy, I suggested to the Minister when we had the presidency of the EU that a low-lying fruit that we could easily have plucked was the creation of a common gas market. That would have protected gas prices in the UK. Every time there is a problem in Russia, it ripples across Europe and affects gas prices for all our constituents in a way that we cannot control.

<p><a name="stpa_o383"><a name="70620-0017.htm_para4"><a name="07062062000058">The Galileo satellite system is another example of a massive project that is failing. We are trying to mimic the US global positioning system because the French have pushed for that. It is clear from last month&#146;s talks that we have lost the funding for the project.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o384"><a name="70620-0017.htm_para5"><a name="07062062000059">This debate has focused on the summit, but it has also proved that we have wasted two years and Germany is now seizing the initiative. The 27 nations have much in common, but we are also very different. The challenge is where to draw the line. We have mutual interests and they must be maximised without threatening individual authority. I hope that the Foreign Secretary has listened to the debate, and that if a constitution is put before the UK we will have an opportunity to vote in a referendum. Until we finally agree what the EU is really for, how much power it should have, and what the limits on that power should be, we will continue to have a tug of war between states, leaders and parties, inhibiting Europe from reaching its full potential.</p>

 I welcome this debate for two reasons. First, I made my maiden speech in a European debate immediately after the Dutchand French referendum results. I have not had an opportunity to speak on the issue since, although it is a matter of considerable concern to a minority of people in this country. Those who hold views about it do so very strongly, as has been evident from this debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o385"><a name="70620-0017.htm_para6"><a name="07062062000061">Secondly, I welcome the debate because today is the first time that the Government have been prepared to engage in discussion on their negotiating stance before the summit that begins tomorrow. That is in stark contrast to the approach adopted by many other European Governments. I was recently in Denmark with the Public Accounts Committee, and we had the opportunity to meet the Danish Parliament&#146;s EU scrutiny committee. Its chairman told us that the responsible Minister attends the committee every month to brief its members on the Danish stance as negotiations take place. That seems an entirely appropriate way to inform those in the Danish Parliament with an interest in the subject, and it is very regrettable that this Foreign Secretary in particular has chosen to duck the issue and to refuse to discuss itat all.</p>

to establish the Government&#146;s position for two years, and this is the first time that the right hon. Lady has been prepared to discuss it in this Chamber. She has been challenged previously on the matter at Foreign Office questions, and she has declined any opportunity for debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o386"><a name="70620-0017.htm_para7"><a name="07062062000064">We know why the Government have been reluctant to get involved in debate on these matters, and their flip-flopping in respect of Europe was well illustrated earlier by my right hon. Friend the shadow Foreign Secretary. It has become apparent that there is open disagreement between the Prime Minister, the next Prime Minister and the Minister for Europe about whether there should be a referendum, and, if so, on what basis. The Government&#146;s position seems to change from week to week.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o387"><a name="70620-0017.htm_para8"><a name="07062062000065">I want to focus on some of the points that the Foreign Secretary made about the constitutional implications of the proposed treaty and the need for a referendum. She said that she supported having a full-time chairman of the European Council, with the current powers. She could not bring herself to use the word &#147;president&#148;, but my concern is that any move to having a full-time president appointed for, say, the two and a half years set out in the original constitutional treaty would have a profound impact on the conduct of EU business, and on the influence of member states on the determination of future policy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o388"><a name="70620-0017.htm_para9"><a name="07062062000066">Having a full-time chairman of the Council would also instantly remove the revolving presidency. Views are divided about whether that is an efficient way to conduct business in Europe, but it provides a focus for each country, when it assumes the presidency, to get engaged in Europe and to identify its priorities in trying to change and progress the European agenda. To give credit where it is due, the Prime Minister moved Africa and the millennium development goals up the European agenda, something that might not have happened had we not had the presidency, but the ability to do such things would disappear if a full-time president were appointed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o389"><a name="70620-0017.htm_para10"><a name="07062062000067">A president of the Council would have no direct link to the electorate in any member state. Inevitably, that would serve to institutionalise the post and render it bureaucratic and centralised, lacking the legitimacy provided by election. In addition, and by definition, the person performing the role would not be allowed to hold a current national office. That means that he or she would be either retired, or recently rejected by national voters.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o390"><a name="70620-0017.htm_para11"><a name="07062062000068">The president would have power over the some 3,500 civil servants in the Brussels bureaucracy. Inevitably, that would tend to accrete power to the role, as the postholder would seek to direct the civil service to do more. That is an unavoidable consequence whena bureaucracy has a figurehead who is essentially responsible for managing that bureaucracy and who would not be rotated out of position regularly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o391"><a name="70620-0017.htm_para12"><a name="07062062000069">The post of president would fundamentally change the nature of the legislative process in Brussels, with individual member states no longer taking the lead in negotiating with others over issues that come before the Council. Legislation would be developed between the Commission and the Council, with member states having only a tangential relationship to the process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o392"><a name="70620-0017.htm_para13"><a name="07062062000070">My second point relates to the Foreign Secretary&#146;s comments about a common foreign and security policy. She said that the Government were supportive of such a policy, but she indicated that it would need to be achieved by unanimity, which sounds like shorthand for accepting the notion of an EU Foreign Minister and, as we read yesterday in the <i> Financial Times</i>, that is confirmed by the Spanish Minister for Europe who said:</p>
<a name="70620-0017.htm_brev0"><a name="07062062000682"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;We were prepared to find a title other than foreign minister, but we are not prepared to change the substance of his role.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o393"><a name="70620-0017.htm_para14"><a name="07062062000071">If that goes through, it sounds as though the Government will support that position.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o394"><a name="70620-0017.htm_para15"><a name="07062062000072">What would be the consequences if we had an EU Foreign Minister? It would give the Commissiona foreign policy role long opposed by British Governments from both sides. The scope for divergent views would gradually be eroded, despite what the Foreign Secretary said, because the original treaty proposed that the Foreign Minister should have power to make proposals by majority decision rather than by unanimity; to run a powerful EU diplomatic service, which would undoubtedly try to take over the responsibilities of our diplomatic representation; and to speak for members at key international meetings such as the United Nations Security Council. The post itself would put pressure on all those aspects of British Foreign Office representation internationally, which would be difficult to resist. In the past, the Government have always resisted such proposals, but they were prepared to give way at the time of the last constitutional treaty.</p>

<p><a name="st_o292"><a name="07062062000073"><a name="70620-0017.htm_spnew5"><a name="07062062000750"><b>Daniel Kawczynski:</b>
 I am grateful to my hon. Friend and Shropshire neighbour for giving way. Does he agree that, because of our historical relationship with Commonwealth countries, it is extremely important that we retain foreign policy decisions for the House and the Foreign Secretary?</p>

<p><a name="st_o293"><a name="07062062000074"><a name="70620-0017.htm_spnew6"><a name="07062062000751"><b>Mr. Dunne:</b>
 My hon. Friend and neighbour makes an interesting point. The interests of the Commonwealth are of relatively little importance for other European member states; it is for our Government to stand up for the Commonwealth in international forums, and that representation would be lost if the powers of our Foreign Secretaries were gradually transferred to an EU Foreign Minister over time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o395"><a name="70620-0017.htm_para16"><a name="07062062000075">My third point is about the UK veto and blocking powers. The Foreign Secretary talked about support for measures for improving efficiency and subsidiarity, and I am sure that almost everybody in the Chamber would sign up to those. Our concern is how they would translate into practice. The proposal in the original constitutional treaty was to reduce the ability of member states to block legislative proposals they opposed, and that treaty would have done so by approximately a third. At present, there are three hurdles to overcome before securing the passage of legislation: 72 per cent. of weighted votes in Council, plus 62 per cent. of population plus 50 per cent. of member states. The constitutional treaty proposed scrapping one of the hurdles to leave only two: 65 per cent. of population and 55 per cent. of member states.  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="20 Jun 2007">

<notus-date day="20" month="6" year="2007" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>20 Jun 2007 : Column 1466</b><br>
By definition, that would inevitably make it harder for a country&#151;even a large member state such as the UK&#151;to block measures that it felt were not in its national interest.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o396"><a name="70620-0017.htm_para17"><a name="07062062000076">Although the procedures of the European Commission may need some strengthening, it is of concern that we are considering watering down our ability to protect British interests, in particular as they affect British business, where there may be conflicts between one member state and another&#151;between large and small countries or particular styles of conducting business.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o397"><a name="70620-0017.htm_para18"><a name="07062062000077">Three aspects apply and I shall touch on them briefly. The first is the UK&#146;s derogation from the 48-hour working week. A number of countries, notably France and Spain, and the Commission itself want to scrap the derogation. The Department of Trade and Industry has estimated that the cost to the economy of losing our ability to derogate from the 48-hour working week would be &#163;9 billion a year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o398"><a name="70620-0017.htm_para19"><a name="07062062000078">The second point relates to a measure that has recently gone through and will come into force later this year. In the financial services sector, London has overtaken New York as the global capital of finance and has a far more significant role to play than any other capital in Europe&#151;in fact, I think that I am right in saying, than all other capitals in Europe combined. London has by far the biggest influence over the financial markets. The markets in financial instruments directive was significantly amended as a result of the stance that the British Government were able to take. Had the procedures for making decisions been watered down, it may well have been impossible to have secured those amendments. That would have damaged our financial community.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o399"><a name="70620-0017.htm_para20"><a name="07062062000079">The third issue, which is topical, is the temporary workers directive. The UK has some 700,000 more temporary workers than any other country in Europe. The British Chambers of Commerce has said that if states seek to force through equal rights for temporary workers&#151;compared with full-time workers&#151;that will have a significant impact on reducing employment in this country in particular.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o400"><a name="70620-0017.htm_para21"><a name="07062062000080">Yesterday, the president of the CBI, Richard Lambert, was quoted as saying that the revamped constitution poses a major threat to Britain&#146;s labour laws and commercial ethos. He referred in particular to the charter of fundamental rights. That has been characterised as a red line of the Prime Minister&#146;s. However, as was said earlier&#151;notably by my hon. Friend the Member for Stone (Mr. Cash)&#151;there are aspects of the charter of fundamental rights that are already capable of being enshrined in English law. Mr. Lambert said:</p>
<a name="70620-0017.htm_brev1"><a name="07062062000683"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Giving the Charter any kind of legal status would runthe risk of opening up our employment laws to damaging challenges.&#148;</p>

<a name="70620-0017.htm_brev2"><a name="07062062000684"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;We would run the risk of allowing the European Courtof Justice&#151;a purposeful body, looking to stamp its own interpretation on the law&#151;to overrule carefully crafted rules on how strikes operate in the UK.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o402"><a name="70620-0017.htm_para23"><a name="07062062000082">That could, for example, extend to cross-border picketing and the like&#151;not something that anybody in business in this country would welcome.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o403"><a name="70620-0017.htm_para24"><a name="07062062000083">In conclusion, the arguments that the Government are making in relation to the referendum are extraordinarily convoluted and confused. In 2004, the Prime Minister argued that the original treaty did not change the fundamental relationship between the UK and the EU, but he still accepted that there was a need for a referendum. Today and last week, the Foreign Secretary argued precisely the opposite in relation to the treaty, to justify a referendum.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o404"><a name="70620-0017.htm_para25"><a name="07062062000084">According to the next Prime Minister, only if the Government are defeated in their negotiations will he sanction a referendum. That just shows that in 2004 the referendum was granted by the Prime Minister purely for reasons of political expediency. The refusal now to hold a referendum shows the Government&#146;s disdain for the people. While travelling round the country, the next Prime Minister has been claiming that he wants to listen to the people. He should have the courage to do so and allow a referendum if there is any transfer of power to Brussels through the treaty.</p>

 I am pleased to be called to speak in the debate. I must apologise to you and the House for not being present throughout, Madam Deputy Speaker. Among other things, I have been speaking in an Adjournment debate concerning a matter in Hertfordshire on which many thousands of my constituents have written to me.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o405"><a name="70620-0017.htm_para26"><a name="07062062000086">I am pleased to have this opportunity to speak because, beyond any doubt, I feel that there are highly significant constitutional issues at stake&#151;on any view of the situation. The Commission and other member states are seeking significant constitutional changes and our own Prime Minister has been talking of the red lines that he is going to adopt in response. It is absolutely right that we should debate the proposed changes in the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o406"><a name="70620-0017.htm_para27"><a name="07062062000087">I also believe that an issue of trust is at stake. There is a perception in some quarters that there is a need to restore trust in government. We have heard a little about that&#151;we might hear more. The question of the referendum touches on the issue of trust. My hon. Friend the Member for Ludlow (Mr. Dunne) rightly reminded the House that the Prime Minister promised the country a referendum on the constitutional treaty in April 2004. It is worth bearing in mind the fact that the referendum was promised no matter what happened in other countries that voted on the treaty beforehand. When my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory) asked whether a no vote in a &#147;small country&#148; would stop the referendum, the Prime Minister said:</p>
<a name="70620-0017.htm_brev3"><a name="07062062000685"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The referendum should go ahead in any event.&#148;&#151;[<i> Official Report</i>, 20 April 2004; Vol. 420, c. 164.]</p>

The Government seem to have adopted that key phrase, which has been repeated by both the Prime Minister and the Foreign Secretary, as the criterion against which the need for a referendum should be judged.</p>

I am tempted to say that the Government&#146;s approach seems to be that they will know the characteristics when they see them, but they have been a little more forthcoming in the past. The previous Foreign Secretary, the right hon. Member for Blackburn (Mr. Straw), was asked that very question in June 2005 when the Government were setting out the course that they proposed to take following the no votes in France and the Netherlands. His colleague the hon.

What matters is not the label applied&#151;the way this is dressed up&#151;but whether any agreement includes the substance of what was originally proposed in the constitutional treaty: the merger of the high representative of the European Union and the foreign affairs Commissioner to create a quite different individual in a different constitutional position. Any reasonable person would regard that as a significant constitutional change in itself, but it is not a change that stands in isolation.

<p><a name="stpa_o412"><a name="70620-0018.htm_para2"><a name="07062062000095">That was a significant step because it would enable the president of the European Union and the Foreign Minister of the European Union to go around the world representing Europe, to speak on behalf of a body with a legal personality and to conclude treaties on behalf of a body with a legal personality.

<a name="70620-0018.htm_brev1"><a name="07062062000687"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The Constitutional Treaty proposed making elements of criminal law subject to qualified majority voting in the Council of Ministers, and the Commission still supports this proposal. The evidence we have seen does not persuade us that, as things stand at present, there are sufficient benefits in terms of tackling crime, either here in the UK or across the EU, to justify such a major transfer of power away from Member States as would be entailed by a switch of criminal law from the third to the first pillar.&#148;</p>

 I shall not try to persuade my hon. Friend to change his view on that. I am trying to bring unanimity. The case that he is arguing is that we should not have a referendum at all on these issues, which is my position, or we should have a referendum in either circumstance. The Government have been trying to have a referendum when it is convenient to them and not have one when it is not convenient to them. Thatis the most intolerable position to uphold.

 I am happy to agree entirely and unreservedly with my right hon. Friend. He has expressed an honourable point of view. I was far from convinced by some of the exchanges that we heard across the Dispatch Box earlier today, particularly when my right hon.

It does not matter what happened then; what matters is what this Prime Minister promised this House and the country when he made his commitment in the House, which&#151;I shall be corrected if I am wrong&#151;also appeared in the Labour party manifesto at the last general election. That is an issue of trust here and now for this Prime Minister. He did not stand up and say, &#147;I promise you a referendum on the constitutional treaty, but I may change my mind in view of everything that has happened in the past.&#148; He made an unequivocal pledge and an issue of trust arises as a result.</p>

The criminal law obtains to a nation itself, and a nation should make its own decisions on that. It is a characteristic of a nation that it has the opportunity to make decisions on the criminal law and to decide what types of conduct it wishes to criminalise and whichit does not, after debate in individual national Parliaments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o416"><a name="70620-0018.htm_para6"><a name="07062062000105">In practice, as a result of the merging of the third pillar into the first pillar, qualified majority voting and the acquisition of existing community law, criminal procedure and substantive criminal law could be decided not in this House but in Europe where we may find ourselves in the minority, and as a result of qualified majority voting the criminal law of this country could be changed even though there was a majority in the House and in the country against such a change. That is a fundamental line to cross.</p>

 I agree with my hon. Friend. If one builds into that the European arrest and evidence warrants, one finds that not only is the criminal law being changed against the wishes of the majority of the British people, but they would then find themselves being subjected to arrest warrants from other countries because of the abolition by the Government of the dual criminality safeguard.</p>

 I am particularly pleased to have an opportunity to participate in the debate, because as a former Member of the European Parliament between 1999 and 2004 European policy was my life for that period. I am pleased that a number of Tory Members were elected when my right hon. Friend the Member for Richmond, Yorks (Mr. Hague) was leading the party.

That is beneficialin some cases&#151;for example, the environment&#151;but in other cases it means that our businesses are wrapped in bureaucracy and red tape, which prevents them from generating the wealth that we need.</p>

In a Parliament such as the European Parliament, where no party is in overall control, the co-decision process works very well. I was environment deputy co-ordinator for the European People&#146;s party and European Democrats group, and we achieved a lot through the co-decision process. I was often telephoned on a Monday morning by Ministers from UK, who said, &#147;We are having no luck with our Socialist group. They are all toeing the line.

 In a Parliament with no overall majority, the smaller groups often have a disproportionate impact and influence on legislation. Compromises are often struck not in meetings, but in coffee bars. Although it is true that if the Socialist group and the EPP were to get together they would have a majority, in many cases smaller groups such as the Greens or the Liberals have a lot of influence. I look forward to the formation of our new group in the European Parliament. We can work with our former colleagues in the EPP on matters on which we agree, but it is important when we disagree that we can put a man on the front row of the European Parliament to argue the case for the UK. I look forward to the formation of a group involving Czechs and other colleagues and hope that it will contribute to our voice being better represented in the European Parliament and the British interest being better represented generally.</p>

it might be necessary to change the rules in order to do so. The right hon. Member for Suffolk, Coastal has had that experience, and understands that one country out of 27 blocking measures to deal with climate change is a totally effective way of stopping the kind of progress that is necessary.

 The Minister is deliberately oversimplifying what took place over the past five hours. It is wrong to suggest that Opposition Members who have expressed concerns about the constitution are anti-European or anti-European Union.

 I asked the hon. Gentleman a question. He spoke eloquently about the need to take effective action to deal with immigration. Others among his colleagues have talked about the need to protect this country from international terrorism. The truth, however, is that measures to take effective action in those areas can be blocked by one member state out of 27. If we are serious about dealing with international terrorists who cross borders, we must take decisions by qualified majority voting; otherwise, a single country can stop it. He cannot speak eloquently in favour of dealing with immigration and tackling terrorism unless he is prepared to will the means to do so. So far, he has not done that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o454"><a name="70620-0019.htm_para17"><a name="07062062000178">After the United Kingdom joined the European Community under a Conservative Government, the first treaty changes took place in 1986 when the Single European Act was ratified by Parliament. Despite the then Prime Minister&#146;s reputation for being a hard-line Eurosceptic, the noble Baroness Thatcher agreed to the substantive changes introduced by that Act, which set out a timetable for the creation of the single market, with most legislation being voted on by qualified majority. The Act considerably extended the scope of European decision making and the use of qualified majority voting in key areas from the environment to health and safety at work. The latter is, for example, the legal basis for the working time directive. The hon. Member for Ludlow (Mr. Dunne) claimed that double majority voting would lead to the loss of our opt-out on the working time directive. I assure him that that is simply not the case. It would not change our blocking minority.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o455"><a name="70620-0019.htm_para18"><a name="07062062000179">In fact, the Single European Act gave rise to almost 300 pieces of legislation as part of the efforts between  <br>

1986 and 1992 to complete the single market. The right hon. Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory) said that the Single European Act contained only 12 new areas of qualified majority voting. Actually, it gaverise to hundreds of different directives&#151;significant legislation transforming our relationship with the European Union. The Single European Act also gave extensive new powers to the European Parliament. For the first time in our history, Members of the European Parliament could have a real say on European legislation, rather than simply being consulted, as was the case previously.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o456"><a name="70620-0019.htm_para19"><a name="07062062000180">Two years later, the noble Baroness Thatcher declared:</p>

The approach of Opposition Members has changed dramatically. Far too many of them seem to believe that little Englanders can somehow solve the cross-border problems of the 21st century in splendid isolation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o458"><a name="70620-0019.htm_para21"><a name="07062062000182">The right hon. Member for Richmond, Yorks, for example, talked of the need to create a flexible European Union. He probably dreams about it, but that is the only thing that he is capable of doing at the moment, as he seems to have failed to notice that in order to get a flexible European Union, we would have to change the treaties. Those treaties would have to be changed by unanimity, there would have to be a constitutional debate, and he would have to secure the support of 26 other countries. So far, he has secured the support of one&#151;on a good day, with the wind in the right direction, and with an &#147;R&#148; in the month. All subsequent treaty changes have been ratified through Parliament: the Maastricht treaty in 1993, the Amsterdam treaty in 1998 and the Nice treaty in 2002.</p>

It provided for the introduction of a common and foreign security policy and a European security and defence policy, and a new competence for the European Union in justice and home affairs. The first reference in the European Union&#146;s history was made to the European convention on human rights, on which the charter of fundamental rights is based. Qualified majority voting was introduced in 32 articles, 15 articles were moved to co-decision, and for the first time in history the European Parliament was given legislative powers equal to that of the Council on a range of policies. The Maastricht treaty introduced European citizenship and the European Union. It was ratified by this House in July 1993.</p>

The truth is that the overwhelming majority of Labour Members of Parliament voted against a referendum at the time.

referendum&#151;in this respect, my view is not so far from that of the hon. Member for Aldridge-Brownhills (Mr. Shepherd)&#151;is whether significant constitutional change is involved. We had a referendum in 1975, there have been referendums on Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, there is provision for a referendum in the Northern Ireland Act 1998, and we have committed ourselves to a referendum on the euro. Those are all fundamental changes, but not the sort of day-to-day changes that have been made in the House on a three-line Tory Whip without a referendum.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o465"><a name="70620-0020.htm_para4"><a name="07062062000199">That is the area of principle with which Conservative Front Benchers have failed to deal.

 Does the Minister accept that the Government ultimately decided that they had to have a referendum on the constitutional treaty because it was demonstrated&#151;I think that I played some small part in this&#151;that as there was a repeal provision there was a fundamental change in the structural relationship? I have tried to demonstrate that again today. Will the Minister not accept that the distinction between that constitutional treaty and what is now being proposedis a distinction without a sufficient difference and therefore, on the Government&#146;s own terms, a referendum is required?</p>

 I do not accept that argument. I have set out a proper principle, and it is reflected in the constitutional arrangements of several other countries: the requirement for a referendum follows a judgment that there is significant constitutional change. That is true of the Netherlands and Denmark. If the hon. Gentleman were to look at the practice in our country, he would recognise that it is the same here.</p>

 Our debate shows that each party and Member has a different threshold for what, in their opinion, constitutes a major constitutional change. Therefore, we have to make judgments on that as individual Members. The Conservative Front Bench has avoided explaining what would happen in the unlikely event that they were to return to office. Whenever there is a new IGC, a new treaty, or a change or a tweaking, would they put that to a referendum? I hope that the Minister will encourage a Conservative Front-Bench Member to stand up and answer that. What would they do? If there were a Conservative Government, would they put a comparable change to a referendum?</p>

 While the Conservatives are in opposition, they certainly will say that they would do that, because in opposition they can make political capital out of such matters. That is what is happening.

 I am slightly sorry that I gave way. I gave the hon. Gentleman the opportunity to set out in a few brief sentences the principle underlying his position, as he has failed to give any principle. All he has done is simply give an exposition on why it is now importantto have a referendum. The Conservative party has changed its position so frequently on this subject that it is difficult to know what he might like to say on it.</p>

 The Minister is being most generous in giving way.

 The position in the manifesto was straightforward: that we would hold a referendum on a constitutional treaty. I have demonstrated that we have had a series of amending treaties&#151;it has been pointed out that the original treaty of Rome has been amended. None of those amending treaties has required a referendum. The most significant of them, with the extensive constitutional change that I set out, was passed through this House in the usual parliamentary process with a three-line Whip on Conservative Members to vote down the proposal for a referendum. That is the clear history of this matter. The Conservative party&#146;s current position is driven simply by political opportunism.</p>

the Maastricht treaty, as did the hon. Member for Aldridge-Brownhills. They were consistent&#151;they voted in way that is consistent with the position now being argued by Conservative Front Benchers. It is the latter who have a problem. They are simply using this as an opportunity to make political capital. So long as we all recognise that and are straightforward about it, there is no problem, but to try to dress it up in any other way is simple political dishonesty.</p>

 May we focus on some specifics? Of course, in areas that do not fall within the exclusive competence of the European Union, the principle of subsidiarity and proportionality should apply, but all of us in our different parties know that as things stand, the subsidiarity provision in the treaties of Maastricht, Amsterdam and Nice is manifestly unsatisfactory and weak. Will the right hon. Gentleman argue for a yellow-card proposal, for a red-card proposal or for what else? An answer might offer some reassurance to the House and to the country.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman, as ever, raises a good and a principled point. There will certainly be a thorough discussion at the European Council summit of proposals to strengthen the role of national Parliaments. That issue was raised by a number of Members, and it is important that that discussion takes place, not least because of the votes in the Netherlands and France.

They have been negotiated within the Government, and they are the clear position of this Government and will not be breached. Again, the difference between this Government and the Conservatives is that they simply have not understood or reflected the strong tradition of parliamentary democracy in this country. John Major said at the time of the Maastricht treaty that it is not in our parliamentary tradition to hold referendums in this country. The then Foreign Secretary, the noble Lord Hurd, put it rather well:</p>

 I am delighted to have secured this Adjournment debate this evening on an important issue for my constituents. The debate arises from the sale of the remaining shares held by Liberal Democrat-controlled Hull city council in the local telecommunications company, Kingston Communications. That action was taken without any public debate or discussion, and it deserves some public scrutiny. I know that the Secretary of State for Education and Skills, my right hon. Friend the Member for Kingston upon Hull, West and Hessle (Alan Johnson) and the Deputy Prime Minister, my right hon. Friend the Member for Kingston upon Hull, East (Mr. Prescott) are also concerned about that decision and the effect that it will have on local services and jobs, especially at a time when the global activities of private equity companies are causing such public concern.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o475"><a name="70620-0020.htm_para14"><a name="07062062000224">At the outset, it is certainly worth setting out a little of the proud history of the local telephone company in Hull. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, like many major cities, Hull developed its own local telephone company, and in 1902 the council gained its first licence to operate services, with the first exchange opening in 1904. To celebrate its golden jubilee, Hull Corporation produced a &#147;golden pages&#148;, a forerunner to the &#147;Yellow Pages&#148;, which was printed on gold paper and distributed with a classified business section. Hull has often pioneered good ideas like that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o476"><a name="70620-0020.htm_para15"><a name="07062062000225">Hull became famous for having its own municipally owed telephone company&#151;the only remaining one in the UK&#151;with its own distinctive cream-coloured telephone boxes, designed by Sir Giles Gilbert Scott, who also created BT&#146;s more famous red ones. It also had tariffs that meant that customers could speak for as long as they wanted to other customers in the local area, long before the BT friends and family packages. Local people enjoyed better service for having a local telephone company.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o477"><a name="70620-0020.htm_para16"><a name="07062062000226">The company has continued to innovate, and was the first telephone network in the world to deploy 100 per cent. digital exchanges. In 1987 the Hull City Telephone Department became Kingston Communications plc, a company in its own right, although still 100 per cent. owned by the council. In 1999 the council took the decision to sell the telephone company, but retained a sizeable shareholding of 44.9 per cent. Many of my constituents bought shares too, such was the local commitment to a local business.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o478"><a name="70620-0020.htm_para17"><a name="07062062000227">Until a few weeks ago, Hull city council&#146;s shareholding in Kingston Communications stood at31 per cent. The link between the people of Hull, as service users and employees, and Kingston Communications had lasted for 105 years, but under the Lib Dem council elected in May 2007 the link survived for only 19 days. A link that had survived two world wars was broken by the Lib Dems within 3 weeks.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o479"><a name="70620-0020.htm_para18"><a name="07062062000228">I want to raise two points in this debate. First, I am particularly concerned about the hasty decision made  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="20 Jun 2007">

by the Lib Dem council in Hull, which cashed in the remaining shareholding in Kingston Communications without any room for public debate or discussion. In particular, I want to explore the tension in law that exists when a local authority that owns shares in a publicly listed company has to make decisions about its shareholding. Apparently it must do that in private, but as a local authority it is democratically accountable to the wider electorate. That is a possible blind spot in local democracy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o480"><a name="70620-0020.htm_para19"><a name="07062062000229">Secondly, I want to explore what I believe is the lack of strategic thinking by the Liberal Democrats in Hull when they took the decision. They have been timid in their decision making, and have failed to look at what is really in the city&#146;s best interests when it comes to developing a positive telecommunications and digital future for the area. They had the opportunity, by building on the historic telecommunications company, to work on and develop a pioneering approach in Hull. Other cities could only envy that, and I shall say a little more about that later.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o481"><a name="70620-0020.htm_para20"><a name="07062062000230">I do not intend to go through the pros and cons of the sale, merely to ask how a democratically elected council could take major decisions about its shareholding in a company with apparently no discussion or debate with the people on whose behalf they hold the shares. Given the company&#146;s long history with the people of Hull, and its current status as the city&#146;s only provider of telephone and internet services, the matter must surely be worth some discussion and debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o482"><a name="70620-0020.htm_para21"><a name="07062062000231">The sale took place very soon after the May 2007 local elections. There was no opportunity for a debate about the future of Hull city council&#146;s assets, and there was no mention of the issue in the Liberal Democrat election manifesto. The people of Hull have been denied a chance to have their say on a matter that directly affects their services and provides employment in the community. The suddenness of events and the lack of transparency have had the effect of making local democracy seem somehow irrelevant.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o483"><a name="70620-0020.htm_para22"><a name="07062062000232">I understand that there are rules that have to be applied when dealing with the disposal of shares, and I know that the Liberal Democrats in Hull have claimed that their hands were tied in this matter and that they could not go public with their plans. Of course I acknowledge that there are rules concerning the disposal of shares, but I also understand that the Financial Services Authority would have had no problem if the Liberal Democrat manifesto had contained a line setting out the council&#146;s intention to review its assets with a view to achieving the best rate of return, and to evaluate its shareholding in Kingston Communications.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o484"><a name="70620-0020.htm_para23"><a name="07062062000233">Clearly, a manifesto promise may not be realised, if the party that makes the promise is not returned to power. Alternatively, a party may not be able to follow through its manifesto, for all sorts of reasons. However, it is strange that the Liberal Democrats, who are always preaching to politicians about freedom of information, should have failed so miserably, when in power, to practise what they preach.</p>

The answer is that we have some idea of what goes on among the local freemasons,  <br>

but we have no idea of what goes on in the Kingston Communications shareholding committee.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o486"><a name="70620-0021.htm_para1"><a name="07062062000235">It is surprising that the local Liberal Democrat manifesto stated that the party was going to ensure that its councillors engaged in &#147;meaningful consultation&#148; with local people. It claimed that</p>
<a name="70620-0021.htm_brev0"><a name="07062062000708"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;for too long in Hull, decisions have been taken behind closed doors with little regard to the views of the people whose communities and families they affect.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o487"><a name="70620-0021.htm_para2"><a name="07062062000236">Well, 19 days into its time in office, the Liberal Democrat council blew that one, did it not?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o488"><a name="70620-0021.htm_para3"><a name="07062062000237">My concern is simply that, in an age when all political parties want to gain the trust of local people, strengthen local democracy and engage and consultin a meaningful way, the action taken by the Liberal Democrats in Hull is arrogant. If there had been discussion in the local election campaign about such an important issue, at least there would have been some debate and discussion about an asset built up by generations of Hull people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o489"><a name="70620-0021.htm_para4"><a name="07062062000238">My second point stems directly from that, and has to do with the possibilities flowing from the historical local telephone company and the resulting asset base that the council owned in Kingston Communications.I understand that the portfolio holder for Hull city council was advised that the dividend on the shareholding in Kingston Communications could be higher if the council sold its shares and reinvested in the market. However, I understand that other options, which could have been bolder and more focused on the future needs of the city and its people, were available.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o490"><a name="70620-0021.htm_para5"><a name="07062062000239">With a 31 per cent. shareholding in Kingston Communications, the council had a real opportunity to look at some interesting ideas to benefit the city where the company was born and had prospered. Since Iwas elected in May 2005, many of my constituentshave contacted me about the monopoly position of Kingston Communications in Hull. It is the only telecommunications and internet provider in the area, with uncontested dominance in the local market.Now the influence of local people through a major shareholding in the company has been lost; we have a straightforward privately owned monopoly supplier in the city, with no guarantees about choice or quality of telephone and internet services. Moreover, peoplehave no say in what happens to local Kingston Communications jobs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o491"><a name="70620-0021.htm_para6"><a name="07062062000240">One option Hull city council could have considered was how to use its shareholding to force the management of Kingston Communications to realign the corporate strategy towards what is called an open horizontal model. That would have meant that the cabling in the city was brought under the ownership of the city&#151;perhaps by forming a separate company to do that&#151;to ensure that it benefited all who wanted to use it. There could have been investment to install fibre-optic cabling and to ensure that it was made available to all who needed it. The process is akin to the roads being available to whoever wishes to use them, with services provided by lots of different businesses that use the roads.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o492"><a name="70620-0021.htm_para7"><a name="07062062000241">I am informed that similar models are under development in cities in Europe, such as Amsterdam. An open access model would allow investment to fund an infrastructure upgrade in the city region and allow  <br>

<notus-date day="20" month="6" year="2007" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>20 Jun 2007 : Column 1489</b><br>
for telecom companies to compete with each other for customers by buying access to the fibre-optic network. It would allow the use of other service providers in Hull, so there would no longer be a monopoly supplier as at present. The model would yield great socio-economic wealth to the community of Hull, and put the city on the global map as the first in the UK to adopt it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o493"><a name="70620-0021.htm_para8"><a name="07062062000242">The idea has great merit in terms of what would best help the city develop economically and speed up its much needed regeneration. It would put the council at the centre of the process, acting as the guardian for the city, making sure that the cabling in the city was used for everyone. It could secure employment in the city, which of course is now not guaranteed. Kingston Communications is obviously focusing its business on the corporate sector and much of the company&#146;s investment is directed away from Hull at present. The model would ensure that existing and new investments in telecom services and networks were kept in Hull and Humberside. It would be good for the regional economy and local jobs&#151;the modern, skilled local jobs that is Hull is crying out for.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o494"><a name="70620-0021.htm_para9"><a name="07062062000243">I have set out only one option, but an imaginative and thoughtful debate could have taken place in the city if we had had a far-sighted local authority that was really looking to regenerate the economy in Hull by using digital technology and investing in the wider community. The Lib Dems have again wasted a real opportunity, with a short-term approach to an historic asset of the city. Councillor Sloan, the portfolio holder, said:</p>
<a name="70620-0021.htm_brev1"><a name="07062062000709"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The decision to sell the council&#146;s remaining stake in Kingston Communications was made because it was in the best interests of the city, its people, local businesses, local shareholders and indeed the company.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o495"><a name="70620-0021.htm_para10"><a name="07062062000244">I am not sure that it was in the best interests of thecity, local people or local businesses simply to grabthe money and run. The council could have done something much more imaginative and much bolder. The Lib Dem council in Hull has wasted an opportunity.</p>

 I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Kingston upon Hull, North (Ms Johnson) on the way in which she put her case to the House. She clearly has deep concerns, and the passion with which she spoke and her commitment to her constituents does her enormous credit. Her views are shared by other Hull Members. The Secretary of State for Education and Skills, my right hon. Friend the Member for Kingston upon Hull, West and Hessle, has moved to the Back Benches today&#151;unusually and, I hope, temporarily&#151;to show his commitment and his deep feelings about the issue, which are shared by the Deputy Prime Minister, my right hon. Friend the Member for Kingston upon Hull, East (Mr. Prescott).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o496"><a name="70620-0021.htm_para11"><a name="07062062000246">All local authorities, including Hull, have to make complex decisions about how best to manage their assets and investments, but those are matters for the judgment of each authority; central Government have  <br>

no powers to intervene. We want authorities to have as much flexibility as possible to manage their investments, which was one of the freedoms we conferred under the prudential capital finance system in 2004. Before that, investments were subject to a complex system of regulation that we inherited from the previous Administration. Now, instead of regulations, we have statutory guidance, which is in simple language and gives authorities considerable discretion to make decisions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o497"><a name="70620-0021.htm_para12"><a name="07062062000247">Authorities are allowed to pursue any form of investment that they consider appropriate. They may also cash in existing investments whenever they want. No Government consents are required at any stage. It is a matter for the political judgment of the local authority. However, the investment guidance contains important safeguards for local taxpayers. It requires the authority to produce a yearly investment strategy, which must be put to the full council. The strategy must set out the general investment policies of the authority and explain how risks will be monitored and managed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o498"><a name="70620-0021.htm_para13"><a name="07062062000248">I listened carefully to what my hon. Friend the Member for Kingston upon Hull, North said she that would like the Government to do, and I understand how deeply concerned she is. However, puttingany constraints on the disposal of shares by local authorities would be inconsistent with the freedoms that we have recently conferred on them. When making decisions on whether to acquire, keep or dispose of an investment, an authority&#146;s main concern should be security and seeking to minimise the risk of losing money that it holds in trust for the local community. Having addressed that, the authority may seek to maximise its return from its investments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o499"><a name="70620-0021.htm_para14"><a name="07062062000249">All of an authority&#146;s investments need to be monitored carefully, and authorities must be ready to respond to changing market circumstances. That may sometimes lead to long-standing investment policies being reversed or changed. These are complex matters, which require specialised professional advice. There can be differences of opinion between technical experts. It is important that, for any sale to take place, the council must fully investigate all the options that are open to it. When making decisions about the disposal of any asset, we would expect the authority to consider the impact that the disposal would have onthe community, the broader local economy and, of course, jobs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o500"><a name="70620-0021.htm_para15"><a name="07062062000250">I understand my hon. Friend&#146;s regret at what she feels is a lost opportunity to consider other alternatives. I was struck by her comments about the opportunities available in Amsterdam. If she can undertake that kind of research in the time she has had available, she may want to ask her local authority what opportunities it took to research the available alternatives. Clearly it is too late for that to have an impact on the sale, but she may want to look into the matter to reassure herself and her constituents about whether alternatives were considered.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o501"><a name="70620-0021.htm_para16"><a name="07062062000251">I appreciate the fact that the council could not have laid out its exact plans in this matter, but I was interested to hear my hon. Friend say that her understanding from the Financial Services Authority was that a commitment in the manifesto to review all assets would have been acceptable and would not have caused any difficulties. I want to refer to a story in a  <br>

<a name="70620-0021.htm_brev2"><a name="07062062000710"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;A few months ago Lib Dem leader Carl Minns was dismissing the idea of selling off the city council&#146;s remaining stake in Kingston Communications as &#145;typical Old Labour thinking&#146;.&#148;</p>

It is a matter for the discretion and judgment of the local authority, and the administration in Hull has decided to proceed in this way. If she wants to raise any complaints about financial impropriety, and would like the Audit Commission to look at them, she can look at the rules and regulations to see whether the complaints can be investigated. However, I am not aware that Hull city council has acted improperly financially. We are talking about a matter of judgment, and the council&#146;s judgment is clearly at odds with that of my hon.
