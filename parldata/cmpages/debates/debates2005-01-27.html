<p>1. <a name="50127-01_wqn0"><b> Mr. Tam Dalyell  (Linlithgow)</b> 
 (Lab): What action her Department is taking to support British firms in bids for reconstruction projects in Iraq.  [211107]
</p>


<p><a name="50127-01_spmin0"><b>The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry  (Ms Patricia Hewitt): </b> 
 Through UK Trade and Investment, we provide a range of advice and support to British firms that are interested in helping with reconstruction work in Iraq. That advice takes full account of the security situation in Iraq and the terms of Foreign and Commonwealth Office travel advice.
</p>





<p><a name="50127-01_spnew0"><b> Mr. Dalyell: </b> 
 Realistically, as long as we are seen as an occupying army, and especially in light of those appalling pictures, which have had a dreadful effect in the Arab world, is there any possibility of proper reconstruction until the forces have been withdrawn and Iraq has a Government of its own?
</p>





<p><a name="50127-01_spnew1"><b> Ms Hewitt: </b> 
 I share the condemnation by my hon. Friend and many others of any abuse of prisoners that has taken place. Of course, the security situation is difficult, but the reality in Iraq is that its economy is growing and its water and sanitation services are significantly better than they were under Saddam Hussein. We have got thousands of schools and hospitals working, and we have got more Iraqis in jobs. I am proud of the fact that many British companies are bringing their expertise to help with that reconstruction.
</p>





<p><a name="50127-01_spnew2"><b> Richard Ottaway  (Croydon, South)</b> 
 (Con): If I can take the opposite view to the hon. Member for Linlithgow (Mr. Dalyell), such is the state of Iraq&#039;s infrastructure that it can be remedied only by private investment. Private investors will invest only if the situation is militarily secure and remains so. Does the right hon. Lady agree that the armed forces will have to stay there for a considerable period while the infrastructure is repaired?


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>27 Jan 2005 : Column 436</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br></p>





<p><a name="50127-01_spnew3"><b> Ms Hewitt: </b> 
 My right hon. Friend the Prime Minister has made it clear that we will continue to support the Iraqi people in moving towards self-government. The elections that will take place this weekend are another step in that direction and, of course, we will continue to support the Iraqi people and the new Iraqi Government. They will have to make the judgment about how long they want coalition forces to support them but, for the moment, we will continue to provide that support both directly and by training Iraq&#039;s own police and security forces.
</p>





<p><a name="50127-01_spnew4"><b> Liz Blackman  (Erewash)</b> 
 (Lab): TQ Education and Training Ltd in Long Eaton in my constituency has just been awarded a $10&nbsp;million contract to provide training for the Ministry of Electricity in Iraq. It was extremely pleased with the support that UK Trade and Investment gave it by providing information on logistics and the trading environment and putting it in touch with the appropriate contacts in the Iraqi Government. Is that not an excellent example of the DTI supporting British firms so that they can play their part in much-needed reconstruction in Iraq?
</p>





<p><a name="50127-01_spnew5"><b> Ms Hewitt: </b> 
 Indeed it is. May I, through my hon. Friend, congratulate TQ Education and Training, which will be doing enormously important work with the Ministry of Electricity, just as other firms will help staff in the Ministry of Oil to gain the expertise that they need? That has been possible only because of the superb work of UK Trade and Investment and I am sure that she agrees that it would be disastrous if the Opposition had their way and effectively abolished it.
</p>





<p><a name="50127-01_spnew6"><b> Malcolm Bruce  (Gordon)</b> 
 (LD): Does the Secretary of State acknowledge that, while the Export Credits Guarantee Department has announced $100&nbsp;million of additional short-term cover for Iraq contracts, &#163;1&nbsp;billion, with interest, of historic debts have had to be written off in Iraq and &#163;3.1&nbsp;billion of outstanding ECGD debts are deemed irrecoverable? Can she tell us how much British taxpayers may have to put at risk and, more particularly, will she undertake to report to the House the extent of any future write-offs? This is not a blank cheque for British companies, and it may not be secure because of the security situation.
</p>





<p><a name="50127-01_spnew7"><b> Ms Hewitt: </b> 
 I hope that the hon. Gentleman welcomes the fact that the Paris Club recently agreed to forgive 80&nbsp;per cent. of Iraq&#039;s outstanding debts, as that is important in enabling reconstruction to take place. In the long term, with the enormous resources that Iraq has, there is no reason at all why it should not be able to repay debts. The ECGD, within a stringent risk and commercial framework, makes careful judgments on every country where it is asked to provide cover and, of course, on companies&#039; individual applications.
</p>





<p><a name="50127-01_spnew8"><b> Mr. David Clelland  (Tyne Bridge)</b> 
 (Lab): My right hon. Friend rightly acknowledged the contribution that British businesses make to construction and reconstruction in Iraq. PB Power in my constituency has received a grant from the Department, and the company is now using its considerable skills to create a national 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>27 Jan 2005 : Column 437</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>electricity generation and distribution system in Iraq to power hospitals, workplaces, homes and schools for the ordinary citizens of Iraq.
</p>





<p><a name="50127-01_spnew9"><b> Ms Hewitt: </b> 
 I congratulate PB Power, which is doing immensely important work, along with many other companies. I hope that the whole House will join me in paying tribute to the British firms and British workers who are working alongside the Iraqi people and helping to rebuild that country in difficult and often dangerous circumstances.

<a name="50127-01_sbhd1"><h4 align=center>News Industry Supply Chain</h4>


<p>2. <a name="50127-01_wqn1"><b> Angela Watkinson  (Upminster)</b> 
 (Con): What plans she has to reform the news industry supply chain.  [211108]
</p>


<p><a name="50127-01_spmin1"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Trade and Industry  (Mr. Gerry Sutcliffe): </b> 
 In August last year, the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry approved recommendations from the Office of Fair Trading to revise the newspaper wholesalers code of practice so as to remove current restrictions on retailers selling on newspaper titles to other retailers within the same wholesaler territory. We hope that removal of those restrictions will help promote the practice of selling on and give retailers increased choice and flexibility of supplier.
</p>





<p><a name="50127-01_spnew10"><b> Angela Watkinson: </b> 
 Mr. Ashia, Mr. Patel and Mr. O&#039;Connor, three independent newsagents in my constituency, have expressed concern about the wholesale monopoly that gives them no choice of supplier. They are backed up by the National Federation of Retail Newsagents, which says that publishers and wholesalers suggest
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;that thousands of small newsagents could be threatened, if current agreements are not given a Block Exemption from scrutiny under the Competition Act 1998&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-01_para0">
whereas, in reality,
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;this is no more than a ruse to allow publishers and wholesalers to maintain their stranglehold over the news industry.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-01_para1">
What would the Minister say to the three newsagents who contacted me?
</p>





<p><a name="50127-01_spnew11"><b> Mr. Sutcliffe: </b> 
 The hon. Lady and other hon. Members have been approached by a large number of organisations including the National Federation of Retail Newsagents, the Newspaper Society and wholesalers. The issue is complicated but we want to preserve maximum choice for retailers, particularly local newsagents. In the repeal of vertical exclusions, we undertook to ask the Office of Fair Trading to discuss the matter with the various sectors involved and to report back to us. We are expecting that report in the very near future and we hope that it will address many of these issues.
</p>





<p><a name="50127-01_spnew12"><b> Mr. Peter Pike  (Burnley)</b> 
 (Lab): My hon. Friend will recognise that local newsagents are an important community service. They are increasingly squeezed by superstores selling newspapers and they are not getting a fair deal from the wholesalers. It is important that we 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>27 Jan 2005 : Column 438</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>get the report as soon as possible so that they get a fair deal, stay in business and continue to provide a local community service.
</p>





<p><a name="50127-01_spnew13"><b> Mr. Sutcliffe: </b> 
 My hon. Friend has championed that cause at Question Time and in debates in the House about the balance between wholesalers and small newsagents. It is important that small newsagents are protected, because of the service that they offer to our communities. We must wait for the OFT report, which I expect to be available soon because the extension of the repeal ends on 1&nbsp;May. I acknowledge the point that is being made and hope that we will reach the right decisions quickly.
</p>





<p><a name="50127-01_spnew14"><b> Mr. Henry Bellingham  (North-West Norfolk)</b> 
 (Con): I am grateful for what the Minister has said so far, but is he aware that, over the past decade, the combined effect of margin squeezes, spiralling carriage costs and poor wholesaler service has forced thousands of small newsagents into bankruptcy and closure? The result is that there are already 1,000&nbsp;postcode sectors in the UK serving more than 4&nbsp;million people that have no access to a newsagent. Does the Minister agree that, along with the closure of sub-post offices and small garages, that is bad news for the small firms sector and for communities, which is why it is so important that he acts?
</p>





<p><a name="50127-01_spnew15"><b> Mr. Sutcliffe: </b> 
 I acknowledge the points that the hon. Gentleman raised. He will be aware of the process that we have to undertake under the competition regime. We also have to ensure maximum consumer choice, so that people can buy a paper or magazine from a local newsagent, supermarket, garage or wherever. I recognise the significant role that local newsagents play in our communities and their wider social role. I hope that the OFT recommendations will give us an opportunity to make sure that local newsagents are protected, but we must wait for the process to take its course.
</p>





<p><a name="50127-01_spnew16"><b> David Taylor  (North-West Leicestershire)</b> 
 (Lab/Co-op): May I declare an interest to the extent that generations of my family ran village post offices and newsagents? Does the Minister agree that it is important that the views of independent newsagents are not misrepresented? There appears to be a risk of that today. They have said that the solution to the supply and distribution problems faced by the industry will not be found by simply enacting a wide-ranging UK block exemption that prevents scrutiny of a market that is already highly concentrated and restricted, so they are in favour of reform of the kind that is anticipated. That is the case, is it not?
</p>





<p><a name="50127-01_spnew17"><b> Mr. Sutcliffe: </b> 
 My hon. Friend takes a great interest in newspapers. I enjoy our early morning Tea Room meetings reading them. He is right that, when the Secretary of State took the decision last year, 12&nbsp;months were given before implementation to allow the industry an opportunity to come together and work out a good relationship. That is why the Office of Fair Trading was involved. I am aware that some people feel that the block exemption needs to be continued, but I know that the OFT is taking all these matters into consideration, and when it produces its report, we will make a judgment on it.

<a name="50127-02_sbhd0"><h4 align=center>Business Support (Overseas Exhibitions)</h4>


<p>3. <a name="50127-02_wqn0"><b> Mr. Nigel Evans  (Ribble Valley)</b> 
 (Con): What the total budget available to support businesses exhibiting overseas was in each year since 1997.  [211109]
</p>


<p><a name="50127-02_spmin0"><b>The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry  (Ms Patricia Hewitt): </b> 
 The total annual budget to support exhibitions and seminars abroad, including overseas missions, has been between &#163;16&nbsp;million and &#163;21.6&nbsp;million for each year since 1997. The budget for 2004&#150;05&nbsp;is &#163;20&nbsp;million.
</p>





<p><a name="50127-02_spnew0"><b> Mr. Evans: </b> 
 Does the Secretary of State agree that we need to support British exporters and that overseas exhibitions are a tremendous showcase for them to display their goods and an opportunity for networking? If the budget is cut, it will disincentivise businesses in respect of exhibiting overseas. If we do not support our exporters, we can be certain that the Germans, French and Italians, and our other competitors around the world, will support their businesses. Can we have a fresh commitment from the Government that they will not slash that budget?
</p>





<p><a name="50127-02_spnew1"><b> Ms Hewitt: </b> 
 I entirely agree with the hon. Gentleman about the need to maintain our support for British exporters and our support for inward investors alongside that. I invite him to cross the Floor and to join my hon. Friends on the Labour Benches and to join me in opposing the disastrous plans of the Opposition virtually to abolish UK Trade and Investment, and with it, support for more than 30,000&nbsp;British firms with their exports.
</p>





<p><a name="50127-02_spnew2"><b> Mr. Martin O&#039;Neill  (Ochil)</b> 
 (Lab): Does my right hon. Friend recognise that the improvement in the organisation and accountability of much of the outward trade mission organisation is welcome? Indeed, the back-up that it has received over recent years from embassy staff has been of the highest order. There is an anxiety, however, that the electoral irrelevance of the Opposition means that it is down to us to reassure people that we will continue to give them the backing and support that they currently enjoy, and that the worries of organisations such as regional development agencies and the Scottish Council for Development and Industry about a reduction in even a Labour Government&#039;s budget are unfounded. She should be able to reassure such organisations that the passport to export is going to be facilitated and supported as well as it has been in the recent past.
</p>





<p><a name="50127-02_spnew3"><b> Ms Hewitt: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is absolutely right. Although we are certainly seeking to run this superb service even more efficiently in future than we have done in the past and to ensure that we get support for inward investors alongside exporters, I am happy to give him and our business customers that reassurance. Unlike the Opposition, we will not abolish passport to export, which is an enormous success, and unlike them, we will not abolish research and development grants or regional selective assistance. We will continue to support British firms and workers.
</p>





<p><a name="50127-02_spnew4"><b> Mr. Julian Brazier  (Canterbury)</b> 
 (Con): The Secretary of State knows perfectly well that we are committed to maintaining R and D budgets.

<a name="50127-02_para0">
When will the Secretary of State recognise that the best way to tackle the crisis in the balance of payments&#151;it is a crisis because the deficit is very close to an all-time high&#151;lies not with a string of different organisations having a finger in the pie, including all the regional development agencies throughout the country, UKTI and other bodies, but in having a single export promotion agency led by people with real experience from industry?
</p>





<p><a name="50127-02_spnew5"><b> Ms Hewitt: </b> 
 If the hon. Gentleman would care to look at his own James report, he would see that he and his party propose to sack 700&nbsp;United Kingdom Trade and Investment staff and secondees&#151;most of whom have private-sector experience&#151;and put in 50&nbsp;from the private sector.

<p><a name="50127-02_spnew7"><b> Richard Burden  (Birmingham, Northfield)</b> 
 (Lab): Does my right hon. Friend agree that one of the best ways of exhibiting British business and showcasing British talents is to ensure that British products are in use in oversees markets? That being the case, will she join me in welcoming the negotiations on a possible joint venture between MG Rover Group and Shanghai Automotive? It offers the prospect not only of selling those products in Chinese markets, but of investment here in the United Kingdom. While recent press reports have been wide of the mark, will she assure the House that the Government are doing all that they can to bring those negotiations to a successful conclusion?
</p>





<p><a name="50127-02_spnew8"><b> Ms Hewitt: </b> 
 As my hon. Friend knows, we are absolutely solid in our support for the UK motor manufacturing industry and for its increasingly successful exports. As he said, we certainly cannot believe everything that has been in the press recently on this subject. I take every opportunity to stress to Chinese Ministers and business colleagues in particular the enormous merits of the United Kingdom as a place for inward investment. I am doing everything possible within my power to help ensure that those negotiations on a joint venture are successfully concluded.

<a name="50127-02_sbhd1"><h4 align=center>Cinema Industry</h4>


<p>4. <a name="50127-02_wqn1"><b> Mr. David Rendel  (Newbury)</b> 
 (LD): What plans she has to review fair trading regulations with respect to the cinema industry.  [211112]
</p>


<p><a name="50127-02_spmin1"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Trade and Industry  (Mr. Gerry Sutcliffe): </b> 
 My Department has consulted publicly on recommendations from the chairman of the Office of Fair Trading that the Films (Exclusivity Agreements) Order 1989&nbsp;made under the Fair Trading Act 1973&nbsp;be revoked and the Secretary of State will take a decision on this order in the light of the chairman&#039;s advice due to be received shortly.
</p>





<p><a name="50127-02_spnew9"><b> Mr. Rendel: </b> 
 I am delighted to hear that, but I will press the Minister further. He will know that, by 2003, 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>27 Jan 2005 : Column 441</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>71&nbsp;per cent. of all cinemas were in multiplexes and that 75&nbsp;per cent. of those were owned by just five companies, so choice has been dramatically restricted. Will he consider negotiating with his colleagues in other Departments on two measures that I suggested in my ten-minute Bill last year and that have now been supported by <i>Time Out</i>? The first is to change planning laws so that there will be a separate use class for cinemas and the second is to introduce the possibility of rate relief for small rural cinemas.
</p>





<p><a name="50127-02_spnew10"><b> Mr. Sutcliffe: </b> 
 In a sense, as with my earlier answer, we have to wait for decisions to be taken before we move on to what recommendations to make in the light of those decisions. That is under the 1973&nbsp;Act. The hon. Gentleman will know that the Enterprise Act 2002&nbsp;took away powers from the Secretary of State and will give them to the Competition Commission. This is being looked at under the 1973&nbsp;Act and the Secretary of State has to consult and consider the chairman&#039;s recommendations. When that has taken place, issues such as the changing nature of the industry will be considered. I am sure that decisions such as the one that the hon. Gentleman raised can be taken then, or certainly there can be consultation and discussion on those issues.
</p>





<p><a name="50127-02_spnew11"><b> Chris Bryant  (Rhondda)</b> 
 (Lab): With the degree of vertical integration in the industry and with so many of the distributing companies and the people who own the cinemas themselves owned by the same people, unless we tackle the anti-competitive practices that may exist in the industry, is there not a real danger that independent producers who make small films will find it difficult to get those films into cinemas? Is it not also difficult for independent cinemas to get access to some of the big blockbuster movies that could make more money for them?
</p>





<p><a name="50127-02_spnew12"><b> Mr. Sutcliffe: </b> 
 I recognise my hon. Friend&#039;s involvement in and commitment to making sure that creative industries, particularly the film industry, are successful. He will know that, since 1997, there have been tremendous tax advantages for small budget films of around &#163;15&nbsp;million. There has been a greater incentive to support the British film industry. It is difficult to make any comment at this stage until we have an OFT recommendation and the Secretary of State makes a decision.

</p>


<p><a name="50127-02_spmin2"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Trade and Industry  (Nigel Griffiths): </b> 
 In 2004, 130&nbsp;regulations were passed under seven items of primary legislation, as compared with 1994, when the previous Administration passed 148&nbsp;regulations. The hon. Lady will join me in welcoming that reduction.
</p>





<p><a name="50127-02_spnew13"><b> Mrs. Lait: </b> 
 It is no cause for congratulation that industry is increasingly regulated, which is why it believes that the Government do not care for industry. 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>27 Jan 2005 : Column 442</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>In the light of the cost to British industry of increased regulation and the findings of the British Chambers of Commerce that the Government did not use sunset clauses in 2002&#150;03, will the Minister heed the Cabinet Office, which has urged the use of sunset clauses, or does he still believe that sunset clauses are a quack cure?
</p>





<p><a name="50127-02_spnew14"><b> Nigel Griffiths: </b> 
 I believe that we must bear down on regulations, some of the worst of which have been effectively tackled by our unit. It is important to examine all the options, but if the hon. Member and her party believe that sunset clauses are the universal solution to the problem, why did they not introduce them during their 18&nbsp;years in government?

<p><a name="50127-02_spnew15"><b> Mr. Liam Byrne  (Birmingham, Hodge Hill)</b> 
 (Lab): This month, Barclays bank has published new data showing that the business start-up rate in Birmingham is set to rise by 17&nbsp;per cent. Regulations aside, does my hon. Friend agree that there has never been a better time to start a business in this country?
</p>





<p><a name="50127-02_spnew16"><b> Nigel Griffiths: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is right. That point was reinforced last week by Global Entrepreneurship Monitor, which said that this country is more entrepreneurial than all our major European competitors and Japan, too. The Barclays survey shows that more companies started up last year than at any time since the survey began in 1988. More people are in work than at any time in our history and economic growth has occurred for 50&nbsp;consecutive quarters. My hon. Friend&#039;s constituents are working hard and growing their businesses and their experience is reflected up and down the country.

 (DUP): Many people in industry believe that the Government are oblivious to the damaging downward spiral of excessive regulation and increasing non-wage costs, which undermine competitiveness. Are the Government aware that the two factors are combining to make the UK a less attractive place to do business?
</p>





<p><a name="50127-02_spnew18"><b> Nigel Griffiths: </b> 
 The representations that I have received as Minister for Small Business and Enterprise include a big thank you for abolishing automatic fines on VAT, which hit 200,000&nbsp;businesses and cost them &#163;99&nbsp;million in fines in the final year of the last Conservative Administration. Businesses have thanked me for raising the audit threshold to help almost 300,000&nbsp;companies avoid bureaucracy and for abolishing corporation tax for 150,000&nbsp;small businesses. We have done a lot to ensure that businesses do not face bureaucracy and tax, but I am first to admit that more remains to be done, and we will do more in another term.

 My hon. Friend is right. I know that the House and the country will thank him for his Gangmasters (Licensing) Act 2004, which is designed to crack down on this. My hon.

<p><a name="50127-02_spnew21"><b> Mr. Stephen O&#039;Brien  (Eddisbury)</b> 
 (Con): For British business to reverse its declining competitiveness under this Government, it needs Government to get out of its way. Yesterday, the Institute for Fiscal Studies demonstrated that a Labour Government would have to raise taxes by &#163;11&nbsp;billion were they to stay in office. Labour offer no hope for business, in contrast to the Conservatives, who will reduce taxes.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-02_para1">
The other crushing Labour tax on business by another name is the burden of over-regulation. Precisely by how much will compliance costs to business rise if, preserve us, Labour cling on to office for a third term?
</p>





<p><a name="50127-02_spnew22"><b> Nigel Griffiths: </b> 
 Many measures are being taken to reduce compliance costs to business, so the hon. Member has clearly got the wrong end of the stick. Having read his report complaining about thousands of regulations being passed last year, I would be interested to know why the Conservatives prayed against only eight of them.
</p>





<p><a name="50127-02_spnew23"><b> Mr. O&#039;Brien: </b> 
 The Minister has failed to answer the question because he has absolutely no idea, and does not care, about how much compliance with regulations is costing British business and British competitiveness. Does he agree with the Prime Minister, who said that the problem with regulation is cultural, which is the case not least in his Department? The Minister and his Secretary of State are all talk. Will he tell the House how he intends to reverse the flow of regulations spewing out of his Department? What career incentives have he and the Secretary of State put in place for DTI civil servants to suggest specific repeals of regulations, as we have done, and not to propose yet more burdens on business?
</p>





<p><a name="50127-02_spnew24"><b> Nigel Griffiths: </b>

 Existing nuclear power stations are expected to continue in operation for some years, with Sizewell operating up to the 2030s. Our policy on possible new nuclear power stations was set out in the 2003&nbsp;energy White Paper. There are no current plans for new build, but we do not rule out that option in the future.
</p>





<p><a name="50127-03_spnew0"><b> Mr. Jack: </b> 
 Today, I had the pleasure of receiving a delegation from the Chinese environmental protection committee. Its members told me that China is about to double its commitment to nuclear power. A recent MORI poll confirms that the public now favour the generation of more nuclear power because they recognise its contribution to reducing CO <sub>2</sub> emissions. Given that the Minister confirms that the option will be kept open, will he ask the nuclear installations inspectorate to commence a design review of candidate designs to cut down the lead time if the industry can provide funding and investment to build a new generation to replace power stations that are being taken out of use?
</p>





<p><a name="50127-03_spnew1"><b> Mr. O&#039;Brien: </b> 
 The right hon. Gentleman takes a keen interest in those issues, given that Springfield is in his constituency. It does a good job and has an excellent safety record. However, the time scales for developing a nuclear power station are long. We are currently keeping open the options for possible nuclear development at some time in the future if the position changes, but it is currently economically unattractive. No private sector business organisations are making such propositions. We continue to watch the operation of the market but I repeat that the proposition is economically unattractive.

 We are making efforts to ensure that we keep the skills that are needed if we decide to build in future. It is currently economically unattractive to do that: nobody is presenting propositions for building a nuclear power station. The decision does not need to be made immediately. If we reconsidered the matter, we would want to produce a White Paper and hold a broad-based consultation and discussion before making a decision. It is not a foregone conclusion that new build is necessary. Progress is being made on gas and renewables and energy efficiency, which are currently our priorities.

<p><a name="50127-03_spnew4"><b> Mr. Michael Weir  (Angus)</b> 
 (SNP): The Minister said that new nuclear power stations were currently uneconomic. Is he aware of the huge concern in Scotland that the crazy transmission price regime that the zealots of Ofgem pursue will undermine the economics of new renewable build in northern Scotland?

 The hon. Gentleman stretches the question to try to include matters that are important in Scotland&#151;matters that we are considering with a great deal of care. Ofgem is examining how connections between Scotland and the rest of the United Kingdom are developing. We believe that, in future, whatever the regime, Scotland will produce an enormous amount of energy for the whole UK. The link between Scotland and the rest of the UK is the key to Scotland&#039;s future prosperity.

 Solicitors acting for the miners have had &#163;450&nbsp;million in public money, so they are not short of such funds.

 I have been advised of the medical evidence in relation to surface-only workers. Unfortunately, the levels of respiratory disease and dust in their lungs do not appear to make them eligible, and would not appear to do so under the other scheme.

Towards the end of last year, 15&nbsp;cases were identified, and I hope that solicitors can find a way of pursuing those cases, so that we can get to the facts. The medical evidence so far is that dust damage done to lungs on the surface is not comparable to that done to deep-mine workers in dusty pits.

 There is nothing to stop a miner taking a civil case. Indeed, the whole scheme arose from a civil case about that.

</p>


<p><a name="50127-04_spmin3"><b>The Deputy Minister for Women and Equality  (Jacqui Smith): </b> 
 The median female wage for health and social work is &#163;8.72&nbsp;per hour, which is above the &#163;7.95&nbsp;hourly wage for all women in employment. Registration of social care workers is being led by the Department of Health and it is hoped that that will help to raise the status of this important sector of the work force.
</p>





<p><a name="50127-04_spnew10"><b> Angela Watkinson: </b> 
 The Minister will know that local social services departments have great difficulty in meeting the demand for social care workers, especially when a 24-hour care package can require six or more&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;people to care for one client. The employees are almost exclusively women with complex domestic commitments, so the jobs involve flexible hours and are often local. The women are tied into the jobs and have no pay bargaining power because they are locked into the terms and conditions that go with the jobs. How can we raise the status of those women and set them on a career path, so that when their children are older they can move to other jobs where their skills are transferable?
</p>





<p><a name="50127-04_spnew11"><b> Jacqui Smith: </b> 
 The hon. Lady is right about the vital contribution made by care workers in many communities throughout the country. She asks what we can do. First, we need to improve the training of those in social care. Secondly, we need to ensure that local authorities have the resources both to recruit and retain the workers on the pay that they deserve for their efforts. That is why the &#163;150&nbsp;million grant that authorities will receive in 2005&#150;06&nbsp;for recruitment, retention and training is so crucial, and that is why I am sure the hon. Lady will share my disappointment that it will presumably be subject to one of the cuts proposed by her party&#039;s Front Benchers.
</p>





<p><a name="50127-04_spnew12"><b> Sandra Gidley  (Romsey)</b> 
 (LD): I am worried by the Minister&#039;s figures. She said that the median female hourly wage was &#163;8.72, but earlier this year the Equal Opportunities Commission said that 5&nbsp;per cent. of the social care work force earned around &#163;5&nbsp;an hour. Home owners say that they cannot afford to pay more on the rates provided by social services departments. What does the Minister think the minimum wage for the job should be, and what action are the Government taking to ensure that social services pay enough for that minimum to be paid to these hard-working and much-needed employees?
</p>





<p><a name="50127-04_spnew13"><b> Jacqui Smith: </b> 
 As I said in my earlier answer, if we are to ensure that the people carrying out this vital work can be paid a decent rate, we must make certain that our social services departments are funded properly. In particular, we need to make certain that the resources 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>27 Jan 2005 : Column 451</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>are directed towards recruitment, retention and training. The &#163;150&nbsp;million grant&#151;the level of grant has increased in the past few years&#151;is crucial in that regard, but so is training itself and the status of these workers. In both those areas, the Department of Health has taken important action and the ongoing registration of social care workers will ensure that their status and pay reflect the contribution that they make to our communities.
</p>





<p><a name="50127-04_spnew14"><b> Sir Nicholas Winterton  (Macclesfield)</b> 
 (Con): The Minister has touched on the critical issue: the resources allocated to local government to enable it to pay for social care workers. I am frequently approached by representatives of residential care homes and nursing homes in my constituency, who say that they cannot find sufficient women to do the job because our area, fortunately, is economically vibrant and well-off and the demand for labour is tremendous. Will the Government not take account of this issue in allocating resources to local authorities and thereby enable them to provide the extra pay needed to employ these care workers, who play an essential role in looking after the many vulnerable people in our society?
</p>





<p><a name="50127-04_spnew15"><b> Jacqui Smith: </b> 
 I agree with everything that the hon. Gentleman said. Of course it is crucial that we allocate to local authorities the resources necessary not only to train and recruit these workers, who are doing such an important job, but to retain them on decent rates of pay. Members are right to say that the majority of such workers are women, but it should be part of our task to attract more men into this sector, to increase the total number of workers available. Yes, we do need to ensure that local authorities have more resources and, through the training and recruitment grant, we are ensuring that they will get an extra &#163;150&nbsp;million next year. I am sorry to return to an earlier point, but if the Conservatives&#039; sums are to add up, that grant must form part of their proposed cuts&#151;should they ever get into power.

Indeed, we established the Women and Work Commission, which is chaired by Baroness Prosser, to examine the action that needs to be taken to deal with the fundamental causes of the gender pay gap. We have already strengthened the law in this area and are creating specialist equal pay tribunals. We will, of course, continue to look at proposals for further action, while recognising that we must balance the demands that we make on business with the proper standards that we set to protect individuals.

On the Identity Cards Bill, the truth is that the issues have been debated for many years. The draft Bill was subject to detailed scrutiny before being introduced&#151;

<p><a name="50127-06_spnew2"><b> Mr. Hain: </b> 
 Yes, it was. It was subject to detailed scrutiny and my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary took that into account in drawing up the Bill that was eventually introduced. It is very interesting to note that an unusual amount of filibustering took place in Committee on this Bill. I do not know whether that was deliberate, to allow questions such as the hon. Gentleman has just put claiming that the Bill had insufficient time: I merely note what happened. The time that we have provided for the Identity Cards Bill is fully adequate for its remaining stages and we do not intend to make any changes.

<a name="50127-06_para3">
I am not able to give the hon. Gentleman a date for the Budget and I do not think that he seriously expects me to do so. He mentioned a black hole, but the real black hole is in Tory finances. They propose &#163;35&nbsp;billion-worth of cuts, which is inconceivable and completely unrealistic, as my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister has repeatedly made clear. They also propose &#163;4&nbsp;billion in tax cuts, but nobody&#151;except Conservative Front Benchers&#151;believes that they could have tax cuts, massive savings and cuts in spending on that scale. They simply could not do everything at the same time.

<p>
<a name="50127-06_para4">
It is very interesting to note that the Leader of the Opposition&#039;s own policy document on taxes says that the options discussed in that paper represent a menu from which a Conservative Government may draw when formulating their Budgets. It goes on to say that the presence of a particular option in that paper or in its successors in the consultation series does not constitute any guarantee or promise that the particular option in question will form part of any Conservative Budget. So, we cannot even believe the &#163;4&nbsp;billion tax cuts that they say they will introduce. The contrast is between a Labour Government, who have introduced economic stability of a kind that we have not known for generations&#151;high employment, low mortgage rates, low interest rates, low inflation and economic growth year by year&#151;and the mess and the black hole created by the last Conservative economic plan.

 My right hon. Friend will be aware that in south-east Northumberland we have had a black Wednesday, with the announcement that 500&nbsp;jobs at a pharmaceutical factory are to go, and of course the loss of Ellington colliery, with 300-odd jobs&#151;nearly 900&nbsp;jobs altogether. Will my right hon. Friend arrange a debate, not on the narrow subject of south-east Northumberland but on the north-east as a whole, so that at least the Members for that region could point out the disadvantages that they are getting from the Government?

Obviously we are very sad about the closure of Ellington colliery and we will fight to preserve all jobs wherever and whenever we can. However, a balance needs to be struck. The difference between the situation now and under the Conservatives, when mines and pits were closed by the hundred, is that then there was nowhere else for the miners to go. There were no alternative jobs. When my hon. Friend says that he and his constituency have been let down by this Government, the truth is that, as I believe he is on the record as saying, unemployment has been cut massively in his constituency. There are job prospects in the region because the north-east is doing better than it has done for generations. We must recognise that there will be a process of switch in jobs and a process of churning, but at least we are going to work with those involved to find them new job opportunities.

This morning, No. 10&nbsp;Downing street has indicated that that prospect is under review.

Of course we will want to withdraw British forces as soon as possible, but we will not do that except at the request of the Iraqi Government.

 Following the request made by my hon. Friend the Member for Blyth Valley (Mr. Campbell) regarding the north-east, but in relation to coal generally, will the Leader of the House arrange for a debate or a statement by the appropriate Minister on UK Coal&#039;s activities, which should be investigated? With 49,000&nbsp;acres of land, some of which will be exploited after the closure of Ellington, UK Coal is more of a property company than a coal company. The Government intervened to replace some of the privatised rail companies that succeeded British Rail, and it is high time that we got rid of UK Coal, which is practising the art of shutting pits; otherwise, there will soon be no pits left. UK Coal is continuing the tradition of Thatcher and Heseltine because it wants to make a lot of money out of the land.

I know that the hon. Gentleman supports that objective and I am sure that he agrees that Sinn Fein is an important part of the democratically elected political landscape in Northern Ireland. The recent criminality involving the IRA is extremely serious; it is why the process has stalled after seeming to reach a promising point. My right hon.

I rebut the charge that Members of Parliament have not reformed their own pensions. We have done so, and we are phasing out early retirement privileges in line with other parts of the public sector.

On the question of programming&#151;of course we will keep it under review. The House made a decision on the matter only a few months ago, but I accept that the hon.

 This is not the question that I was originally going to ask, but following the questions from my hon. Friends the Members for Blyth Valley (Mr. Campbell) and for Bolsover (Mr. Skinner) about the UK coal industry, coal has become such a pressing national issue that it has to be examined. The deep-mine industry has fallen into the clutches of a bunch of asset-strippers who, even when offered money by the Government, have pressed ahead with pit closures, using Government money for redundancy payments. Given that background, there is only one answer&#151;public intervention and public ownership. Otherwise, within a decade, we will not have any deep mines left in Britain, so we need a debate or at least a statement.

 If my hon. Friend&#039;s pessimistic forecast&#151;I am not suggesting that it is unrealistic in the circumstances&#151;were true, the worldwide demand for clean coal, particularly from China and India, should mean that Britain is a position to contribute by exporting technology and expertise. The end of coal would therefore be a counter-productive strategy. Indeed, given the high demand for coal, it is difficult to envisage such a strategy being employed, but the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry is well aware of the difficulties, and will have noted his powerful point.

 Of course that is an important matter. The exact handling of any legislation will be discussed and agreed through the usual channels.

It is important that those who have been involved in terrorist activity, or of whom we have intelligence that they are involved in terrorist activity and could, for all I know, be plotting to blow up the House of Commons, are dealt with properly, and at the same time that the rule of law applies and civil liberties are protected as far as possible.

Given that we now know that Saddam Hussein and his personal entourage benefited to the tune of $10&nbsp;billion from that corruption and that the Secretary of State for Defence in this House has made a link between that money and the funding of the insurgency that is currently threatening the lives of British troops and civilians in Iraq, may we have a debate in Government time on the oil-for-food scandal, particularly so that we can find out whether the Government believe that the fault lies inside the UN itself or with the Security Council, which was constantly warned but took no action?

<p><a name="50127-10_spnew13"><b> Mr. Hain: </b> 
 As a Minister between 1999&nbsp;and 2001, when the policy was enforced, I was concerned about the amount of oil being smuggled on Saddam&#039;s behalf and about the way in which the oil-for-food programme had been working. I am sure that there was no deliberate attempt on behalf of the Security Council or the United Nations Secretary-General or his officials to do that. The hon. Gentleman has made a very serious charge, and I know that the Foreign Secretary will want to consider it very carefully.

I make one other brief point: of course, what we knew was that Saddam was propping up his tyranny by the illegal raking off of oil-for-food money and oil revenues. That would still be going on if he were still in power. When we look at the balance on whether the military action was right or wrong, we have to decide whether, with all the difficulties that exist at the moment&#151;I know that the hon.

 Earlier, in answer to questions on the scrutiny of the Identity Cards Bill, the Leader of the House said that there was division in the Conservative party on the Bill, and I think he will recognise that there is also division in his own party. Is it not precisely the time when Parliament should give maximum time to scrutiny of legislation when those on the Back Benches and Front Benches are not speaking with one voice? That is when Parliament can fulfil its greatest function in ensuring maximum scrutiny of legislation. Was it not only yesterday that, in speaking to his own report to the House, the Leader of the House recognised that there are currently at least two hours less time for debate on Thursdays than on any other day of business? Why has he scheduled this measure, which is controversial and divisive in the House, for debate on a day when there is less time for scrutiny, and when the Bill itself has not had proper scrutiny in its Standing Committee?
</p>





<p><a name="50127-11_spnew1"><b> Mr. Hain: </b> 
 I simply do not accept the charge as made. I have dealt with the point already, but let me look at the progress of the Identity Cards Bill a few days ago on 25&nbsp;January. At column 228&nbsp;of the Committee proceedings, the Chairman said:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;I am sure that the hon. Member for Cotswold will not be tempted to debate how many people live in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, because that is not relevant to the amendment&quot;.</p>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;This is not a stand part debate&quot;,</p>

<a name="50127-11_para1">
and he went on to say:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;Order. I am sorry, but the intervention is long and it is not relevant to the amendment.&quot;&#151;[<i>Official Report, Standing Committee B,</i> 25&nbsp;January 2005; c. 228&#150;29.]</p>

<a name="50127-11_para2">
I could go on and on for pages upon pages of the <i>Official Report</i>. The truth is that I can only assume that a deliberate attempt has been made by those who are opposed to the Bill&#151;I do not really know whether the Conservatives are opposed to it, but the Liberal Democrats certainly are, and we will remind the electors of that at the next general election&#151;to filibuster the Bill and then say that it has not been debated properly.
</p>





<p><a name="50127-11_spnew2"><b> Mr. Oliver Heald  (North-East Hertfordshire) (Con):</b> 
 On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. The Leader of the House has shamefully described the proceedings in the Identity Cards Bill Committee as involving a filibuster. When the hon. Member for Reading, West (Mr. Salter) made that point to the Chairman of the Committee, however, he said:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;If the hon. Member for Woking&quot;,</p>

<p>

<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;had been filibustering, I would have called him to order by now.&quot;&#151; [<i>Official Report, Standing Committee B,</i> 20&nbsp;January 2005; c. 202.]</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-11_para4">
Although it is correct that, from the time to time, the Chairmen, as they always do, have made particular points, there has been no single occasion in the whole of the passage of the Bill on which anybody has been successfully accused of filibustering. In fact, no Chairman would allow it. In those circumstances, should not the Leader of the House withdraw, as the Home Secretary had to do in November 2003, and apologise to the House and to the Chair for the way in which he has gone on?
</p>





<p><a name="50127-11_spnew3"><b> Mr. Hain: </b> 
 Further to that point of order, when one looks at just one sitting of the Committee, the fifth sitting on Tuesday morning, and sees the string of interventions from the Chair calling the Committee to order, one sees that it is way beyond the normal practice of chairing a Committee. If what happened was not filibustering in the precise meaning of the term, it was pretty close to it.
</p>





<p><a name="50127-11_spmin0"><b>Mr. Deputy Speaker:</b> 
 Filibustering is a term that means different things to different people on different occasions. I am quite sure that the Chairman of the Committee would have called any Member to order if they were deliberately filibustering. I think that we ought now to leave the matter where it is.

<p>Government amendments Nos. 9&nbsp;to 11.</p>





<p><a name="50127-11_spnew5"><b> Mr. Chope: </b> 
 The new clause would require proper consultation and discussion in respect of any proposal to withdraw first class passenger accommodation from an existing railway service. Discontinuing a first-class service would be put on a par with discontinuing any other service and trigger the consultation arrangements under part IV of the Bill.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-11_para5">
Why is the new clause necessary? We believe that the Government have a covert agenda to ameliorate overcrowding on the railways by converting first-class accommodation to second class, instead of by expanding capacity.
</p>





<p><a name="50127-11_spnew6"><b> John McDonnell  (Hayes and Harlington) (Lab):</b> 
 I hope that that is right.
</p>





<p><a name="50127-11_spnew7"><b> Mr. Chope: </b> 
 Perhaps the hon. Gentleman thinks that the Heathrow Express is an example of a better form of practice. When faced with increasing demand it increased the number of carriages on each service from 8&nbsp;am to 9&nbsp;am. That, surely, is a better way of responding to increased demand than by eliminating first class.
</p>





<p><a name="50127-11_spnew8"><b> Mr. Brian H. Donohoe  (Cunninghame, South) (Lab):</b> 
 It may be of interest to the hon. Gentleman to know that the Heathrow Express is about to lose its first-class compartments.
</p>





<p><a name="50127-11_spnew9"><b> Mr. Chope: </b> 
 If that is so, I am sure that the hon. Gentleman would agree that that should be the subject 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>27 Jan 2005 : Column 474</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>of consultation and discussion with people who use the airport and that service. If that is the proposal and it is coupled with the threat hanging over the Gatwick Express, it drives a coach and horses through the Government&#039;s lip service to integrated transport. We need to ensure that our main airport hubs are linked by good quality transport to the central conurbation. That includes ensuring that public transport is of sufficient quality to appeal to those who aspire to travelling first class, as I suspect most hon. Members do, certainly when they are on official parliamentary business.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-11_para6">
First-class accommodation is used by a variety of people. Many of them are vulnerable, elderly, have disabilities or are expectant mothers
</p>





<p><a name="50127-11_spnew10"><b> John McDonnell: </b> 
 Some of them are rich.
</p>





<p><a name="50127-11_spnew11"><b> Mr. Chope: </b> 
 Perhaps some of them are rich. If the hon. Gentleman wishes to pursue his agenda for levelling down, let him join in the debate. Many people who use first-class accommodation are probably significantly less well off than he is, but choose to do so because they feel that if they were to travel standard class, as it is called, their health would be in jeopardy. A recent example was raised only yesterday in a debate in Westminster Hall of a pregnant lady who lost her child as a result of overcrowding on the train. We know that some of the more enlightened train operating companies, such as South West Trains, Thameslink and South Eastern Trains, offer complimentary first class upgrades to pregnant women holding season tickets when no seats are available in standard class. Obviously, they could not do that if there was no first-class accommodation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-11_para7">
Others using first-class accommodation have private or confidential work to do on the train, such as Government Ministers. Others choose to pay a premium&#151;an unregulated fare&#151;to provide more space and comfort and a better chance of obtaining a seat. That is particularly true of people joining busy commuter lines at intermediate stations. On the line that I use between Christchurch and Waterloo, it is possible for people joining the train at Christchurch or Hinton Admiral to get a seat, but for those who join at Winchester, for example, it is almost impossible. Many people are prepared to pay a premium fare so that they can have a seat in first class. A similar situation arises on many commuter lines into Paddington, including the Chippenham and Didcot lines.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-11_para8">
First-class accommodation is also used in connection with high value added tourism services, which are particularly important for rural economies. The Great Western mainline route utilisation strategy, published by the Strategic Rail Authority in January, contained the expression,
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;Alteration to the mix of first and standard class seating&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-11_para9">
That was as a possible means of increasing capacity. <i>The Daily Telegraph</i> picked that up in a report on 13&nbsp;January under the byline of the transport correspondent.

</ul>

<p class="tabletext">The Strategic Rail Authority said peak-time congestion on routes into London Paddington could be trimmed by converting premium accommodation to standard-class on turbo commuter trains and some high-speed services.</p>

<p class="tabletext">The SRA ruled out more ambitious plans for faster journeys and increased frequencies on grounds of cost, and warned there was little prospect of improving capacity or punctuality before 2011.&quot;</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-11_para10">
That is the sorry saga of this Bill and its background. It is a Bill to enable the Government to take control of a railway service which will be in decline in future because of a lack of investment. Because the Government have been embarrassed by the demand of the independent rail regulator, they have decided to circumvent the powers of that regulator and take more control of the service. That is why the Government are making themselves directly responsible for whether there will be first-class seats on mainline commuter services into London.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-11_para11">
The story goes on. <i>The Daily Telegraph</i> correspondent went on to say:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;The SRA strategy was criticised by consumer groups. Mike Greedy, of the Western England regional passenger committee, said, &#039;If we want major improvement in rail services, there has to be substantial investment. Otherwise we stand no chance at all of encouraging people to switch to rail from the car.&#039;&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-11_para12">
It is the Government&#039;s agenda and is explicit in the Bill that people like Mr. Greedy, who serve diligently on the regional passenger committee, will be out of a job because the Government are abolishing regional passenger committees and centralising them. It is much more convenient for the Government if there are no people like Mr. Greedy to comment on their actions.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-11_para13">
I raised those issues in Committee. The Minister described my questions as &quot;idle fantasies and speculation&quot;. He then went on to describe them as &quot;patent nonsense&quot;. I sought an assurance that the Government would not allow train operators to withdraw first-class accommodation on long distance commuter services to London, but I received no reply. I have asked about this on other occasions and the Minister has ducked and weaved and refused to confront this important issue.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-11_para14">
The new clause gives the Government a chance to clarify their intentions in relation to the future of first-class rail travel. It ensures that if there are to be changes involving perhaps the withdrawal of first class, those changes should first be subject to proper consultation with the travelling public, as is required under part IV of the Bill.

<p><a name="50127-12_spnew0"><b> Mr. Graham Stringer  (Manchester, Blackley) (Lab):</b> 
 I rise to speak to amendment No. 30&nbsp;to clause 39&#151;the so called bustitution clause of the Bill. I also tabled amendment No. 29, which was not selected by Mr. Speaker.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-12_para0">
I want to explore the scope and practical impact of clause 39. Where a train service is reduced or removed in a passenger transport authority area, clause 39&nbsp;provides that that train service will be replaced by a bus service, so that the people who previously used the train have a bus service. It goes further than that, however, by allowing passenger transport authorities and passenger transport executives to impose a quality contract on bus operators in the area, which effectively means the regulation of those buses&#151;even if train services are not being removed, it is good to re-regulate buses in metropolitan areas.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>27 Jan 2005 : Column 476</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-12_para1">
My questions concern the practicality and limits of clause 39. To explore those questions, one must realise that transport in metropolitan areas is not run by benign bus companies that deliver services efficiently, effectively and economically. In my part of Greater Manchester, the service is dominated by First group, which has an appalling record on punctuality and bus maintenance. In a recent inspection, the wheels were found to be falling off three of the buses, which is not unusual. In Yorkshire, an inspection of 96&nbsp;vehicles found that more than half of them were not fit to be on the road.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-12_para2">
The environment is not benign. I have met representatives from Arriva, First group and other bus companies, who do not like the idea of regulation. One of the reasons why they do not like it is simple: those bus companies make 14&nbsp;per cent. profit in metropolitan areas outside London and 8&nbsp;per cent. profit in Greater London, where the system is regulated. The regulated bus system in London works effectively and efficiently, unlike the system in other metropolitan areas in this country. The bus companies do not want to co-operate in providing a comprehensive integrated transport system. They provide services to give them the greatest possible bottom line, and they compete on the road in order to do so&#151;sometimes they compete, but sometimes they form cartels and monopolies in order to make profits.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-12_para3">
How does clause 39&nbsp;overcome the problem of section 124&nbsp;of the Transport Act 2000, which states how PTAs and PTEs can introduce quality contracts? The Government are reducing the timetable for consultation in section 124&nbsp;to six months, which is welcome. However, section 124&nbsp;also states that quality contracts may be introduced when they are the only practical way to provide bus services in an area. That is a high hurdle over which the PTAs and PTEs must jump. My reading of clause 39&nbsp;is that section 124&nbsp;of the 2000&nbsp;Act remains, so that hurdle must still be overcome. Will the Minister explain how quality contracts can be implemented if bus companies are determined to change their services? Under the deregulated system, bus companies often provide services that they withdraw immediately after the consultation period. Clause 39&nbsp;is defective and will not achieve its objective.

<a name="50127-12_time0"><h5>1.45&nbsp;pm</h5>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-12_para4">
Clause 39&nbsp;is also ambiguous. In Committee, we had an interesting debate&#151;I thought that it was interesting, although I do not know whether the Minister agrees&#151;about how far a quality contract can be extended following the de minimis withdrawal of a train service. If one train were removed from one commuter line in south Yorkshire or Greater Manchester, would clause 39&nbsp;allow the regulation of all buses in south Yorkshire or Greater Manchester? I hope that the Government intended to leave that wonderful loophole to improve the delivery of bus services in metropolitan areas, but I do not think that that was their intention.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-12_para5">
The limits of the quality contracts are not clear. In Committee, the Minister gave the helpful reply that quality contracts do not mean a substitute bus running alongside a railway line to the same timetable, and that the replacement service will be integrated into the rest of the system, but he did not provide a clear answer on how far that contract can go. Amendment No. 29&nbsp;is designed to explore those issues so that we do not implement

<b>27 Jan 2005 : Column 477</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>defective legislation that does not allow PTAs to introduce quality contracts when the conditions described in the Bill occur. The matter is important and we must get it right. As I said earlier, a regulated system would have merit without clause 39, but if clause 39&nbsp;is included, I hope that it will be used to introduce a regulated bus service.
</p>





<p><a name="50127-12_spnew1"><b> Mr. Elfyn Llwyd  (Meirionnydd Nant Conwy) (PC):</b> 
 On new clause 1, although I appreciate that it is helpful to have first class and standard class on most lines, the hon. Member for Christchurch (Mr. Chope) over-egged his pudding. I often travel by first-class rail, but I also often travel standard class from north Wales to south Wales, and I am in reasonable health after doing so. To suggest that travelling by standard class is a health risk is beyond the bounds of credibility.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-12_para6">
Amendment No. 52&nbsp;seeks to introduce a further paragraph in clause 32(4), which concerns references to the Office of Rail Regulation. Railways are an integral part of the economy. They provide not only transport, but social, environmental and economic benefits. I hope that the Government will look favourably on amendment No. 52, which would complement clause 32(4) and round off the criteria for references to the Office of Rail Regulation. As it stands, clause 32(4) merely refers to &quot;consultation&quot; and does not refer either obliquely or plainly to the social, environmental and economic costs and benefits of the proposal being referred to the Office of Rail Regulation. I hope that the Minister can respond to that amendment, and possibly even accept it&#151;I live in hope.

The post-Beeching experience shows us that where such substitution bus services were introduced they often did not survive for long. We therefore need to take great care as regards any legislation that enables passenger transport authorities to undertake them.

Members on both sides of the House support the concept of quality controls with regard to bus quality contracts. London&#039;s regulated bus service has proved a success. However, it is strange that the Bill introduces bus quality contracts solely in relation to rail substitution services. What will the Government do to ensure that bus regulation is promoted throughout the country using bus quality contracts? It is unusual and bizarre to link that solely to the removal of railway services. I am concerned that if we allow the clause to go forward without further refinement, bus substitution

<p><a name="50127-12_spnew3"><b> Mr. Mark Field  (Cities of London and Westminster) (Con):</b> 
 I fear that it falls to Conservative Members to defend the interests of first-class rail passengers. Nevertheless, my hon. Friend the Member for Christchurch (Mr. Chope) made some serious points. If high-quality passenger accommodation is available on all our trains, more people will use public transport, including those who might have been dissuaded from doing so in the past. In Heathrow, for example, taxi traffic may have been reduced as a result of the Heathrow Express. That would have more effect in the constituency of the hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington (John McDonnell) than in other parts of London. Does the Minister have any evidence that high-quality new services such as the Heathrow Express and Gatwick Express, with first-class accommodation, make a contribution to getting traffic off the roads? If not, will he conduct such a survey?
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-12_para11">
The amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Manchester, Blackley (Mr. Stringer) is sensible, but it shows a certain of degree of wishful thinking on his part about what goes on in London. While I would not want to gainsay anything said by the hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington, there are problems with the highly-regulated bus transport market in a broader sense, as well as in relation to bustitution. A significant amount of work is taking place on the tube and rail networks in the capital, often at weekends. There are very effective bustitution arrangements to deal with that, and I must give credit to Transport for London for doing a good job in that regard. As I live and work in central London, I use the buses regularly. I would be the first to say that there have been improvements to that service over the past four years under Mayor Livingstone. However, I am afraid that they have come at a great cost, which I suspect that he rather hoped would be underwritten by the Treasury. That has not happened, with the result that TFL faces losses of up to &#163;1&nbsp;billion a year from its budget for 2007&#150;08.

 Does the hon. Gentleman accept that the regulated system that existed in London before it had a Mayor worked better than in the other metropolitan areas? It lost virtually no passengers between 1985&nbsp;and 1999, when other cities lost 30&nbsp;to 40&nbsp;per cent. of their passengers; and before Mayor Livingstone, there was no subsidy. It was not a perfect system, but it worked better than elsewhere in the country, and we should have the benefit of that kind of system.

 I accept that. The hon. Gentleman will be glad to know that I consider Manchester to be this country&#039;s second city, partly because my in-laws live in Wilmslow, about 12&nbsp;miles away from it. That is probably also why I can pronounce the name of the hon. Gentleman&#039;s constituency better than most southerners. He makes an entirely fair point. London&#039;s bus system has been pretty sophisticated, and regulation has helped. Transport for London does a good job in that regard, but there is a cost to be paid.

<a name="50127-13_para0">
In central London, in particular, we have the problem of an enormous number of services, particularly in places such as Oxford street and Trafalgar square,

<br>&nbsp;<br>where one sees bus after bus. That reminds me of what happened after the much-criticised deregulation of the market. In the mid-1980s, Oxford, where I was an undergraduate, had a massively deregulated market, and it was well-known that in Cornmarket one would see eight or nine buses from different companies all heading out towards London within five minutes of one another.

Here in London, things are not quite so simple. I hope that the Government will give serious consideration to what was said by Labour Members and by my hon. Friend the Member for Christchurch, who made a powerful case in relation not only to public safety but the broadening out of the use of our railways. That will be an important step forward if we are to get as much traffic off our roads as possible. The issue goes well beyond passenger traffic, as we also need to get as much freight as possible off our roads and on to rail.

Congestion is not only a problem for central London. Within the next few weeks, there will be a referendum on congestion charging zones in Edinburgh, and that may happen in other parts of the country. The railways must be part of the solution in the months, years and decades ahead.

<p><a name="50127-13_spnew2"><b> John Thurso  (Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross) (LD):</b> 
 The hon. Member for Christchurch mentioned the case of Mrs. Janice Norman, the lady who lost her baby after being poked in the stomach while travelling a few weeks previously. My hon. Friend the Member for Carshalton and Wallington (Tom Brake) has been pursuing the matter. When I raised it in Committee, I was reassured by what the Minister said and therefore withdrew my new clause on a campaign for considerate commuting. I do not necessarily accept that there is a link between that case and travelling first class.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-13_para3">
I am attracted to the new clause not on health grounds but on the simple premise that where a service is introduced with certain criteria, and that service is to be withdrawn, it is right that the public should have an opportunity to be consulted.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-13_para4">
Moreover, we know from the figures on traffic growth that it stems mostly from more affluent drivers, and if we are to persuade them to come off the road and get on to the train, it will often be necessary to provide a premium service.

<p><a name="50127-13_spmin0"><b>The Minister of State, Department for Transport  (Mr. Tony McNulty): </b> 
 I am grateful to the hon. Member for Christchurch (Mr. Chope) for explaining the point of new clause 1. However, I do not support his aim or the conspiratorial fantasies that lie behind it and I have grave reservations about the practical effect of the new clause.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-13_para6">
The discontinuance provisions in part 4&nbsp;are designed to deal with proposals to do away with a passenger service or close a station or part of the network. Those are specific matters. To protect passengers&#039; interests, the procedures that have to be followed in those circumstances are set out in the Bill and are rightly rigorous. They rightly received a good deal of scrutiny in Committee. On the other hand, withdrawing first-class accommodation from a particular route or service might 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>27 Jan 2005 : Column 480</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>affect some passengers. However, there is a difference for a community between having a rail service that is more or less convenient than the existing one and having no service. The procedures in part 4&nbsp;are designed to deal with only the latter.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-13_para7">
I am also concerned about the practicalities. There is no incentive to take away first-class accommodation where it is well used and every incentive for the operator to get the balance right for the benefit of all customers. That makes sense if it is thought through. There is no sense in requiring operators to run trains with almost empty first-class seats when there is little demand and at times when standard-class passengers cannot get a seat. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman&#039;s concern has been prompted by First Great Western&#039;s route utilisation strategy, which includes proposals to alter the mix of first and standard-class seating on some routes. If that is implemented, it would be a further factor for consideration in addition to the train operating companies&#039; commercial judgment.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-13_para8">
However, the essential principle still applies: imposing a statutory procedure will seriously inhibit operators&#039; flexibility to respond to changing demand and others&#039; ability to propose to them that they might do so. Although the new clause might appear to defend the interests of specific sets of passengers, it does nothing for passengers as a whole&#151;first-class, standard-class, steerage or whatever else exists&#151;because it would restrict operators&#039; flexibility to respond to the passengers about whom the hon. Gentleman seems to be concerned.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-13_para9">
The proposal also appears to raise some complicated issues of definition, because it refers simply to first class. There is no industry-wide definition of first class. At least one operator has no first class as such, but offers a choice of standard and club. The new clause would not cover that. Others have intermediate categories such as silver standard. Again, the new clause does not reflect that. Each offers the passenger a slightly different package, and even when first-class accommodation is advertised as such, the precise service varies from operator to operator.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-13_para10">
Those who want to travel first class do not do so in the hope that there will be three first-class carriages on a train; they simply want a seat in first-class accommodation. It does not matter to the business community, or whoever the hon. Gentleman meant, whether three carriages or one carriage separate them from the riff-raff&#151;the clear implication of his remarks&#151;so long as they get the service for which they paid. That only reinforces my view that we should avoid statutory constraints on operators&#039; commercial freedom to offer different services and that any attempt to impose them would throw up serious problems of definition and practicality.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-13_para11">
In short, the new clause is impracticable as well as undesirable, and I invite the hon. Gentleman to withdraw it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-13_para12">
Let me deal with the other amendments briefly. Amendment No. 52&nbsp;would impose a new duty on the Rail Passengers Council to provide a report on the economic, environmental and social costs and benefits of a closure proposal as part of the material accompanying a reference to the Office of Rail Regulation in clause 32.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>27 Jan 2005 : Column 481</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-13_para13">
I take the points that the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy (Mr. Llwyd) made, but I believe that the amendment is unnecessary because the initiator of the proposal would already have carried out such an assessment. That body, either an operator or railway funding authority, is under a duty to assess the effects of a closure proposal according to the closures guidance that the Secretary of State, Scottish Ministers and the National Assembly for Wales, as the case may be, have a duty to provide under clause 42.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-13_para14">
Earlier this week, I sent the Chairman of Standing Committee A, which deliberated on the Bill, a note setting out current thoughts on the contents of the closures guidance. A copy is in the Library. The note states that any assessment of a closure proposal should cover the costs and benefits of environmental, economic, safety, accessibility and integration effects. Those of course include the effects on passengers, freight users and operators, as well as on the environment. Assuming that the Bill obtains Royal Assent, we shall consult on the draft closures guidance before the main network modification provisions are brought into force. The Office of Rail Regulation&#039;s role is to ensure that the assessment is carried out in accordance with the guidance and that it meets any criteria in it. That provides important independent input into the procedures.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-13_para15">
Requiring the Rail Passengers Council to do a similar assessment could put considerable strain on its resources only to replicate work that has already been done. I therefore accept the thrust and import of the amendment but believe that, although the hon. Gentleman&#039;s points were well made, the headlines of the closures guidance that we have already issued cover them. I hope that he accepts that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-13_para16">
Amendment No. 53&nbsp;appears to intend to exclude freight services from the network modification procedures in the Bill. Again, I respectfully suggest that that is unnecessary as the provisions in the Bill for discontinuing services apply only to passenger services, as do the current procedures&#151;which we seek to replicate in the new settlement for the industry&#151;in the Railways Act 1993.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-13_para17">
However, that is most definitely not to say that freight operators or customers have no input into the network modification procedures. The note on closures guidance clearly states our intention that the final guidance will make it clear that, if freight services are affected by a closure proposal, the impact on freight users and operators must be assessed and taken into account when developing the proposals. Furthermore, if freight operators are affected by the proposal, schedule 7(3)(2)(k) provides for a statutory duty to consult them. I would also expect freight customers to be consulted under those circumstances. Although the network modification elements of the measure refer specifically to passenger services, other components protect the role of freight on rail lines and parts of the network.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-13_para18">
Let me deal with the amendments to clause 39. We have a sort of dichotomy, because one amendment would remove it altogether and the other would extend it to light rail and other guided systems. I take the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Manchester, 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>27 Jan 2005 : Column 482</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Blackley (Mr. Stringer) that amendment No. 30&nbsp;would make more sense had amendment No. 29&nbsp;also been selected.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-13_para19">
With regard to amendment No 5, which my hon. Friend the Member for Hayes and Harlington (John McDonnell) tabled, I accept the concerns, which are rooted in history, about all the promises that were made at the time of Beeching for a host of bus services to replace many of the rail lines that were to close. The substitution of buses was either not forthcoming or happened for only a short time.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-13_para20">
As my hon. Friend the Member for Manchester, Blackley said, there is a regulatory framework in statute in the Transport Act 2000, suitably adjusted with regard to timing. We made it clear in the July White Paper on the role of transport in the broader sense, not the rail White Paper, that we are trying to encourage authorities, especially in urban areas, to devise far-sighted, radical and integrated transport packages for all modes of transport. In that context, we would be happy to make the bus service operators grant and other elements available to the authorities so that they had far more control over the buses and could replicate something similar to the semi-regulated position that pertains in London.

<p><a name="50127-14_spnew0"><b> Mr. Paul Truswell  (Pudsey) (Lab):</b> 
 I am pleased to hear what my hon. Friend has just said, but does he accept that the only practicable way of introducing quality contracts would involve a virtually insurmountable hurdle that would ultimately have to be tested in the courts? Will he reconsider whether that test could be reduced, so that there could be a better balance between the interests of passengers and the interests of the operators in making profits?
</p>





<p><a name="50127-14_spnew1"><b> Mr. McNulty: </b> 
 In all candour, I have to say no, I do not accept that. As the Minister with responsibility for buses last year and this year, I have said that I do not believe that local authorities have pushed the regulatory framework in the Transport Act 2000&nbsp;to its limits, with or without taking into account what we said in the July White Paper. They have not been dilatory, but they have been slow in coming forward with imaginative ways of moving towards a bus quality contract. There are many ways, under the 2000&nbsp;Act and the proposals in the July White Paper, in which local authorities can move towards affording their communities the required regulatory framework and subsequent bus provision. We stand ready to work with any local authority to push things in that direction, not least in the context of what we said in July. So I do not accept the thrust of what my hon. Friend has just said, although he will know that his view is shared by many of our colleagues, and almost certainly by many people in the passenger transport executives.
</p>





<p><a name="50127-14_spnew2"><b> Mr. Stringer: </b> 
 We are familiar with both sides of this argument. The implication of what my hon. Friend the Minister is saying is that the Secretary of State for Transport can take the decision to agree quality contracts. The strength of the argument put forward by my hon. Friend the Member for Pudsey (Mr. Truswell) and I is that, while section 124&nbsp;of the 2000&nbsp;Act remains, that decision is with the courts, not with the Secretary of

<b>27 Jan 2005 : Column 483</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>State. It is therefore very difficult for any local transport authority to show that its proposals are the only practical way available.
</p>





<p><a name="50127-14_spnew3"><b> Mr. McNulty: </b> 
 There are certainly clear and exacting criteria in the Transport Act 2000. They need to be seen in the light of changes that we have made to the regulatory framework since then, and of the way in which we shall take forward the announcements that we made in July. We are starting to talk seriously with a range of authorities about how all these elements can be brought together, and I do not doubt that my hon. Friends the Members for Manchester, Blackley and for Pudsey and I will have further deliberations on it with a whole range of other colleagues as well. It is time to talk far more readily about how all the assorted modes can work together and, in that context, whether quality contracts have a role.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-14_para0">
In terms of network modification, it is appropriate to have such measures in the Bill, although I accept the concerns that have been expressed about what prevailed post-Beeching. I do not accept that we are seeking to do something similar. This was debated at length in Committee. Where a local community&#039;s transport needs result in a requirement for a quality contract so that buses can replace lines and services that have been discontinued, it makes perfect sense to have one. We discussed the assorted elements involved, and we need to look at the issue in much more detail and do much more work on the substance of how the provisions will work. They could well form part of a broader quality contract that could be brought in for a particular area.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-14_para1">
It is important that the provisions should be in the Bill, but not to facilitate closing another third of the rail network, as Beeching did, while promising to replace the services with buses and then not doing so, or doing so only for the short term. It makes sense that the provisions relating to facilities for bus substitution&#151;I shall not use the horrendous word &quot;bustitution&quot;&#151;be included in the Bill. In this context, it has already been pointed out that amendment No. 30&nbsp;does not make a whole lot of sense without amendment No. 29, and I agree with that. On its own, amendment No. 30&nbsp;does not fit with the rest of the Bill, although it would have gone alongside the other one. I understand the attraction for passenger transport authorities of including light rail in the provisions, but, given the way in which amendment No. 30&nbsp;would sit with the rest of the Bill, we do not think that it is appropriate to pursue this matter.

Of the Government amendments at the end of this group, the main one is Government amendment No. 11, which is required to give Scottish Ministers certain powers in relation to rail services, networks and stations that are wholly in Scotland, as well as to certain cross-border services. As clause 44&nbsp;is currently drafted, only the Secretary of State has those powers. The amendment adds the Scottish dimension in terms of giving the powers to Scottish Ministers. The other two Government amendments are consequential on the thrust of Government amendment No.11.

Much of our discussion has been on serious issues, and I would ask the House to reject the amendments, other than the Government amendments.

<p><a name="50127-14_spnew6"><b> Mr. Chope: </b> 
 I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Cities of London and Westminster (Mr. Field) and to the hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross (John Thurso) for their comments in support of new clause 1. I would simply say to the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy (Mr. Llwyd) that the circumstances of the average railway passenger on a rural line in Wales are very different from the hustle and bustle involved in commuting into London. My hon. Friend the Member for Cities of London and Westminster and the hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross raised the kind of pertinent questions that would have to be answered if there were a proper consultation process on any proposal to remove a first-class service.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-14_para4">
The Minister resorted to the last desperate line of defence when he said that the problem was that the new clause did not define first-class passenger accommodation. I do not think that there is anyone in the House who does not understand what we mean by that term. To suggest that the new clause is defective because the term is not defined is absurd. The Minister also tried to argue that the withdrawal of first-class accommodation would affect fewer people and be less significant than the closure of a rural station or the withdrawal of a rarely used rural service. Again, I disagree with him, because I believe that the withdrawal of first-class accommodation could, in certain circumstances, affect much larger numbers of people. That is why any such proposals should be subject to consultation, as the new clause suggests.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-14_para5">
What I found most worrying about the Minister&#039;s response was his suggestion that the new clause would impose constraints on the freedom of operators. He then conceded, however, that the whole system of the route utilisation strategy will be controlled from the centre by the Government. That in itself will inhibit the freedom of operators to decide what is the best mix of first and standard-class accommodation. So I remain suspicious about the Government&#039;s agenda, and the best way forward is to ensure that, if they pursue these proposals, they are forced to consult on them.
</p>





<p><a name="50127-14_spnew7"><b> Mr. McNulty: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman is entirely wrong. That is not the function of the route utilisation strategy. Its function is to come up with strategies to use the route and eventually feed that into the franchise templates against which all operators will bid.

<p><a name="50127-14_spnew8"><b> Mr. Chope: </b> 
 The Minister has done nothing to allay my concerns. He says that route utilisation strategies will feed into the specification that is used for the franchisees to bid against. I submit that, if one is a potential franchisee, and one does not bid against the specification laid down by the centre, one&#039;s chances of success in that franchise bidding are very small.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-14_para6">
The only way to allay the increasing concerns of those who travel first class occasionally or frequently, particularly on main routes into London, is to ensure that they would be given proper notice and have the chance to express their views through consultation. I therefore hope that the House will support new clause 1.

I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
</p>





<p><a name="50127-16_spmin0"><b>Mr. Deputy Speaker  (Sir Michael Lord): </b>

</p>





<p></p>




<br>

<br>



<p>No. 7, in clause 13, page 12, line 2, at end insert &#039;in England&#039;.</p>





<p><a name="50127-16_spnew1"><b> Mr. Davidson: </b> 
 The Conservatives have just fought for the rights of first-class passengers; I want to speak up for people in Strathclyde.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-16_para0">
The amendments are intended to maintain equality between Scotland and England in terms of the role of passenger transport executives in the rail franchising process. Although the Bill will devolve significant additional powers over the railway network in Scotland to Scottish Ministers, it does not confer any additional legislative competence on the Scottish Parliament. The primary legislation governing the relationship between Ministers and regional authorities on railway matters will remain reserved to this Parliament. Consequently, unless the Bill gets it right, there is a real risk of a gap in the statutory chain, which could both fetter the future discretion of Scottish Ministers and frustrate the effective delivery of integrated transport in the west of Scotland.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-16_para1">
This is not just a matter of legal niceties. It is of fundamental importance to my constituents, and to the 44&nbsp;million passengers who use the Strathclyde rail network each year. Rail travel accounts for more than a quarter of all fare-paid journeys in the Strathclyde area, and the level of railway use in the west of Scotland is second only to that in Greater London. The railway network is therefore a core component in the regional transport system in Strathclyde. It is also undoubtedly a key reason why there are proportionately fewer car journeys in Strathclyde than in the rest of Scotland.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-16_para2">
In other words, we are looking at a balance between private and public transport in the west of Scotland that clearly goes with the grain of the Government&#039;s national transport and sustainability objectives. It is important that the Bill should not undermine the continued delivery of integrated transport in the Strathclyde Passenger Transport area, and therefore unwittingly work against the wider policy objectives that the Government have set themselves.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-16_para3">
The relatively healthy state of affairs in the west of Scotland&#039;s transport is not simply a happy accident. It is the result of more than 30&nbsp;years of conscious political 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>27 Jan 2005 : Column 490</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>choice and deliberate financial decisions by accountable regional bodies that had the will and the means to influence directly the delivery of local railway services as part of an integrated transport system. Strathclyde regional council, of which I was a member&#151;as was the Minister: I hope she will bear that in mind when she replies&#151;invested more than &#163;400&nbsp;million in developing the local railway network while it was the passenger transport authority for the area. Since railway privatisation, the successor PTA has spent over &#163;50&nbsp;million of discretionary funding in service and network enhancements, and a recent study by consultants appointed by the Scottish Executive has shown that more than half the growth in traffic and revenue on the Strathclyde rail network during the 1990s was directly due to initiatives by the PTA and the PTE.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-16_para4">
Such an outcome is clear proof of the correctness of what the Secretary of State for Transport said in the House when he introduced the railway White Paper:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;Local transport decisions are best taken by people who know what is needed locally.&quot; [<i>Official Report</i>, 15&nbsp;July 2004; vol. 423, c.1548].</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-16_para5">
It also seems to accord with the intentions of the Scottish Transport Minister, Nicol Stephen, who has said:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;I still expect SPT to have a direct role in the management and development of rail services in the west of Scotland.&quot; [<i>Scottish Parliament Official Report</i>, 16&nbsp;June 2004; c. 9099.]</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-16_para6">
Unfortunately, the present drafting of the Bill appears to undermine the delivery mechanism for that assurance. It is that defect that the amendments seek to address. The Bill proposes to take away PTEs&#039; existing powers in relation to rail franchises, and clause 13&nbsp;replaces them with new provisions for engaging PTEs in the franchising process. However, clause 13&nbsp;does not apply in Scotland, although this is an area where the Scottish Parliament has no competence to enact equivalent or alternative provisions. The amendments therefore seek to introduce an additional clause that will give Ministers in Scotland the same discretion to involve a passenger transport executive in future railway franchises that the Secretary of State for Transport seeks in relation to English PTEs.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-16_para7">
There is a parallel Bill before the Scottish Parliament that could potentially amend the basis on which SPT currently operates, and result in a transfer of powers between it and Scottish Ministers. That is an undoubted complication, but I cannot emphasise too strongly that it does not remove the need for the amendments. I remind the Minister that the Scottish Parliament is not able to amend the underlying legislation governing railways. It is also worth pointing out that Holyrood&#039;s Transport (Scotland) Bill is at a less advanced stage than the Railways Bill, and its key components in relation to SPT are simply enabling. Their implementation will depend ultimately on secondary legislation whose terms and scope have yet to be defined, let alone scrutinised by the Scottish Parliament.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-16_para8">
The Government&#039;s acceptance of the amendments would not oblige Scottish Ministers to follow any particular future course of action, other than introducing a statutory obligation to consult. I am sure that hon. Members would in any event endorse that latter requirement. The same principles of open and accountable government should be adopted consistently 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>27 Jan 2005 : Column 491</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>throughout the United Kingdom, and should not be differentially applied in a Bill that is the responsibility of this Parliament.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-16_para9">
The remaining provisions of the amendments put the Bill&#039;s application to a PTE in Scotland on the same footing as in England. They would preserve a statutory framework that would enable, but not compel, Scottish Ministers to adopt the same participatory approach to a rail franchise in Scotland that would be available to the Secretary of State for Transport in England in equivalent circumstances.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-16_para10">
We are always dealing with hypothetical situations when legislation is in progress, but in this one, the uncertainty is compounded by the fact that two legislatures are involved. If this part of the Railways Bill is passed unamended, there is a tangible risk of unintentionally restricting the future ability of the Scottish Executive and the Scottish Parliament to provide for the continuing effective delivery of integrated transport in the west of Scotland. Such a risk could arise, for example, if the current Transport (Scotland) Bill failed to gain Royal Assent or was substantially amended by the Holyrood Parliament. A risk could also arise if Scottish Ministers chose not to exercise their proposed power to initiate secondary legislation in this field, or sought to change the basis of that legislation at the outset or in future.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-16_para11">
My new clause and amendment seek to remove such risks by ensuring the consistency of the reserved legislative framework within which devolved railway policy will be made and delivered in Scotland. They preserve, rather than forgo, options by preventing a situation in which Scottish Ministers are statutorily debarred from involving a PTE in rail franchising. In the interests of even-handedness and of ensuring the future delivery of integrated public transport in the west of Scotland, I commend the proposals to the House. I am sure that the Minister will not fail to be moved by them and will accept them.
</p>

A duty would thereby be imposed on Scottish Ministers, in preparing or revising a strategy, to publish in full their reasons for so doing.

We live in an age of openness and&#151;I like to think&#151;fairness, and everything that we do should at least be within the spirit of the Freedom of Information Act.

</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-17_para2">
I hope that the Minister will tell me and the House that my amendment is not necessary because she expects the giving of such explanations to be best practice. If she does, I shall be delighted not to pursue the matter further.

I, too, remember fondly our days as members of Strathclyde regional council many years ago, on which we both served our political apprenticeship. If I remember correctly, he had to serve his slightly longer than I served mine, before moving on to other things.

I accept what my hon. Friend said about the approach of Strathclyde PTE, and I should make it clear that I highlighted those points in responding to my hon. Friends the Members for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Harris) and for Cumbernauld and Kilsyth (Rosemary McKenna), who have raised similar issues before. That PTE was forward-thinking and was at the forefront of providing integrated transport. As my hon. Friend alluded to, it underpinned a political agenda that recognised the need and desire in the west of Scotland for an integrated public transport system that served all the communities in the area. I should point, however, that I will be asking my hon. Friend to withdraw his new clause and amendment, for reasons that I hope he will understand.

It would be remiss of me not to put on the record the fact that yesterday, the Scottish Parliament gave its unanimous support&#151;such unanimity is very unusual&#151;for a Sewel motion transferring functions relating to railways from this House to Scottish Ministers. Having agreed that transfer of power to Scottish Ministers, it would not be right for this House then to second-guess what they want to do. As my hon. Friend said, they have outlined their approach to railway development in Scotland in the Transport (Scotland) Bill. They have made it clear that there will be a need for local input into the Scottish rail network, and have therefore stated categorically that the west of Scotland regional transport partnership, which will replace Strathclyde PTE, will have a role in the development, management and monitoring of the franchise in that part of Scotland. Indeed, the new regional transport partnerships will be established across Scotland.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-17_para7">
I am aware that concern exists that there might be a gap between enactment of the Railways Bill and of the Transport (Scotland) Bill, but we anticipate no such gap. Under the terms of clause 14&nbsp;of the Railways Bill, Strathclyde PTE will continue to be a party to the ScotRail franchise. That will allow it to maintain its current role in the management of that franchise, until Scottish Ministers make an order under the Transport (Scotland) Bill&#151;once enacted&#151;to transfer its powers.

The Transport (Scotland) Bill also includes provisions that allow Scottish Ministers, if they so wish, to transfer or share their own transport functions with the new regional transport partnerships that will be established across Scotland. Therefore, if they wish, Scottish Ministers can share rail functions with any RTP. So clause 13&nbsp;as drafted will not statutorily debar Scottish Ministers from involving other parties in rail franchises, and in the light of that assurance, I hope that my hon. Friend will see fit to withdraw his new clause. If he does so, it would be entirely logical for him to withdraw amendment No. 7&nbsp;as well.

The amendment tabled in the name of the right hon. Member for East Yorkshire (Mr. Knight) is not necessary. We share the view that there needs to be maximum consultation, transparency and openness. Under freedom of information Acts north and south of the border, the opportunity now exists to underpin that transparency. I know that Scottish Ministers share the UK Government&#039;s concern that Scottish citizens should be properly informed about what is proposed for their railway network and why. As I said in Committee in response to a previous amendment to clause 5&nbsp;that was based on a similar principle, the Scottish Executive have adopted the principles of the Cabinet Office&#039;s code of practice on policy development and public consultation. That being the case, the reasons behind policy and strategy proposals will be explained as part of observing those principles, and of good practice. There is every likelihood that before its actual publication, a strategy will have been widely available as a consultation document.

<p><a name="50127-17_spmin1"><b>Madam Deputy Speaker  (Sylvia Heal): </b> 
 With this it will be convenient to discuss New clause 6&#151;<i>Redundant Assets Register&#151;</i>
</p>





<p></p>




<br>

<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#039;The Secretary of State shall every three years lay before each House of Parliament a register of all assets including land and property owned by Network Rail which are redundant to railway use or which have not been used for railway purposes during the preceding eighteen months together with a statement of intent regarding their future use or disposal.&#039;.
<br>



<p><a name="50127-17_spnew5"><b> Mr. Knight: </b> 
 The Standing Committee debates on this Bill were very constructive, and genuine concerns were raised by hon. Members from all parties. It is in that spirit of constructive debate that I wish to speak to these new clauses.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-17_para13">
The new clauses are reasonable, moderate and fair, and I hope that the Minister of State will respond positively to them. New clause 5&nbsp;would require the Secretary of State to publish an annual rail efficiency report containing his assessment of the performance and cost effectiveness of Network Rail in the previous 12&nbsp;months. In particular, it would encourage him to provide comparative data in respect of those rail companies operating wholly or in part in the EU.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-17_para14">
The suggestion is not impractical. The Minister will know&#151;as will many Conservative Members&#151;that the EU position on railway service reform has three stages. Perhaps predictably, they are called the first railway package, the second railway package and the third railway package.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-17_para15">
The second railway package aims to create a legally and technically integrated European railway, and was adopted by the EU in April 2004. The third railway package sets out proposals to open up international passenger services to competition inside the EU by the year 2010. It is therefore entirely appropriate that we should, wherever possible, compare the performance of the UK rail network with that of our European counterparts.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-17_para16">
When hon. Members raise concerns about our railway system, they often say how wonderful the railways in France are. I have never had the delight of travelling on a French train, but I should be delighted to be able to scrutinise our performance in this country to see how it compares with what happens in France. In that way, I could determine whether the claims made about the French railway are accurate or apocryphal. An annual rail efficiency report would therefore do a service to us all, and I hope that the Minister can respond positively to the suggestion.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-17_para17">
New clause 6&nbsp;would require a review of assets to take place every three years, covering all land and other property owned by Network Rail that is redundant to railway use or which has not been used for railway purposes in the preceding 18&nbsp;months. The review would also contain a statement of intent regarding the future use or disposal of such assets.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-17_para18">
On 5&nbsp;March 2002, the Under-Secretary of State for Transport, the hon. Member for Plymouth, Devonport (Mr. Jamieson), responded to a question by stating that the Strategic Rail Authority had not carried out any evaluation of rail assets at that stage. In the past, there has been some criticism of the lack of information in respect of assets held by the rail network.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>27 Jan 2005 : Column 495</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-17_para19">
I am not necessarily critical of the fact that Network Rail might have some assets that are not currently in use and which are in a temporary limbo. It is justifiable for businesses to have certain assets that they may not use at present but which they may want to use in the future. It would be very short-sighted to force a company such as Network Rail to dispose of assets when it may have tentative plans to bring those assets into use in the future. New clause 6&nbsp;would not do that: instead, it would require the Secretary of State to produce a list of the relevant assets, and a statement of intent that would tell us what would become of them.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-17_para20">
I know that many assets have been realised over recent years, but many redundant assets remaining in Network Rail&#039;s asset base could be brought back into use or disposed of. I shall give the Minister an example. The main rail line from St. Pancras to the north has quite a lengthy stretch through Leicestershire that used to have four tracks. As a former regular user of that line, I was aware that two of those tracks were used exclusively for freight and two for passenger services. The reason for having four lines in that stretch was to allow the faster passenger trains to overtake the slower-moving goods vehicles.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-17_para21">
The collapse in rail freight a couple of decades ago caused someone in authority to decide that that stretch of line should not have four tracks. As a result, two of the tracks were taken up, but the track bed remains, and the people who manage these assets should be forced to decide whether they will be brought back into use in the future, or whether they should be realised and sold. The benefit of selling an asset that is for the moment dormant is that money is released for other railway purposes.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-17_para22">
Both new clauses are reasonable, and the history of our railway network shows why there are surplus assets in many parts of the country that Network Rail could sell. The Stockton to Darlington railway opened in 1821, thus beginning 100&nbsp;years in which the private sector raised capital for investment. It was a period of strong competition, which caused the original railway companies to lay tracks and purchase assets around the country. Some of those assets are still retained in railway ownership.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-17_para23">
We are in a different ball game now. It is right that Network Rail should be forced to justify the assets that it still has, and to indicate whether they will be brought back into use or whether they could be made available for sale.

<p><a name="50127-18_spnew0"><b> John Thurso: </b> 
 Both new clauses would place a duty on the Secretary of State to publish information or reports. However, they are relatively narrow, in that they concentrate on the financial side of his responsibilities.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-18_para0">
New clause 5&nbsp;deals with rail efficiency and the performance of Network Rail. In passing, a minor criticism is that it does not go far enough. By concentrating on Network Rail, it leaves out a large part of the rail system&#151;the train operating companies, the ROSCOs&#151;rolling stock companies&#151;and so on.

New clause 6&nbsp;relates specifically to a register of assets. I have no difficulty in supporting the new clauses, because they point the way to one of the deficiencies in the Bill. As the Minister knows, I support the Bill and the principle that the SRA should be abolished, because

<br>&nbsp;<br>it is right for the Government to take strategic responsibility for the railway. However, under the present arrangements, the SRA is under a duty to report on the matters mentioned in the new clauses and on a range of other matters. That report is made available to us. In the transfer of duties from the SRA to the Secretary of State, the duty to report has been lost, and the new clauses are intended to restore it.

</p>





<p><a name="50127-18_spnew1"><b> Mr. Mark Francois  (Rayleigh) (Con):</b> 
 I support my right hon. Friend the Member for East Yorkshire (Mr. Knight) and new clause 5, which calls for the publication of annual rail efficiency report by Network Rail. I should probably declare a small personal interest at this point, in as much as the chairman of Network Rail, Mr. Ian McAllister, is a constituent of mine, and I have written to him on the issue that I wish to raise this afternoon.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-18_para4">
I wish to back the suggestion for a specific efficiency report, because a good number of my constituents are commuters. Many of them work in the City of London and travel into Liverpool Street station each morning. The efficiency of Network Rail is of considerable importance to them, not least because there are now important capacity issues on the Liverpool Street line. Network Rail, and Railtrack before it, has undertaken work to upgrade the line, both in terms of signalling improvements and initiatives such as lengthening some of the platforms at stations to facilitate the operation of 12-carriage trains, which are obviously more efficient. We also now have the combined franchise, operated by the &#039;one&#039; group, which has led to some improvement in the co-ordination of services in and out of Liverpool Street, although the new timetable is taking a while to settle down.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-18_para5">
Important physical constraints must be faced, however, including a narrow entrance, or neck, in and out of Liverpool Street station, so that it is comparatively difficult to run many more trains in and out, especially during the morning and evening peaks. Incidentally, if we are to see much expansion in house building in the Thames gateway area, that restriction will be an increasing problem, because at least some of the people who will live in those houses will want to commute into London. Ministers will have to be conscious of that.
</p>





<p><a name="50127-18_spnew2"><b> Mr. Mark Field: </b> 
 Does my hon. Friend agree that the potential for increased capacity at Fenchurch Street station&#151;used by the constituents of other south Essex Members, if not by his, to come into central London&#151;

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>27 Jan 2005 : Column 497</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>is also limited. I therefore recognise the issues that he raises about the potentially large increase in housing capacity in the Thames gateway region.
</p>





<p><a name="50127-18_spnew3"><b> Mr. Francois: </b> 
 My hon. Friend raises an important point. I commuted into Fenchurch Street for some eight years, so I am familiar with that station. It, too, has a very narrow neck. It will be therefore a serious challenge to bring in additional trains from the east of London, because only so many trains will physically fit into so much space. Ministers will have to consider that situation seriously, as will a future Conservative Government.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-18_para6">
Speed restrictions still apply in some areas of the track at times, and further upgrade work&#151;especially on some of the bridges, which can be particular choke points in terms of speed restrictions&#151;would probably prove cost-effective in helping the trains to run more smoothly and efficiently. In addition, if we are to have an annual report specifically about efficiency, one area that it should cover is time lost to engineering works, especially when scheduled engineering works take place over a weekend but overrun into Monday morning. The track is opened again later than scheduled, so services during the Monday morning peak are disrupted. I have experienced that myself on several occasions in the past year when travelling to the House.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-18_para7">
In a letter I received from Network Rail in November, the company admitted that six such overruns had occurred in the previous nine months, including at least one occasion when the line could not be released until past 9&nbsp;am, with predictable consequences for commuters struggling into work. Greater effort may be required from Network Rail to try to prevent what should be an avoidable problem that is largely under its own control. They are, after all, the company&#039;s works. If Network Rail were required to report on the matter specifically every year, in a way easily accessible to commuters, it might help to focus minds on the problem.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-18_para8">
In fairness, I should say that Network Rail has already undertaken some initiatives to try to address the situation, so it is not as if it has ignored the difficulty or pretended that it does not exist. Nevertheless, the problem persists on occasions and greater effort needs to be applied to try to eradicate it. I am grateful for the opportunity to put those points on the record and I look forward to hearing the Minister&#039;s comments on the issues, which are of great interest to my constituents.
</p>





<p><a name="50127-18_spnew4"><b> Mr. McNulty: </b> 
 I shall start with a few points arising from the contribution by the hon. Member for Rayleigh (Mr. Francois). We fully accept and understand, as we have said repeatedly, that the railways&#151;and other transport dimensions&#151;need the infrastructure commensurate with the developments that are coming in the gateway, in north Kent and south Essex. Clearly, that will have a knock-on effect for assorted London terminals in the constituency of the hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster (Mr. Field), such as Liverpool Street, which will have to be factored into the mix.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-18_para9">
From the Kent perspective&#151;I know that the hon. Member for Rayleigh could care less about that as an Essex Member&#151;the channel tunnel rail link and other 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>27 Jan 2005 : Column 498</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>changes to the integrated Kent franchise will assist matters and, although they are meeting some resistance, they will redress the balance somewhat in terms of the numbers of trains going into Cannon Street, Fenchurch Street and St. Pancras. The changes are causing some disquiet among Kent commuters who have taken trains into Cannon Street for ever, and we will have to take into account how they will be affected.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-18_para10">
The hon. Gentleman also mentioned overruns. Engineering works need to be signed off only when it is safe to do so, and sometimes that means a couple of hours overrun with all the knock-on effects on the network. It is a fine balance, and Network Rail is getting better at it, but I cannot say that it will never happen again. In some cases, the safety considerations outweigh whatever delay and disruption may occur at that crucial time for commuters on a Monday morning. Safety must remain the key focal point.
</p>





<p><a name="50127-18_spnew5"><b> Mr. Mark Field: </b> 
 In view of the cost implications of finding land in central London at Fenchurch Street station or Cannon Street, does the Minister think that we should have hubs in Finsbury Park, Stratford&#151;which, in a sense, is already a hub&#151;or the other side of London Bridge station, to provide larger capacity? Should we have new or enlarged stations outside the central zone stations that already exist? If so, is that the sort of initiative that should be replicated in other large cities, where the sheer cost and inconvenience of developing existing stations in the centre means that it is wise to consider areas in the suburbs for development?
</p>





<p><a name="50127-18_spnew6"><b> Mr. McNulty: </b> 
 I think the answer is yes to some extent, but clearly it is dependent, whether it is in central London or elsewhere, on the existing hub and network reality as well as the potential for developing things further. The hon. Gentleman and other hon. Members know that we are seeking to overcome precisely such difficulties at Birmingham New Street. There will be a reconfiguration, once the channel tunnel rail link is up and running by 2009, in terms of the balance between the King&#039;s Cross/St. Pancras complex and a number of the channel tunnel rail link stations in the hon. Gentleman&#039;s constituency. As and when Thameslink 2000&nbsp;is taken forward&#151;perhaps the 2000&nbsp;should be in inverted commas; I do not know&#151;much of the real work there that will have a profound impact particularly on the southern commuter lines will be around the viaducts and bridges of Borough and the throat into London Bridge, and that will have serious ramifications in terms of enhancing capacity and efficiency.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-18_para11">
So a number of things can be done. Finsbury Park, which the hon. Gentleman mentioned, is a mini-hub already and by the end of this work we shall have a very substantial hub at Stratford, with 10&nbsp;or 11&nbsp;lines going into it. If we are moving on to developments similar to those at Stratford, if there is an opportunity to make them transport hubs if they are close to but not in the centre&#151;almost suburban but not quite; the hon. Gentleman will know what I mean&#151;we should avail ourselves of that opportunity.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-18_para12">
That leads me neatly to new clause 6&nbsp;rather than new clause 5, and I will deal with both in detail after I have given way.

 I thank the Minister for his courtesy in giving way. May I say for the record that even though I 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>27 Jan 2005 : Column 499</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>am an Essex MP I have considerable sympathy with Kent commuters because they face many of the problems as my constituents do commuting in from Essex? But on infrastructure, the Minister may be aware that the East of England regional assembly voted for increased housing targets in November 2004&nbsp;and then effectively abrogated that plan in December 2004, specifically because of a lack of transport infrastructure to accommodate house building on that scale. To be fair to the Minister, he has shown some awareness of the problem, but we cannot stress enough how important addressing this is going to be.
</p>





<p><a name="50127-19_spnew1"><b> Mr. McNulty: </b> 
 To be honest, the assembly did not abrogate it; it simply looked again and did not go quite as far as it had earlier in terms of numbers. That is slightly different from a complete abrogation of what it passed in the first instance. But without getting too far off the point and the matters before us, there is a &#163;200&nbsp;million pot for the community infrastructure fund to take up smaller projects and schemes throughout the gateway and the other growth areas that we are progressing, and at the last count the currently committed spending just in the gateway in terms of transport infrastructure has been the best part of some &#163;900&nbsp;million&#151;close to &#163;1&nbsp;billion; we have said time and again that of course the two must go together.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-19_para0">
The point that I was going to end on in speaking about stations was that while I have sympathy with new clauses 5&nbsp;and 6, for reasons that I shall explain I believe that both are unnecessary. But this point was raised at Second Reading and I do have some sympathy with it and am trying to pursue this more readily with Network Rail. It is not about its asset base; principally the land that it holds is operational rail land and not much more, and I shall return to that in detail. But there is an issue about what Network Rail can do in a proactive fashion around assorted termini to improve, and maybe enhance, passenger flow and so on by working far more readily than it has done thus far with the private sector, with the development industry, not only across the obvious London termini where there is clearly a commercial attraction but in other towns and cities too, and on a smaller level, to capture some sort of development gain. Network Rail has not been very good at that; I have told a constituent of the hon. Member for Rayleigh that to his face, so I am not talking out of turn. There is much more that can be done to turn our key termini far more readily into the transport interchanges and flourishing commercial ventures that they could be, perhaps far more so than they are now. I am exploring that and trying to move on with Network rail in that regard.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-19_para1">
If I may, I shall &quot;return to the clauses&quot; but I am not sure that I had got to them yet. New clause 5&nbsp;calls upon the Secretary of State to publish an annual assessment of the performance and efficiency of Network Rail in the form of a &quot;rail efficiency report&quot;, with what the right hon. Member for East Yorkshire suggested about EU comparative data. The independent Office of Rail Regulation already carries out such an annual assessment, in the form of&#151;I fully accept that it does not trip off the tongue as lightly as &quot;rail efficiency report&quot;&#151;its annual statement on Network Rail&#039;s stewardship of the national rail network. It is a different label but it does capture, I would suggest, what the right 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>27 Jan 2005 : Column 500</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>hon. Gentleman is after. Its first such report covered primarily the year April 2003&nbsp;to March 2004&nbsp;and was published in November 2004. A rail efficiency report, I would contend, would therefore create unnecessary duplication.

<a name="50127-19_time0"><h5>3.15&nbsp;pm</h5>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-19_para2">
The key function of the ORR is to monitor the performance and cost-effectiveness of Network Rail. The &quot;Statement on Network Rail&#039;s Stewardship of the National Rail Network 2003&#150;04&quot; is an evaluation of the extent to which Network Rail met the stewardship requirements of its network licence, regulatory targets, and those targets identified in the business plan for April 2003&nbsp;to March 2004. It covers all aspects of Network Rail&#039;s stewardship&#151;expenditure, maintenance, renewal, enhancement, asset knowledge, operations, performance and monitoring. It consolidates the analysis carried out during the year by the regulator and allows Network Rail&#039;s customers, funders, members, users and other stakeholders to see how efficiently Network Rail is managing this important national asset. The Secretary of State will publish the ORR&#039;s second annual statement in autumn 2005.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-19_para3">
I fully understand that in some ways that does not quite capture the reasons for the overruns and the reasons for the lack of efficiency, but they will be and are captured in other ways. As Minister with responsibility for rail, I have a meeting once a month with all the parties concerned, including Network Rail, just on performance of the various aspects of the rail industry, when those matters are explored further, but I do think this document does largely capture what the right hon. Gentleman rightly suggests should be in such an efficiency report. It sets out the regulatory calendar for the scrutiny of Network Rail&#039;s business plan and delivery against it. It includes an annual return, regulatory accounts and a quarterly statement, and the statement is presented as a balanced scorecard of high-level indicators that measure the extent to which Network Rail is achieving improvements and targets in a number of key areas of performance: safety, train performance, asset performance, activity volumes, finance, customer satisfaction and supplier satisfaction.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-19_para4">
The views of consultees are sought on whether these indicators are the right ones, whether they need to be expanded to reflect Network Rail&#039;s broader responsibilities following the rail review, and the frequency with which they should be published. We are consulting on that now as we speak. Data comparing Network Rail&#039;s performance with that of rail companies operating partly or wholly within the European Union are currently not available. Whilst the European Commission would like to enhance benchmarking data, there is no prospect of any meaningful data becoming available for the foreseeable future, but I do take the right hon. Gentleman&#039;s point and we shall continue to look to the ORR, in carrying out its periodic reviews, to conduct research looking at benchmarking performance with other selected comparators that are appropriate comparators with other EU countries, to inform its assessment of Network Rail&#039;s performance and efficient gains. I understand that this was the approach taken in the last periodic review.

I think that overall, given especially the shift of emphasis in terms of ORR and what it can do should the Bill receive Royal Assent, that would be a more effective approach than simply having an efficiency report by the Secretary of State. I would say too that many of the things we are doing outside the Bill would lend themselves more readily to trying to capture that performance assessment at the local level. We are requiring Network Rail to work much more closely with train operating companies on a franchise-by-franchise, region-by-region basis. Invariably, that is through a key integrated control centre, where Network Rail, the train operating company, and the rolling stock company if necessary, all sit side by side to manage that part of the network more efficiently.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-19_para6">
When the centres are up and running more readily&#151;I think that the next to go on stream will be the East Anglian one based at Liverpool Street&#151;proper communication and information flow will give us more realistic reasons why overruns occur. The hon. Member for Rayleigh and the right hon. Member for East Yorkshire suggested that all such information is available and I would not demur from that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-19_para7">
Although I understand the impetus behind new clause 6, which would provide for a triennial register of Network Rail&#039;s land and property assets that were redundant or had not been used for eighteen months, I am not sure that I would go along with it. Perhaps it would be helpful if I explained the background to the management and disposal of railway land. At the time of privatisation, the ownership of operational railway land was transferred to Railtrack, and subsequently Network Rail. The British Railways Board retained the non-operational land and buildings. That estate was transferred to BRB (Residuary) Ltd, a subsidiary of the Strategic Rail Authority, upon the SRA&#039;s establishment in 2001.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-19_para8">
As part of the periodic review process, Network Rail is encouraged to maximise its income from all sources, including the redevelopment of its land and property, by&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;exploiting appropriate disposal opportunities. However, a balance is needed to ensure that future rail development opportunities are not sacrificed for short-term financial gain through disposals. As everyone knows, Network Rail is regulated by the Office of Rail Regulation, and it must seek the ORR&#039;s consent before making arrangements for land disposal.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-19_para9">
I do not know about the specific piece of two-track line in Leicestershire that used to be the four-track line to which the right hon. Member for East Yorkshire referred. If there is any possible reason why that might be four-tracked again in the future, I would rather that is was left as it is and protected than for anything else to happen to it. That does not mean that something is imminent for that specific stretch. I am simply saying that it is sometimes appropriate for land to be held for more than 18&nbsp;months&#151;the time cited in new clause 6&#151;pending future development.

<p><a name="50127-20_spnew0"><b> Sir Michael Spicer  (West Worcestershire) (Con):</b> 
 Of course I take the point that land which is redundant today might not be redundant tomorrow. Just before privatisation, a lot of land became redundant because of 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>27 Jan 2005 : Column 502</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>the inefficiency of the railways under nationalisation. Privatisation led to more demand, and although we now want the duelling of track throughout my constituency, we did not want that under nationalisation. However, surely that does not negate the value of reporting to the House about what is thought to be operationally viable in the future or redundant in the way envisaged by new clause 6. Why not keep the House of Commons informed?
</p>





<p><a name="50127-20_spnew1"><b> Mr. McNulty: </b> 
 I am not saying that the House of Commons or anyone else should not be informed, but the ORR and Network Rail have a relationship in the first instance through which they can consider what happens to land. Let me go into a bit more detail, although we can return to the matter if hon. Members wish.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-20_para0">
Network Rail&#039;s forecast income from property was closely scrutinised by the ORR as part of the access charges review in 2003, precisely to ensure that Network Rail was maximising the revenue generating potential of its property portfolio. In the conclusions of the review, the ORR determined that Network Rail should earn &#163;1.2&nbsp;billion in property income over the five years from 1&nbsp;April 2004, which was &#163;50&nbsp;million more than Network Rail had forecast. That is clearly a challenging target, but assets, buildings and other portfolios do not stand idle while people decide what to do with them, because they form part of Network Rail&#039;s overall budget. As has been said, it is clearly best for Network Rail to determine how best to manage its property portfolio from day to day to optimise revenue earned from that without compromising its core business of operating, maintaining and renewing the rail network. It would not be terribly appropriate for civil servants or politicians to get involved in that process.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-20_para1">
The ORR thus already regulates and monitors the disposal of Network Rail&#039;s land and property. Network Rail&#039;s network licence includes a condition that was imposed by the rail regulator to prevent the disposal of land by Network Rail unless the ORR consents to such disposal. When reaching a decision, the ORR will consult various railway industry stakeholders for their views. Consent is likely to be refused if the land could be important to the continuing operation and further development of the network, as I said.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-20_para2">
The purpose of the licence condition is to ensure that parts of the Network Rail property portfolio that might be required for the future development of the railway are retained for that purpose. If consent is given, which may be for an individual case or in accordance with a general consent covering specified categories of land, the decision on whether, when and how land should be disposed is a commercial one for Network Rail.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-20_para3">
A balance must be struck between what the ORR reports about the previous disposal and utilisation of assets and the real commercial considerations of the ORR and Network Rail. Many of the suggestions made by the right hon. Member for East Yorkshire are covered in one way or another by the relationship between the ORR and Network Rail. However, the arbitrary time frames in new clause 6&nbsp;are not appropriate. When the post-SRA world settles down, I am more than happy to ensure that the right hon. Gentleman, his colleagues and anyone else who needs to know are aware of Network Rail&#039;s assets register, land 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>27 Jan 2005 : Column 503</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>holdings and the targets for the next periodic review. In that context, I would suggest that most of the concerns addressed by new clauses 5&nbsp;and 6&nbsp;either have been covered already, or are well on their way to being covered. Although I accept the substance of the right hon. Gentleman&#039;s points, I hope that he will withdraw the motion.
</p>





<p><a name="50127-20_spnew2"><b> Mr. Greg Knight: </b> 
 We have had a worthwhile debate. The hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross (John Thurso) criticised what he described as the narrow drafting of the new clauses, but accepted the thrust of the argument behind them. I suppose it was a case of praising with faint damns, but I thank him for his qualified support.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-20_para4">
My hon. Friend the Member for Rayleigh (Mr. Francois) drew the House&#039;s attention to specific problems occurring in his part of the country, and I am sure that the Minister will reflect on his comments. My hon. Friend made a telling point when he said that bridges on some parts of the network are choke points. They are indeed a big problem on a large part of the network, and in many cases they prevent the network from being opened up to increased freight business. If redundant assets could be sold to fund bridge replacement work, both passengers and freight customers would benefit.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-20_para5">
We take the Minister&#039;s point about retaining&#151;where appropriate&#151;currently unused railway land if there are plans to bring it into use in future. We accept that, of course, but it was not part of the aim we sought to achieve through new clause 6. I was delighted to hear that the hon. Gentleman accepts that Network Rail could do more and be more proactive about enhancing passenger flow. We give him two cheers for clearly acknowledging that more could be done. I hope that as long as he is a Transport Minister, he will stay on the case and ensure that Network Rail is indeed more active in improving the quality of travel for passengers. In the light of his response and of the fact that the Minister acknowledges that there is a problem, I shall not pursue new clause 6&nbsp;any further.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-20_para6">
I was less convinced by the Minister&#039;s response to new clause 5. There is a case for saying that as long as the railways remain under the wing of the Secretary of State, the Secretary of State should be answerable to the House and should have a duty to publish a rail efficiency report&#151;if only to focus his mind and ours on the fact that more could and should be done to improve rail efficiency. Although I thank the Minister for his comprehensive response, I still have some doubts regarding new clause 5, and when in doubt one should always take the mood of the House.

 I make no apology for spending a little time on new clause 9&nbsp;and the amendments grouped with it. They were requested by the National Assembly for Wales, not because Plaid Cymru Members asked for them, but because the Economic Development and Transport Committee of the National Assembly, chaired by Christine Gwyther AM, a former new Labour Minister of the Assembly, was concerned that they should be included in the Bill. To make matters slightly worse, and to add insult to injury, the Assembly had requested overall control of the railways in a measure in the Queen&#039;s Speech, but that proposal was dispatched with very little regard.

<a name="50127-21_para2">
Before I speak to the amendments, I wish to refer to a letter written by Christine Gwyther on 14&nbsp;January 2005&nbsp;to the Chairmen of the Railways Bill Committee. She says that her committee was
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;very conscious that the timetable set for the Parliamentary process is very tight and that this has put your Committee under enormous pressure in its scrutiny of the Bill. While this is not a matter for you, my Members were disappointed that the timing of this most important piece of legislation allowed so little time for wider consideration, or for the National Assembly to consider the Bill in much detail&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The Committee&#039;s overall view was that the Bill marked a major stage in the development of the Railways in Britain and provided an opportunity for a comprehensive transfer of powers over Welsh railways to the National Assembly. Members noted the substantial range of powers that it conferred on the Scottish Executive and were disappointed that the Secretary of State for Transport was retaining many of these powers in relation to Wales. A particular concern was the failure of the Bill to transfer to the National Assembly control over the infrastructure in Wales. Clearly, it is too late to make fundamental changes to the Bill, but there are two specific points which the Committee felt could easily be changed:</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">Members were concerned about the lack of control Wales would have over closures where the Assembly is not funding the rail service. Clauses 22&nbsp;to 31&nbsp;refer to National Authorities being notified of any closure proposal and then carrying out a consultation on this. However, while the Scottish Executive is the National Authority in Scotland, the Secretary of State for Transport would undertake this function in Wales. Members cannot see any reason why the National Assembly should not have this responsibility in Wales and urged you to amend the Bill accordingly.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-21_para3">
Finally, the letter states:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;One other anomaly relates to the confirming of bye-laws. The National Assembly already has extensive powers in this regard and the Committee cannot see why it should not have the same powers as Scottish Ministers in relation to schedule 9. This could be achieved by amending Paragraph 1&nbsp;of that schedule to include the National Assembly for Wales as the appropriate national authority for bye-laws relating to Welsh assets, with similar provisions to those relating to Scotland in relation to cross-border bye-laws.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-21_para4">
I have quoted extensively from that letter since I believe that it is important not only in itself, but with regard to further issues. We are always told about the successful partnership between the National Assembly for Wales and this place and that the way in which legislation works, as and when it is necessary, is that it is called for by the Welsh Assembly and put in train by Ministers in this place. This is a classic example where the devolution process breaks down utterly. For whatever reason, the pleas of the Assembly, the cross-party committee and the letter penned by the ex-new Labour Minister who chairs that committee have been ignored utterly by the Committee in this place. Its members had the representations in good time to table amendments. Indeed, amendments were tabled, and they are now being discussed.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-21_para5">
I have dealt with those points at length because I hope that somebody more kindly disposed to the devolution process in the other place will take them up. They are important if we are indeed going to refer to any form of partnership between the National Assembly for Wales and this place pro tem in any event.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-21_para6">
I shall not read out the new clause, as other Members have important amendments to speak to later, but I wish to make a brief point. The new clause emulates the provision for Scotland and falls very well into the rest of

<br>&nbsp;<br>the Bill, which gives the Assembly power to spend money on rail services. It calls for a railway strategy for Wales, which would guide decisions about where to put money and what money to put in. The Transport (Wales) Bill requires the Assembly to draw up a Wales transport strategy. A railway strategy could be a part of that, but in our view, it needs to be mentioned in the Railways Bill, as it needs to be an input into the Secretary of State&#039;s decisions about railways, particularly if the other amendments that we have tabled to strengthen the Assembly&#039;s powers are rejected.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-21_para7">
Amendment No. 33&nbsp;deletes &quot;Wales-only&quot; and inserts &quot;any Welsh&quot;. The purport of that is to give the Assembly a consultation role in any proposed franchise agreements which include Welsh stations, for example Paddington to Swansea, rather than to confine it to services run entirely within Wales.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-21_para8">
Amendment No. 36&nbsp;inserts a new subsection and adds the Assembly to the list of bodies that can own railway assets following the end of a franchise. One of the issues strongly raised by Miss Gwyther was the need for the infrastructure to be in the hands of the National Assembly.
</p>

Amendment No. 38&nbsp;adds the Assembly to the national authorities&#151;currently just the Scottish Executive and the Secretary of State&#151; which must

That comes from subsection (6). This is a proposal from a service operator to discontinue a service that the franchise does not require the operator to run and which, if it is decided to delete it, should not be allowed to run. Therefore this is to secure the provision of services.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-21_para11">
Amendment No. 39&nbsp;adds the Assembly to the definition of national authorities that must consider proposals coming from funding authorities, rather than service operators, to discontinue a service that may not be required under the franchise agreement.

Amendment No. 41&nbsp;adds the Assembly to the national authorities that must consider proposals coming from service operators to discontinue excluded services, which are basically services other than ordinary passenger services. The wording emulates that which applies to Scotland.

Amendment No. 59&nbsp;gives the Assembly power to make railway byelaws. Miss Gwyther specifically asked for this in her letter to the Committee. I ask the Minister to address these points, as I am sure he will. I felt it necessary to put them on the record because the last thing we want is for the National Assembly to feel that it has been entirely excluded from the process. I realise that the request came rather late to the Committee. Nevertheless, the request was plainly made well before today.

In broad terms, I can see no reason why Wales should not be permitted the same devolutionary responsibilities as Scotland. Some difficulties exist, and the hon. Member for Islington, North (Jeremy Corbyn) has made the point that whereas the Scottish railway system is almost wholly in Scotland and has two well-defined routes in the west and the east, the situation is more complex in Wales, because the railways dip in and out of England. That difficulty in formulating strategy is not apparent in Scotland.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-22_para2">
On the principle of the matter, the Welsh Assembly should be permitted as much say in the railways as possible. I have said this before, and I am sure that I will say it again: the correct principle for devolution is that what can be devolved should be devolved. Assembly Members&#151;in particular, Jenny Randerson, who speaks for the Liberal Democrats on such matters&#151;have contacted me to make the point that all parties would like to see a greater role for the Welsh Assembly. I hope that the Government will listen with some sympathy to the points that have been made and consider&#151;if not today, in another place&#151;how they might fulfil the legitimate aspirations for devolution expressed by the hon.

<p><a name="50127-22_spnew7"><b> Mr. McNulty: </b> 
 I do not doubt that these are serious matters. Nor do I doubt that the hon. Member for Ceredigion (Mr. Thomas), who sat&#151;or rather, did not sit&#151;for Plaid Cymru on the Committee, had difficulties on the day that the amendments should have been debated. These amendments should therefore be treated with all due consideration and regard, and in detail, and I shall try to respond to them in that context. However, the record should show that the inundation took place on only one sitting day. The hon. Member for Ceredigion popped along to see us for about half an hour on the first day that we sat and was not there for the remaining seven sittings. That is a matter of regret, not least for the hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross (John Thurso), who, as he said, would have wanted to discuss the amendments had that been possible. I understand about the flood, but to turn up for only one sitting, albeit with an excuse for one of the others, is not a terribly good batting average for any member of any Committee.

<p>
<a name="50127-22_para3">
New clause 9&nbsp;seeks a power for the National Assembly for Wales to prepare and publish railway strategies for Wales that is equivalent to Scottish Ministers&#039; powers in relation to Scottish railway strategies in clause 5. I contend that that is unnecessary. The Secretary of State has overall policy responsibility for the strategic direction of the railway in England and Wales. Scottish Ministers have the power to prepare a railway strategy because they have equivalent franchising and network functions in Scotland to those of the Secretary of State in England and Wales. I understand that the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy (Mr. Llwyd) addresses those points in later amendments, which I shall deal with in due course.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-22_para4">
Although the Bill does not place a statutory duty on the Secretary of State to publish railway strategies in the same way that section 206&nbsp;of the Transport Act 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>27 Jan 2005 : Column 512</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>2000&nbsp;makes it a duty of the Strategic Rail Authority to publish such strategies, he will have an overall strategy for the railway. From time to time, the Department for Transport will undoubtedly publish documents that set out his objectives in this regard. The Department will certainly consult the National Assembly for Wales as a matter of course when preparing any strategies that affect Wales.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-22_para5">
The Bill already requires the Secretary of State to consult the Assembly before exercising certain key functions: for example, before he gives general guidance to the Office of Rail Regulation as to that body&#039;s exercise of its functions, which is in clause 3; before he publishes a statement of policy on franchising, which is in schedule 1; and before issuing invitations to tender for franchises that provide or include Welsh services or entering into such a franchise without a tendering process, which is in clause 10. The Bill already has elements that take full account of the need to consult the Assembly.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-22_para6">
Moreover, there is nothing in the Bill to prevent the Assembly from preparing and publishing its own strategy for the Welsh railway. As the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy will know, it already funds a significant programme of rail investment as part of its policy of developing an integrated transport system, which is set out in its document, &quot;The Transport Framework for Wales&quot;. Clause 3&nbsp;anticipates the Assembly&#039;s strategies. It provides that the Office of Rail Regulation must have regard to any Assembly&#039;s railway policies or strategies notified to it when exercising its functions under part 1&nbsp;of the Railways Act 1993&nbsp;and the Bill. Subsection (8) says that the ORR must
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;have regard to any notified strategies and policies of the National Assembly for Wales, so far as they relate to Welsh services or to any other matter in or as regards Wales that concerns railways or railway services&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-22_para7">
The provision therefore already exists. There is a logic and integrity to the Bill&#039;s provisions for Wales and the National Assembly. I know that the hon. Gentleman wants to go much further and I shall deal with the amendments that try to achieve that shortly. However, the measure&#039;s logic reflects the asymmetrical democracy that exists through devolution in this country. As the hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross said, it reflects the relative weight, power and functions of the respective institutions.
</p>





<p><a name="50127-22_spnew8"><b> Mr. Llwyd: </b> 
 I am genuinely grateful for the detail that the Minister is providing in his response. However, the debate echoes what was said when the Strategic Rail Authority was set up. People in Wales felt that there should have been either a separate Welsh branch of the SRA or a strong Welsh representation. However, I repeat that I am grateful to the Minister for going into such detail.
</p>





<p><a name="50127-22_spnew9"><b> Mr. McNulty: </b> 
 I do not doubt that the hon. Gentleman is right. He will understand that I did not follow the debate on establishing the SRA with the same attention to detail and interest with which I am following the current debate, for obvious reasons. However, in the past year or two, the SRA has moved more readily towards a regional focus and taken account of the regional sensitivities that exist throughout the United Kingdom. We do not want to

Amendment No. 33&nbsp;would give the Assembly a great deal more power&#151;more power than Scottish Ministers would enjoy. It would make the National Assembly and the Secretary of State joint signatories to all the English franchises that cross the border into Wales. The Scottish Ministers will not have that power for the east and west coast franchises&#151;the rough parallel that one could draw.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-22_para9">
The core of the Bill as it relates to Wales is the Assembly&#039;s role in the Arriva Trains Wales franchise. That is the only franchise that currently provides what the Bill defines as &quot;Wales-only services&quot;. As drafted, the Bill gives the Assembly the right to be a joint signatory with the Secretary of State to the Arriva Trains Wales franchise, thus recognising the importance of that franchise to Wales.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-22_para10">
Clause 10(1) deals with the other important relationship between the Secretary of State and the National Assembly: on consultation about all franchises that serve Wales. My hon. Friend the Member for Islington, North made that point earlier. The Assembly will have the clear right to be consulted about franchises that provide Welsh services. That will give the Assembly the opportunity to say what it would like to achieve for Wales from them. It will also be able to use the broad powers in clause 10&nbsp;to provide financial assistance to secure additional services from the relevant franchisee.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-22_para11">
If he considered it appropriate, the Secretary of State could invite the National Assembly to be a joint signatory to a franchise that provided Welsh services&#151;for example, if the Assembly wished to secure significant services via the franchise. Clause 10(3) enables him to do that. However, it is right that that remains a flexible option. I do not therefore believe that amendment No. 33&nbsp;is necessary.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-22_para12">
Amendment No. 36&nbsp;would enable the Assembly to be the recipient of franchise assets at the end of a franchise agreement. At the end of the term of a franchise in England and Wales, it will be the Secretary of State&#039;s responsibility to make a transfer scheme in relation to the franchise assets. In Scotland, that role will be performed by Scottish Ministers.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-22_para13">
Clause 12&nbsp;sets out the parties to whom the franchise assets may transfer. They include the Secretary of State, the Scottish Ministers or a company that is either wholly or jointly owned by the Secretary of State and the Scottish Ministers, and a franchise company. The Secretary of State must consult every party to which he proposes to transfer assets before making the transfer scheme.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-22_para14">
The primary intention of the clause is to transfer designated franchise assets at the end of the franchise to the new operator of train services. In the vast majority of cases, the new operator will be the new private sector franchisee. A transfer scheme will be made to transfer the franchise assets from the old franchise company to the new one. The out-going company will be paid by the in-coming train operator for the franchise assets in accordance with the terms of the franchise agreement.

<p>
<a name="50127-22_para15">
In a small number of cases, the Secretary of State, Scottish Ministers or companies owned by them will operate a train service as the operator of last resort on a temporary basis. Assets such as ticket machines and office equipment will therefore have to be transferred to those bodies to allow them to provide the service. There is no provision in the Bill for the National Assembly for Wales to operate services as the operator of last resort. The Assembly is therefore not included in the list of bodies that can receive a transfer of franchise assets.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-22_para16">
That does not prevent the Assembly from owning certain assets in relation to a franchise. For example, if the Assembly were to invest in the Arriva Trains Wales franchise and there were certain assets that it considered should remain the responsibility of the Assembly, those assets need not be designated as franchise assets. The franchise agreement could clearly state that those assets were not among the franchise assets and were to be returned to the Assembly, which would then decide how they were to be used. On replacing the Arriva Trains Wales franchise in future, it would be for the Assembly to decide how it wished such assets to be used by the new franchise operator. The Assembly will of course be involved in the re-letting process, and will be consulted by the Secretary of State about that franchise and all franchises that serve Wales. However the ultimate statutory responsibility rests with the Secretary of State. I am therefore convinced that amendment No. 36&nbsp;is unnecessary.

I understand the import of amendments Nos. 38, 39, 41&nbsp;and 48&nbsp;to 51, which all seek to make the National Assembly for Wales the national authority in Wales for the purposes of clauses that deal with network modifications. At present, the Secretary of State has that role. The amendments, if accepted, would give the Assembly the same status in Wales as Scottish Ministers have in Scotland in this regard. Throughout clauses 22&nbsp;to 31, the only national authorities are the Secretary of State and Scottish Ministers. Scottish Ministers have this duty for all services, stations and networks wholly within Scotland and for some cross-border services; it rests with the Secretary of State in all other circumstances. This reflects and is part of the much wider devolution of responsibility for railway policy and funding to Scottish Ministers. Apart from in a few important areas such as safety, Scottish Ministers now have policy responsibility for all aspects of Scotland&#039;s railway. That makes it appropriate for them to be the national authority in the circumstances that I have just described.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-22_para18">
As hon. Members have pointed out, that devolution settlement has not been extended to Wales. Under the Bill, devolution of railway policy and funding to the Assembly is much less extensive than to Scottish Ministers, and I fully accept that that is the cause of the complaint by the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy. The Assembly is taking on responsibility for franchising services in Wales, and those starting and finishing in Wales, through the Arriva Trains Wales franchise. However, the Secretary of State continues to have a major role relating to the railway in Wales&#151;in specifying high-level outputs for the railway under schedule 4&nbsp;to the Bill and funding the network, for example. Part of the reason for this is that the network in Wales is much less discrete an entity than the network in Scotland, which makes fuller devolution difficult at present.

That being the case, it would be inappropriate for the Assembly to be the national authority for the purposes of this clause. Retaining this role for the Secretary of State fits better with the more general approach to devolving railway responsibilities to the Assembly, and is also simpler and more straightforward. Of course, in acting as the national authority for the purposes of the clause, the Secretary of State will need to consult and work closely with the National Assembly. There is already a requirement in schedule 7&nbsp;for the Assembly to be a statutory consultee in relation to all closure proposals affecting Wales. Backing this up will be the extensive formal and informal discussions envisaged in the memorandum of understanding between the Secretary of State and the National Assembly.

 Does the Minister accept that some services, such as those operating on the Fishguard and Cardiff to Paddington line and those running along the north Wales coast, effectively serve local communities? They are mainline train services, but people use them in the same way as they would use a regional network such as Arriva, which operates within Wales. How would the Assembly discharge its responsibilities in regard to lines which the Minister would say start in Wales and end in England?
</p>

 I accept that point, which alludes to the complexities of the issue. Equally, portions, and no more than portions, of many of our high-speed lines in an English context will be utilised as inter-communal lines as well in various parts of the country. In terms of the examples given, and specifically the Assembly, such matters will be worked out between the provisions in the Bill relating to Wales, which I have described thus far and will come on to describe, and the memorandum of understanding to which I have just alluded. In those or other circumstances in which an Assembly viewpoint should be given in discussions on any aspect of rail services in Wales, there should be no blockage on that view being reflected. We are not simply in the business of imposing from the centre what view should prevail in terms of the Welsh rail network. Equally, we are trying to work with the Assembly around the complexities to which the hon. Gentleman and others have alluded. I am trying to do so by taking the amendments as seriously as I can and in the spirit in which they were suggested. The memorandum will pick up many of those complexities, beyond what is not already reflected in the Bill.

Although the National Assembly is not a national authority, it has a significant role in closure procedures in Wales.

Consultation will take place with the Assembly to come to some broad agreement on what specifically those should be in relation to Wales, as they need to be published jointly with the Secretary of State, as I suggested. The Assembly is also a designated railway funding authority under clause 44&nbsp;of the Bill. The effect of that and the Assembly&#039;s funding of the Arriva Wales franchise will be that the Assembly will have the power to initiate closure proposals for the services that it funds through the Arriva Wales franchise. In that context, although I understand the import and thrust of that series of amendments, they are not absolutely necessary.

<a name="50127-23_para2">
Amendments Nos. 57&nbsp;and 59, taken together, to which the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy alluded, seek to amend schedule 9&nbsp;to replicate in Wales the arrangements for confirmation of railway byelaws, before they come into effect, that apply in Scotland. More specifically, the amendments would mean that where the byelaws affect only railway assets in Wales, they would need to be confirmed by the National Assembly. Where the byelaws affect railway assets including those in Wales, they would need to be confirmed by both the Welsh Assembly and the Secretary of State.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-23_para3">
As currently drafted, the Bill makes the Secretary of State responsible for approving the byelaws of all railway operators wherever assets are located or used in England and Wales. This role is consistent with the Secretary of State&#039;s overall responsibility for the railway network in England and Wales. In Scotland, the Scottish Ministers have overall responsibility, hence their role in approving byelaws. I can understand the Assembly&#039;s desire to have a greater role in this regard. However, the arrangements set out in the Bill do not exclude it entirely. Byelaws will be made by the railway operator. The arrangements for approving the byelaws will not prevent the Assembly from working with Arriva Trains on the development of byelaws for the operator&#039;s stations and trains, which would then be approved by the Secretary of State.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-23_para4">
I assure the hon. Gentleman that I will examine further the matter of byelaws and how they reflect dealings with Arriva Trains Wales, to see whether there is some way, perhaps outwith the Bill, that we can ensure that the Assembly plays a fuller role. I understand the importance of byelaws in many regards, although I am sure that he has read the <i>Official Report</i> of the assorted Committee proceedings, which reflect that there were those in Committee who would choose to push the byelaws a little too far in some regards. I will examine the byelaws point in more detail, to see whether through the memorandum, or some other way, there can be some accommodation.

&#039;(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It shall be the duty of the Office of Rail Regulation (ORR) to publish, before the end of each calendar year, a report on safety.

</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-23_para8">
The new clause is very straightforward. It seeks to give the Office of Rail Regulation a duty to spotlight safety issues, which I think is important. I am not being alarmist, but in 2003&#150;04&nbsp;there was a pronounced increase in the number of incidents in which fewer than five fatalities occurred in the United Kingdom, as compared with the preceding two years. Although there were no major incidents in 2003&#150;04, there were several minor incidents on the network. My hon. Friend the Member for Caernarfon (Hywel Williams) and I know of one or two quite close to our constituencies, at Porthmadoc, and there have been some near misses elsewhere. There was a 6&nbsp;per cent. reduction in the number of incidents of signals being passed at danger in 2003&#150;04, but there were 378, which is quite a large number.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-23_para9">
Without being alarmist, we firmly believe that as there will no longer be a separate body to consider this issue&#151;the Health and Safety Commission, whose responsibilities are to be absorbed into those of the Office of Rail Regulation&#151;the public would be reassured if the Bill took account of that change by reorganising the railways to strengthen safety provision. We would also like the ORR, when it reports annually, 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>27 Jan 2005 : Column 518</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>to have criteria on which to judge relative safety in the relevant year, in the context of performance targets and the like.

<a name="50127-24_para0">
In the light of what we have just heard, I think it worth pointing out that rail travel in the UK is still one of the safest forms of travel. However, Conservative Members have some sympathy with new clause 12. Its aims are laudable. I have reservations about the potentially heavy-handed nature of these provisions, but if it is a question of balancing improved safety scrutiny against the imposition of a heavy-handed framework, we would all say that safety must come first. I hope that the Minister will be able to reassure the House that the new clause is not needed.
</p>





<p><a name="50127-24_spnew1"><b> Mr. McNulty: </b> 
 As the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy (Mr. Llwyd) said, new clause 12&nbsp;seeks to impose on the Office of Rail Regulation a statutory duty to publish an annual safety report. The ORR would be required to include in the report information on passenger and non-passenger injuries and fatalities, and conclusions as to their causes; recommendations resulting from consideration of these incidents; and findings and recommendations arising from reviews of safety at level crossings. The statutory duty would also require that reviews of safety at level crossings be conducted annually.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-24_para1">
I agree with the right hon. Member for East Yorkshire (Mr. Knight)&#151;the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy seemed to make the same point&#151;that accidents of one sort or another are always likely to occur on our rail system. Mercifully, grave incidents are few and far between, and rail remains overwhelmingly one of the safest forms of transport. We will all agree that when accidents do occur and difficulties arise, the actions of our emergency services and all subsequent inquiries and reports are expedited, in so far as they can be, in an extremely professional and committed fashion.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-24_para2">
The right hon. Member for East Yorkshire has anticipated me, in that I shall ask the House to resist the new clause, which is not necessary, as I hope to show. The Health and Safety Executive is currently responsible for publishing an annual report on the safety record of the railways&#151;a function that is set out in the memorandum of understanding drawn up by the Secretary of State for Transport and the Health and Safety Commission. That MOU details the respective working arrangements and responsibilities in respect of railway safety, including the functions to be performed by the HSE. There is no statutory requirement in the Health and Safety at Work, etc. Act 1974&nbsp;for the HSE to publish an annual report on railway safety. Such reports give details of incidents involving passengers and non-passengers, as well as those involving level crossings, and they are publicly available, free of charge, on the HSE&#039;s website. The HSE considers safety recommendations separately, in the context of inquiries and investigations commissioned for specific incidents.

<b>27 Jan 2005 : Column 519</b>

<p>
<a name="50127-24_para3">
In transferring safety functions from the HSE to the ORR, we will seek to ensure that all such functions continue to be carried out in the same manner. Although there was no statutory requirement on the HSE to publish a safety report, the ORR should do so and we anticipate that it will. Indeed, we expect a similar reporting function to be set out in an MOU, to be drawn up by the Secretary of State and the ORR. The drawing up of an MOU with the ORR will form part of the transition arrangements.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-24_para4">
The Rail Safety and Standards Board is also required to publish an annual safety report. Furthermore, the rail accident investigation branch will have a duty to produce a report on all accidents and incidents that are the subject of an investigation. The intention is that the regulations providing for these duties will come into force later this year. We need to consider how best to fit these publications together, with a view to providing the public with information in the most effective way. Although I cannot say at this stage exactly how that will be done, I can assure the House that the information currently available to the public will continue to be available. In that context, I suggest that the new clause is unnecessary.

The present health and safety regime on the railways will continue following the transfer to ORR, as will the publication requirements placed on the RSSB.

<p><a name="50127-24_spnew4"><b> Mr. Chope: </b> 
 Many disabled people still feel disenfranchised when they consider embarking on a rail journey, and the new clause would put that right. Rail journeys should be a pleasant experience for everyone, regardless of whether they are disabled, and I hope that the new clause will engender the Government&#039;s support.
</p>





<p><a name="50127-24_spnew5"><b> Mr. McNulty: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman has been very brief in his presentation of the new clause, but I am sure that the House shares his concerns about disabled passengers. I disagree, however, that the new clause goes further than existing provision. When one considers the lot of disabled passengers under the previous Conservative Government between 1979&nbsp;and 1997, the new clause is, frankly, a joke. However, this is an important matter for discussion.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-24_para7">
The new clause would require the Secretary of State to promulgate a code of practice for protecting disabled railway users in England and Wales. It would empower the Secretary of State to prepare and, from time to time, revise that code of practice. It would require him to publish it, and each revision of it. Finally, it would require him to consult the Department&#039;s disabled persons transport advisory committee before preparing or revising the code. It is designed to provide for a duty on the Secretary of State to maintain a code in England and Wales that corresponds to the power in clause 47&nbsp;allowing Scottish Ministers to prepare a similar code. I strongly believe that the new clause is unnecessary, and suggest that it be withdrawn. If it is not withdrawn, I ask the House to resist it because a stronger provision is already included in the Bill.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-24_para8">
The existing requirement on the SRA to maintain a code of practice is contained in section 71B of the Railways Act 1993. Paragraph 29&nbsp;of schedule 1&nbsp;to the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill preserves that requirement, substituting the Secretary of State for the SRA. The Secretary of State&#039;s duty will extend to the whole of Great Britain, with the Scottish Executive&#039;s code applying only to services that they procure, including the ScotRail franchise. The schedule 1&nbsp;provision is stronger than the terms of the new clause in that it additionally requires the Secretary of State to promote the adoption and implementation of the code, but the new clause would require him only to revise and publish the code from time to time. The requirements in the new clause would not achieve anything for disabled passengers. Schedule 1&nbsp;also makes transitional provision to continue in force any existing SRA code and to enable the Secretary of State to draw on any consultation already undertaken by the SRA. That will provide continuity between the position as it stands under section 71B of the Railways Act 1993&nbsp;and the position in the post-SRA period. That is important, but the new clause would mean the loss of that continuity.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-24_para9">
Amendment No. 60&nbsp;seeks to add an additional requirement on the Scottish Ministers as to which bodies they must consult before publishing a code of practice for disabled rail users in Scotland under clause 47. The clause currently requires consultation with the disabled persons transport advisory committee, which is the body that SRA must currently consult when preparing a code of practice under the Transport Act 2000, and the body that the Secretary of State will be required to consult when he acquires the SRA&#039;s duty. Therefore the third element of the new clause is 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>27 Jan 2005 : Column 521</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>redundant, because it provides for something that already happens and will continue to happen under the new system.

On the question of consultation, can he say whether the SRA is&#151;or the Secretary of State will be&#151;under any obligation to consult the Disability Rights Commission, which has been established since the 1993&nbsp;legislation?
</p>





<p><a name="50127-25_spnew1"><b> Mr. McNulty: </b> 
 That is a fair point, but I will have to get back to the House on it. I am not completely au fait with the legislation that established the DRC, so I do not know whether it drew in all consultation requirements in extant legislation.

Gentleman and the House on that point.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-25_para0">
The amendment would add the Mobility and Access Committee Scotland as a second consultee, after the disabled persons transport advisory committee, for Scottish matters. I freely concede that the amendment raises a very good point. MACS has been established by the Scottish Parliament to fulfil a similar role in Scotland to that of DPTAC in Great Britain and the Scottish Executive have advised that MACS is very important, but we need to take a step back. I have some sympathy with the principle behind the amendment, but we still think that it is unnecessary. As the matter is convoluted, let me go through it briefly.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-25_para1">
The Mobility and Access Committee for Scotland was established by the Scottish Parliament in 2002, and fulfils a similar role to DPTAC. DPTAC was established under legislation that pre-dated devolution, but equal opportunities law, including the Disability Discrimination Act 1995, is reserved to Westminster. So, on the face of current legislation, DPTAC continues to have a role in Scotland.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-25_para2">
However, DPTAC and MACS work closely together. They have a concordat between them that will ensure that their work is complementary and that while DPTAC will deal with all issues that are reserved to Westminster, MACS will deal with issues that are devolved to the Scottish Parliament. I can imagine a much greater role for MACS in future with the additional devolution proposed by the Bill, but believe me, Madam Deputy Speaker, I have looked into how one might unpick the pre-devolution legislation that established DPTAC&#151;pre-devolution legislation that established much of the framework of our equal opportunities legislative framework&#151;and I have discovered that a great many amendments would be needed to get it all in order to such an extent that we could simply say that in Scotland, given where we have got to with greater devolution on rail, MACS should be consulted, and in the rest of the country DPTAC should be. Although it is convoluted, I think that that explanation renders the amendment unnecessary.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-25_para3">
So, there would be a much greater role for MACS in future, given the additional devolution proposed by the Bill. However, a duty for Scottish Ministers to consult 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>27 Jan 2005 : Column 522</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>DPTAC but not MACS, however silly it sounds, should not adversely affect the existing role of MACS. Existing arrangements should ensure that DPTAC involves MACS or refers to it where an issue relates to devolved matters. I am also sure that when the Scottish Executive do consult on the code of practice, they will involve as wide an audience as necessary.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-25_para4">
Although I have, as I have tried to explain, enormous sympathy with amendment No. 60, I think that, for many of the reasons that I have suggested in terms of the legislative complexities, it is unnecessary; equally, given the increasingly strong relationship between DPTAC and MACS, if the import of the amendment is to ensure that the Scottish voice of disabled transport users is as fully involved and consulted as possible once these rail matters have been devolved to the Scottish Executive, the House can have, I think, my assurance that we will work together with the Scottish Executive to ensure that what the amendment seeks to do will prevail. But please do not ask me to take the matter back and come back with what will be, I would guess, anything from 30&nbsp;to 50&nbsp;amendments just to get all the legislative elements lined up so that what we all want can prevail strictly and purely in law. Rather, I ask hon. Members, please accept the assurance that it will prevail in reality. We do not want to go unpicking pre and post-devolution legislation and the statutory framework. In that context, I hope that the new clause will be withdrawn and the amendment will not be pressed.

<br>

<br>
&#039;(9)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Secretary of State may not exercise his powers under subsections (2) and (3) to make a scheme to transfer the relevant franchise assets of any franchise currently operated by the Strategic Rail Authority (SRA) to a franchise company.

<p><a name="50127-25_spnew4"><b> Mr. Llwyd: </b> 
 The effect of amendment No. 35&nbsp;is obvious. It would make safety a paramount consideration overriding other provisions in franchise agreements. It would open up the possibility of renationalising rail services on safety grounds, although the term &quot;transfer&quot; could include a transfer to a private company.

 There are only 15&nbsp;minutes left in the debate, so I shall be as brief as possible. I shall speak to amendments Nos. 18, 17&nbsp;and 4, which I have tabled. With your permission, Madam Deputy Speaker, I hope to press amendment No. 17&nbsp;to a Division at the appropriate time.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-25_para5">
The Bill is part of a sequence of events since 1997&nbsp;during which we have been on a path of overcoming the problems faced by the railway industry as a result of privatisation under the previous Conservative Government. Although I do not think that the amendments go far enough, they offer a range of ways in which the Bill could be improved to bring back a degree of public ownership and public sector involvement.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-25_para6">
I argue the case for public sector ownership, control and accountability because the promises that we were given at the time of privatisation have demonstrably not been fulfilled. We were told that privatisation would bring about more investment in the railways and that the service would be improved. We were told that there would be a transfer of risk from the public sector to the private sector and that we would have a more efficient railway system throughout the country. I congratulate the Government on the massive growth in investment, but that has come not from the private sector, but the Government, taxpayers and passengers.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-25_para7">
Last year&#039;s public subsidy to the private sector from the taxpayers of this country was &#163;2&nbsp;billion. Since privatisation, the Government have put &#163;10&nbsp;billion into the railway industry, but &#163;1&nbsp;billion of that&#151;figures now suggest that it might be nearer &#163;2&nbsp;billion&#151;has been creamed off for profit. Today&#039;s <i>Evening Standard</i> publishes the various companies&#039; profits for last year. Their profits have risen by an average of 20&nbsp;per cent., with FirstGroup making &#163;60&nbsp;million, National Express &#163;54&nbsp;million and Stagecoach &#163;43&nbsp;million. The private sector continues to exploit the railway industry for its own benefit.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-25_para8">
We were told on Second Reading that we required private sector involvement because it would bring &#163;70&nbsp;million a week of additional investment to the railway industry itself, but recent independent examination by independent experts has demonstrated that all that &#163;70&nbsp;million a week is public sector money that has been laundered back into the system. It is made up of subsidies provided to the private sector which it then disguises as its own investment.

</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-25_para9">
Profiteering has gone on apace, which is why we need a publicly accountable railway system. Profits have been achieved by what is called &quot;sweating the assets&quot;, which means cutting services, exploiting the work force, and sometimes putting passengers at risk by undermining safety regulations and practices. We have heard of two further examples of that this week. On Monday, the <i>Daily Mirror</i> exposed yet again the fact that maintenance contracts on track renewal have led to the system being left unsafe overnight and over the weekend because of inadequate work done by inexperienced people. Only two days ago, 100,000&nbsp;passengers were unable to travel on the London Underground because the private company managing the service could not complete its work overnight, as it did not bring the materials required for the job. Costs have escalated under the private sector, and costs for maintenance and renewal have almost doubled in the private sector compared with those under British Rail.
</p>

<p><a name="50127-26_spnew0"><b> Jeremy Corbyn: </b> 
 Is my hon. Friend aware that the company Tube Lines, which is owned by Jarvis, has got into enormous financial difficulty and, indeed, has sold its contracts with the public sector to refurbish parts of the London Underground? There is now trading in public contracts, but priority should be given to finishing those contracts for the public interest and the public good, rather than advancing share prices in the City.
</p>





<p><a name="50127-26_spnew1"><b> John McDonnell: </b> 
 Companies trading in profits is understandable when one looks at examples such as National Express, which expects a 70&nbsp;per cent. increase on last year&#039;s profits. How can that provide value for money for the public sector and for the travelling public?
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-26_para0">
When the public sector demonstrates that it can run a service effectively and efficiently and give good value, as when Connex South Eastern went bust and South Eastern Trains took over the franchise, what happens? The Government force the operation back into the private sector. The private sector argues that its involvement enables transfer of risk, but we know that when that risk becomes too great, the public sector has to take it over again. That is what happened with the channel tunnel, Connex South Eastern and the maintenance contracts across the whole industry. Transfer of risk was a myth; it has been clearly demonstrated that it never worked from the start.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-26_para1">
I am unable to comprehend why the Government cannot now allow some form of public sector operational involvement in the railways industry. The general public are convinced: poll after poll shows that the public want the railways to be brought back into the public sector. As for the Labour party, I remind comrades and colleagues that at its last conference the party voted overwhelmingly for a policy to bring rail back into public ownership. When South Eastern Trains was discussed at the London Labour party conference, which took place only weeks ago, it was agreed unanimously that South Eastern Trains should remain in the public sector. It is absolutely bizarre that the Government will not even allow the public sector a level playing field with the private sector. That is what amendment No. 17&nbsp;would achieve.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>27 Jan 2005 : Column 525</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-26_para2">
Amendment No. 18&nbsp;is straightforward: it invites the Secretary of State to bring the railway industry back into public ownership as franchises run out. Amendment No. 17&nbsp;simply proposes that when a franchise comes up for renewal, there should be a public sector comparator to enable an independent assessment of whether the public or the private sector can run it best; then, the contract should be awarded according to the results of that assessment.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-26_para3">
Amendment No. 4&nbsp;states simply, &quot;If it ain&#039;t broke, don&#039;t fix it.&quot; If South Eastern Trains is running operations effectively in the public sector, why not leave it there? Ironically, it may well remain in the public sector&#151;the Norwegian public sector, unfortunately, since Norway&#039;s state railway is bidding for the operation. The Government have a bizarre ideological commitment&#151;a dogmatic commitment&#151;to the private sector. It reminds us of the Victorian commitment to the hidden hand of the market, or, perhaps more appropriately, the American neo-conservatives&#039; mantra for every occasion: &quot;Private sector good, public sector bad.&quot; It appears that the only role that the Government envisage for the public sector is that of clearing up the mess made time and again by the private sector.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-26_para4">
On Second Reading and elsewhere, the Secretary of State argued that the railways cannot be brought back into the public sector because it would be too expensive. We were told at one point that it would cost &#163;3&nbsp;billion, yet within six months we were told that the cost would be &#163;22&nbsp;billion. My amendments would enable the railway industry to be brought back within the public sector without cost, as franchises run out. It is argued that amendment No. 18&nbsp;inserts a public sector preference, but amendment No. 17&nbsp;answers that by invoking an independent and objective assessment process. In fact, it is almost a modernising amendment&#151;practically third way-ish.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-26_para5">
Amendment No. 4&nbsp;is also straightforward. All the statistics for every quarter of last year show that South Eastern Trains in the public sector has outperformed all the private sector elements of the industry. They demonstrate how much more efficiently and effectively the operation has been run since it was taken over from Connex.
</p>





<p><a name="50127-26_spnew2"><b> Mr. Robin Cook  (Livingston) (Lab):</b> 
 I do not want my hon. Friend to understate his case. I am sure that he wants attention to be drawn to the fact that South Eastern Trains has not only improved the service to the public, but cut the subsidy needed by &#163;1&nbsp;million a month. The Government are therefore gaining every bit as much as the travelling public; surely they have an interest in ensuring that that continues.
</p>





<p><a name="50127-26_spnew3"><b> John McDonnell: </b> 
 My right hon. Friend makes a valid point about benefits for the Government, but there are also benefits for South Eastern Trains from bringing maintenance contracts in-house. All that we are asking for is a rational process of decision making. We do not come with any ideological baggage from the past about the danger of relying on the hidden hand of the market or about the perfection of the public sector. We want a rational process of assessment.

Time is short, so I shall conclude with an extract from a moving speech that was made at the Labour party conference. It is about Africa and the Government&#039;s role in the world, and the example that the Government can set, not just in Europe but globally:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;But if we can show a publicly funded health service free at the point of need delivers to all the people, if we can show a modern state schooling free of charge is the best hope for all children, if we can show the ethic of public service is so strong that public services can provide efficiently for all people without having to privatise or charge&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. then what a difference our country can make to our world.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-26_para7">
I agree with that emotional and powerful speech by the Chancellor of the Exchequer. It sums up the arguments of the amendments precisely and succinctly. All we want is a fair approach based on what works, what is in the best interests of our overall community, and what delivers services to passengers without exploiting the state for the profiteers in the private sector, as happens at present. On that basis, I should like to press the amendment to a vote.
</p>





<p><a name="50127-26_spnew4"><b> Mr. McNulty: </b> 
 Amendment no. 35, which was moved by the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy (Mr. Llwyd), aims to provide a discretionary power to transfer designated assets from a franchisee if that is warranted on passenger safety grounds. It would not achieve that as worded, and it is also unnecessary. I accept, however, the hon. Gentleman&#039;s point about the paramountcy of safety on the railways, which was a feature of the various contributions from colleagues.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-26_para8">
If a franchise operator operates in an unsafe manner, there are various means by which it can be held to account, including the terms of the franchise agreement, the terms of its operating licence and the enforcement of the Railways (Safety Case) Regulations 2000. The hon. Gentleman will know that those regulations require all railway operators to have a comprehensive safety case approved by the Health and Safety Executive before starting operations. A railway safety case ensures that a railway operation has effective arrangements in place to ensure the safety of workers, the travelling public and others who may be affected by the operation. If the operator acts in breach of its safety case, it may be prosecuted by the HSE.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-26_para9">
The Office of Rail Regulation will only grant a licence to operate if the train operator holds a valid safety case, unless the HSE has granted a safety case exemption for any reason. The regulator may revoke a licence if the licence holder commits a serious breach of the Railways (Safety Case) Regulations. Unless exempt, it is unlawful for an operator to operate railway assets without a licence. It is an event of default under the franchise agreement if the operator&#039;s safety case is withdrawn or terminated, or if the operator is in material non-compliance with an HSE prohibition or enforcement order. All those powers are entirely adequate to protect passenger safety.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-26_para10">
It is hard to imagine a circumstance in which passenger safety might require the ownership of designated assets such as ticket barriers, information systems or contracts to be transferred to another body. If the assets themselves are a danger to the public, it will not remedy the situation to transfer the ownership of those assets to another person. For all those reasons, amendment No. 35&nbsp;is not necessary.

Amendments Nos. 4, 17&nbsp;and 18, as my hon.

Friend the Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook) suggested, that the operating subsidy is far less&#151;

<p><i>Order for Third Reading read</i>
</p>





<p><i>Motion made, and Question proposed,</i> That the Bill be now read the Third time.&#151;<i>[Jim Fitzpatrick.]</i>

<a name="50127-29_time0"><h5>5.24&nbsp;pm</h5>
</p>





<p><a name="50127-29_spnew0"><b> Mr. McNulty: </b> 
 We had an interesting debate on Report and I thank everyone who was associated with the Committee stage, where the Bill received excellent scrutiny. It is nice for the most minor party to be able reflect on Report the views that prevailed in Committee after its representative did not bother to turn up to the Committee proceedings. I repeat that I am deeply sorry that the hon. Member for Ceredigion (Mr. Thomas), who represented Plaid Cymru on the Committee once in eight sittings, had a flood in his house on the day when his amendments were to be discussed and they were therefore not moved. Nevertheless, it is a shame that he managed to attend only one sitting.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-29_para2">
The Committee took the proceedings seriously and its members, from all parties, including Government Back Benchers, considered a range of issues in depth. That, together with the discussions on Second Reading and Report, means that the measure, as part of the overall implementation of the rail review, is all the better for our deliberations. I urge the usual channels&#151;since I am no longer a member of that fraternity and sorority&#151;to take lightly any urgent request from Plaid Cymru to serve on Committees because, in my experience, its members do not attend. None the less, Wales is important to the Bill, as are Scotland and the rest of the country, and the House lost the expertise that purportedly comes from Plaid Cymru.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-29_para3">
Throughout our proceedings, I said that the Bill needed to be viewed in the broader context of implementing the rail White Paper and the overall rail review. There is therefore a wider backdrop, which must be considered, to each clause. The Bill consists of 10&nbsp;main elements, including the winding-up of the Strategic Rail Authority. As was said in Committee, that is not a reflection of how bad the SRA has been. To 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>27 Jan 2005 : Column 534</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>be fair, it has got us to a stage where we can move on and make further progress on the railways. It has done a splendid job and will continue to do so until its demise.
</p>

<p>

However, we are now at the stage, given the assistance of the SRA, whereby we are marching from the complete bodge that was privatisation in 1994&nbsp;towards something that has greater logic and integrity; something that no longer requires a body such as the SRA. Strategic elements of the Bill allow us to take it back into the Department for Transport. It is right and proper that the Government rather than the SRA make strategic decisions and determinations.

The same is true of not only safety regulation but the relationship between safety, economic regulation, the Office for Rail Regulation and the Government. It is right and proper that the Government should set the broad strategic context for our railways and also the parameters for resources. The Bill makes concomitant changes to the relationship between the Government, ORR, Network Rail and the industry to reflect the new settlement.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-29_para6">
In shifting safety regulation from the Health and Safety Executive to ORR so that it is much more closely bedded into all the regulatory features of the railway industry, hon. Members should be assured that nothing will change the paramountcy that is afforded to safety throughout the industry. All the rail safety regulation functions that currently reside with HSE will move to ORR and will be locked far more firmly into the overall industry than has hitherto been the case. Because of that change in the nature of the relationship between the Secretary of State and the ORR, it has been important to make some changes in the Bill in relation to economic regulation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-29_para7">
One of the underlying features of the Bill is the Government&#039;s real desire to devolve decisions and functions as close to the local and regional areas as possible. The Bill provides for the most significant transfer of functions to the Scottish Executive since the Scotland Act 1998. The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, my hon. Friend the Member for Stirling (Mrs. McGuire) said earlier that that is, at least in part, the reason why the Sewel motion passed so swiftly through the Scottish Parliament yesterday, not only unanimously and to great acclaim, but to a roaring round of applause, which is probably unheard of there. In terms of the transfer of functions and resources to Scotland, the settlement makes sense and is also quite historic.

We have explored many of the Welsh issues in the Bill. I do not want to dwell on the absence of Welsh Members when we met in Committee, but it is a shame that we had to have those discussions today rather than at that time. However, that is by the by. The Bill provides for a significant shift of functions, input and influence to colleagues in the National Assembly for Wales, as and when that is proper in relation to services that are entirely within Wales. There will also be a proper level of consultation and influence relating to services that go to and from Wales.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-29_para9">
There has also been significant devolution in regard to the PTEs, and provision has been made for potential devolution in London, where appropriate. That is right and proper as well. Sadly, the geography of Wales, Scotland and London dictates that rail services are not

<br>&nbsp;<br>contiguous with administrative or national borders. We have made no apology for saying that if the Mayor and Transport for London want to take a greater role in regard to heavy rail in the areas that surround London, that would be worth looking at. In the first instance, London&#039;s devolution settlement did not include any significant input in regard to heavy rail. TFL has been enormously successful. As the hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster (Mr. Field) very fairly said, much of what it has done has been a real bonus for London. In the broadest sense, it is appropriate to consider how its influence can be extended to heavy rail, because there is a major lacuna in London&#039;s transport settlement in that regard.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-29_para10">
The Bill makes provision for that in the wider sense, and in the first instance, such devolution could involve the Silverlink franchises, which are more or less wholly in London, save for a little sojourn about three miles north of my constituency, where the Silverlink service finishes at Watford Junction. Given that Silverlink is almost wholly within London, however, it might provide a starting point for considering a new role for TFL. Any further role involving commuter services outside London would need to be considered only with the highest regard for the regional assemblies and areas into which such control might extend.

<p><a name="50127-30_spnew0"><b> Jeremy Corbyn: </b> 
 I thank the Minister for giving way and I apologise for not being here for the beginning of his speech. On the transfer of facilities in London to TFL, is he prepared to consider the issue of the suburban interchange stations, which at the moment are run by Network Rail but which have a huge TFL input? Does he agree that it would make sense to reconsider the structure of the organisations, so that just one authority could run such stations? I am thinking particularly of Finsbury Park, but the same also applies to Clapham Junction and a number of other suburban junction stations.

 I thank my hon. Friend for making that point, which was made on Report, and Finsbury Park was prayed in aid&#151;I think that he was in the Chamber at that time. On where the ownership should remain, I made the point in Committee and on Report that the development of suburban, inter-urban regional stations should be duly considered, and that at the very least, protocols should be put in place so that TFL, Network Rail and others can work and operate them in the interest of their collective networks far more readily than they do now. A linked point is the potential of those network hubs for local communities, which has not been explored as readily by TFL or others thus far. My hon. Friend will know, however, that interlinking either between various tube lines or tube lines and heavy rail is complex, and the benefit of the interchange must prevail in the first instance.

If the Bill is passed, the framework will be in place at least to examine how that sort of co-operation and advance can work in a London context and in the context of this Bill and other areas on which the transport White Paper elaborated last July.

If we do that, there are consequences for much of the railways legislation that is currently on the statute book. Much of the Bill, admittedly in a rather tedious way, has been about accepting that the Strategic Rail Authority is going, and that the regional network of passenger committees is going, to be replaced by a far stronger passenger voice. Those two elements, plus all the devolution provisions in the Bill, have meant in some cases a tortuous track back to correct previous legislation, hence the 19&nbsp;clauses on network modification and the point that we discussed on Report about bus substitution, not, I hasten to add, &quot;bustitution&quot;.
</p>

<a name="50127-30_para2">
While the Railways Bill should be considered as one element, which is hugely integrated, has a logic to it, and stands as one piece, it needs to be regarded in the wider context of all that we are doing in terms of transport generally, not just rail. It sets a framework, but as I have said on numerous occasions, the legislation only takes us so far. What really matters is what happens on the ground.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-30_para3">
As some of my hon. Friends have suggested during our deliberations, the Railways Bill needs to be seen firmly in the context of taking steps: to continue sustained investment in our railway network; to ensure that the management of the industry is as robust and efficient as possible; to make changes increasingly to franchising arrangements to introduce a degree of vertical integration; to introduce far greater co-operation between train operating companies and Network Rail through integrated control centres, and a good deal more co-operation at regional and franchise level; and to develop a far better rolling stock strategy than that which prevails at the moment to help the industry derive best value from future lease renegotiations. That is not part of the Bill but is central to our overall vision for the future of railways.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-30_para4">
To deliver a far better deal, it is not necessary for freight to be a substantive part of the Bill, but as we discussed a little on Report and in more detail in Committee, freight remains very important in terms of the delivery of this Government&#039;s vision for rail. It is also important to recognise all that we have done, in full-co-operation with the outgoing Rail Passengers Council, to develop a far stronger, far more focused voice for passengers and consumers.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-30_para5">
All that is possible because of the sustained investment being put in by the Government. We feel that we are now ready to move on to the next phase. The Bill will realise an exciting and improving vision for rail.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-30_para6">
When I was made rail Minister last September, I announced that I could say without fear of contradiction that I was very pleased to be rail Minister, and that it was a very exciting time at which to become rail Minister. Had I said that five or 10&nbsp;years earlier, John Major&#039;s fabled white coats would have been flapping over the horizon; but, not least because of the sustained investment that has taken place since 1997, this is indeed a very exciting time for the railways. The number of rail passengers is back to pre-1960&nbsp;levels&#151;and we should bear in mind that about a third of rail capacity was denuded by Dr. Beeching some years after 1960.

As I said on Second Reading and in Committee, despite my excitement at being rail Minister, I have no intention of going down in history as the next Dr. Beeching. That cannot prevail, given our vision for the railways and the framework outlined in the Bill.

The Bill will enable us to build on that sustained investment and accelerate the improvement of our transport networks to the benefit of all&#151;the rail industry, business, taxpayers and, most important, passengers.

The Minister has been seeing the Bill through rose-tinted spectacles. He cannot disguise the fact that it is big on bureaucracy and centralisation, and very weak on how customers will actually benefit.

The only possibility of avoiding that would come from a change of Government, which we are working earnestly to bring about later this year.

Various aspects of the Bill represent unfinished business. Let me remind the Government of a specific worry of ours, which has not been resolved. We pointed out in Committee that paragraph 1G of schedule 4&nbsp;is objectionable because it undermines the jurisdiction of the Office of Rail Regulation in carrying out an access charges review. Currently, the ORR, not the Secretary of State, determines network capacity, what it can deliver, where it needs most maintenance and what its renewal pattern should be. This was made very clear in a letter from the permanent secretary at the Department

<br>&nbsp;<br>for Transport to the ORR on 16&nbsp;December 2003&#151;the time of the most recent ORR access charges review&#151;which is published on the ORR website. The permanent secretary said:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;Under the Railways Act 1993, and the licences issued and contracts approved by virtue of that Act, it is the role of the Rail Regulator&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. alone to determine and establish the income requirement of Network Rail, and to set access charges accordingly.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-30_para13">
On 9&nbsp;February 2004, the Secretary of State told the House that the rail review&#151;the Bill is a significant part of the review&#039;s implementation&#151;would definitely not do certain things. He expressly excluded from the review re-nationalisation, loss of independence of the ORR and

In our view, it is impossible to reconcile paragraph 1G of schedule 4&nbsp;to the Bill with the Secretary of State&#039;s statement to the House on 9&nbsp;February 2004, because the schedule transfers from the ORR to the Secretary of State the role of determining the size and other features of the network. It diminishes the ORR&#039;s jurisdiction and thereby transfers a very important function from an independent regulator to the political Secretary of State.

Given that the railways are largely, if not entirely, paid for from the public purse, and that the Treasury and the Secretary of State will make the decisions, it is correct that an elected Government&#151;the representatives of the people&#151;should have the duty to produce a strategy. I am completely at odds with those on the Conservative Front Bench on that matter.

I regret that we were unable to use the Bill to acknowledge the efforts of the rail work force.

An example of that is the two-tier system of travel concessions available to workers. I hope that that problem can be addressed in another place, or perhaps in subsequent legislation. Some rail staff working before privatisation gained full travel concessions, whereas others employed after privatisation received only a fraction of that, or none at all.

As my hon. Friend the Member for Hayes and Harlington (John McDonnell) noted, today&#039;s <i>Evening Standard</i> carries screaming headlines about rail company profits.

The city has a complex transport network, with an over-used London underground system, a rapidly and vastly improving bus network, but several under-used overground railway lines. They need to be fully integrated. London&#039;s transport planning has been bedevilled in the past by the separation between London Transport and the railway network. We have an opportunity with Transport for London and the concepts enshrined in this Bill to make TFL the body that can integrate the tube network with the overground network, the expanding tram network and the bus network.

However, we do not have the necessary improvements to the station itself, where the underground and the overground meet, because the two organisations involved cannot agree on who will pay for it and what to do. If the station were run by one organisation, such as TFL, we could make some progress.

<a name="50127-32_head1"><h3 align=center>Childhood Anaemia</h3>


<p><i>Motion made, and Question proposed,</i> That this House do now adjourn.&#151; [<i>James Purnell</i>.]</p>




<a name="50127-32_time1"><h5>6&nbsp;pm</h5>


<p><a name="50127-32_spnew1"><b> Mr. Bob Laxton  (Derby, North) (Lab):</b> 
 I am glad to be given the opportunity this evening to speak about the incidence and importance of detecting childhood anaemia. Anaemia is a condition where the level of haemoglobin in blood is lower than normal. Haemoglobin plays an essential role in the body, carrying oxygen to every living cell. Lowered levels can have a profound effect on health in both adults and children, producing a range of symptoms. In children, these symptoms can seriously impede mental and physical development. Anaemic children perform poorly in the classroom and are unable to participate in many physical activities. The problems become compounded as anaemic children develop into teenagers who fail to benefit from education.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-32_para2">
In 1988, one of the first studies looking into iron deficiency anaemia discovered the extent to which pre-school children had this condition. Over a 17-year period, study after study has also demonstrated the extent of iron deficiency anaemia in children. For instance, 52&nbsp;per cent. of pre-school inner-city children are anaemic, as are 34&nbsp;per cent. of female undergraduates. Anaemia does not differentiate between social classes either, with 9&nbsp;per cent. of teenagers being diagnosed as anaemic, irrespective of which social class they come from. This level of anaemia in children is comparable to that of developing countries.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-32_para3">
In its last health survey for England in 1994, the Department of Health found that 4.1&nbsp;per cent. of men and 10.8&nbsp;per cent. of women were classified as anaemic, using the World Health Organisation&#039;s definition of anaemia. When the national diet and nutrition survey looked into iron deficiency anaemia in children, it found that 10&nbsp;per cent. of children aged one and a half to two and a half years of age were anaemic. This fell to 6&nbsp;per cent. for those aged two and a half to three and a half years. However, the percentage did not continue to fall into the rest of childhood. Instead, an absolutely staggering 50&nbsp;per cent. of young women between 15&nbsp;and 18-years-old were found with iron intakes well below the recommended amounts.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-32_para4">
In 1998, a separate study was carried out by HemoCue, a name that I am sure is familiar to both doctors and nurses. Its aim was to determine the prevalence of anaemia and to assess and improve the diets of children of pre-school age in the Pear Tree district of Derby. Pear Tree is an area just outside my constituency of Derby, North, falling in the neighbouring constituency of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-32_para5">
Nevertheless, the results of the study demonstrate the terrifying level of anaemia in an area of economic deprivation, with a high number of Asian immigrants. For instance, 54&nbsp;per cent. of Asian Muslim children referred to the study were anaemic. In Asian Sikh and caucasian children this figure was 32&nbsp;per cent. and 30&nbsp;per cent. respectively. A similar study that HemoCue carried out in north Birmingham, in south Birmingham 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>27 Jan 2005 : Column 544</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>and in Bradford yielded similar results. In north Birmingham, for instance, 45&nbsp;per cent. of children aged 21&nbsp;months old were anaemic.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-32_para6">
Until the issue of anaemia, and particularly childhood anaemia, was raised with me by John Clague, the director of HemoCue, I had, like many non-medical people, no idea of the incidence of anaemia in children, particularly in the UK&#039;s inner-city areas&#151;in spite of the fact that many health professionals are aware of the existence and prevalence of iron deficiency anaemia. However, we have not seen a great deal of change in the last 15&nbsp;years or so, except where specific programmes have been introduced by health care professionals with a particularly strong interest in the subject. The conventional attitude, in the meantime, is that childhood anaemia is self-correcting and does not have too serious longer-term consequences for a child. That is of course untrue. Persistent anaemia causes sores; spare hair; brittle, flattened nails; pallor and general debility. In other words, an anaemic child could well make for an unhealthy adult.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-32_para7">
I understand that the Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition&#039;s working group on iron is expected to make its draft report available for comment in summer this year, with finalisation in spring 2006. I look forward to reading its findings and recommendations. However, childhood anaemia is not remotely high enough on the Government&#039;s health agenda. Indeed, due to the nature of the problem, childhood anaemia is the responsibility of both the Department of Health and the Department for Education and Skills. I urge the Minister to use the planned publication as a more than timely opportunity to address childhood anaemia and perhaps approach the problem from a new angle and build the identification of childhood anaemia into primary care provision. I also hope to start to do something about it now.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-32_para8">
According to the World Health Organisation, anaemia is the most common evidence of nutritional deficiency in the world. As it happens, anaemia is not a specific disease, but a symptom of many conditions that result from a lack of haemoglobin in the blood. Several causes underpin anaemia. It could be due to the body&#039;s failure to produce red blood cells, which carry haemoglobin. It could be caused because red blood cells are being destroyed unusually quickly, or simply because someone is bleeding. Such bleeding is often brisk and obvious, but can be hidden in the case of a slow-bleeding gastrointestinal ulcer, or a tumour.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-32_para9">
The WHO study focused on anaemia due to nutritional deficiency. As one would expect, it was most common among children in the third world. However, even in the western world, nutritionally induced anaemia is not as rare as one might think. A survey showed that 10&nbsp;to 15&nbsp;per cent. of women of reproductive age were anaemic.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-32_para10">
There are several ways in which anaemia caused by nutritional deficiency can be treated. The obvious solution would be to ensure that children eat foods that contain the best sources of iron, namely red meat, offal, such as liver and kidneys, and eggs. From personal experience, an average child will probably eat red meat and eggs, perhaps in the form of a hearty steak and an omelette, but trying to get an eight-year-old to eat liver, kidneys or leafy green vegetables is a battle of parental wits over a child&#039;s intransigence. Of course, there is also 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>27 Jan 2005 : Column 545</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>iron in cereals, lentils, soya and beans. As some die-hard chocoholics will no doubt be pleased to hear, chocolate is also a source of iron, although I suspect that one would have to eat more than a box of Mars bars or KitKats a day to reach the optimum level of iron intake.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-32_para11">
If it is difficult to address the problem through the daily diet, the next best option is to treat it with iron supplements, but there are possible problems with that approach if a full analysis is not completed. For example, if there is no true iron deficiency, the excess iron supplements hinder the absorption of calcium and zinc.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-32_para12">
A lack of iron is not the only cause of anaemia. A shortage of vitamin B12&nbsp;and folic acid can also slow down the production of red blood cells. Vitamin B12&nbsp;is found in meat and dairy products, and if a person consumes sufficient quantities of it over time, it is stored in the liver for a good five years. Like iron, folic acid is obtained from green vegetables, cereals and liver, but it is not stored in the body for long.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-32_para13">
When it comes to babies, the biggest form of anaemia is encountered when breast milk is replaced by cow&#039;s or formula milk. Babies who are moved too quickly from breast milk to fruit juices or sugary concoctions miss out on the iron in milk. In a strange irony, one study found that middle-class babies from the so-called muesli eating classes, as well as those from immigrant homes, were most likely to have anaemia. Indeed, the Department of Health found similar results when it examined differences by household benefit status for men and women.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-32_para14">
What are the effects of anaemia? Even mild anaemia can lead to extreme fatigue and interfere with a child&#039;s ability to perform at school and participate in social activities. There are even more severe consequences in the long term, such as an irreversible delay in mental or psychomotor development. The Government are doing good work through Sure Start and children&#039;s centres to ensure that children growing up in deprived communities receive the additional support that they need. As recently as last Tuesday, my right hon. Friend the Minister for Industry and the Regions, who also happens to be the Deputy Minister for Women and Equality, came to my constituency and we visited Sure Start programmes and a children and families centre there.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-32_para15">
We were both extremely impressed by the engagement of nurses and a range of professionals in dealing with children. Vulnerable children from families in receipt of the welfare food scheme are already provided with supplements, including vitamin C, which helps to aid absorption of iron from the diet. The publication of last year&#039;s White Paper &quot;Choosing Health&quot; reflects the Government&#039;s continued commitment to improving the diet and health of our children. However, the scattergun approach is not sufficient. The consequences of childhood anaemia are long lasting; more can and should be done to tackle it. If we succeed, we lay another solid brick for the future of each deprived inner-city child.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-32_para16">
If we set aside discussions of education in nutritional awareness, ethnic weaning practices and poverty, the basic conclusion is simple: to reduce the incidence of 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>27 Jan 2005 : Column 546</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>anaemia in children in UK inner cities, we must, first and foremost, ensure that we can identify the individual children at risk. The Government have, rightly, concentrated on childhood obesity, which has to be tackled, but it is not the only problem affecting the development of young children that needs our attention. It is equally important that anaemia is tackled.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-32_para17">
Companies such as HemoCue, which provides testing apparatus for anaemia, have to establish closer links with community health organisations and with Sure Start programmes. HemoCue is a Derbyshire-based firm and global leader, whose technology is used in many NHS hospitals throughout the UK. With just a single drop of blood and in less than a minute, HemoCue technology can give a precise haemoglobin analysis.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-32_para18">
If a positive identification of iron deficiency is found in a child, two immediate courses of action can be taken to remedy the situation. One is to inform the child&#039;s parents that dietary changes must be made. As I have said, that might mean the inclusion of more iron-rich food in the child&#039;s diet&#151;for example, red meat, eggs, leafy vegetables and, dare I say, chocolate. The iron fortification of food such as bread, milk and cereals can also help to reduce iron deficiency. Several studies have shown that because the recommendation being made is based on a scientific test, parents accept more readily advice that might otherwise be dismissed as nannying or hectoring.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-32_para19">
In addition, it is important that regular screening is offered to all children as part of their routine development check. We must first harness the expertise of the health care professionals who know the extent of the problem and work at the sharp end in the community&#151;midwives, nurses, community nurses and community-based paediatricians. In primary care trusts and the priorities determined within health action zones, there is a mechanism to empower those professionals to screen for anaemia in domiciliary visits. Bradford community health NHS trust has led the way in that respect. We must ensure that other NHS trusts seize the opportunity. Well woman clinics and well person clinics have become part of the health-speak vocabulary in recent years. It is not time that we extended the terminology across the board to include well woman and child clinics in inner-city areas, and systematically provided anaemia screening for both mother and child?
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-32_para20">
The development of such links and services in primary care take us a long way toward our goal of reducing anaemia in children. At the same time, it will create the right framework that will move us closer to our longer-term goal of better health for future generations. I trust that my hon. Friend the Minister appreciates the problem of childhood anaemia&#151;I am sure that he does&#151;but will he assure me that his Department will take the necessary steps toward tackling that serious health problem, and do so as soon as possible?

 I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Derby, North (Mr. Laxton) on raising this important subject, in which he has taken a considerable interest for a long time. I hope to be able to reassure him that the Government take it as seriously as he does.

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-33_para0">
Nutritional anaemia is the most common type of anaemia in children. As my hon. Friend said, it can be caused by deficiency of iron, vitamin B12&nbsp;or folate, although iron deficiency appears to be the most important cause of the condition. Its effect is to limit a child&#039;s ability to be physically active. Prevention of iron deficiency is important, because the condition can affect intellectual development and behaviour in the longer term, and it is also associated with deficits in a variety of developmental and behavioural measures. The Department of Health and the Food Standards Agency undertake regular surveys to monitor the diet and health of children. My hon. Friend mentioned the national diet and nutrition survey, and the last survey in 2000&nbsp;indicated that the reported prevalence of anaemia varies markedly in different age groups and that younger children and teenagers are both prone to iron deficiency. It showed that 3&nbsp;per cent. of boys aged two to six years were anaemic, compared with 1&nbsp;per cent. of boys aged seven to 18&nbsp;years. Eight per cent. of girls aged four to six years, 4&nbsp;per cent. of girls aged seven to 10&nbsp;years, and 9&nbsp;per cent. of 15&nbsp;to 18-year-olds were anaemic. In addition, lower intakes of both iron and vitamin C, which helps in the absorption of iron, are more common among manual worker social classes.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-33_para1">
My hon. Friend rightly mentioned concerns that iron-deficiency anaemia is much more common among certain ethnic groups, including people from south Asian and Afro-Caribbean backgrounds. One survey, as he suggested, showed very high levels of deficiency. For example, 29&nbsp;per cent. of Pakistani children, 25&nbsp;per cent. of Bangladeshi children, and 20&nbsp;per cent. of Indian children aged about two years were anaemic. Also of concern is the fact that iron intakes are considerably lower in young women, with 50&nbsp;per cent. of 15&nbsp;to 18-year-olds having intakes well below the recommended amounts, which can put them at risk of iron-deficiency anaemia. My hon. Friend raised the possibility of screening and early detection of anaemia. I can understand why he has come to that conclusion, but we must consider all the available evidence before deciding on such a course.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-33_para2">
The UK national screening committee&#151;the NSC&#151;advises the Government about all aspects of screening policy, drawing on the latest research evidence and the skills of a specially convened multidisciplinary expert group. While screening has the potential to save lives or improve the quality of life through early diagnosis of serious conditions, it can never be 100&nbsp;per cent. accurate. The NSC is increasingly presenting screening in a risk reduction context to emphasise that point. Its child health sub-group has advised that there is currently insufficient evidence to introduce a national screening programme for iron deficiency anaemia, and that the emphasis should be on primary prevention through good nutritional advice until further evidence is available.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-33_para3">
The child health sub-group is a specialist sub-group of the NSC consisting of representatives of the royal colleges, paediatricians, researchers, health visitors and consumer interests. They weighed in the balance a number of arguments against screening when arriving at their recommendations. The test requires a blood sample, which some parents might regard as an unwelcome intrusion. Although haemoglobinometers are simple to use, a meticulous technique in collecting 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>27 Jan 2005 : Column 548</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>the sample and using the instrument is essential. The instruments available in community settings have a higher measurement error than those used in laboratories, and little is known about the accuracy of the measurements carried out in the primary care setting. Severe iron-deficiency anaemia would probably be identified without difficulty, but detection of the mild cases that would form the bulk of the screening could be less reliable.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-33_para4">
The timing of a screening test would present problems. Many children who would have the screening test at the age of 12&nbsp;or 18&nbsp;months would become iron- deficient in their third year. Conversely, some children who are iron-deficient in their second year recover as they eat a more varied diet in the third or fourth year of life. We do not think, therefore, that the evidence currently supports the extension of whole-population screening programmes. Iron deficiency is preventable, and resources need to be directed at primary prevention rather than screening. I realise that my hon. Friend may not agree with that recommendation, but if it is of any reassurance to him, the UK national screening committee always keeps its policies under close review, and I will draw its attention to the issues that he has raised today.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-33_para5">
What are we doing about childhood anaemia? I took part of my hon. Friend&#039;s speech as an indication that he does not believe that our emphasis should be on improved nutrition. However, I believe that is exactly where it should be. The Government are committed to improving the diet and nutrition of the nation, as set out in the recent Government White Paper, &quot;Choosing Health&quot;.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-33_para6">
Specific actions to improve children&#039;s diet include introducing healthy start vouchers, providing training and support for head teachers, governors, caterers and health professionals, aiming for all schools to be healthy schools, adopting a whole-school approach to food through the food in schools programme, improving school meals and considering the introduction of nutrient-based standards, and introducing Ofsted inspections of healthy eating in schools.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-33_para7">
Current action on nutrition includes our investment in the five-a-day programme, the school fruit and vegetable scheme, promotion of breastfeeding and action to improve diet and nutrition across the whole school, as well as working with industry to reduce fat, sugar and salt. In addition to these specific actions, there is a considerable amount of local action including healthy living centres, Sure Start and action to deliver national service frameworks&#151;all actions that my hon. Friend mentioned.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-33_para8">
The Government recognise the importance of primary prevention and have several actions under way. The importance of good nutrition prior to pregnancy and during pregnancy is well recognised. The welfare food scheme was established in 1940&nbsp;to protect the health of women and young children at the time of rationing and price rises. The scheme was originally universal, but is now primarily targeted at low income families in receipt of income support, income-based jobseeker&#039;s allowance or child tax credit under a certain level. The scheme currently provides tokens for free milk&#151;both liquid milk and infant formula&#151;and vitamins to around 800,000&nbsp;pregnant women, mothers 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>27 Jan 2005 : Column 549</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>and young children under five in England, Scotland and Wales. A separate but parallel scheme operates in Northern Ireland.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-33_para9">
In line with the recommendations made by the committee on medical aspects of food and nutrition policy, the welfare food scheme is being revised to meet the present-day nutritional needs of mothers and children. Following the public health White Paper, from mid-2005&nbsp;a reformed scheme, Healthy Start, will be introduced. The key features of the new scheme will be to provide access to a broader range of foods&#151;for example, fresh fruit and fresh vegetables are being added to cow&#039;s milk and cow&#039;s milk-based infant formula at the outset&#151;and this range will be kept under review. The scheme will use fixed-value vouchers, rather than volume-based tokens, which can be exchanged in the widest possible range of participating retail outlets, including food co-operatives and community shops as well as supermarkets, milk roundsmen, greengrocers, farmers markets and others. Closer links with the NHS will also enable the scheme to become the vehicle for delivering advice and information on diet, exercise, and other health issues to qualifying pregnant women and families. Finally, the new scheme will provide equal value benefits for breastfeeding and non-breastfeeding mothers.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-33_para10">
Vulnerable children in qualifying families are also provided with supplements, including vitamins A, C and D. Vitamin C in particular aids the absorption of iron from the diet. Iron supplements may also be prescribed to children with iron deficiency anaemia that does not improve with appropriate dietary advice. The provision of iron supplements for premature and low birth-weight infants is now standard practice, as they are at risk of iron deficiency.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-33_para11">
Breast milk provides the best form of nutrition for an infant. Following World Health Organisation revised guidance, the Department of Health recommended in May 2003&nbsp;exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months of an infant&#039;s life. The early introduction of cow&#039;s milk, as my hon. Friend said, is associated with an increased risk of anaemia in children. The Department recommends that unmodified cow&#039;s milk be given as a main drink only after the age of one year. Appropriate weaning is important. After one year, the child&#039;s diet should include a variety of foods to ensure that it is adequate in iron and vitamin C.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-33_para12">
My hon. Friend pointed out that this is an agenda spread across two Departments, the Department of Health and the Department for Education and Skills. I believe that is right, as schools are pivotal to achieving our goals. Schools are a key setting through which we can improve children&#039;s health. Our vision is that all schools will be healthy schools that provide supportive environments, including policies on healthy and nutritious food, with the time and facilities for physical activity and sport, both within and beyond the curriculum. That needs the support of colleagues in the Department for Education and Skills.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-33_para13">
We are committed to improving school food and drink, not just at lunch time but across the school day, and we are revising and extending school meal standards, including food sold through vending machines and tuck shops. School meals should be 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>27 Jan 2005 : Column 550</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>nutritionally balanced and should cater for children&#039;s dietary requirements and specific religious or philosophical requirements and medical needs. The Department for Education and Skills is also ensuring that there are special diets for customers from religious and ethnic groups. These include halal meat and a variety of vegetarian options.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-33_para14">
We will be supporting school heads, governors and caterers to provide the best meal service possible, for example through training for caterers and guidance on food procurement. We will soon be launching a food in schools toolkit that will guide, inspire and help schools take the whole-school approach to healthy eating. I am delighted to say that, today, almost 2&nbsp;million four to six-year-old children are now receiving free fruit and vegetables every school day in more than 15,600&nbsp;schools in England.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-33_para15">
Recognising the vulnerability of teenage girls, the Government have also developed targeted healthy eating advice aimed particularly at young women. Following research that it conducted in 2004, the Food Standards Agency has issued special advice to teenage girls and young women. That includes practical tips on how to increase iron intakes and information on iron-rich foods. For example, a glass of orange or grapefruit juice with meals rather than the often consumed cup of tea can increase iron absorption.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-33_para16">
My hon. Friend mentioned the Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition, and we have indeed asked it to look at issues around dietary iron for us. As too much iron can be harmful, both beneficial and adverse effects are being considered, including the effect of dietary components on iron absorption and utilisation in the body; the interaction of infections and inflammation with iron metabolism and the possibility that that may affect the apparent incidence of iron deficiency; the effect of iron deficiency on health and well-being, for example mental and physical development; and the potentially adverse effects of excess iron, including free radical damage and the risk of cardiovascular disease and cancer. The team is now in the final stages of reviewing evidence for the iron report, which, as my hon. Friend said, is expected to be ready to be released for stakeholder comment in summer 2005.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-33_para17">
Finally, as well as the White Paper &quot;Choosing Health&quot;, the national service framework for children and young people and maternity services, together with the chief nursing officer&#039;s review of school nursing, will also play important roles in our campaign. The NSF puts an emphasis on early identification and intervention in child and family-focused services. The first strand is about promoting health and well-being, identifying needs and intervening early. I assure my hon. Friend that, although the framework began solely as a Department of Health document, with the appointment of the Minister for Children, Young People and Families, it became a joint Department for Education and Skills and Department of Health document, and we are collaborating very closely on ensuring that it is implemented.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-33_para18">
One of the key themes of the chief nursing officer&#039;s review is the need to follow the child, providing services where vulnerable children and young people are, rather than services being dictated by professional roles and organisational boundaries. In order to fulfil the chief

<br>&nbsp;<br>nursing officer&#039;s vision of having at least one full-time year-round qualified school nurse working in each cluster or group of primary schools, new funding will be provided to make that a reality by 2010. I think that those school nurses will be pivotal in spotting childhood anaemia at an early stage.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50127-33_para19">
Having set out the Government&#039;s position, I hope that I have given my hon. Friend some reassurance that the issue is very important to the Government and a
