 Since 1998-99, 600,000 children have been lifted out of relative poverty and the number of children in absolute poverty has halved from 3.4 million to 1.7 million. Government measures over the past two years will lift about a further 500,000 children from relative poverty. On 28 January, we launched the consultation, &#147;Ending Child Poverty: Making It Happen&#148;, ahead of a child poverty Bill that will enshrine in legislation the Government&#146;s promise to eradicate child poverty by 2020.</p>

 Surely, we should do both. That is exactly why we are, for example, investing more in family intervention projects to help the families who are in the most difficult circumstances, while increasing the amount of money that we put into tax credits. We said in the last Budget that we would take, in total, another 500,000 children out of poverty. I do not think that the Conservative party would have pursued that policy if they had been in power.</p>

There are also children from families whose wider family have brought in a husband or wife, with no education, from very poor parts of Pakistan or Bangladesh.

 My hon. Friend identifies a very important issue, which is exactly why we commissioned Professor Paul Gregg to consider how we can help families in those circumstances. That is why we are saying that we would require such families to find out about the support that is available and then be required, once their youngest child is three years old, to take up skills training or drug treatment to get off drugs and into work.

 In the past year, the CSA&#151;now the Child Maintenance and Enforcement Commission&#151;has collected an extra &#163;156 million, but we agree that more needs to be done. That is why we are taking powers in the Welfare Reform Bill to be able to take away people&#146;s passports or driving licences without a court process. That will make things much more speedy. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will support that, unlike the Conservative party in the Lords the last time that that was proposed. That is also why we are saying that, where there is a payment, parents should be able to keep all of it and that there should be a complete disregard for child maintenance payments and benefits.

 Yes, my hon. Friend is absolutely right. We need to do more to support credit unions and enhance financial literacy, so that people know, for example, whether their financial arrangements are not in the best possible order. More money must be put into reducing poverty directly, thus both giving people more resources and a greater ability to earn money. If we had kept to the same policy as the Conservative party, 2 million more children would be in poverty.</p>

 According to a recent report by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, 15 indicators of poverty and social exclusion had worsened in the five years preceding the onset of the current economic downturn, more than double the number in the previous five years. That includes the number of people living in very low-income households. Perhaps it is little wonder that the number of children living in poverty has risen by 100,000 in the past two years. How does the Secretary of State explain the Government&#146;s poor performance?</p>

 The right hon. Lady has no policy of that kind, because she has no way of funding it. The Conservatives used to say that they would fund it out of welfare reform, but now they are not prepared to do as much welfare reform as us. If the right hon. Lady wants to repeat that claim, she will have to find new resources. Hers is a policy without a budget, and I hope that she will not pretend to repeat it.</p>

One of the problems, of course, is identifying and making contact with those older people.

Given the Government&#146;s sustained attack on savers and the fact that there are now a number of proud pensioners in this country who have never claimed anything from the state and who shy from doing so, which leads to disguised poverty among pensioners, when will the Government wake up and present to those people that they, too, are entitled to some kind of support?</p>

 Last Friday a weekly job club was launched in Banbury with the support of the whole community.

 I take the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point, which is why we are making sure that there is outreach work, for want of a better phrase, directed at smaller towns and areas. He will know that the Berkshire, Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire district has developed a local employment partnership through which many of the notified vacancies are filled. About 45 per cent. of all vacancies are signed up to through the local employment partnership, but the hon. Gentleman is right to say that we must not only provide help and support, but get notified vacancies publicised to as wide an audience as possible. I will reflect on his point about rural areas and the sparsity of provision of Jobcentre Plus offices. They cannot be everywhere.

Those are the very categories that include women. We are making sure that Jobcentre Plus is doing all it can not just for women who present, but especially for those from the retail sector.

There have been cases in which administrators have been reluctant to do that, and have even been reluctant to let in the rapid response service.

<p><a name="st_o119"><a name="0902025000162"><a name="90202-0004.htm_spmin0"><a name="0902025000512"><b>The Minister for Employment Relations and Postal Affairs (Mr. Pat McFadden):</b>
 With permission, Mr. Speaker, I should like to repeat a statement being made by my noble Friend the Secretary of State for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform in the other place about the industrial action at the Lindsey refinery and elsewhere in the country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o4"><a name="90202-0004.htm_para0"><a name="0902025000163">On Thursday and Friday last week, contract workers at the Lindsey refinery in north Lincolnshire and elsewhere took part in unofficial industrial action. That has been followed today with further such action at Sellafield power station and other sites around the UK. The stated reason for such action is said to be that a contract awarded at the Lindsey site to an Italian contractor, IREM, has resulted in discrimination against British workers through the exclusive employment of Italian and Portuguese workers. On the Lindsey site, the great majority of the workers are British. I understand that all the striking workers are from maintenance or enhancement projects on the sites; and as of this afternoon there is no disruption of production at any of the sites where this unofficial industrial action is taking place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o5"><a name="90202-0004.htm_para1"><a name="0902025000164">On Friday, my Department asked ACAS, the independent arbitration service, to meet the employers and the unions to examine the various accusations being aired and to establish the facts&#151;we expect its report very quickly. ACAS was in touch with the parties over the weekend and I understand that the first meeting is taking place today. ACAS&#146;s first responsibility is to report to us on whether laws have been broken; if they have we will take action. We are determined to see robust enforcement of the employment rights legislated for by this Parliament, and the fair and proper application of the European rules that govern the operation of companies throughout the EU and the mobility of labour, which has always been an intrinsic part of membership of the EU and has been supported by successive British Governments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o6"><a name="90202-0004.htm_para2"><a name="0902025000165">In a statement issued yesterday, the energy company Total, which runs the Lindsey site, said:</p>
<a name="90202-0004.htm_brev0"><a name="0902025000365"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;It has never been, and never will be, the policy of Total to discriminate against British companies or British workers.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o7"><a name="90202-0004.htm_para3"><a name="0902025000166">It went on to say that it subcontracts on a fair and non-discriminatory basis and that the wage rates are the same as for equivalent jobs on the site.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o8"><a name="90202-0004.htm_para4"><a name="0902025000167">Two key accusations have been made in recent days. The first is that the use of labour from overseas leads to an erosion of wages and conditions for all concerned because these workers are paid less than UK workers. The second is that there is discrimination in recruitment practice against British workers. The statement issued by Total last night confirmed that workers from overseas are paid at the same rate as other workers on site, and it further confirmed that Total does not operate any policy of discrimination with regard to tendering or recruitment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o9"><a name="90202-0004.htm_para5"><a name="0902025000168">The same rules apply here as with UK companies bidding for work overseas, and I would remind the House that there are some 300,000 UK companies operating elsewhere in Europe. Subcontracts can be bid for by UK or overseas-based companies. Of course, if an overseas company wins a contract it can use its permanent employees to carry out the work, but Total  <br>

has confirmed that where new vacancies are advertised, it will work with subcontractors to ensure that UK workers are considered in the same way as anyone else.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o10"><a name="90202-0004.htm_para6"><a name="0902025000169">The workers coming here from Italy and Portugal are protected by the EU posting of workers directive, which the UK has implemented fully. It guarantees those workers minimum standards, for example on pay and health and safety, and facilitates the free movement of services within the European Union&#151;a vital market for British companies. In the case of the Lindsey refinery, we have been informed that all subcontractors adhere to the national agreement for the engineering construction industry, which governs terms and conditions, working hours and pay.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o11"><a name="90202-0004.htm_para7"><a name="0902025000170">Membership of the European Union and taking advantage of the opportunities for trade presented by the EU are firmly in the UK&#146;s national interest. Free movement of labour and the ability to work across the EU have been a condition of membership for decades. It is important that we respect and guarantee that principle, not least because it guarantees the right of hundreds of thousands of British workers and companies to operate elsewhere in Europe. It illustrates the importance of Europe to the UK that half our &#163;370 billion of exports per year go to the EU, half our &#163;315 billion inward investment comes from the EU and between 3 million and 3.5 million UK jobs are linked both directly and indirectly with our trade with the EU.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o12"><a name="90202-0004.htm_para8"><a name="0902025000171">At a difficult economic time, we fully understand the anxieties that people have about their jobs. That is why we have been taking the measures that we have to support people through these difficult times. We strongly believe in fair opportunities for everyone in this country and in ensuring that British people have access to advertised job vacancies. It would be quite wrong, and indeed against the law, for companies to advertise vacancies and exclude British people from them. Equally, it would run contrary to the principles of the single market and harm British people working abroad if we were to exclude foreign workers from employment in the UK.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o13"><a name="90202-0004.htm_para9"><a name="0902025000172">Of course, we understand the concerns of workers at a time of economic difficulty, and we have now established a mechanism through the ACAS process to examine those concerns. It is through that strong and independent process that we should proceed, not through the continuation of the unofficial industrial action that has been taking place. Our aim is to get through the economic difficulties that we face with Britain continuing as a great trading nation, with our companies able to operate worldwide and our workers equipped for the jobs and industries of the future. I commend this statement to the House.</p>

<p><a name="st_o120"><a name="0902025000173"><a name="90202-0004.htm_spnew6"><a name="0902025000513"><b>Mr. Kenneth Clarke (Rushcliffe) (Con):</b>
 May I first ask, for the sake of clarification, for reassurance that this is a statement of the whole Government, not just the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform, and that the Secretary of State for Health has now recanted and been enlightened, and accepts what has been said? Most importantly, will the Minister confirm with clarity whether the Government believe that the posting of workers directive is satisfactory and working fairly in our interests, or whether they are seeking amendments to it? That has been left quite unclear in all the interviews given by Ministers so far.</p>

The unions should help to get people to desist from that.

<p><a name="stpa_o15"><a name="90202-0004.htm_para11"><a name="0902025000175">However, does the Minister also accept that understandable worries at the present time have been turned into direct action as a result of the Prime Minister&#146;s irresponsible use of the phrase &#147;British jobs for British workers&#148;?

 I should take this opportunity to welcome the right hon. and learned Gentleman back to the Conservative Front Bench. He brings great experience to his role. I always feel that, particularly when we are discussing issues of European competence, he may have more in common with Labour Members than with some Members behind him, but we will see how the debate develops.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o16"><a name="90202-0004.htm_para12"><a name="0902025000177">The right hon. and learned Gentleman asked a couple of specific questions. As I said in the statement, we have fully implemented the posting of workers directive. It has been in place for some years, and as for many such directives, the European Commission has established a group to look at its operation, and we will see if it makes any recommendations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o17"><a name="90202-0004.htm_para13"><a name="0902025000178">As for the statements of the Prime Minister to which the right hon. and learned Gentleman referred, never at any time has the Prime Minister said or implied that he or the Government are opposed to the free rights of British companies to operate throughout the European Union or of European companies to operate here in the UK. What the Prime Minister said, quite rightly, was that, as a country, we needed to do more to equip the British work force for the jobs, skills and industries of the future. That is precisely what we are doing. That is why, while apprenticeships declined when the Conservative party was in power, we will grow apprenticeships to some 0.5 million, and we will stand by our commitment to equip British workers for the future.</p>

work, seeing contracts going elsewhere can be very toxic? What can he say to those people, of whom there are many in my constituency and others, who have such skills and who are out of work? What can be done to assist them to get jobs, which they so desperately want at the moment?</p>

 I know that my hon. Friend has been closely engaged with this issue in recent weeks, and that she is doing everything she can to help her constituents in a positive and responsible manner. On future employment, I would say two things to her. The first thing we have to do is maintain our investment in infrastructure, and not cut it, as the Conservatives would, and that means continuing with rebuilding our energy and transport infrastructure, and with other important projects of national significance. The other thing that will support employment for her constituents, and those of all hon. and right hon. Members, is for this country to maintain its positive stance as a positive member of the European Union, to continue to look outwards and trade globally, and, in so doing, to increase wealth for the UK and employment in the UK.</p>

<p><a name="st_o124"><a name="0902025000181"><a name="90202-0004.htm_spnew10"><a name="0902025000517"><b>Mr. Jeremy Browne (Taunton) (LD):</b>
 We welcome the statement, but it has been made necessary because of the reaction to the cynical and undeliverable statement by the Prime Minister at the Labour party conference in 2007 that there would be British jobs for British workers. That statement was as misleading as the Prime Minister&#146;s other promise to abolish boom and bust. That economic failure caused the understandable anxiety in the country at the moment, with Britain plunging deeper into recession, unemployment soaring and the final hallmark of all Labour Governments&#151;increasing industrial unrest.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o18"><a name="90202-0004.htm_para14"><a name="0902025000182">Pulling up the drawbridge cannot be the right response. British companies and citizens benefit from the free movement of goods and services across the European Union. Does the Minister agree that many in Germany and France who see a falling pound feel it is unfair that British businesses are gaining a competitive advantage as a result of changing exchange rates? I agree with the right hon. Gentleman and accept his comments that all new jobs must be open to all workers and that employment law must be upheld, but does he agree that protectionism, whether it is being advanced by the new President of the United States or by isolationist right-wing commentators in Britain, would be ruinous for our country and must be avoided?</p>

 I appreciate the hon. Gentleman&#146;s welcome for the statement and his positive comments on Britain&#146;s role as a member of the European Union. I agree that unofficial industrial action is not the way to resolve the concerns that have been expressed. We have set up a process through ACAS, which will involve the employers and the trade unions, to air the concerns that have been expressed, and as I said, the statement issued last night by the energy company Total addressed some of those concerns.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o19"><a name="90202-0004.htm_para15"><a name="0902025000184">The hon. Gentleman is right about protectionism. If we look at past history and the economic problems of the last century, we can see that a retreat from looking outwards and a retreat from world trade would indeed mean that protectionism became a sure-fire way of turning recession into depression.</p>

 Does my right hon.

This is a plea: in all the other jobs that will come into being with the contract for the closure and reconstruction of the Lindsey oil refinery, preference should be given to British workers, and to local workers, in an area of high unemployment where the skills are available. As well as sending in ACAS, should not my right hon.

 As I said, the vast majority of workers on the site are British. It is legal for a European company to contract for work and to say that it will use its permanent employees to carry it out.

 Although this dispute relates to the employment of European workers under European law, about which little can be done&#151;at least in the short term&#151;does the Minister accept that the reason why it has had such tremendous resonance across the country is people&#146;s concern about the huge flux of immigration into the UK in recent years, a large part of it from outside the EU, which has accounted for a majority of the new jobs of people of working age? Last year, the total number of work permits issued was a record, at about four or five times the level when the Government were elected, so can he assure us that from now onwards far fewer work permits will be issued and, in particular, that people for whom no job is immediately available will not be issued with work permits allowing them to come to the UK just looking for jobs as, extraordinarily, the Government now permit?</p>

 Will my right hon. Friend ensure that ACAS talks not just to Total, but to Alstom, the subcontracting company, which subcontracts again to another company? It is that company that is causing the problem; it has a record of trying to breach the national agreement in respect of agency workers. That loophole was closed through the agency workers directive, and it is critical in this situation that ACAS looks into what is happening with Alstom as well as with Total.</p>

With regard to ACAS talking to Alstom, I am sure that it will talk to all the major employers in this field that it can.

A number of claims have been aired in the past few days, and it is right to get ACAS to take a dispassionate and impartial look at those claims, so that we can establish the facts.</p>

 I congratulate my right hon. Friend on the statement and his comments that he is determined to ensure the robust enforcement of employment rights in this country. Other hon. Members and I attended a meeting a few weeks ago at which we considered the economic climate in this country, in Europe and across the world. Comparisons were made with the difficulties that arose in Europe in the late 1920s and early 1930s in order that we may learn from history and ensure that history does not repeat itself. What we have heard in recent days worries me greatly. We all need to be very temperate in our language and ensure that we do not again see what happened in the late &#146;20s and early &#146;30s and play into the hands of and pander to the extreme right in any country.</p>

 I quite agree with my hon. Friend that we should not pander to the extreme right. He refers to history, and that is relevant on two counts. First, in response to an earlier question, a retreat into protectionism would be a mistake for us and for the rest of the world economy if it was repeated in countries elsewhere. He is absolutely right that, since the end of the second world war, the establishment and growth of the European Union has helped to ensure not only peace but far greater prosperity for its citizens, and we should seek to maintain that in the future.</p>

 The right hon. Gentleman opened his statement with some so-called statistics about the benefits of the European Union that, in my view, are at the very least open to debate. Does he not accept, as many trade union leaders believe, that there is problem with the labour mobility directives? The UK Government have not on all occasions stuck up for British interests. If he is interested in seeking to reduce tension on this subject, perhaps he will produce a balance sheet of the number of projects that UK companies are carrying out in France, Germany and Italy, for example, as against the number of projects that are being carried out by those countries in the UK. Perhaps that would give people the facts of the case. Will he do that?</p>

 My right hon.

Does he agree that something is seriously wrong if, in the case at Lindsey and other cases around the country, the national agreement is being abided by, yet local UK-based companies are not successful in their tenders? My hon. Friend the Member for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell) suggested a meeting with all parties to consider the issue.

 I must take issue slightly with my hon. Friend. What is important is an open and fair bidding process for contractors to win the work. We cannot put ourselves in a position whereby every time a non-British company wins a contract, we say that it is unfair.

 I am sure that the workers and trade unions of this country will welcome the hon. Gentleman&#146;s strong support. I believe that he was referring to a series of European Court judgments issued over the past couple of years on pay differences between posted workers and workers employed locally. If the statements that have been made are true and, in the subcontracting cases that have been cited in recent days, the same pay rates apply throughout the site, it would appear that the issue of a race to the bottom in wages does not apply in this instance. As for the judgments themselves, as I have said, a European Commission body is examining the operation of the Posting of Workers Directive, and a social partners dialogue on the judgments is in progress at European level.</p>

I understand that in times of economic difficulty there will always be heightened concerns about jobs. If those concerns include an allegation that the law or rules are being broken, we will look at them, and that is precisely what ACAS has been charged with doing.

European companies operating here in the UK are properly and fairly applied. In recent days, there have been allegations on both counts that that may not be the case, and that is precisely what we have asked ACAS to look at.</p>

 I agree with the Minister that right-wing anti-Europeanism and protectionism would be disastrous for British workers. Do I understand from his statement that ACAS will investigate the implementation of employment rights in respect not just of statutory minimum standards such as the minimum wage, but the national collective bargaining agreements that apply at all of those sites? The wages there are many times higher than the minimum wage. I still find it puzzling that European companies can bring their labour in, meet all the costs of accommodating and transporting them&#151;both to this country and to and from work&#151;and still claim to abide by national pay rates and conditions of service. That does not seem to add up, and I wonder whether the real answer to that puzzle is to be found in the fact that these subcontractors subcontracted all the way down the line to a point at which nobody really knew whether the workers concerned were being exploited or whether local workers were getting the justice and fairness to which they are entitled.</p>

 My right hon. Friend asks several questions, which I will try to answer. He asks about the national agreements setting standards that are higher than the basic minimum wage. He is right about that. Claims have been made that the subcontractors on the Lindsey site abide by the national agreement, and that is a legitimate issue for ACAS to look at. He mentioned the costs involved and I suggest that employers may not always choose the cheapest tender, and that speed or the overall package that a subcontractor offers may be strong factors. The statement issued last night said that the subcontractors did abide by the national agreement, and ACAS will doubtless examine that claim with the employers and the unions involved.</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o26"><a name="90202-0006.htm_para0"><a name="0902025000239">The ministerial statement set out the chilling context in which this debate takes place. We are dealing with rapidly rising unemployment, much of it centred on the construction industry, and the situation is bitter and divisive. We shall try to suggest a positive approach to the problem through fiscal stimulus from capital spending.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o27"><a name="90202-0006.htm_para1"><a name="0902025000240">I wish to make three simple points. First, fiscal stimulus is necessary, and the best way of providing it is through properly targeted public investment. Secondly, despite the Government&#146;s claim to be bringing forward capital investment, that is not happening. There are severe problems in the public investment area, and the situation is complicated by the virtually complete collapse of private finance initiative projects. Thirdly, if we are to have public investment in an environment where there are growing anxieties about public debt, we need a mechanism for proper evaluation of such things in a way that does not happen now, because much of it takes place in the framework of the commercial secrecy that surrounds PFI projects.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o28"><a name="90202-0006.htm_para2"><a name="0902025000241">Let me develop each of the points in turn. First, like most western Governments, we believe&#151;and the Government say that they believe&#151;in the need for a fiscal stimulus. Despite the severe financial constraints on the public sector, we believe that such a stimulus is right and necessary, and that the best way of bringing it about is through properly targeted public investment rather than, as has happened, the value added tax reduction. A few weeks ago, we proposed in the House that, assuming a belief in the fiscal stimulus, a much better use of that &#163;12.5 billion would have been to introduce a series of public investment measures aimed at, for example, home insulation, social housing projects and public transport. We remain of the view that that would have been the correct way forward.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o29"><a name="90202-0006.htm_para3"><a name="0902025000242">Why is public investment so important in a recession? Partly because it creates employment. There is a big opportunity cost to the alternative of not investing: people remain unemployed. Some 100,000 construction workers have already been laid off in this recession. The figure was 300,000 at the peak of the last recession in the early 1990s, and there is a reasonable expectation that the number of unemployed construction workers in this recession will be even bigger than that.</p>

 My hon. Friend is talking about the absolute importance of fiscal stimulus through capital investment. Does he share my concern about local authorities that put together capital programmes which rely partly on anticipated receipts on capital sales and the disposal of assets? Such local authorities are finding it increasingly difficult to make their programmes add up, as the opportunities for disposing of assets at a reasonable price dry up because of the recession. Does he agree that if the Government want the economic stimulus and local councils to deliver better street lighting, and improvements in schools and various other assets that councils hold on the public&#146;s behalf, they need to find ways to bridge the funding gap to allow councils to make the capital investment today?</p>

 My hon. Friend makes a good point that I shall develop later.

That is why we presented our series of proposals before Christmas.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o31"><a name="90202-0006.htm_para5"><a name="0902025000246">My second basic point is that, despite the Government&#146;s commitment in principle to accelerating public investment, a growing amount of evidence&#151;anecdotal so far, but I hope that the Government will clarify the matter&#151;shows that many of their enhanced public investment projects are not happening or are severely delayed.

There may be good technical reasons for re-examining the projects&#151;for example, some depend on asset disposal, as my hon. Friend the Member for Sutton and Cheam (Mr. Burstow) said. However, many do not. The adult college and the tertiary college in my constituency do not have that problem, or the other problems that are supposed to be associated with the building programme, and cannot understand why the projects are being held up.

 I visited Bournemouth and Poole college on Friday to learn that a project of &#163;150 million had to be divided in two. Half has been deferred for at least 24 months and half is faced with general uncertainty. Does my hon.

My local college has already spent &#163;11 million and it is faced with total uncertainty and antiquated buildings.</p>

 My hon. Friend makes her point well. Indeed, hon. Members of all parties made similar points last Thursday during Innovation, Universities and Skills questions. The problem is not only wasteful and exacerbates delays, but it affects a specific form of public investment, which, as the Government have demonstrated, is of great benefit. The colleges that have been built in the existing programme have produced quick returns in accelerating apprenticeship training and other useful activities.</p>

 I do not know the answer. The Financial Secretary is here and I am happy to take an intervention from him, but I am sure that he will give a proper explanation in his speech.

of that has been committed. One of the reasons is that public housing projects&#151;social housing&#151;whether undertaken by councils or by housing associations, depend on agreements with developers and section 106 money. Private development has largely ground to a halt and section 106 money is not available, so public sector housing is not proceeding either. We also know that many social landlords have collaborated with developers, and many of them overcommitted themselves with bank borrowing. There is about &#163;50 billion of borrowing by social landlords&#151;certainly by the registered social landlords. Many of them are now paralysed and unable to proceed with developments.</p>

Moreover, in the middle of a recession, one of the things that the Government concretely can do, and which we all agree is an imperative, is simply not happening. I would be interested to hear exactly what is happening on that front. We have repeatedly asked the Government. As far as we can establish, virtually no money is coming out of the appropriate Department to develop social housing when it is most needed.</p>

 Over the past couple of weeks, Ministers, including the Prime Minister, have accepted the case that my hon.

Friend seek to elicit from the Government today a commitment, first, to draw down more money from the new Homes and Communities Agency&#151;it says that it has lots of money that it is willing to spend, and that could plug the gap&#151;and, secondly, to call in local authorities with a large social housing programme that is currently blocked, so that the money can be released?

 The idea of getting the councils in to talk to the Government about what can be done is right. It should also be possible to bring in some of the developers and get them to work together. There should not necessarily be a public/private sector demarcation. My hon. Friend is right. Although I think the failings are largely in the Government, they are not entirely in the Government. The new agency is probably highly conservative in its approach. I get a sense that it is reluctant, for example, to encourage the buying up of empty stock because it says that it is the wrong quality and cannot be used for public sector housing, so housing stock just sits there  <br>

In the past six months, only one PFI project&#151;as it happens, the M80 motorway in Scotland&#151;has been able to proceed. All others have ground to a halt, as I understand it. The Financial Secretary shakes his head; if he can encourage us with some good news, I would be delighted to hear it. The PFI process is in considerable difficulty because commercial partners will not come forward, and the number of banks willing to participate has drastically contracted, mainly because of the credit crunch. It was always a rather questionable financial mechanism, and it is now in the deepest difficulty.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o38"><a name="90202-0006.htm_para12"><a name="0902025000265">I have made several points about the difficulty that the Government are having in making capital investment take place. The problem is that the context is one of a crisis that is far worse than we knew it to be even three months ago. One of last week&#146;s revelations was the fairly clear indication from independent outside bodies, such as the International Monetary Fund, that the crisis in the UK is significantly worse than that of almost any other developed country. It is worth reflecting briefly on why that is the case.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o39"><a name="90202-0006.htm_para13"><a name="0902025000266">There are two major reasons why the British recession is likely to be much worse than in other developed countries. The first is that the bubble in the housing market and the growth of personal debt were more  <br>

extreme than they were in almost any other developed country, except for Ireland and possibly Spain. The blame for that is quite widely distributed, but it is partly down to a failure of regulation: the deregulations of the 1980s and the liberation of the building societies that allowed them to become banks. It is partly due to failures by the Financial Services Authority, and partly due to a failure of monetary policy. Much of the responsibility for the failure to spot the bubble in the housing market lies with the Government, but also with irresponsible lending by the banking system. That was exceptional in the UK.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o40"><a name="90202-0006.htm_para14"><a name="0902025000267">The second reason, and the full significance of this point is only now becoming fully apparent, is that Britain will suffer severely because we are host to some of the world&#146;s largest banks. Of the largest five, three are in the UK, and they are ultimately the responsibility of the British taxpayer&#151;not counting Lloyds HBOS, which is not far behind them. The City of London hosts those enormous, universal banks that are now in extreme difficulty, and the effects are rippling through our economy. That is happening because banks are rapidly&#151;to use an ugly phrase&#151;deleveraging, which is showing up in a contraction of credit to British companies, and because of the loss of revenue from the City on which the Government hitherto relied. A factor that has not yet come through, but which could be of enormous magnitude, is the big losses that the banks will accrue, much of which will end up with the Treasury. We do not know how much, but the amount will be large.</p>

 I wonder whether the hon.

The automatic stabilisers constitute more than 80 per cent. of the current stimulus package, given the fall in tax revenues and the rise in public spending, and less than 20 per cent. of the package will come from measures in the Government&#146;s announcement.</p>

 Although &#163;12 billion is a lot of money, the Government&#146;s fiscal stimulus is not large in terms of the British economy.

 The hon.

In recent years, the Government have made public investments amounting to something in the order of 2 to 3 per cent. of GDP. That is the order of magnitude that we are talking about.

 I thought that I had just answered that. If we can sustain that level of public investment, it will be an important achievement in itself. The danger is that that investment will simply stop.

Those projects will, of course, be costly and involve public borrowing in the short run, but in many cases they will pay for themselves and reduce debt in the long term.

 There may be a subsidy, which of course has to be weighed against other elements of current spending, but that is a separate argument. However, good public investment may well produce a return for the taxpayer, which has to be factored into all our calculations.

I think that we all know, from the experiences of our local shopping centres, that much of it was completely lost. Most of that VAT cut finished up in increased margins for retailers, which of course has some kind of indirect economic consequence, but not very much.

product&#151;we can argue about whether they were concealing one or two percentage points, but it was of that order of magnitude and it was less than the figure for the United States, Germany or France. I am always happy to concede that. The worry is that public debt is growing very rapidly and that within two to three years it may well have reached 60 per cent., by which time other developed countries will also have increased their public debt as a share of GDP.</p>

As far as I am aware, Japan has not had a currency crisis, yet it has public debt of well over 100 per cent. of GDP. It finances that comfortably by patriotic saving on the part of the Japanese and their lending their money to the Government. Its high levels of debt are way beyond what we are currently contemplating and do not, by any means, necessarily create the kind of problems that some hon.

This situation is partly to do with the cycle and partly to do with a structural deficit, and it has emerged partly because of the collapse in the housing market and the revenue associated with it, and partly because of the collapse in the City and the revenue associated with that. The Government, the Conservatives and the Lib Dems&#151;all of us&#151;will have to face the fact that over the long term there is a structural deficit problem that will have to be dealt with, come what may. It is fair to say that none of us have yet come up with a convincing explanation of how that structural deficit will have to be addressed, but that is the nature of the problem&#151;it is not, by any means, about excessive public investment.</p>

 I hope that the hon. Gentleman also noticed what the IFS said about the effectiveness of the VAT cut as a stimulus to the economy. When he or the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond) speak later in the debate, as I hope they will, I would welcome clarification of their view about the fiscal stimulus that has been announced in the USA. The shadow Chief Secretary, the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge, told us in a debate a couple of weeks ago that there was an emerging consensus that there should be no fiscal stimulus in circumstances such as ours when there is a deficit. He will by now have noticed that this emerging consensus does not extend to the incoming US Administration. As the hon. Member for Twickenham rightly said, the US has higher debt than us and a larger deficit, and it is planning a larger fiscal stimulus. It would be very helpful if the Conservative Opposition could confirm to us their apparent view that there is a consensus that President Obama should abandon the central economic policy proposal he has put to the American people. This underlines just how isolated and out of touch the Conservative party is.</p>

The last Conservative Government allowed public investment to shrivel: it hit a low of 0.3 per cent. of GDP in 1988, and in 1996-97&#151;the last year for which they were responsible&#151;it was just 0.6 per cent. That abysmal record of under-investment left a legacy of decaying public services and infrastructure that every Member of this House will remember all too clearly in their own area.</p>

 Does my right hon. Friend also recall that under the last Conservative Government of 1992-97, with their woeful investment record to which he has just referred, the national debt doubled, and that this Government started to pay that down? Can he also tell us what are the accumulated national debts as a proportion of GDP of other leading industrialised countries, compared with that of the United Kingdom?</p>

 My hon. Friend is absolutely right, of course, and I can tell him that every G7 country apart from Canada has a higher level of net debt as a proportion of GDP than us, and that our level is therefore comparatively low and puts us in a very good position for taking the measures we now need to take.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o52"><a name="90202-0008.htm_para1"><a name="0902025000317">Under this Government, investment has grown by more than three times the 1997 level, to 2.1 per cent. of GDP this year. Next year, at 2.7 per cent. of GDP, public investment will be at a higher level than at any time in the last 30 years.</p>

 Given the case the Minister is making, is he as concerned as I am that the net worth of the UK public sector&#151;not just the debt position, but that taken together with the asset position&#151;is very much lower today than it has been historically, and that that deterioration has taken place under both his Government and the Conservatives?</p>

 I am not sure what data the hon. Gentleman is referring to, but I can tell him that sustained investment over a long period has enabled us to repair a lot of the damage caused to schools, hospitals, transport and other national infrastructure. In the health service, for example, in 1997 half of NHS buildings predated the national health service; that proportion is now down to 20 per cent. I therefore think the statistic the hon. Gentleman cited is a bit misleading.</p>

 Will the right hon. Gentleman respond to a question I earlier asked my hon. Friend the Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable) about the difficulty local authorities face in financing their capital programmes? In making good at the local level&#151; through investment in their housing stock and schools&#151;the damage that the right hon. Gentleman is talking about, how can they now bridge the gap caused by their not being able to realise receipts? My local authority is partly funding its programme from &#163;12 million of receipts that it now does not anticipate will come about.</p>

 I will come to that point. There certainly is a challenging market environment for private finance initiative deals at present, but a number of them have been agreed recently; I am thinking of the Forest Gate housing project in my own area, for example&#151;which was, I think, agreed last week&#151;and Building Schools for the Future projects, and not only of the project to which the hon. Gentleman referred.</p>

Today, we are in a recession&#151;the first to hit the UK since the early 1990s and face some of the harshest economic conditions for decades, and perhaps for a century. The nature of this downturn is fundamentally different from those the UK suffered in the past. In the late 1980s, UK GDP growth was allowed to rise to 6 per cent., well above the economy&#146;s growth potential. As a result inflation rose to double digits and interest rates followed in an effort to control inflation. Domestic policy mistakes caused the economy to enter recession in 1990 and unemployment to rise above 3 million for the second time in 10 years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o54"><a name="90202-0008.htm_para3"><a name="0902025000323">Today, things are very different. The problem we face is global, with many forecasters now expecting the world economy to contract for the first time since  the second world war. Bad decisions at the heart of the international financial system have meant banks losing confidence in each other and, therefore, global credit markets to freeze up.</p>

 Does the Minister share my view that the Prime Minister was wrong to suggest that the UK was uniquely well placed to deal with a recession, especially in light of the IMF&#146;s damning judgment last week that this year the country would have the greatest reduction in GDP of any of the major developed countries?</p>

 No. I agree with the Prime Minister&#146;s assessment and there are two reasons: first, as we have already discovered in this debate, we go into the recession with a low level of debt compared with other G7 countries and, secondly, we go in with a high level of employment; indeed, for several months last year more people in the UK were working than ever before.

have gone into the recession in good shape but the effects of the downturn are now being felt everywhere around the world. Trade and manufacturing have contracted sharply in America, Europe and Asia as companies have been unable to access the credit they need, so economic forecasts for growth in 2009 have been revised sharply downwards.</p>

 The Minister is exactly right in his point that the circumstance is unique and that the recession is being felt not just in the UK but in Europe and America. In the downturns of the 1980s and 1990s, the construction industry was able to take some work abroad; people moved abroad&#151;for example, lift manufacturers took projects abroad&#151;but at present, they are unable to do so. Does that not mean that there is greater need for investment in construction projects and the construction industry to mitigate this special and&#151;for the construction industry&#151;very deep downturn?</p>

 Will my right hon. Friend take this opportunity, verbally, to give the bankers a kicking?

summit in mid-November. We hold the G20 presidency this year, and it is increasingly recognised, as Stephen Green of HSBC was saying last week, that the G20, in bringing together the biggest developing as well as developed countries, is the right group of nations to bring together to formulate solutions. My hon. Friend the Member for Preston (Mr. Hendrick) rightly expressed concerns earlier about developing countries, which underlines the importance of the G20. Through our presidency, we are driving an ambitious work plan to help tackle the problems.</p>

We know that there are major lessons to be learned there. It is clear that existing international systems of regulation failed to adapt to the challenges of this new, highly globalised world; we need to co-operate internationally to make major changes so that those mistakes cannot be repeated.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o57"><a name="90202-0008.htm_para6"><a name="0902025000334">International action needs to be accompanied by a decisive domestic response. Our response has been threefold. First, we had the comprehensive package of support for the banking system announced in October, which has been widely replicated around the world since. Secondly, there were announcements in the pre-Budget report of a major fiscal stimulus package to support the wider economy; the measures we are discussing today are an important part of that&#151;and I shall say more about it in a few moments. Thirdly, there was a package of measures last month to begin to replace the lending capacity lost by the withdrawal from the UK of foreign banks and other institutions and to address the barriers preventing UK banks from expanding lending, to support stability and to restore certainty in the banking sector.</p>

 I am very supportive of the fiscal stimulus, but one issue greatly concerns me&#151;the slimness of the evidence of whether anything is actually happening on the ground. Let me provide the example of two projects in my own constituency, both of which are Barratt developments that have now been mothballed. They could be picked up and got going; they could employ construction workers immediately by building flats that were initially aimed at the private sector, but could be brought into social housing. That could be got going immediately. Why is the Treasury not getting the biggest four or five developers together in a room and actually doing a deal with them to proceed with those sort of projects? Why do we not get some action on the ground?</p>

That is why we are taking action now with the business payment support scheme to allow firms to spread tax payments over a timetable they can manage. More than 34,000 businesses have reached agreements since that was announced at the time of the PBR.

to stay in their homes with support for their mortgage repayments; and there is also the VAT cut. I very much welcome what the Institute for Fiscal Studies said last week about the effectiveness of that as a stimulus measure. I think that the mistake of the hon. Member for Twickenham is his apparent belief that the effectiveness of the VAT measure is about what happened in the past, but I think that the measure will, as the IFS pointed out, prove increasingly effective as the year progresses and as the subsequent increase back up to the original rate approaches on 31 December.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o59"><a name="90202-0008.htm_para8"><a name="0902025000338">We are increasing household income next year by putting an extra &#163;145 in the pocket of every basic rate taxpayer; we have given all pensioners a bonus &#163;60 one- off payment, and the basic state pension for a single person is going up very sharply from &#163;90.70 to more than &#163;95 a week in April. We are supporting families by permanently increasing child benefit to &#163;20 a week with effect from last month instead of April, and we are increasing child tax credit by &#163;75 a year in April, which is above inflation. So, unlike the Conservative party, we agree with the Governments of every major economy in the world who are increasing public spending now. I agree with the hon. Member for Twickenham that bringing forward major capital spending on our national infrastructure is a vital way to preserve jobs and boost our economy through this period.</p>

 On new projects, it is obviously important to get projects moving as quickly as possible for the next year or so, but there are some huge capital projects around, particularly the Mersey Gateway bridge, which is in my constituency, worth some &#163;700 million and might be ready in the next two or three years, following a public inquiry this year. Does my right hon. Friend agree that it is important not only to get projects on the move this year, but to plan for the next two or three years?

First, there simply is no freeze on the capital funding programme for further education colleges. Investment in college capital projects will amount to &#163;2.3 billion between 2007-8 and 2010-11. That programme is steaming ahead. Incidentally, the equivalent programme in 1997 was zero&#151;there was no capital investment at all in FE in 1997. More than 250 projects are under way, funded by the Learning and Skills Council, helped by the recent decision to accelerate &#163;110 million in the current year from future budgets to help beat the downturn; 154 of those projects are due for completion this year. There has been some disappointment that a number of projects have not gone ahead as quickly as was hoped, but the programme is proceeding on precisely the scale that we said that it would, with a very large number of colleges benefiting as a result.</p>

 In an earlier intervention, co-operation between the Treasury and other Departments was mentioned. What co-operation was there between the Treasury and the Department for Communities and Local Government, which vetoed any English region from applying for extensions that would have brought in an extra &#163;671 million-worth of EU funding? Why were the regions not allowed a say on that? Was the Treasury involved in that decision?</p>

 I am not sure which programme the hon. Lady means. If she will drop me a line, I shall be happy to tell her what happened in that specific instance. I can assure her, however, that we are working very closely with all the spending Departments. In the case of the Department for Communities and Local Government, it is true that there is pressure on social housing, but we have set ambitious targets to increase provision, and over the next three years we are investing about &#163;6.5 billion to deliver on those targets.

 As the hon. Lady knows, Andrew Foster has been brought in to look at those issues and he will report as soon as he is able to do so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o64"><a name="90202-0009.htm_para2"><a name="0902025000358">The Liberal Democrat motion is also wrong to criticise the fact that we have set out in our plans a fiscal consolidation in the period ahead. We have set out how we will get back to balance in the medium term, and I make no apology for that. We need to get back to balance and to set out plainly how we will do that. Indeed, that is what we did in the pre-Budget Report. I think that we are the only country to have set out the trajectory that we will follow to do that, and it is the right thing to do. It will involve, when the upturn comes, a level of public sector net investment that will be lower as a proportion of GDP than it will be next year&#151;but at 1.8 per cent. of GDP it will still be three times as big as in 1997.</p>

 My right hon. Friend mentioned the upturn and when it will come. The recent evidence from the IMF and other forecasters is that the recession may last longer. If the recession is likely to last longer than until the end of this calendar year, will Ministers, when they make the Budget projections, consider putting in place a further fiscal stimulus and bringing forward investment so that we do not have a deeper recession than is necessary?</p>

 As my hon. Friend knows, we will set out new forecasts at the time of the Budget, and of course we will reflect on the lessons from them. However, the IMF forecast is for growth for the UK for the next calendar year. Interestingly, it also forecasts a shorter period of negative growth for this country than for several other G7 countries.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o65"><a name="90202-0009.htm_para3"><a name="0902025000361">As I was saying, our increase in public investment compared with the Tory years will be sustained not just through the current downturn but through to the other side of it as well. Of course, paying for the fiscal stimulus, and for the steps that we are taking to support British businesses and households, will require Government borrowing to increase. We are starting from a strong position. According to the OECD, the UK had the lowest net debt of any country in the G7 apart from Canada&#151;the point that Joseph Stiglitz rightly underlined on &#147;Newsnight&#148;. That is the point that the Conservatives have failed to recognise. It would be helpful if the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire (Mr. Gauke) confirmed, when he speaks later on behalf of the Conservative party, whether it is his party&#146;s view that President Obama should abandon his central economic policy proposal because of what they think is an  emerging consensus, although it does not even appear to be a consensus in the shadow Cabinet, given some of the remarks that have been made by its members.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o66"><a name="90202-0009.htm_para4"><a name="0902025000362">Of course debt in the UK will rise in the period ahead, as it will rise in the other major economies. Every advanced country in the world is increasing Government borrowing in response to the downturn. The latest OECD forecast shows not only that UK net debt was the second lowest in the G7 when the shocks began, however, but that our net debt will remain below that of most other G7 countries right the way through this downturn.</p>

 It is a pleasure to speak in this debate. The Liberal Democrats have proposed an interesting motion, which is very helpful to the House in one sense&#151;it highlights an inconsistency in the Government&#146;s approach. We hear how the Government are engaging in a fiscal stimulus through public works and additional spending to help people out of the recession, but almost daily we read that public expenditure is being held back and that capital projects have been cut.

It has not been made up&#151;we are hearing about it, our constituents are telling us about it daily. We see frequent newspaper reports of PFI projects being put on hold. <i> The Times</i> tells us that more than 100 school and hospital projects are being delayed. The Government have announced that many of the proposals, such as the widening of the M25, are to be held back for budgetary reasons.</p>

That represents quite a turnaround in just a few weeks. They are a capital-&#147;C&#148; Conservative Government: the Conservative Government in Canada, led by the Conservative Prime Minister, Stephen Harper, and the Conservative Finance Minister, Jim Flaherty, who have, in the past few weeks, fallen into line with the rest of the world.

 I will give way, but I shall just make this point. The hon.

Essentially, it goes back to the reckless running of the public finances in the early part of this decade, when during boom years we were still borrowing huge amounts and organisations such as the International Monetary Fund were warning the UK Government that the fiscal position was unsustainable.</p>

 I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving way again. His case on the detail of the UK public finances is there, and we can examine the record. However, I am intrigued. Clearly, the United States is the most important global economy, but it has a higher level of borrowing to GDP and public debt to GDP than we do and its banking system is worse placed than ours. Does the hon. Gentleman therefore advise President Obama to shelve his plans for fiscal stimulus?</p>

 The US has a reserve currency; it does not have the same risk of a run on its currency as the UK does. The important distinction is that its automatic stabilisers are much smaller than the UK&#146;s. A lot of the fiscal stimulus that is going to occur in the UK would happen automatically, and the same does not happen to the same extent in the US.

The great sterling crises in our economic history happened precisely because we were unwinding our reserve currency role. The hon. Gentleman&#146;s point is exactly, 180°, wrong.</p>

 Essentially, we have a credit crunch and a monetary problem, and we believe that we should focus on monetary policy.

I will not develop the argument in great detail, but all parties would agree that where, within existing budgets, it is possible to bring forward projects, given that land and labour are relatively cheap and available at present, it is sensible to do so. Indeed, on the subject of social housing&#151;the point was made earlier&#151;where there are no rigid rules preventing private housing development which has been mothballed from being taken into social housing use, there is a strong argument for considering that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o89"><a name="90202-0010.htm_para5"><a name="09020227000058">There may well be merit in the proposals set out by the Liberal Democrats, but they are not a response to the recession. They are not a way of pump-priming the economy. For example, one of their proposals is a five-year programme to insulate schools and hospitals. That may be a sensible policy, but it is not a response to the recession. They advance an argument for improving railway infrastructure. There may be something to be said for that. I looked at the set of schemes that they proposed, the various lines that would be improved or doubled, and the destinations and areas that those serve.</p>

I did not see any reference to Wolverhampton, but perhaps that is the least of the worries of the hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Rob Marris). The policy is not focused on the recession.

It is worth quoting what the US congressional budget office found when it examined the $356 billion spending proposals as part of the fiscal stimulus in the US. It concluded that only 7 per cent. would be spent in 2009 and 31 per cent. in 2010. There is a practical point&#151;planning permission and various details need to be dealt with.

 I support my right hon. and hon. Friends on the Front Bench. Irrespective of the crisis that we face in international banking and the financial sector, the strategy of co-ordinated investment in social and economic regeneration over the past decade has worked and continues to work. Without it, communities such as my constituency would still have Dickensian schools, hospitals and GP surgeries, and we would have had construction workers on the dole for the past decade and more. If we are serious about regenerating communities and engaging the private sector to reinvest in communities, the public sector requires a co-ordinated approach to replenishing the public realm.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o94"><a name="90202-0010.htm_para10"><a name="09020227000066">I invite my right hon. Friend the Financial Secretary to visit us in my area of Wigan. For the past decade, we have worked with the private sector to reinvest in our townships, abandoned by the last Conservative Government, and our pit villages and our textile communities, left almost overnight with no economy and a disinvestment in our public services. That caused great social and economic dislocation. Some parts of our community are still grappling with the consequences a decade or more later.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o95"><a name="90202-0010.htm_para11"><a name="09020227000067">It is important that we do not look for merely a short-term fix to get us out of our fiscal difficulties because of the failure of the American and other banking systems. We must sustain our investment for social and economic good. If we are serious about re-skilling and up-skilling our work force and giving every kid in Britain the right to be the best they can be, we need a co-ordinated approach at local level, with public investment linked to engagement with the private sector in order to develop our infrastructure and encourage investment in communities where previously the private sector had disinvested for a decade and more.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o96"><a name="90202-0010.htm_para12"><a name="09020227000068">In our community, the local authority worked with the private sector to encourage the creation of public sector campuses in our small townships and our larger ones. We want the Government to utilise capital investment in the NHS, the education system, housing and local government, and to bring those investments together, instead of allowing investment by individual Departments to be made in a pepper-pot way. We need to bring forward those investments to ensure a better-resourced outcome from public investment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o97"><a name="90202-0010.htm_para13"><a name="09020227000069">During this crisis, the Government have established a National Economic Council. Before Christmas, we in Wigan met the banks, building societies and private sector developers to create our own economic council to ensure that work introduced at the top line happens locally, on the front line. I say to the Exchequer Secretary that when top-line announcements are made, we must have the capacity to ensure that they are followed through at a local level. We will be judged by communities when they can see what we talk about in this place  <br>

making a difference in their everyday lives. When we say that we will invest in schools and colleges, we have to ensure that that investment is set out in an effective way over the next two or three years, and that we are certain that local authorities can invest in them. We have to be sure about investment in housing, whether it is social housing or public-private investment to bring back private sector housing into public use, such as old stock that needs refurbishing, or new stock that cannot be sold in the marketplace today. We need a time scale that ensures that people can see the differences made.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o98"><a name="90202-0010.htm_para14"><a name="09020227000070">It is important that alongside those public investments, we ensure that the banking system generates enough resources, so that where public investment with the engagement of the private sector is needed, the private sector can work in sync with us. That is critical to the LIFT&#151;local improvement finance trust&#151;strategy for NHS investment, particularly in primary care. We can get an agreement with the national health service, but without investment to encourage the private sector to engage in big infrastructure projects, and without banks agreeing to participate with private sector developers as part of the LIFT company, some of the Government&#146;s priority projects will be delayed. It is important to listen to voices at ground level to ensure that top-line announcements by Ministers are delivered on the bottom line, in the local community.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o99"><a name="90202-0010.htm_para15"><a name="09020227000071">We must not allow the Conservatives to get away with what they have attempted to get away with tonight. They have made it absolutely clear that there would be immediate removal of capital investment in this country under a Conservative Government, leading to dislocation for the private and public sectors. The consequences for public services, and private sector companies engaged in public services, would be double what they were under the last Tory Government during the 1980s and 1990s. It is not rocket science. The policies advocated by the Tory Front-Bench spokesman, the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire (Mr. Gauke), were those pursued by the last Conservative Government during two recessions. At that time, the consequence of those policies was a laying waste of my community and its public services. We were trying to provide public services in our community at a time when nine out of 10 people on council estates had to rely on some form of state benefit. That was the level of dislocation caused the last time the Conservatives put into practice the policies that the hon. Gentleman advocated in relation to this recession. These are siren voices: they were wrong then, and they are wrong now. It is important, in arguing our corner, that we do not just become administrators of Treasury policies. We should be enthusiastic and tough in arguing our corner on public service investment.</p>

It is important, having rightly saved the banking system from meltdown, that the system does not revert to type. We saved the banking system for a simple reason: to protect the long-term future of business and commerce, and to protect pensions and other assets. It is no job of ours to sit back if a bank allows 12,000 jobs to go to the wall, as one bank in my constituency is doing. Why is that happening? Because the bank will not implement the strategy that the Government rightly outlined weeks ago. It is our task not only to ensure that  <br>

If the Exchequer Secretary does not believe me, I invite her to come to Colchester, where phase 1 of the Colchester institute is about to finish. In a few weeks&#146; time, the entire work force will leave the site to join the dole queue because the much-promised phase 2 does not have the necessary finance. Given some of the interventions we have heard, I imagine that that story is being repeated in other constituencies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o103"><a name="90202-0010.htm_para19"><a name="09020227000076">I made two interventions on those speaking on behalf of their Front-Bench teams, when I asked about renovation and restoration before demolition, and about new build. Let me set out the significance of those comments. I welcome public investment in my constituency whether it is &#163;100 million or &#163;150 million, as promised by the Conservative-led Essex county council for new schools&#151;or at least I welcome part of it, because some of it will not provide value for money. One of the aspects that will not provide value for money is the demolition of a perfectly good secondary school opposite the Colchester institute. The people of Colchester want phase 2 of the institute to be built before we start demolishing buildings to provide new ones. We need a bit of joined-up government.</p>

Members will know that I have been badgering the Government for 12 years about the resumption of council house building. It is a fact that Conservative Governments have built more council houses since the second world war than Labour ones. I made that point to Brother Blair and to the then Deputy Prime Minister, and I have made it to the current Prime Minister. We need to invest more in existing housing stock that stands vacant. In my constituency, the Government have in excess of 200 houses standing empty, for which they are paying rent approaching &#163;750,000. Those 200-plus family houses could accommodate some of the families for whom the waiting list has virtually doubled under Labour. The houses are under the control of the Ministry of Defence, and I make a particular plea for the Government to engage in a bit of joined-up thinking, so that some of those families can move into houses that currently stand empty. I am sure that there are other houses standing empty across the country which should be brought back into use, and we could also buy up houses in new developments&#151;but not flats, please. We need family houses, and I urge the Government to take that line.</p>

I think that she said something to the effect that we did not have any monetary policy tools left to deal with the crisis now that interest rates were so low.</p>

<p><a name="st_o296"><a name="09020227000080"><a name="90202-0011.htm_spnew1"><a name="09020227000517"><b>Angela Eagle:</b>

 If that was not the case, I would be grateful if she clarified exactly what she did say.</p>

 I was asking the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire (Mr. Gauke) a question about monetary policy, should we get to the stage where interest rates in this country are as low as they have been in Japan and the USA. I was talking about a hypothetical situation, not one that is in existence, because, as the hon. Member for Chichester (Mr. Tyrie) knows, interest rates are currently 1.5 per cent.</p>

<p><a name="st_o299"><a name="09020227000083"><a name="90202-0011.htm_spnew4"><a name="09020227000520"><b>Mr. Tyrie:</b>
 I think that the hon. Lady is labouring under a massive misapprehension about monetary policy and the main tools available to the authorities. I hope that that misapprehension is not informing the higher reaches of policy making in the Labour Government, because if it is, it must be partly responsible for the talk about using all sorts of other tools, which in my view is probably premature.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o106"><a name="90202-0011.htm_para1"><a name="09020227000084">At least three monetary tools are still available. The first, as the hon. Lady correctly implies, is 1.5 percentage points of interest rate cuts. Secondly, there is the use of funding policy. I find it quite baffling that the Government should be allowing the Debt Management Office to issue so much long-dated stock, when they should be asking it to fund at least part of the deficit at the short end, thereby generating some further monetary easing. The third tool is the exchange rate, which she has ignored completely. The dramatic fall in the exchange rate is by far the biggest event to have taken place in monetary policy&#151;bigger even than the fall in interest rates that we have seen&#151;and it will have considerable effects. However, those effects will take some months to come through. Until they do, monetary policy needs to be given a chance to work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o107"><a name="90202-0011.htm_para2"><a name="09020227000085">Fiscal policy is broadly working&#151;that is, the fiscal stabilisers are already operating as they should. It is monetary policy, and in particular that part which pertains to banks and the credit system, that needs a good deal of Government attention. However, they have been remiss in not acting on that earlier, first, by not underwriting the banks with recapitalisation, and then, when they did, by recapitalising the banks in a way that encouraged them to strengthen their balance sheets at almost any cost, thereby negating part of the purpose of the recapitalisation in the first place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o108"><a name="90202-0011.htm_para3"><a name="09020227000086">Given that so little time is available and given the fact that we are going to hear a couple of Front-Bench speeches in a moment, let me quickly make one or two further points. <i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> I am getting a signal that  <br>

it might be helpful if I make only one further point, so I will do that, and in only one minute, too. It might be misrepresented as being party political, but the point that I am going to make, which is almost universally accepted by all dispassionate observers of economic policy, is that there is absolutely nothing left of Labour&#146;s economic policy at all.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o109"><a name="90202-0011.htm_para4"><a name="09020227000087">The policy that was put together a decade ago has been completely dismantled. The idea&#151;the rhetoric or the mantra&#151;of so-called spending to invest was long ago replaced by spending to consume. Indeed, the use of the word &#147;investment&#148; for current spending in the public sector has devalued the term, which has been damaging. The fiscal rules were consigned to the dustbin at the time of the Northern Rock episode&#151;it was the first time that they were seriously tested, and they collapsed. Then there was the Chancellor&#146;s autumn statement, which tore up all the Labour Government&#146;s remaining pledges on taxation&#151;the pledges that they used to try to persuade middle Britain that the economy was safe with them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o110"><a name="90202-0011.htm_para5"><a name="09020227000088">It is against that backdrop that in just over a year we will hold an election. The conduct of economic policy will be central to that election. I leave the House with one thought. When they go to the polls, the electorate will have in their mind a simple question. When looking at the Prime Minister and the running of the economy over the previous decade or so, will they be able to say well done?</p>

 This has been an interesting, albeit short debate. I am aware that I have very little time to wind up, as we would like to finish by half-past 6 to ensure that House staff can go home.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o111"><a name="90202-0011.htm_para6"><a name="09020227000090">My hon. Friend the Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable) opened this debate by making a case for sensible public investment that would create jobs today and build assets for tomorrow. However, in the interventions that we have heard today, many of my hon. Friends, as well as colleagues in other parts of the House, have pointed out examples of programmes that have stalled. In particular, my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole (Annette Brooke) mentioned building projects for colleges in her constituency. I was surprised by the response from the Minister, who said that those projects were steaming ahead, because it is self-evident that they are not.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o112"><a name="90202-0011.htm_para7"><a name="09020227000091">The right hon. Member for Makerfield (Mr. McCartney) said in his contribution that the Government would be judged on how they make a difference to people&#146;s lives on the ground. Unfortunately, that was not the tone of the Minister&#146;s response. He agreed with almost everything that my hon. Friend the Member for Twickenham said about the need for a fiscal stimulus, the need to invest in social housing and the need to invest in insulation, but he made no new announcements. We are talking about an issue of scale. Ticking a box and saying that the Government have a programme is not going to help us out of recession.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o113"><a name="90202-0011.htm_para8"><a name="09020227000092">The Conservative spokesperson, the hon.

However, he said nothing about how the Conservatives would lead us out of the current recession and seemed  <br>

to misunderstand the point that my hon. Friend the Member for Twickenham was making. He has consistently argued for borrowing to invest in capital projects, not borrowing to fund tax cuts or current expenditure. Those things are different, and the hon. Gentleman should be aware of that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o114"><a name="90202-0011.htm_para9"><a name="09020227000093">My hon. Friend made the point, which others made too, that unemployment involves a large cost. Doing nothing is not a cheaper option, and I wish that the Conservatives would be aware of that. As for railway redevelopment, the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire perhaps gives us credit for having more cunning than my colleagues are capable of. However, now that he has acknowledged on the Floor of the House that Liberal Democrat projects will make an immense difference to many of my hon. Friends&#146; constituents, I am sure that his words will be quoted in Liberal Democrat &#147;Focus&#148; leaflets in no time at all.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o115"><a name="90202-0011.htm_para10"><a name="09020227000094">Nowhere is there a more urgent need to invest than in housing. There are 1.77 million households on the housing waiting list in England. Far from the need declining, more and more families are struggling to afford private rents or mortgages. The Council of Mortgage Lenders has estimated that 75,000 families will have their homes repossessed this year. Many will arrive at their council&#146;s door with their belongings in one hand and their children on their other arm. Councils will have nowhere to house those people, because housing projects have been drying up.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o116"><a name="90202-0011.htm_para11"><a name="09020227000095">Demand for housing does not dry up because house prices are falling or because banks have stopped lending. As soon as lending recovers, the real and present danger will be that we might end up with hyper-inflation in the market, because we will have failed to keep pace with true demand in the meantime. As my hon. Friend the Member for Twickenham said, the truth is that house building in both the public and private sectors has stalled. Figures from the National House-Building Council suggest that the industry started fewer than 30 per cent. as many homes in the last quarter of 2008 as it did in the last quarter of 2007.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o117"><a name="90202-0011.htm_para12"><a name="09020227000096">In an intervention, my hon. Friend the Member for Eastleigh (Chris Huhne) mentioned developments in his constituency. Many such developments are now being mothballed, which is why my hon. Friend the Member for Twickenham has been arguing for a dramatic increase in the amount of funding available for councils and housing associations to buy up such properties. The Minister said that that money had been made available, but only &#163;200 million has been made available through the national clearing house scheme, most of which has been spent. Surely that demonstrates the need for more money to be made available.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o118"><a name="90202-0011.htm_para13"><a name="09020227000097">The problem with housing associations being able to build is partly to do with lending and partly to do with the model of cross-subsidy that has been used for a decade to fund social house building. That model will simply not work in the current climate. Private sales have dried up. Housing associations that previously relied on being able to sell homes off plan cannot even sell them when they are fully built. Furthermore, low-cost home ownership lending products are no longer being   <br>

offered by banks, so all the options for housing associations to cross-subsidise their social housing, affordable housing and housing for rent are just not available.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o119"><a name="90202-0011.htm_para14"><a name="09020227000098">As a consequence, many housing associations have stopped building&#151;they have certainly stopped building shared ownership homes&#151;because they know that mortgages are not available. The consequence for them, as for the construction industry, is that they are making many staff redundant. The Government will have to accept that Treasury subsidy-per-unit targets will not work at the moment. The Homes and Communities Agency says that it will make more flexible funding available, but we need that funding to get to housing associations quickly, so that they can take advantage of it. Delay is costly for those people waiting for social housing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o120"><a name="90202-0011.htm_para15"><a name="09020227000099">I said that a consequence of the fact that building has stalled is that construction workers are being laid off in their thousands. The Federation of Master Builders predicts that job losses in the construction industry could reach 90,000 this year. The consequence is not just short-term, and it is not just misery for families whose major breadwinner has lost their job. The costs will be felt in the British economy for at least a decade, because even when the money to build again becomes available, the country will have lost vital construction skills, and it will take a decade, or possibly even a generation, for us to recover. Families, certainly in my constituency, cannot wait that long for house building to begin again.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o121"><a name="90202-0011.htm_para16"><a name="09020227000100">In the face of that, the Government have been tinkering at the edges. They are bringing forward &#163;400 million in the next 18 months for social housing providers to deliver just 5,000 homes, but 1.7 million households are on the housing waiting list. A further &#163;150 million was announced in the pre-Budget report, but reports from the Department for Communities and Local Government suggest that it has not yet even worked out how to allocate that. It is a drop in the ocean given the fiscal stimulus that is needed for the recession, and given the number of families desperate for housing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o122"><a name="90202-0011.htm_para17"><a name="09020227000101">Some &#163;12 billion was frittered away on a VAT tax cut that made little or no difference to most families; that money would have been better used in putting unemployed people back into work, and in leaving a lasting legacy that would save energy, reduce bills and fight climate change. With the money used to make a tiny VAT cut, we could have insulated every school and hospital in the country, funded insulation for a million people languishing in fuel poverty, and have built 40,000 extra zero-carbon social homes. The Conservative spokesperson said that that was not a response to the recession; well, it is certainly a response to need, and he has come up with no response to the recession whatever.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o123"><a name="90202-0011.htm_para18"><a name="09020227000102">If the Government really wanted to cut VAT, how much more useful would it have been to cut the rate of VAT for rebuilding and renovation? My hon. Friend the Member for Colchester (Bob Russell) made a point about the number of empty homes that are left derelict, not just in the private sector, but often in the public sector. There are more than 700,000 empty properties in England&#151;enough to make a sizeable dent in the amount of housing needed in this country&#151;yet the Government are not prepared to take the action necessary to bring those homes back into use. What is needed from the Government is a dramatic building programme that  <br>

focuses attention across all Departments. They need to get the public sector to release land now. They need to bring forward substantial amounts of new money, and money in the existing comprehensive spending review, to make sure that housing associations and councils can buy up land and property while prices are cheaper.</p>

 We have had a short but interesting debate this evening, and I would like to deal with some of the issues raised. Interestingly, the hon. Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable) said that capital expenditure simply is not taking place at the moment. I am glad to say that that is not true; I am sorry to disappoint him, but there is a great deal of work going on, and a great deal of extra capital expenditure coming through. I hope that he is reassured by that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o124"><a name="90202-0011.htm_para19"><a name="09020227000104">The Government will continue to show the commitment to investing in public services that we have demonstrated since 1997. That commitment is in contrast to years of neglect under the previous Conservative Government. Our investment has meant the building of 1,100 new schools, and more than &#163;20 billion of improvements to social housing. The 100th new NHS hospital was recently successfully completed, and more are in the pipeline. When we came to government in 1997, 50 per cent. of the NHS estate dated from before 1948. Today that figure is down to just 20 per cent. We are proud of that record and are determined to continue investing in UK infrastructure to ensure world-class public services in buildings fit for the 21st century.</p>

 To mention just one of the many examples that have been given on the Floor of the House in this debate, the builders are to leave the Colchester institute site in the next few weeks. Many other colleges are in exactly the same position; building work is grinding to a halt. What is happening?</p>

<p><a name="st_o303"><a name="09020227000106"><a name="90202-0011.htm_spnew7"><a name="09020227000524"><b>Angela Eagle:</b>
 There is no freeze to the capital programme for further education expenditure, and there is no question but that the &#163;110 million that was brought forward in the pre-Budget report this year will be spent. There are signs that the ability of some colleges to raise their own funds for proposed projects is being affected by the downturn, and it is right that the Learning and Skills Council should take a look at the proposals for capital schemes in the pipeline to assess the likely impact on funding support for individual projects. I understand the concerns that have been raised, but hon. Members who are anxious about projects in their constituency should recognise and accept that the 253 projects to which my right hon. Friend the Financial Secretary referred have been given the go-ahead, and that more than 150 of them are due to be completed this year, so there is a substantial programme of capital works in the pipeline&#151;&#163;2.3 billion over the next three years. I point out that the figure was zero in 1997.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o125"><a name="90202-0011.htm_para20"><a name="09020227000107">We know that we can sensibly combine our commitment to investment in our infrastructure and our public services with a real boost to the economy to help us through this very difficult global downturn.

stimulate economic activity, but because it will modernise Britain&#146;s infrastructure and ensure that we are in the best possible position to take advantage of the upturn when it comes. That is why we are using the fiscal stimulus to invest in our competitiveness for generations to come.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o126"><a name="90202-0011.htm_para21"><a name="09020227000108">I agree with the hon. Member for Brent, East (Sarah Teather) that it is far more costly to do nothing than to invest in increased public expenditure as part of a co-ordinated fiscal stimulus to deal with the unprecedented global situation in which we find ourselves. That is why the pre-Budget report in November set out a fiscal stimulus, including &#163;3 billion of capital expenditure on schools, transport and homes, which is to be brought forward from 2010-11 to the next financial year. That is real help now, and it is in contrast to the attitude of the do nothing Tories. This Government have taken concrete action to give a timely boost to prevent job losses and stimulate economic activity, and we are on track to deliver that spending.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o127"><a name="90202-0011.htm_para22"><a name="09020227000109">There are reports that the difficult economic climate will adversely affect the private finance initiatives that are a common feature of the Government&#146;s public investment programmes. Some of those worries have been expressed this evening. There is no doubt that the market is challenging. The credit crunch has reduced liquidity in the financial markets, and that has affected all debt-raising. Understandably, there is a concern that that could result in new PFI deals struggling to find finance, or increase costs for those that do obtain finance. Obviously, we are watching the situation extremely closely.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o128"><a name="90202-0011.htm_para23"><a name="09020227000110">Projects continue to reach financial closure. As my right hon. Friend the Financial Secretary said, in January, two projects&#151;the M80 highway project and the Forest Gate housing project&#151;closed successfully. That involved &#163;370 million of public investment, which had been committed and which is now being put to effect. We are working to push forward all the projects currently in the pipeline. In recognition of the potential difficulties facing such initiatives, Treasury officials are working with other Departments and Partnerships UK to help ensure that projects are able to obtain finance in a timely fashion. In addition, the measures to unfreeze credit announced last month by my right hon. Friend the Chancellor are intended to help remove barriers to lending.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o129"><a name="90202-0011.htm_para24"><a name="09020227000111">My right hon. Friend the Member for Makerfield (Mr. McCartney) made an impassioned speech, as usual, about the importance of protecting communities during such downturns. I agree with him about the policy of the Conservative party, which is to cut public expenditure now, right in the middle of a recession. That is the opposite of a fiscal stimulus. The Conservatives would not do nothing&#151;they would take action that would make matters worse. By cutting public expenditure, the Conservatives are once more falling into the trap of laying waste to entire communities and huge areas of the country. This Government will not fall into that trap. We are committed to ensuring that public expenditure remains higher, even after the fiscal consolidation that we have planned. Public capital expenditure will be 1.8 per cent. of gross domestic product in 2013-14, which is three times more than the paltry 0.6 per cent. that we inherited from the Opposition. The Government have addressed the huge backlog&#151;</p>

Members; is concerned at the lack of progress on the Prime Minister&#146;s constitutional renewal programme; is disappointed that current legislation fails to provide for limits on donations or spending by political parties; calls for urgent and effective action to reduce parties&#146; dependence on large donors and trade union interests; believes that comprehensive reform of the procedures of the House is essential to enable it to scrutinise Government and the spending of taxpayers&#146; money more effectively; and recognises the need for urgent action to restore the trust of the British public in Parliament as an institution and in politics as a profession.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o137"><a name="90202-0012.htm_para4"><a name="09020227000404">The past fortnight has been a bad couple of weeks for parliamentary politics. We had the aborted attempt to exempt Parliament from the Freedom of Information Act 2000, the revelations about the activities of certain peers and a reminder, in the Standards and Privileges Committee&#146;s report, of the actions of one hon. Member. A week ago, when we discussed the freedom of information provisions, perhaps in a genuflection to Burns, I asked colleagues to try to see themselves as others see us. I despair at what those outside the House who are struggling to keep their jobs and to keep a roof over their heads think when they read in their newspapers of people asking for &#163;10,000, &#163;20,000 or up to &#163;100,000 to affect legislation by the exercise of whatever influence they believe they have. This cannot go on, and it is time that we took action.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o138"><a name="90202-0012.htm_para5"><a name="09020227000405">A sensible, appropriate and proportionate response is to recognise that Parliament is in urgent need of reform. I refer to Parliament as a whole, as the matter is not simply about those at the other end of the corridor. The title of the motion, as it was read out by the Leader of the House at business questions on Thursday&#151;I am sorry not to see her in her place&#151;referred to this as an &#147;urgent&#148; case. When I took that title to the Table Office, its staff told me that they were unhealthy&#151;<i> [Interruption.] </i>I mean unhappy&#151;they might be unhealthy, too. They said that they were unhappy with the term &#147;urgent&#148; and that it was not a parliamentary term. What could better illustrate the difficulties of reforming this place?</p>

 No, there is no &#147;but&#148;. It is unwise for us to try to score political points off one another on these issues, and it is dangerous for anybody to claim moral superiority. I simply say to the whole House that those who are tempted to throw rocks either down the corridor or at other parties in this House should realise that we all inhabit an exquisite, Victorian, neo-Gothic house of glass. Every time we cast aspersions on other politicians, those aspersions are applied to us in our constituencies, however inappropriately. It is public perception that is important.</p>

 Will the hon. Gentleman deal also with the question of constitutional reform, which is implicit in the motion? The issues of standards and conduct to which he refers are matched by, if not less than, the problem of whether this is becoming a sham Parliament.</p>

<p><a name="st_o310"><a name="09020227000410"><a name="90202-0012.htm_spnew5"><a name="09020227000808"><b>Mr. Heath:</b>
 There are all sorts of constitutional issues, and the hon. Gentleman has a particular viewpoint on one of them. The perception outside is that politics is not being conducted in the way that it should be, and that we in this House and in the body politic generally are not clearly free from the taint of partiality that affects all of us. That is very dangerous, but more than that there is a perception that our political structures are not fit for purpose or serving the country well. That is where the thrust for constitutional reform comes from.</p>

There was palpable relief that for once, the reports over the past week were about things down that end, not here. That is a wrong-headed relief, because when there is damage to the reputation of politics, it affects all of us. The reputations of all of us are at stake. If the other House does not operate with credibility, it cannot properly perform the role that it is required to perform in our constitutional arrangements.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o141"><a name="90202-0012.htm_para8"><a name="09020227000412">We therefore need to be concerned, as I know are many hon. Members, and noble Members in the other place who are honourable in their intent, about sorting matters out. Are there not inherent problems, however, with this mish-mash or half-reform that we have left in the other place? We still have 92 hereditaries who are there by accident of birth&#151;never mind the pretend elections among that exclusive franchise. Uniquely among all Parliaments, we have people who are there&#151;</p>

allegedly prepared to change the law for cash in their hands. To me, as to many peers, that is outrageous. Furthermore, however, we have as Members of the House of Lords a convicted perjurer, a convicted fraudster and a convicted fire raiser. What a rum crew we have making laws for this country. We also have four peers who do not choose to be resident in the United Kingdom for tax purposes. They do not choose to pay the taxes that the rest of us pay, but they choose to make the laws that the rest of us have to live with. Two of them made solemn pledges that they would become resident for tax purposes&#151;pledges which, since they have been elevated, they have chosen to ignore.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman and his party make a big play of the fact that everybody who makes laws in this country should pay taxes in this country. That is a principle I can support, but can he tell me whether that extends to European Commissioners and Members of the European Parliament, who make 80 per cent. of the laws of this country, but who, as far as I am aware, do not pay any taxes in this country?</p>

 Leaving Europe aside&#151;[Hon. Members: &#147;Hooray!&#148;]&#151;I agree with the thrust of the hon.

One of the tax exiles in the other place is funding campaigning in marginal constituencies to the tune of tens of thousands of pounds, to get a political advantage in a way that the public would perceive as totally wrong. What does the hon. Gentleman think about that?</p>

 Order. I am beginning to have some forebodings about the way this debate is going. I should remind hon.

Only factual matters can be referred to on the Floor of the House. I think the House will do itself a service in the country if we are seen to conduct this debate in a sober and serious way, rather than in the rollicking manner in which it has been conducted so far.</p>

 I agree, Mr. Deputy Speaker, which is why I was very careful not to cast aspersions on any particular peer.

Indeed, there are intimations that they have agreed to them. The Lord Chancellor was a very busy man over the weekend, writing columns in various newspapers saying he was minded to do this, that and the other. I rather hoped he might come to the House today when there was a debate on the subject and tell us what he proposed to do. Instead, however, he chose to send the Deputy Leader of the House of Commons, the hon. Member for Rhondda (Chris Bryant)&#151;</p>

 Yes, unpaid. I mean no disrespect to the hon.

One of them is that there should be the power to expel and suspend. It is extraordinary that that was discussed 10 years ago and still has not been brought into force. Another is that the House of Lords Appointments Commission should be on a statutory basis.

The Government are completely wrong; we cannot achieve what we want to do in putting right what is wrong in this country without democratic structures that support and enable reform.

We know that, although I suspect that we have less disagreement at this end of the corridor. I make no secret of the fact that we have disagreement at the other end. All parties have members who disagree&#151;those who wish, for reasons of their own, to stick with a system that they believe to be either in the national interest or their own interest. When somebody has been appointed a peer, it is astonishing how quickly they consider that the system that appointed them must be an exceedingly good one, because it had the perspicacity to put them on to the red leather seats. However, I fundamentally disagree with that view. At some stage we have to confront the issues. We have to put the argument and let those who disagree do so and lose the argument.</p>

We have to look at Commons reform as well, which is why the point made by the right hon. Gentleman is so important. We have to make this House more effective. Why on earth do we not yet have a business Committee? We waste time on inconsequential measures, but when there are really important matters before the House, such as the Report stage of a big Bill when Members want to say what they need on behalf of their constituents, they are unable to do so because of some ridiculous programme motion that does not take into account the gravity or importance of the measure.</p>

Why are we so poor at scrutinising public expenditure? The nadir for this Parliament was in November&#151;the supplementary estimate that spent &#163;37 billion of taxpayers&#146; money. What happened? We had a short debate when about only 12 Members were in the Chamber. We could not table amendments or apply proper scrutiny. That is not what people send us to the House to do&#151;allow the Government to spend eye-wateringly large amounts of money on a rubber stamp, on the nod, without proper scrutiny.

We should have had agreement; it was within our grasp to have proper caps on donations and on expenditure, to reduce the ridiculous arms war in election spending and put things on a sensible footing.

Then, those on the Government Benches were too scared to take the proposal forward without the Conservatives, so it was abandoned. What do we have instead?

<p><a name="stpa_o166"><a name="90202-0013.htm_para15"><a name="09020235000023">Ordinary oral questions to Ministers and our tradition of allowing interventions in speeches, which I have not noticed in any other Parliament, mean that those in power are held robustly to account. Only last year, we made that regime even tougher by introducing topical questions, thereby allowing Members to ask Ministers completely open questions on any subject. I think that all hon. Members would agree that that has been a significant innovation.</p>

 Will the Minister reflect on the House&#146;s legislative powers? He knows of the widespread concern about hon. Members&#146; inability to seek to amend and debate major Bills&#146; new clauses and amendments on Report. We shall consider two criminal justice Bills that contain nearly 10 parts on average. We will never get through 10 groups of amendments in a day. As a measure of his and the Government&#146;s commitment to parliamentary scrutiny of the Executive, will he ensure that there is enough time to debate all those groups of amendments?</p>

 The hon. Gentleman has asked me that question before, and, doubtless, he will ask me it again. I will try to give the same answer as I gave last time. The truth is that the most important thing that the Government can do is not to introduce Bills until they are thoroughly prepared, to ensure that they do not suddenly choose to introduce additional elements to Bills halfway through their progress&#151;in particular, to Bills that look somewhat like Christmas-tree Bills&#151;and to make sure that the amendments that they table are genuinely concessionary and meet the concerns that Opposition or, indeed, Government Members raised in Committee. It is also true that we sometimes need additional time to fulfil the duty of scrutiny for Bills on Report. That is why, for instance, the next major Bill that is coming up for consideration on Report is the Political Parties and Elections Bill, for which we have allowed two days on Report.</p>

 There must be a degree of consensus in the House that reform of the House, let alone of Parliament as a whole, is necessary. Does the Minister agree that we should tackle the Whips&#146; system? Although the system may be necessary, it is overused. In particular, on questions that relate to consideration on Report or in Committee, more free votes would enable, if enforced by Standing Orders, Members of Parliament to express their opinions. Ultimately, the final debates on a Bill could be whipped in accordance with the manifesto.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman makes a point that I have often heard. Clearly, there are occasions when, by tradition, all the political parties have offered free votes, particularly on matters of conscience. However, I have a majority of 16,000, not because I am such a wonderful person that the people of the Rhondda suddenly decided that they would vote for me. The truth is that the vast majority of them vote Labour because they have done so historically and they want a Labour  <br>

 I am grateful to the Minister for giving way; he has been generous in doing so. I agree that, so far, the introduction of topical questions has been of benefit to the House, but they should not be distorted or polluted by the continued interference of Opposition Front Benchers in the process. In my view, topical questions should be principally, if not exclusively, for the benefit of Back Benchers to challenge the Government.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman makes a point that was made in the original Committee report that suggested topical debates and topical questions; they were intended to enable Back Benchers to have more time and more opportunity to question and scrutinise the Government. As some Opposition Front Benchers have not wanted to give notice of what their questions will be about, they have chosen only to ask topical questions, thereby sometimes crowding out Back Benchers. However, Mr. Speaker is very keen to ensure that Back Benchers have their fair crack of the whip.</p>

 One of the issues that comes up in the House from time to time and at Question Time when the Minister or the Leader of the House is answering is the time that it takes for written questions to receive a reply. Some Departments manage to answer 80 per cent. of questions on the named day; other Departments&#151;for instance, the Ministry of Defence&#151;manage to answer only 20 per cent. on the named day. Respect for the House will help to generate respect outside the House, and the hon. Gentleman could deal with that matter himself.</p>

That is why in every era we need to restate our high ideals. When the Nolan Committee produced its report in 1995, it pointed to seven principles that it saw as vital in public life and that have since been included in the code of conduct. They are worth repeating&#151;selflessness, integrity, objectivity, accountability, openness, honesty and leadership. It is also why Parliament must always be ripe for reform.</p>

 There can be no doubt on either side of the House that both Houses of Parliament need to be reformed urgently and brought up to the standards of the 21st century. As servants of the people and as legislators, we must set an example in all our doings&#151;in our dealings with taxpayers&#146; money, in the way we do business in Parliament and in the way in which we operate and work within the political process.</p>

Public confidence in politicians&#151;by which I mean parliamentarians, Members of the European Parliament and local councillors&#151;is at an all-time low, as is confidence in our political institutions. Let there be no misunderstanding: the current malaise is not a passing fashion or a temporary aberration of the political process. It is a matter of very serious concern, and it should be a source of concern for all politicians.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman is right to say that we have much to do to earn the respect of the public, both here and locally. However, will he accept that there are some encouraging signs that, at local government level, there is much greater satisfaction with certain councils than there has been for many years? I am not making a party political point, because that applies to councils run by all parties. As the Deputy Leader of the House said, there is often considerable satisfaction with individual Members of Parliament and their performance. While the hon. Gentleman is right to encourage us, I hope that he will not downplay the progress and support that exists in many places.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman makes two valid points. While there are many well-meaning councillors and much is being done that is worthy of credit, let us not delude ourselves. It does not take much for local councillors to acquire a bad reputation, especially when it comes to postal votes and the rigging of them. I shall come to that issue later. The hon. Gentleman also mentioned individual Members of Parliament, and it is fair to say that the vast majority do their work as diligently as they can, they claim their expenses honestly and fairly, and they should have nothing to worry about. It is only a small number who earn the bad reputation that we have, and we must address that.</p>

 I have news for the hon. Gentleman. The hon. Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath) mentioned keeping this debate consensual and said that he did not wish to make it partisan, but I am afraid that I will break rank with that particular pledge. I have certain issues to address, and I will not be taking the side of the Liberal Democrats.</p>

We must have full transparency in all our dealings with money, and proper accountability for all that we do in our role as parliamentarians. By doing so, we may make some progress. The hon. Member for Luton, North (Kelvin Hopkins) said that confidence was at a dangerously low level, but I hope that if we make reforms we will be able to regain some of that respect and confidence, both for ourselves and in the political system.</p>

 Some good research shows that the only thing that correlates with low and decreasing turnout at elections is the growing similarity between the philosophies of the political parties. That is a fundamental problem that we have not addressed, and it is up to the parties, as much as Parliament, to do something about it. Does the hon. Gentleman agree?</p>

 I certainly believe that there is a fair amount of difference between the parties, but we will have to wait until the manifestos are produced for the general election. It will be for the electorate to decide not only which party they wish to support in policy terms, but in which political group they have the confidence to run the country properly. It is not only an issue of policies, but of the public judging our characters and who is best to serve the country.</p>

 Approving remarks have been made about the new standards regimes in parish councils and elsewhere as a possible model for reform here, but does the hon. Gentleman agree that some of those standards boards have become a way for people in a local community to grind axes and pursue vendettas? Some of those boards are over the top. The Secretary of State for Health, with a budget of &#163;100,000 million, has much less responsibility for standards than does the chairman of a parish council with a budget of &#163;10,000. The whole thing is out of kilter.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman makes some valid points. When he talks about the standards boards, it is important to recognise that some local councillors are unfairly penalised.

 The answer to that question will be given by whoever is at this Dispatch Box when that Bill comes before the House. I shall certainly not give the hon. Gentleman an answer to a question on a future debate; I would much rather concentrate on the motion that he and his party have tabled in the debate at hand than discuss matters that are not on the Order Paper at the moment.</p>

It is not only the issue of finance that brings this place into disrepute; it is also the way in which politicians and Parliament operate. For example, if a party gives a manifesto pledge to hold a referendum on the European Union constitution, that party&#151;the Labour party&#151;should honour that pledge when it is elected back into government. It demeaned the Prime Minister and the office that he holds when he said that the Lisbon treaty was a different document. This was particularly highlighted by the fact that many of his European Union counterparts said that the Lisbon treaty was a European constitution in all but name.</p>

That issue comes up regularly at business questions, and the Leader of the House gives us many assurances&#151;as have her predecessors&#151;that she will take it on board and pass it on to her Cabinet colleagues, yet we still find that, week in and week out, announcements are made outside the House rather than here, where Ministers can be held to account by the parliamentarians who were elected to hold them to account.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o204"><a name="90202-0015.htm_para20"><a name="09020235000118">The matter of written parliamentary questions was raised in a point relating to the consistency and timing of replies to those questions. I suggest that the issue of proper answers should also be addressed. It is absurd for the Government to give answers such as, &#147;We do not hold the information in the format requested.&#148; If that is the case, they should give the information in whatever  <br>

format exists, rather than withholding the information completely. The former Leader of the House, now the Secretary of State for Justice, often said that one of the problems was that too many questions were being tabled. But if the questions were answered properly in the first instance, there would be no need for the huge number of supplementaries that have to follow. It is bad enough that written questions do not get proper answers, but it is even worse now that the Government simply do not bother to give any answers at all. At the end of the 2007-08 parliamentary Session, nearly 500 questions, which had been tabled for more than a month, received no reply at all&#151;not even the usual Prorogation reply.</p>

 Does the hon. Gentleman share my view that it is appalling that there is an industry of planted questions? Will he give the House an undertaking that those on the Conservative Front Bench do not do that, or that, if they do, they will stop it? This industry of planted questions being hawked around every day is a debasement of Parliament, and it denies the people who are the architects and authors of their own questions the opportunity of succeeding in getting them on to the Order Paper.</p>

 The Conservatives certainly do not do that, because we are not in government and we do not have to take questions every day, as Ministers do. The point that the hon. Gentleman makes was highlighted when, during Prime Minister&#146;s questions, the Prime Minister stood up and started to answer a question before the Labour Back Bencher had even asked it. The question had clearly been planted, and the Prime Minister clearly knew the answer. That gave away the tactics with which this Prime Minister operates.</p>

 There cannot be a Member of this House who does not know that Parliament&#151;and this Chamber in particular&#151;needs to recapture its relevance to this day and age and to our politics.

The present relationship of dominance and subservience between the Executive and the legislature serves neither institution well. I make no distinction here between the parties.

and Britain ruled the waves. Those days&#151;if ever they existed&#151;are long gone, and we now need to work together to find a way forward to ensure that our Parliament and politics are relevant to people. There needs to be a new settlement, and one that commands support across the whole political spectrum. Under such a settlement, the Government would maximise Parliament&#146;s contribution and Parliament would respect the need of Government to pass their laws after a process that, I hope, would improve them.</p>

MPs sometimes pretend that they run the country; Governments sometimes pretend that they lead a healthy democracy. If we can consign those self-delusions to the rubbish bin of history, we will at least have a chance to restore public respect and interest in our democracy and Parliament, to improve government and governance in the United Kingdom, and to recreate the respect not only for Parliament as an institution, but for MPs as important individuals with a central and serious contribution to make.</p>

 I do not think such an arrangement necessary; willpower is the most important thing that we need in this Chamber. As was mentioned earlier, we also need the self-confidence to take the responsibility. I do not propose that the monopoly politics that the Executive have enjoyed should somehow be shifted over so that Parliament has a monopoly position.

give Government their laws after serious scrutiny, should expect to control the rest of its business. That could happen if the House elected its own business Committee that reported to the Floor every week. To remove any residual temptation that Governments might feel to influence the outcome of such an election, there would be a secret ballot. Imagine a parliamentary timetable this week in which we agreed and discussed a budget amendment on the recent bail-out of the banks and we scrutinised the impact of energy companies&#146; policies on the most vulnerable in our constituencies. Imagine if we thought through the concept of &#147;British jobs for British people&#148; and we pondered and were careful and thoughtful about the relationship between the United Kingdom and United States following the advent of a new President. Such a Parliament would be worth listening to, watching and covering&#151;and, for electors, it would be worth influencing. All of a sudden, Parliament would mean something and it would recapture the place that it should have.</p>

The same could be said of Public Bill Committees. If they were run effectively, they could draw on the immense experience of parliamentarians from all parts of the House, who could create and use their own networks to involve their electors and improve the law. That is why we have Public Bill Committees in the first place. Governments and civil servants should not fear the process, but use it to pick the brains of parliamentary representatives and the public alike.</p>

We have heard a lot tonight about the need for people outside to have confidence in us, but we also need to have confidence in ourselves. We could consider many other reforms openly and transparently, debating them in the Chamber and deciding the way forward. There should be the right of the House to reconvene itself, not the right of the Executive to reconvene the Parliament that should  be holding them to account. We could debate each  week&#146;s most popular early-day motion and make  Question Times more topical and conversational. We could use the Chamber&#146;s dead hours much more imaginatively. The House could decide again on electronic voting or reconsider this sterile seating plan that defies debate.</p>

As everyone in the Chamber knows, the truth is that Parliament, as a forum for the nation and for holding the Government to account, is not fit for purpose. The public&#146;s view of MPs is at an all-time low and power is sclerotically over-centralised in Whitehall. The moment is approaching when the Government and Parliament must change and reinvent themselves as the leading parts of a revived and modern UK democracy. That chance comes along very rarely, but the House should seize it for the good of our democracy.   <br>

 I want to concentrate on the &#147;constitutional renewal programme&#148; aspect of the lengthy motion because I am disappointed that, after 12 years of a Government whom I support, there has been little to show in the way of genuine constitutional reform. Indeed, our manifesto in 1997 made it clear that we were intent on reforming the House of Lords and said that we would introduce proposals to do that. It does not matter how much Ministers try to get round that; we have not fulfilled the manifesto commitment. That is only one example.</p>

Let me share something that grates on me. I left school at 16, and many contemporaries of mine have turned up on the Labour Front Bench over the past 12 years. They did not go out to work at the same time as me, but went to university, and they peddled some of the most God almighty rubbish in the late 1960s. They were radical and all that, but when they came here, they became deeply conservative. Some of us have political anchorage and we believed from the beginning in tackling the House of Lords and making Parliament more responsive. However, those former radicals have shifted to an establishment position. Even at this late stage, matters can be corrected. It is not sufficient for the Prime Minister to say that he has a programme for constitutional reform. The test is whether he implements it with dispatch. The jury is still out.</p>

When we came to office, I asked the Government whether they would amend the anomaly in the law that prevented someone who had been ordained as a Roman Catholic priest but had given up the priesthood from standing for Parliament. The Labour Minister responsible said no. Then the Labour party selected a candidate who had been a Roman Catholic priest and wanted to stand for Parliament, and we introduced a law to allow him to stand.

about needing votes from Scotland and so on. I understand those arguments, but I say to Front Benchers that they are in denial. If they do not begin to address the West Lothian question, somebody else will, on different terms. It will not go away. One can argue for a time that there was a settlement for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, but simply to stop there is madness. The question must be tackled&#151;the sooner, the better. The very Union, which we are all committed to maintaining, will be imperilled by not addressing the West Lothian question.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman has much support, often much less vocal than it should be.

If Prime Ministers have the power to make people Ministers, those Ministers should be answerable to Parliament, they should appear and be answerable in both Houses, and if they are the architect of legislation, they should pilot it through both Houses, rather than somebody acting as a parrot, which is in nobody&#146;s interest. Such Ministers should be temporary. They were put into Parliament only as Ministers, and when they cease to be Ministers, their membership should cease. They should not remain in Parliament in perpetuity.</p>

Many people are appointed to the House of Lords and give good service left, right and centre over a long period, but they go on and they go on and they go on. I say this in all seriousness, although people sometimes treat the subject with frivolity. I remember some time ago that I was in my room right at the top, above the House. There was a peer, a very distinguished peer who had given long public service, but he had lost his faculties. He was senile and incontinent. A member of the public tackled me and asked, &#147;Can&#146;t you do something about this?&#148; I said, &#147;Madam, I will do what I can, but I have to say to you that he is a legislator.&#148;</p>

If peers go on and on and on and if there is no capacity for them to resign their seat, that will happen. It diminishes our Parliament as well as being deeply hurtful to individuals, who do not know how or when to give up. There should be a cut-off point, as happens in the Canadian Senate, and for judges and so on. That should be addressed.</p>

<p>I am deeply concerned that senior civil servants almost automatically become peers. It is offensive and it is a reward for those who know where the political bodies are buried. Lord Jay, who incidentally is presiding over the appointment of people&#146;s peers, was head of the Foreign Office. He is the man who stopped Jeremy Greenstock publishing his memoirs and tried to stop the former United Kingdom ambassador to Washington publishing his memoirs, but he was prepared to take a peerage and what is more, was elevated to decide who is appropriate to be appointed under&#151;I think it is called the House of Lords Commission, but I call it people&#146;s peers. That is the kind of cosy thing that goes on. There was a man who presided over a disaster in the national health service. He was immediately dismissed, but he also got to sit in the House of Lords. The bigger the mess up, the greater the rewards in this country, and that has to stop.</p>

We should introduce legislation to make a fixed House that I hope will be elected, but if it is not, it should be one with a definite membership, and its membership should not be determined by the patronage of the Leader of the Opposition, the leader of the Liberal party or the Prime Minister. Human nature being what it is, they will always appoint people in their own image and likeness. That is the inevitable consequence&#151;we will be swapping the hereditary principle for a house of clones. It is time that Parliament addressed this matter.

 It is a real pleasure to follow the hon. Member for Thurrock (Andrew Mackinlay), who would top the poll in any secret ballot for Leader of the House.

The previous Lord Chancellor said that we have not a constitutional renewal Bill, but a constitutional retreat Bill. On Lords reform, I remember being told that the first elections to the upper House would take place at the same time as the 2001 general election. Moreover, the hon.

<p><a name="stpa_o236"><a name="90202-0017.htm_para5"><a name="09020235000170">One of the consequences of introducing a tougher regime in this House is that it has led to pressure being applied to other parts of the body politic, and it is helpful to put our disciplinary regime in the broader context of that for Members of the European Parliament, Ministers and members of the other place. Anyone can make a complaint about an MP to the independent Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards. If the complaint raises matters of significance, he will produce a report for my Committee, which we will publish unamended, saying whether or not that complaint is upheld, and we can then propose appropriate punishments, some of which are career-ending. None of the other regimes&#151;neither the ministerial code nor the current code for Members of the upper House&#151;has our features of open access, independent scrutiny, publication of findings and harsh reprisal. The code for MEPs has the most generous of all allowance regimes, with the most relaxed audit trail.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o237"><a name="90202-0017.htm_para6"><a name="09020235000171">The ministerial code is policed by the Prime Minister, who can decide whether to refer a matter to his independent adviser and whether to publish any report. Neither procedure has ever been invoked. I once complained that a Foreign Secretary had broken the ministerial code. My complaint was passed by the Prime Minister to the then Foreign Secretary, who replied to me, saying that he had not broken the code, showing a circularity of process. In the upper House, the complaints procedure has no independent element and limited sanctions. There would be greater confidence in the two other codes if they adopted those features of ours.</p>

Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath) made is to extend the remit of the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards to cover the upper House. That recognises the regulatory strength of our regime. However, the proposal to extend the remit of the commissioner raises questions about the capacity of his office to take on additional work, while at the same time carrying out with due rigour his inquiries into complaints made against Members of this House. The present commissioner is contracted to work four days a week, although I know that he works more than that. If we are going to extend his remit to the House of Lords, which has more Members than our House, there will be questions to do with resources and whether he will be able to deal with all complaints personally.

Those who have read the Committee&#146;s report will have seen that the breach was less serious than the case on which the Committee had previously reported and that it predated that case, so it can hardly be said to have compounded it.

 There has been an extensive discussion of what is wrong, with which I broadly agree, and in the short time available, I just want to make four proposals for reform.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o242"><a name="90202-0017.htm_para11"><a name="09020235000179">The first proposal is that membership of Select Committees, which are the most important channel of accountability, should not be chosen by the Whips, but should be chosen via a secret ballot of Members of the whole House. Indeed, I would go further than that. As many Select Committee reports are extremely good and deserve the attention and decision of the House, there should be a right in a limited number of cases&#151;perhaps four or five a year, subject to prioritisation by the Liaison Committee&#151;for a Select Committee to propose a motion for debate on the Floor of the House, with a vote at the end.

Of course the Government, as the elected party, must have the right to take through their full legislative programme, but there are many other areas of business on which the Government have no direct electoral mandate, and they should be agreed and decided on by this House. I am thinking particularly about choosing subjects for debate in light of the occurrence of major national and international issues.

Just as there are congressional hearings in the United States, there should be confirmation hearings, held by the relevant Select Committee, for all Cabinet appointments nominated by the Prime Minister&#151;and, I would add, for the most important public sector appointments made outside the House. The Prime Minister would, of course, propose the Cabinet appointments, but it would be for Parliament to ratify them&#151;and indeed to recall the appointee if the Select Committee thought it appropriate. There would then be dual accountability&#151;accountability, of course, to the Prime Minister, but also to Parliament.</p>

 This debate is really about a crisis of confidence in politics. If we do nothing about that crisis, it could turn into a crisis of confidence about democracy itself. We face a conjunction of crises. The crisis in the political system is happening at the same time as a crisis in the financial and economic system that threatens people&#146;s jobs and their confidence in the future. We should take very seriously what the hon. Member for Luton, North (Kelvin Hopkins) said: this is a dangerous situation.

that the only people who have access to political power are people with very large sums of money&#151;either their own money, or that of large corporations. They feel politically excluded. It is a feeling that one comes across everywhere, including on the picket lines of places such as the Lindsey oil refinery. Decent people should not have to resort to such measures. Whether or not we agree with what they are calling for, they should be heard here. That feeling of exclusion existed well before the recent revelations about what was going on in the House of Lords. What has happened there simply confirms, in the most dramatic way, what people already believe: that power lies with money and that the only part that ordinary people play in politics is as spectators&#151;of either a tragedy or a farce.</p>

That is why the first imperative is to get big money out of politics. There should be a strict cap on how much money one person can donate to a political party. There should be strict limits on what parties can spend at both the national and local level. No one should be able to buy an election or be seen to be buying an election. Legislators who have been bought or who do not care whether they are seen to have been bought should just be thrown out.</p>

The very idea of an appointed, non-elected second Chamber&#151;a House of patronage and of networking&#151;is an affront to the mass of people who will never have the connections to get there. That is why we should move now, not later&#151;not in due course&#151;to an elected second Chamber, regardless of what that means for the status and self-regard of Members of this House.</p>

Member for Luton, North mentioned that. A form of election that means that a tiny number of electors in a tiny number of seats decides the entire general election is part of the problem of political exclusion. The political system ignores the vast majority of voters nearly all the time. We have lost everything that we had in this place that made us a Parliament&#151;a place to which people would look for their voices to be heard.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o252"><a name="90202-0017.htm_para21"><a name="09020235000190">The most important aspect is the point raised by at least three Members&#151;the hon. Members for Nottingham, North (Mr. Allen) and for Thurrock (Andrew Mackinlay), and the right hon. Member for Oldham, West and Royton (Mr. Meacher): we do not have the power even to set our own agenda. What we discuss here is what is served up to us every day, under Standing Order No. 14, by the Government. That must go. We must take the power back; we must talk about what the people in the country want us to talk about, and not what the Government want to talk about.</p>

 Is the hon. Gentleman going to address the question of guillotines and programming? Exactly what he has said about the question whether there is a connection is demonstrated by the fact that we are simply not debating things properly, and therefore Bills that affect people go through without being discussed in this House.</p>

Friend the Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath) mentioned the &#163;37 billion that was passed in 90 minutes in a debate before Christmas. An example of something worse is the &#163;50 billion that the Government have devoted to the second bank bail-out, which went through using a procedure that completely bypasses this House; the Treasury simply authorises the issue of Treasury bills, the Bank of England creates an account and that is it. We have entirely lost the historical power over expenditure.</p>

 I say to the hon. Member for Cambridge (David Howarth) that hyperbole hardly ever helps in these debates. The debate has been well attended by Members of all parties, and throughout it we have heard shared concern about the issues that face Parliament. There is real determination in all parts of the House to put right things that need to be mended and ensure that we have a Parliament that is respected by the whole nation.</p>

ready to commence section 59 of the Electoral Administration Act 2006 so that we, as parliamentarians, have to report to only one place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o260"><a name="90202-0018.htm_para1"><a name="09020235000203">Several hon. Members referred to the matter of whether we should elect all members of Select Committees and whether we should elect the Chairmen of Select Committees by secret ballot. Although that sometimes seems an attractive option, there is a danger that if the majority vote were always to carry the decision on the membership and Chairman of every Committee, we would not have the independent Committees that we need. The minor parties would suffer most.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o261"><a name="90202-0018.htm_para2"><a name="09020235000204">I say to those who call for a business Committee of the House that they fail to understand the major and significant difference between this House, in which the Government are constituted solely by virtue of their majority, and other Parliaments that operate differently, in which Ministers are often precluded from being members of the legislature. To those who believe that a nirvana might come if we were to have a business Committee, I say that other Parliaments that have such committees have precisely the same complaints about whether there is the right allocation of time and whether individual Back Benchers have their interests met and can make speeches.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o262"><a name="90202-0018.htm_para3"><a name="09020235000205">Some hon. Members suggested that this Government have not been radical enough on constitutional reform. All that I would say is that when the Liberals were in power, they never managed to reform the House of Lords in any way at all. The Conservatives never had any desire to do so, and it is only this Government who have managed to remove the majority of the hereditary peers. It is only by virtue of our work that the Law Lords have been reformed. We are proud to be a Government who have brought forward devolution and freedom of information.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o263"><a name="90202-0018.htm_para4"><a name="09020235000206">My hon. Friend the Member for Thurrock (Andrew Mackinlay) demanded that I agree with every single thing that he said, but I am afraid that I am unable to do that. He said that I have fallen among thieves by virtue of my membership of the Government. Well, there is honour among thieves, and the truth is that this Government are committed to the reform of Parliament. Nobody should have a job for life, we should have a smaller Chamber and we have laid out a clear path to reform.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o264"><a name="90202-0018.htm_para5"><a name="09020235000207">I am glad to have my right hon. Friends the Leader of the House and the Lord Chancellor by my side as I point out to hon. Members who have said that we are not being diligent enough in bringing forward constitutional reform that we committed ourselves in the Queen&#146;s Speech to introducing a constitutional renewal Bill later this year. I believe that the whole House is united in wanting to protect its reputation and in its determination to do everything necessary to ensure that that happens.</p>

 I am delighted to have secured this debate about Eastham, as I feel strongly that it has been dealt a series of unfair blows recently, and I am pleased to have so many colleagues around to support me. Every community needs to retain certain basic facilities, which need to be preserved and protected from planning and other decisions that threaten to damage them. Any community needs an essential core. Eastham is characterised by being a pleasant and normal English community. It is not an inner city area. It is not rural. It does not depend on any one industry. In many respects, it is a microcosm of our society. My central motivation in leading this debate tonight is to challenge decisions that have been taken and to try to ensure that Eastham and other communities like it do not continue to be the victims of chance.</p>

 Like my hon. Friend, I am a great fan of Eastham. As a boy, I used to cycle down by the locks there. Will he tells us a little about the general environment, because I do not think that people understand what a picturesque place Eastham is?</p>

 I am grateful to my hon. Friend; that is absolutely true, and I shall deal with that point in those specific terms in just a moment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o274"><a name="90202-0018.htm_para15"><a name="09020235000499">Local authorities should have a vision for the protection and preservation of and comprehensive development strategies for communities such as Eastham. Decisions that do not act to Eastham&#146;s advantage should be taken within a framework of detailed local knowledge and in accordance with the needs of local people, rather than by dint of the vagaries of chance, ad hoc actions and the whims of others, without heeding the consequences.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o275"><a name="90202-0018.htm_para16"><a name="09020235000500">As my hon. Friend suggested, it might be useful to provide an overview of Eastham&#146;s place in Wirral and its history. It has a population of about 12,000. Much of it is a green belt area, stretching from the border of the Bromborough industrial estate to the historic Manchester ship canal, the entrance to which is in Eastham at Queen Elizabeth dock. The original village of Eastham, around which more modern housing has been developed, is one of the oldest villages on the Wirral peninsula. It has been inhabited since Anglo-Saxon times and was mentioned in the Domesday Book. St. Mary&#146;s church, which is at the heart of the village, is still active today, of course. The closure of its primary school some while ago, however, did not augur well for the sort of development of which I will speak.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o276"><a name="90202-0018.htm_para17"><a name="09020235000501">A report in the parish magazine for September 1874 quotes Nathaniel Hawthorne&#151;who was then the American Consul in Liverpool, as my hon. Friends will know&#151;as describing Eastham as</p>
<a name="90202-0018.htm_brev6"><a name="09020235000585"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;the finest old English village I have ever seen, with rural aspect, utterly unlike anything in America, in its midst a venerable church with a most venerable air.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o277"><a name="90202-0018.htm_para18"><a name="09020235000502">Much of the old village remains, with a mediaeval street pattern, irregularly clustered period buildings and a distinctive character.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o278"><a name="90202-0018.htm_para19"><a name="09020235000503">Eastham village conservation area was designated in April 1974, and Wirral metropolitan borough council has specific policy objectives for it: to maintain the sense of separation from the surrounding built-up area through the retention of open spaces around the village core; to preserve the setting and sense of enclosure afforded by boundary walls, hedges and mature landscaping; and to preserve the visual setting of the village cross, war memorial and the church of St. Mary, with its yard and lichgate. Although I welcome that limited protection for the historic village, what is needed is a comprehensive policy framework for development in the whole area.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o279"><a name="90202-0018.htm_para20"><a name="09020235000504">Eastham, like many other communities, has a small number of the key facilities that make it up. There is a much-valued day centre, which provides vital facilities for adults with learning and physical disabilities, and the excellent Lyndale school, which specialises in the education of children with profound and multiple learning difficulties. It is a centre of excellence. Last October, with my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families, I saw the admirable work carried out by its talented and committed teaches.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o280"><a name="90202-0018.htm_para21"><a name="09020235000505">Other local amenities include the usual selection of caf&#233;s and shops. A new medical centre is being developed, and there are facilities such as a rugby club, an Air Training Corps site and allotments. One of Eastham&#146;s most treasured aspects is its country park, which is central to its character and a popular attraction. Home to a huge range of wildlife, it is a local treasure. It is also an important educational resource. Every year, park rangers lead more than 3,000 schoolchildren on activities, thus nurturing an interest in and understanding of nature and their environment that will stay with them into their adult life. Despite the loss of the Church primary school, good mainstream schooling is provided at Heygarth, Millfields, Mendell and Raeburn primary schools. South Wirral high school provides excellent secondary education.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o281"><a name="90202-0018.htm_para22"><a name="09020235000506">But there are problems. Eastham gets little by way of funding. It suffers, like other areas that are neither rural nor inner city, from a lack of funding streams. My constituency as a whole and Eastham in particular is heterogeneous, rather than uniform in character. Notwithstanding the Government&#146;s investment in communities that has surpassed that of any other Government, areas that may be classified as suburban&#151;although Eastham would not see itself in that light&#151;are in danger of falling between two stools and thus missing out on the resources that they need. Urban and rural areas benefit from policies, lobbies and organisations adept at getting the most out of the bidding system. Areas such as Eastham suffer as a result and do not benefit greatly from, for example, neighbourhood renewal, Sure Start or other such improvement funds. It is also a long way, and is seen as such, from the town hall in Wallasey.</p>

The youth service and the police tackle the problem, but several shops in Clifton avenue, for example, have long been unoccupied, and have attracted antisocial behaviour and vandalism. Over the years I have corresponded about the matter with Wirral   <br>

Partnership Homes, the council and the police, and I have recently been assured that they are working together to improve the situation. I hope that they are.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o283"><a name="90202-0019.htm_para1"><a name="09020235000508">A new Tesco is to be opened on the Eastham Rake. In some ways that is welcome, but residents are worried about the threat to local small shops. Many of Eastham&#146;s most valuable assets need better funding, or face an uncertain future. Unfortunately, even the prized country park is not immune: it faces the loss of a park ranger as a result of cuts owing to Wirral&#146;s economic situation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o284"><a name="90202-0019.htm_para2"><a name="09020235000509">The day centre is experiencing a number of problems. The local authority is requesting that its privately funded minibuses be used for transport at other smaller centres elsewhere in Wirral. I recently met representatives of the local parents association who believe, I think reasonably, that the centre is the benchmark for adult day services in the area, and that full use of their own minibuses is essential to enable it to provide the best possible service.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o285"><a name="90202-0019.htm_para3"><a name="09020235000510">To add insult to injury, the local authority has stopped funding fuel for the minibuses. The parents association tells me that funding for the fuel is now being provided by them and by carers at the centre. That penny-pinching is ill-advised. Worse still, the centre may be under threat of closure following the council&#146;s strategic asset review.</p>

 It is a pleasure to be able to intervene on my hon. Friend, who does a remarkable job on behalf of his constituency and is a good neighbour of mine. He mentioned the strategic asset review. Does he agree that the review has problems, not least because it singled out Eastham library for closure when it was not on the list and swapped it with another library on the night of the decision? The same happened to Woodchurch library in very similar circumstances.</p>

 I am, of course, focusing on Eastham, but I am focusing on it as an exemplar of other communities. The council&#146;s action in not including certain libraries in the review and consultation process and then closing them is wrong in both form and substance. I shall discuss that in some detail shortly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o286"><a name="90202-0019.htm_para4"><a name="09020235000514">Lyndale school is invaluable, but it is a primary school, and at the age of 11 its pupils must move to a different school that will not offer the same degree of specialisation. Teachers and governors believe that that is disruptive to children&#146;s development, and that Lyndale should teach children up to the school leaving age. Such an extension of what is a highly valuable institution would be very welcome.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o287"><a name="90202-0019.htm_para5"><a name="09020235000515">In 2008, it was announced that Heygarth and Millfields primary schools were to lose their crossing patrols. After writing to Wirral&#146;s chief executive, I was informed that the council was reconsidering its position. Although I have emphasised to the chief executive the importance of ensuring road safety outside those schools in particular, I am not going to hold my breath.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o288"><a name="90202-0019.htm_para6"><a name="09020235000516">Many Eastham residents find employment at Vauxhall. This is an issue close to the heart of my hon. Friend the Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston (Andrew Miller). Like the rest of the motor industry, Vauxhall faces challenges, which may mean challenges to my constituents&#146; employment. We hope that the new Astra&#151;which, I believe, will be produced in September&#151;will alleviate the problem, but nothing is certain in the current climate. My constituents are uncertain, for instance, about the plans of Peel Holdings for land around Queen Elizabeth dock and for a tidal power scheme.</p>

For many years I have campaigned to protect the campus from closure. In response to a question from me, the Minister called on the college to look again at the hole in the community that would be left by the removal of the campus.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o290"><a name="90202-0019.htm_para8"><a name="09020235000518">Carlett Park may be a casualty of the current and historic trend towards shifting the focus of the majority of Wirral&#146;s facilities to the north of the peninsula, leaving my constituents in the south&#151;and to some extent in the west&#151;devoid of key amenities. The centre of gravity in terms of population and politics in the north results in many in the south feeling hard done by and deprived.</p>

 My hon. Friend is known on Merseyside as a doughty champion of his constituency. As someone who used to teach at Carlett Park&#151;and without interfering in the internal politics of further education in the area&#151;I know that it had a very good reputation when I was there, although I suspect that I did not contribute greatly to that. It still has a good reputation and it would indeed be regrettable if it could not continue as a centre of further education.</p>

 My right hon. Friend makes the point much better than I was doing that the college is at the heart of the community. It cannot be judged solely in day to day terms because it is part of the history of the area and of Eastham in particular. People who have been educated very well there over the years, thanks to my right hon. Friend and others, greatly value its presence. It is emblematic of Eastham.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o291"><a name="90202-0019.htm_para9"><a name="09020235000521">The closure of Carlett Park was not always inevitable, but sadly the college has almost made it so. Steps could have been taken to ensure that it adapted to remain relevant and to survive. It should have focused on engaging with local businesses, working together to ensure that local people could be educated locally in a way that provided them with the skills they need for our modern economy. The proximity of Carlett Park to the large and progressive companies in the Wirral international business park offered obvious opportunities for that kind of co-operation. Sadly, that has not been done and if the campus closes it will contribute to removing the heart of the community. I have told the college repeatedly that its facilities are about community as well as education, but it falls on deaf ears.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o292"><a name="90202-0019.htm_para10"><a name="09020235000522">In recent times, Eastham has been threatened by two planning proposals, which have caused considerable anger and concern in the community.

for a grant to invest in a gasification plant which has now been put on hold following widespread local opposition. Proposals remain, however, for a Biossence plant that would convert waste into energy. Recent ministerial assurances about air quality will not go far enough to satisfy the range of concerns felt by my constituents on this issue. These include noise pollution as well as air pollution, disturbance to the local environment and safety. I have made a range of representations on this subject to the chief executive of Wirral council and the chief executives of the companies. I have asked parliamentary questions and met Ministers, and I have also offered local campaigning organisations meetings and the possibility of presenting a petition to Parliament.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o293"><a name="90202-0019.htm_para11"><a name="09020235000523">In response to these threats, my constituents in Eastham have been organised and vocal in defence of their neighbourhood. The Eastham Village Preservation Association, founded in 1969, has fought hard on several issues, including those I have mentioned. More recently, residents have also formed Eastham Fights Back, which continues to voice their opposition forcefully.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o294"><a name="90202-0019.htm_para12"><a name="09020235000524">The most recent blow to be dealt to the people of Eastham is the closure of its library and one-stop shop housed in the same building, which I had the pleasure of opening in August 2005. I welcome the retention of such facilities in Bromborough, but they will be much less accessible for Eastham residents. The closure of the library is deeply concerning to me on two levels. The first is that the council may have acted without due process, failing entirely to consult the public. At best that could be unconstitutional, but at worst it could be maladministration. It is certainly unprincipled and demonstrative of a lack of vision.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o295"><a name="90202-0019.htm_para13"><a name="09020235000525">Eastham library is to be closed as part of Wirral council&#146;s strategic asset review, involving 11 libraries and more than 20 other facilities. This library&#151;as was the case with Woodchurch, I think&#151;was not earmarked for closure but was added later, after the consultation process. There is at present no statutory requirement for consultation by local authorities before closing libraries and they are not obliged to tell the Department for Culture, Media and Sport that they are doing so. I am testing out what sanction the community has against that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o296"><a name="90202-0019.htm_para14"><a name="09020235000526">Although I understand the local authority&#146;s need to balance the budget and to avoid high increases in council tax, especially at a time when families across the country are finding it difficult to make ends meet, Wirral council has none the less received above inflation increases in support from central Government every year since 1997. It is also worth noting that the library has received investment of more than &#163;300,000 over three years. Its closure thus does not seem to make economic, or any other, sense. As a result, I have tabled questions to the DCMS and the Department for Communities and Local Government in order to establish whether provisions are in place to discourage such closures and how those closures fit into the broad framework of Government policy on libraries.</p>

involved in the library. Would my hon. Friend like to come to Wigan with some of his residents to have a look at what we have done? He could then approach the Government to reach an alternative solution to save his libraries and his communities.</p>

 That is an extraordinarily helpful suggestion. A number of assets have been proposed for community transfer, but no preparation has been made for that and no guidance has been given. No packs have been handed out and no explanation has been given of how to set up a trust or whatever is needed to run such facilities. No opinion has been offered on what happens when one has managed to raise the revenue to run the facility but is suddenly faced with a high capital cost. What on earth is a community group running a local facility to do if the roof goes? That is the sort of lesson that I could learn, with others, from visiting my right hon. Friend&#146;s constituency.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o297"><a name="90202-0019.htm_para15"><a name="09020235000529">Although it is not legally binding, the DCMS expects there to be a well-publicised consultation with the local community over a minimum of six to eight weeks. That most certainly did not take place in the case of Eastham. The second cause for concern is that Eastham library is a valuable asset. The flood of correspondence that I have received from alarmed constituents, angry and shocked at the decision, is evidence that it is used and valued by young and old alike. The loss to the community is obvious. Wirral council&#146;s website lists the library as one of few key amenities on the Mill Park estate, which is the largest council estate in the ward. The many groups who benefited from that local community library will be worst affected by the closure.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o298"><a name="90202-0019.htm_para16"><a name="09020235000530">Communities such as Eastham are local, and the facilities that make up their heart need to be local, too. Eastham deserves not to be merely subject to the function of chance and all manner of random decisions, regardless of their adverse effect. Instead, its local authority and others should adopt a strategic view. The catalogue of recent events that I have outlined, on top of the loss of a post office some while ago, demonstrates that that is all sadly lacking and my constituents are suffering as a result.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o299"><a name="90202-0019.htm_para17"><a name="09020235000531">Eastham is diverse both in terms of architecture and landscape and, crucially, in terms of the needs of its population. A comprehensive strategy must be put in place that takes into account that diversity and the proud heritage of the community. Such a strategy should, among other things, take account of the current and historic bias towards the north of the peninsula.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o300"><a name="90202-0019.htm_para18"><a name="09020235000532">I call on Wirral council to review its decisions on the closure of 11 libraries, including tragically that of Higher Bebington, and the loss of more than 20 other facilities, taking due account of the effect on communities. I ask the DCMS to consider the effect of closing those 11 libraries at a stroke. I ask the council and the Department, together with the DCLG, to look at the processes involved in the closure of Eastham&#151;and, indeed, Woodchurch&#151;which seem to be on the borders of immorality and illegality.</p>

I recall a debate that he and I had a couple of months ago on the important matter of allotments, in which he advanced the case on behalf of his constituents with considerable skill. He has done the same tonight.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o302"><a name="90202-0019.htm_para20"><a name="09020235000539">My hon. Friend will know that, unfortunately, I am unable to give him the detailed answers that he is seeking to each of the points that he has raised. That is because the issue to which he refers ultimately needs to be decided and resolved locally. That does not mean, however, that I want to dismiss his overall argument. Quite the contrary: I completely agree with it. Tonight, he made a compelling case for preserving the local strengths and resources in Eastham, which are important sources of pride for the local community. I absolutely agree with his central argument that local authorities must have a strategic vision for the future, that local people should be central to shaping and influencing that vision, and that all decisions must be taken with reference to that overarching strategic plan. In that context, let me address the points that he has raised.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o303"><a name="90202-0019.htm_para21"><a name="09020235000540">I want to start by making it clear that I absolutely agree that no community should be, to use my hon. Friend&#146;s vivid term, the &#147;victim of chance&#148; in the manner that he describes. It is essential that the planning system should produce fair and transparent outcomes, and that communities have every opportunity to make their voices heard, to have their say and&#151;I cannot stress this enough&#151;to be able to influence decisions under consideration by the local authority. If that ability is not available, the public&#146;s faith in consultation and&#151;a more fundamental point&#151;faith in the political process will be undermined.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o304"><a name="90202-0019.htm_para22"><a name="09020235000541">My hon. Friend stated that Wirral borough council recently undertook a strategic asset review to look at making the best use of its resources. I understand that  <br>

the objective of the review is to improve service delivery, offer better value for money, and support the regeneration of the whole borough. I am sure that he will agree that it is right for local authorities to consider whether the services that they offer to people are up to date, responsive to local needs and priorities, and provide value for money for the local taxpayer. However, I have enormous sympathy with the arguments that he has advanced in the House tonight and on his website, where he states:</p>
<a name="90202-0019.htm_brev0"><a name="09020235000586"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Whilst these decisions are a matter for the Council and Councillors, and not the MP, I am obviously concerned for my constituents, the staff involved and about the loss and quality of services. Overall, I very much regret that we have found ourselves in this position and that decisions have been taken so quickly. The decisions seem even harder to justify given that Wirral has had above inflation increases in support from central government each year since 1997.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o305"><a name="90202-0019.htm_para23"><a name="09020235000542">He reiterated that point tonight.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o306"><a name="90202-0019.htm_para24"><a name="09020235000543">I understand that, as part of the strategic asset review, Wirral is looking at the condition of public buildings, their accessibility and the facilities that they offer. The local authority also undertook a six-week consultation, inviting residents and private and public organisations to contribute. The conclusion reached from this exercise was that &#147;fewer is better&#148;. It is not for me to comment on that conclusion. I understand, however, that the local authority wishes to join up council services with those of other organisations such as the police, the fire service and local primary health facilities. This seems sensible, as it would provide co-ordinated public services for the people of Eastham.</p>

 My hon. Friend the Member for Wirral, South (Ben Chapman) mentioned Peel&#146;s plans, which include a massive housing development just over the border, in my constituency; it was approved as one of the Government&#146;s growth points. Does the Minister not think that, as part of their strategic thinking, local authorities should engage with their colleagues across borders to ensure that where facilities are changed and housing is developed, there are adequate support facilities, such as libraries, to meet the needs of the local people?</p>

 That is a fair point. Obviously, I cannot comment on specific proposals that may go before the Secretary of State as part of the planning process. However, the idea that a local authority stands alone and autonomously is not appropriate in the modern world. A local authority will have links with neighbouring authorities. Given such things as multi-area agreements, it is important that local authorities talk to one another.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o307"><a name="90202-0019.htm_para25"><a name="09020235000546">On the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Wirral, South, the contentious element is that Wirral borough council wants to focus resources on Bromborough, which means that Eastham library is earmarked for closure. I want to concentrate on that aspect, because the issue is very important.</p>

<p><a name="st_o450"><a name="09020235000547"><a name="90202-0019.htm_spnew13"><a name="09020235000989"><b>Ben Chapman:</b>
 I very much welcome the retention of Bromborough, but if Wirral council wanted to do that, why did it not say so?</p>

long ago&#151;I remember using Hartlepool&#146;s libraries. They helped me get to university. Nowadays, the best libraries are state-of-the-art resource centres for an area, a welcome magnet for the entire community, with internet cafes, coffee shops, places of advice on jobs, skills and housing, and community rooms to allow residents&#146; groups to meet and community cohesion to grow. They are real assets, and it is not surprising that local residents feel so passionate about them. Indeed, during the annual, painful budget-setting round when I was a councillor on Hartlepool borough council&#146;s cabinet, I felt so strongly about the value of local libraries that I always said that I would resign if any had been proposed for closure.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o309"><a name="90202-0020.htm_para1"><a name="09020235000550">With regard to the concerns of my hon. Friend and of the residents of Eastham, I understand that the local authority has now, largely thanks to his efforts, agreed to work with the local community to explore alternative ways of making the best use of all facilities, including, as he said&#151;I appreciate that he has some concerns about it&#151;asset transfer to the community.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o310"><a name="90202-0020.htm_para2"><a name="09020235000551">I reiterate my central argument that decisions about funding priorities and the best way in which to meet the needs of local residents must ultimately be made by local authorities. Central Government and Ministers cannot interfere in that. However, my hon. Friend made an important point about the consultation process. It is vital that that is clear, transparent and well publicised. I know that a consultation process took place between 27 November and 15 January, including four special area forum conferences, which were attended by more than 2,000 people. I also understand that the consultation was publicised in the local press and on the council&#146;s website.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o311"><a name="90202-0020.htm_para3"><a name="09020235000552">I note from my hon. Friend&#146;s website and from his comments tonight that the decision about Eastham library was made as a result of the consultation and was not therefore directly consulted on. That is important. My hon. Friend the Member for Wirral, West (Stephen Hesford) also mentioned it. I also note that my hon. Friend the Member for Wirral, South was concerned that, as an important local stakeholder, he was not consulted. That is not good enough and I hope that his efforts tonight demonstrate the strength of his feeling to local decision makers. I understand that three overview and scrutiny committees met to consider recommendations presented to cabinet on 15 January. The views of those committees will be made to full council on 9 February.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o312"><a name="90202-0020.htm_para4"><a name="09020235000553">There are no easy answers in such circumstances. It is not for me to interfere in such local decisions, but I emphasise that it is essential to follow the proper procedures and that local residents have every opportunity to be involved in shaping the future direction of their community.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o313"><a name="90202-0020.htm_para5"><a name="09020235000554">Such decisions are undoubtedly difficult locally. It is important to strike a balance that meets the needs of as many local people as possible, providing them with the widest possible services. Given my hon. Friend&#146;s excellent contribution tonight, I hope that he will continue to work with all local partners to help achieve the goal of excellent public services for the widest possible community.</p>
