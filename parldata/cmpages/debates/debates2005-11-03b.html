</p>



<p><a name="st_o0"><a name="51103-01_spmin0"><b>The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry  (Alan&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Johnson): </b> 
 My ministerial team and I have regular meetings about the security of the UK&#039;s energy supply, and particularly about the position for the forthcoming winter. We have also had discussions with a wide range of energy stakeholders. The gas market is likely to be tighter this year, compared with previous years, because of a larger than anticipated decline in North sea gas supplies. However, as Ofgem and National Grid have made clear, under normal weather conditions there are sufficient gas supplies and electricity generation to meet expected demand. Even in the severest of winters, their analysis shows that the market can maintain supplies. In all credible scenarios, energy supplies will be maintained for domestic customers.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o1"><a name="51103-01_spnew0"><b> Mr. Stuart: </b> 
 We are a net importer of gas, yet we have no strategic reserve. We have liberalised gas markets, yet we have stood by while continental countries artificially protect theirs. UK businesses and consumers pay higher prices as a result. What reassurances can the Secretary of State give my constituents at Electro Furnace Products in Saltend that their jobs are safe from gas cuts and artificial price hikes?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o2"><a name="51103-01_spnew1"><b> Alan Johnson: </b> 
 It is no good me giving answers if hon.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members do not listen to them. As Ofgem and National Grid have made clear, under normal weather conditions, there are sufficient gas supplies and electricity generation to meet expected demand. Their analysis shows that, even in the severest of winters, the market will be able to maintain supplies. In relation to the hon. Gentleman&#039;s first point, we have moved from 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>3 Nov 2005 : Column 950</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>being a net exporter of gas to being a net importer. We are just in that process. As a result, the market is responding. As I said in my answer, the supply of gas from the North sea has run down more quickly than anyone expected it to. Nevertheless, that is what we have banked as our storage. Just as the Netherlands and Norway have no storage capacity because they have large gas fields, we still have significant storage there. We have a whole series of measures coming in before the winter, and another whole series next year. I would say to Conservative Members that the market really is working.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o3"><a name="51103-01_spnew2"><b> Mr. Speaker: </b> 
 Mr. Eric Illsley is not here. I call Mr.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luff.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o4"><a name="51103-01_spnew3"><b> Peter Luff  (Mid-Worcestershire)</b> 
 (Con): In his evidence to the Select Committee on Trade and Industry on Monday, the Minister for Energy confirmed that there would be a real risk of interruptions to supply for gas users this winter if, as the Met Office predicts, we have a colder than average winter. The Minister also said that he was prepared to consider certain exemptions, to maximise flexibility in the response to gas users, such as temporary exemptions from emissions regulations or from climate change regulations. Will the Secretary of State tell us what discussions he is having with industry and with his colleagues in the Government to bring forward those sensible proposals?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o5"><a name="51103-01_spnew4"><b> Alan Johnson: </b> 
 I was aware of the hearing that took place with the Minister for Energy earlier this week. I am not accusing the hon. Gentleman of scaremongering in any way, although there are plenty of others around who are scaremongering on this issue. My hon. Friend the Minister was describing what would happen if there were a one in 50&nbsp;winter. That is not being predicted by the Met Office, but we have discussed with the energy intensive users group a range of measures that might need to be put in place in such circumstances. That, however, is a long way from frightening domestic customers by saying that they are going to have their supplies cut off.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-01_para0">
<a name="stpa_o0">On the hon. Gentleman&#039;s other point, he and his Committee have quite properly explored what would happen in an emergency, if there were a one in 50&nbsp;winter, which we are not predicting at the moment. They have asked what measures would be in place to deal with such a situation. It was in that context that my hon. Friend the Minister talked about emissions, from chemical plants in particular. Such measures would need the authority of the Environment Agency, and no one would want to take such steps, even in the most extreme conditions. Nevertheless, the Government have to have contingency measures in place. The problem with talking about them is that we might give the impression that we are going to need them, but, as my answer has clearly demonstrated, and as the winter outlook report from National Grid and Ofgem shows, we do not expect to be in that situation this winter.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o6"><a name="51103-01_spnew5"><b> Mr. Speaker: </b>

<p><a name="st_o7"><a name="51103-01_spnew6"><b> Mr. Dennis Skinner  (Bolsover)</b> 
 (Lab): Is the Secretary of State aware that we do not need any lectures from the party that got rid of clean coal technology, shut the pits, and privatised our gas interests? What we do need is to ensure that in the forthcoming years&#151;not just this one&#151;we save what remains of the British coal industry, introduce the necessary clean coal technology, stop handing out large sums of money to UK Coal, which is using it for property development and shutting pits, and start a process such as the one at Tower colliery in Wales, where the miners themselves are able to produce the coal.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o8"><a name="51103-01_spnew7"><b> Mr. Speaker: </b> 
 Order. I am also looking for brief supplementary questions.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o9"><a name="51103-01_spnew8"><b> Alan Johnson: </b> 
 I agree with my hon. Friend about the record of the previous Government in respect of coal and the environmental damage left behind from the pits that they closed down. While I do not think that we will see the days of king coal again, coal is having a resurgence, and it will be a central feature of the energy review that my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister announced recently. On the final point, we are investing &#163;25&nbsp;million, as we announced recently, to develop new carbon abatement technology such as carbon capture and storage, so there are some exciting developments that were not around even in 2003&nbsp;when we published our energy White Paper.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o10"><a name="51103-01_spnew9"><b> Mr. Tim Yeo  (South Suffolk)</b> 
 (Con): Why do the Government continue to dither over nuclear power? Is it not clear to the Secretary of State that the long-term security of our energy supplies and the achievement of our environmental commitments depends on an early decision to commission a new generation of nuclear power stations?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o11"><a name="51103-01_spnew10"><b> Alan Johnson: </b> 
 Where I agree with the hon. Gentleman is on the point that a decision needs to be made soon on whether we go for new build or not. That must be seen in the context of the entire energy mix: energy renewal, security of supply and energy abatement. Those issues need to be considered together. That is why, rather than&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dithering, the Prime Minister has announced a comprehensive review, the details of which will be announced soon.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o12"><a name="51103-01_spnew11"><b> Mr. Anthony Wright  (Great Yarmouth)</b> 
 (Lab): Whenever there is a threat of a shortage of anything, the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;price of that product invariably increases. In the unlikely event of a shortage in gas supply over the coming winter, will my right hon. Friend guarantee that we will not cease in our efforts to reduce fuel poverty? Over the past eight years, the fuel poverty strategy has taken 4&nbsp;million people out of fuel poverty, and I fear that, if the price increases over the winter months because of shortage, more people will fall into it.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o13"><a name="51103-01_spnew12"><b> Alan Johnson: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is right to raise the issue: we have taken 4&nbsp;million people out of fuel poverty, including 1&nbsp;million of the most vulnerable. Now that gas&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;prices have increased, because they are linked to oil prices, which have increased, we must redouble our efforts. We have recently announced a free helpline to provide people with advice on insulation and so on. We 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>3 Nov 2005 : Column 952</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>need to take other measures. The &#163;200&nbsp;winter fuel allowance this year&#151;&#163;300&nbsp;for the over-80s&#151;will be a welcome contribution to tackling those problems.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o14"><a name="51103-01_spnew13"><b> Norman Lamb  (North Norfolk)</b> 
 (LD): The Secretary of State will be aware that National Grid estimates that large energy users would have to give up some 3.7&nbsp;billion cu m of gas in the event of a repeat of the 1963&nbsp;big freeze, unlikely though it might be, to keep gas flowing to the domestic sector. Is it not crazy that the Government are&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now contemplating an opt-out from the emissions trading scheme? Would it not have been better to have followed the advice of the International Energy Agency and many other experts in pursuing a much more vigorous assault on energy waste?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o15"><a name="51103-01_spnew14"><b> Alan Johnson: </b> 
 First, no one is predicting a 1963&nbsp;winter&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i> I repeat that nobody, in the Met Office, is predicting that. Secondly, major users, to whom we talk all the time, and who have a serious problem&#151;this is not to diminish that&#151;in the event that we have severe weather conditions, have interruptible contracts. They sign those interruptible contracts on the basis that they would get a lower price, and they could, as they recognise, through energy efficiency, sell some of their supplies back on to the market and make a profit in a tight energy situation. I therefore believe that we have the right framework in place even if we have the most extreme winter conditions.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o16"><a name="51103-01_spnew15"><b> Paddy Tipping  (Sherwood)</b> 
 (Lab): Does the Secretary of State accept that there is an element of scaremongering occurring? There is no question of domestic customers being cut off this year. Things might be tight for industrial consumers, but in the longer term will not new pipelines resolve the issue of gas supply?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o17"><a name="51103-01_spnew16"><b> Alan Johnson: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is right. We have doubled the capacity of the Belgian interconnector and introduced the new liquefied natural gas facility that has opened at the Isle of Grain in the Thames estuary. Other measures are being taken this year and more will be taken next year. On the scaremongering issue, one newspaper that puts lurid headlines above journalistic accuracy said that there would be a blackout. It quoted a guy called Jonathan Smith, the media relations manager of E. ON UK. He wrote to the newspaper. It did not publish the letter, but he copied it to me. It states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_o0">&quot;Throughout my conversations with your journalists I stressed that we at E.ON UK did not believe there would be any power and gas problems this winter . . . At no point during the course of the article&quot;</p>

 I thank the hon. Gentleman for his kind comments. I was looking forward to him becoming leader of his party, but now that he has hitched his star to Haltemprice and Howden&#151;not Witney&#151;perhaps it is not to be.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-01_para4">
<a name="stpa_o4">Let me deal with the hon. Gentleman&#039;s very serious point. At present, we have the extra capacity that I just mentioned. I could also have mentioned the new gas storage facility at Humbly Grove in Hampshire. In the unlikely event of severe winter conditions, we can switch from gas and electricity generation to coal generation. We have mothballed plant that we have made ready for&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;use, at Didcot for coal, at Grain for oil and at Killingholme, where there is a combined cycle gas turbine. Moreover, as I said earlier, big users can reduce their energy demand and sell back to the grid. We do not expect any fuel supply problems this winter.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o20"><a name="51103-01_spnew19"><b> Mr. Willetts: </b> 
 I note that the Secretary of State did not repeat the guarantee that the Leader of the House gave during Prime Minister&#039;s Question Time last week. Many energy consumers will have noticed that.

<a name="stpa_o5">I am pleased that we are making some progress this morning.

What we need now is for him to publish an authoritative account of the steps that he will take if there is a threat to our energy supplies during a harsh winter, so that industry and business know where they stand. That is the least he can do.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o21"><a name="51103-01_spnew20"><b> Alan Johnson: </b> 
 The National Grid published its preliminary outlook in May. It published its final outlook last month. We share the wish for a debate on the Floor of the House that has been expressed by the hon. Gentleman and some of his hon. Friends. That has been dealt with by the usual channels, but we agree that&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the debate should take place here rather than in Westminster Hall. My hon. Friend the Minister for Energy is meeting intensive energy users and others daily, and the Trade and Industry Committee is conducting an important investigation.

It would be entirely different if the Met Office were predicting a one in 50&nbsp;winter and if the National Grid&#039;s report were predicting problems. That is not the case, and we therefore have an obligation not to scaremonger. The hon. Gentleman has no such obligation, and nor have any of his Front-Bench colleagues, but others have. We must ensure that such scaremongering is quashed by responsible behaviour in the House.

 As the Prime Minister has announced, we will publish proposals on energy policy next year, embracing our continuing commitment to tackling climate change, preserving reliable supplies of energy and maintaining competitive markets.

<p><a name="st_o25"><a name="51103-02_spnew2"><b> Mr. Borrow: </b> 
 A few weeks ago, I met civil engineers in the north-west, who recently produced an infrastructure report on the region.

In line with the commitment that we gave in the 2003&nbsp;White Paper, if the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;result of the new review announced by the Prime Minister is that we should go down the nuclear new build route&#151;that is a very big if, because factors such as waste and cost have to be taken into account&#151;we will need to publish another White Paper and to have the widest possible consultation. A very healthy public debate is going on, but it is very different from that which took place even as recently as 2003&nbsp;in terms of climate change and the need for security of supply.

 We are acutely aware of the impact of globalisation and the challenges for UK manufacturing and services.

<p><a name="st_o39"><a name="51103-02_spnew15"><b> Alun Michael: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is right about the size of the manufacturing sector, and about the contribution that it makes to the economy. He is also right to point to the impact made by China, India and some other countries, as they now aspire to be at the cutting edge of manufacturing rather then just to produce low-value goods. However, their development provides us with large emerging markets that we should regard as an opportunity rather than a threat. Through the manufacturing strategy, we are working with manufacturing industry to face up to those challenges.

 (Con): One of the highest-profile examples of globalisation is the sale of the MG Rover car manufacturer in my constituency to the Chinese. Is the Minister aware that DTI officials confirmed to the Trade and Industry Committee the other week that the platform for mass-produced Rover cars has been shipped to China lock, stock and barrel? That is a great disappointment to my constituents, but the officials also confirmed that so far they had held no negotiations with Nanjing Automotive Corporation in respect of the company&#039;s long-standing promise that it would reinstate mass production at Longbridge. That is a very worrying and sad development: is it true, and what will the right hon. Gentleman do about it?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o41"><a name="51103-02_spnew17"><b> Alun Michael: </b> 
 I am certainly not going to go into the details of what are commercial matters for the company. The Government engaged very rapidly once the impact of the Rover decisions was known and my hon. Friend the Minister for Trade remains closely in touch with the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;company. We are also working carefully with the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whole supply chain. Despite the Rover issue, the automotive industry is a success story in this country. The&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;contribution made by automotive producers to the economy is considerable, and continues to be strong.

Does the Minister not understand that the Government are part of the problem? Higher taxes, more regulations and cosy deals with the trade unions are making this country less competitive, and driving investment away to eastern Europe and Asia. Does he recognise that the tragedy is that business is telling the Government what is wrong, and it is only the Government who do not recognise the extent of the challenges?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o45"><a name="51103-02_spnew21"><b> Alun Michael: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman is supposed to be speaking at the Dispatch Box, not the ranting box.

He has the cheek to try to give us lessons, but I have to say to him that since I came to this job I have been impressed by the way in&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which manufacturing industry works with the Government, because those people know the value of the manufacturing strategy that we established in 2002&nbsp;to help manufacturing industry.

</p>








<p><a name="st_o47"><a name="51103-02_spnew23"><b> Alun Michael: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is right. What is strong is the partnership with manufacturing industry involving initiatives such as the materials centre that we opened recently on the Isle of Wight, and the fact that our manufacturing strategy is based on applying science and innovation, world-class practice, raising investment and a high level of skills. That all depends on high standards and good leadership in manufacturing industry, and leaders in that industry are acting as partners with us to tackle those issues, so our industry will be successful.

Those bills are set to rise to &#163;700, even though they are already the highest in the country and are clearly unaffordable.

 There is a technical debate about that. Certainly, nuclear energy shares some scientific characteristics with wind and solar energy.

 I am happy to take history tutorials from my hon.

<p><a name="st_o59"><a name="51103-03_spnew9"><b> Malcolm Wicks: </b> 
 It is certainly the case that the nuclear industry, like other parts of the energy industry, such as oil and gas exploration, is demographically challenged&#151;to use the terrible jargon. In other words, there are more people aged 50&nbsp;and over than there are younger entrants. I am giving some priority to the skills issue in the energy industry generally and I have discussed it already with the nuclear industry and other parts of the energy sector. Britain, and especially Scotland, is a centre of excellence for energy, not least because of the skills of our work force, and we need to maintain and improve on that.

 That is an important secondary, or tertiary, question but the primary question is whether, having studied the evidence, the Government should give a lead in a new generation of nuclear.

 (Con): Whether the number of people using gas and electricity pre-payment meters has changed as a result of the measures Ofgem has taken to improve billing practice and tighten suppliers&#039; licence conditions. [24339]


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>3 Nov 2005 : Column 961</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br></p>



<p><a name="st_o62"><a name="51103-03_spmin2"><b>The Minister for Energy  (Malcolm Wicks): </b> 
 In July 2005, following a complaint by Energywatch under the Enterprise Act 2002, Ofgem conducted an investigation into the billing practices of gas and electricity suppliers. It made a number of recommendations, designed to take&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;effect in July 2006. There is no reason why those recommendations, or the measures taken to implement them, should materially change the number of customers using pre-payment meters. Indeed, there are 3.6&nbsp;million electricity and 2.1&nbsp;million gas pre-payment meter customers.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o63"><a name="51103-03_spnew12"><b> Mr. Leigh: </b> 
 As the Minister has made clear, more than&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5&nbsp;million people pay for their gas or electricity with pre-payment meters, despite their being some of the poorest people in the community. In March, the Public Accounts Committee found that on average they were paying a premium to the companies of &#163;60&nbsp;a year. That is unacceptable. What actions have the Government taken since our report was published to rectify the situation and how much has the premium reduced since that time?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o64"><a name="51103-03_spnew13"><b> Malcolm Wicks: </b> 
 This is a matter that concerns me but it is not an easy one. The question is whether those choices should be allowed to the customer; I think they should. There are difficulties with pre-payment meters such as the extra costs, which I acknowledge. I worry about that too, but the alternative might be more disconnections and there are many evils associated with that. The matter is difficult and we need to approach it in a balanced way.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o65"><a name="51103-03_spnew14"><b> David Taylor  (North-West Leicestershire)</b> 
 (Lab/Co-op): One obvious problem with pre-payment cards, as well as disconnections, which the Minister has just mentioned, is that if the card is not charged no fuel&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;supplied. A quarter or more pre-payment users self-disconnect in that way every year and a much higher proportion of them are gas users, which reflects the lower income profile of people forced into that position. Will the Minister tell us what he intends to do to tackle that problem?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o66"><a name="51103-03_spnew15"><b> Malcolm Wicks: </b> 
 As I said, this is a difficult issue because if people were in different systems and there were rising numbers of disconnections, the House would properly be concerned, as some of us have been in the past. We need to enable more customers to be given the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;information to make proper choices, including the choice of switching back to the type of payment methods that many of us enjoy. In that sense, the launch of the industry home heat helpline on Monday is important, as it means that a customer, or someone concerned about their welfare, can phone up for advice on those issues.

 (SNP): When asked about fuel poverty, Ministers often make the point that consumers should consider switching suppliers, but that&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is difficult for people on pre-payment meters, which must be one of the few examples where people are penalised by paying cash in advance.

</p>








<p><a name="st_o68"><a name="51103-03_spnew17"><b> Malcolm Wicks: </b> 
 There is some switching between suppliers for people on pre-payment meters, but I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;acknowledge that that occurs at a lower rate than for other customers. Will I look at the matter again? Yes I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will, because it is a serious concern. We want people on low incomes to be able to enjoy the kind of facilities that we all enjoy. It is true that in this case the poor pay more due to the charging structure. I will look at it again.

<a name="stpa_o9">Clearly, pre-payment meters involve capital expenditure. If there was no price differential, other customers, including many low-income people and many pensioners, would have&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to subsidise those on pre-payment meters. These are difficult issues. I am not relaxed about the fact that so many low-income families have different payment methods from the mainstream of society. I repeat that there is no easy solution, but I have told the hon. Member for Angus (Mr.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weir) that I will reconsider the issue.

 (Con): Would the Minister be prepared to consider looking again at the regulation of the energy market to encourage the installation of smarter, more high-tech meters across the board? The advantage is that the consequences of consumers&#039; energy choices would be&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;much more visible to them. With that visibility, we could encourage and enhance energy efficiency among consumers because they would instantly see the energy consequences of the appliances that they choose to use in the home.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o72"><a name="51103-03_spnew21"><b> Malcolm Wicks: </b> 
 The short answer is yes. I am very interested in the concept of smart metering, particularly if it could tell householders how much CO <sub>2</sub> their dwellings were emitting and, with micro-generation in the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dwelling, they could see the savings that they were making. I understand that there has been a roll-out of smart metering in Italy, so the European experience can be considered. We are discussing that option with Ofgem. The investment required would be expensive, but to repeat my short answer, yes, it is worth considering that option.

However, the Government are aware that we can do more to help business, which is why we propose to ensure that employees give two months&#039; notice of returning from maternity leave. Proposals are in place for proper consultation on whether someone wants to work flexibly if they have a child under the age of six, a disabled child or caring responsibilities, so that the needs of both the employer and the employee can be considered properly.

 Women are seriously under-represented as executive and non-executive members of FTSE boards. There has been a small increase in the proportion of such women over the past five years, and the next FTSE report on that will be published later this month. Given that 30&nbsp;per cent. of managers are women, the reasons behind that under-representation are almost entirely due to the factors that comprise the glass ceiling, which set a challenge both to business itself and the Government.

 May we have a debate on the subject of self-regulating professions? Several of my constituents have contacted me on issues relating to professions about which they feel that they have no right of appeal. I have taken advice on whether I can secure an Adjournment debate on the issue, in this place or in Westminster Hall, but have been told that as it cuts across many Departments I am unable to do so. Is the Leader of the House able to offer a debate on the issue of self-regulating professions?

 I would regard an Adjournment debate in Westminster Hall as an excellent vehicle.

My postbag is already building up in relation to the abuse of fireworks, so the legislation is&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;clearly not having an effect. Will the Leader of the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;House give a commitment that he will bring the legislation back to the Floor of the House after 5&nbsp;November for consideration of what we can do to make sure that we do not suffer the same problems next 5&nbsp;November?

Three new penalty notices and three new offences have been created to deal with the abuse of selling fireworks outside the normal and reasonable period for celebrating what will this year be the 400th anniversary of an important event in the nation&#039;s life. We do not want to prevent those celebrations in any way. On the other hand, it is important that they are&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;confined closely to the period around 5&nbsp;November. I have not received the same number of complaints on the matter this year as in recent years, which, I believe, is because the legislation is having an impact.

 May I ask the Leader of the House for a debate on housing in south Yorkshire, in the light of a written reply from the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister to me this week showing that over the past five years, for the giant conurbations of Rotherham, Sheffield, Barnsley and Doncaster, on average just 3,189&nbsp;new dwellings have been built a year for the 1.5&nbsp;million people who live there? That is the lowest rate of house build in south Yorkshire since the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stone age. We have the land and the building firms, so can we have a debate to consider how planning committees can move forward and land use rules be changed? While the concrete mixers are ready for the south of England, we would like to see in the north of England a much more supply-side orientated policy from the Government to encourage new homes and new houses.

 My right hon. Friend is absolutely right to raise that issue. My constituency is not that far away from the area that he describes and there has been a great deal of new building there, which has improved the housing stock. It is not only a question of new houses for currently homeless people; what most people want is to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be able to move out of some of the older properties into new and better quality houses.

Will the Leader of the House undertake to provide a debate on this year&#039;s settlement in Government time before the House rises for the Christmas recess, so that we can all come and tell him that he is wrong about the council tax increases that will be necessary in the coming year because of the Government&#039;s failure to give financial support to local government?

 On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. Yesterday we witnessed a fantastic demonstration of democracy in Parliament when we were lobbied by the Trade Justice Movement in a wonderfully organised way. Sadly, however, a postcode lottery determined who was completely soaked in the rain outside, because people travelled here from different parts of the country. My constituents, who had travelled no further than 50&nbsp;miles or so, spent four hours outside and were soaked to the skin. Meanwhile, Westminster Hall was nowhere near full. I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wonder whether you, Mr. Speaker, could look into&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;how we organise delegations to Parliament in the 21st century, so that we can treat our constituents in a much better fashion.

<p><a name="st_67"><a name="51103-10_spnew6"><b> Mr. Speaker: </b> 
 I will look into the point that the hon.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gentleman has raised, but my understanding is that as&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;many members of the public were admitted to the precincts as could safely be accommodated&#151;and the organisers of the lobby were well aware in advance that they were bringing more people to Westminster than could be admitted to the building.

I am told by the House of Commons Library, however, that no equivalent information about the Prime Minister&#039;s office is available. I understand that questions have been tabled about the issue, but to no avail. Can you advise me, Mr.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaker, on how I might be able to establish the costs of the Prime Minister&#039;s private office, in an entirely proper way, so that we can compare them with our own costs and with those of the Leader of the Opposition?

 As the Minister will know, an amendment to clause 21&nbsp;was tabled but not selected. It dealt with the question of what constitutes unlawful glorification, which seems to depend on what glorification turns out to mean in the rest of the Bill. We believe that there are good grounds for proscribing an organisation that glorifies terrorist acts, because that is different from criminalising such an organisation, but I should like to understand better the nature of unlawful glorification and its relation to the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;meaning of glorification in clause 1. I hope that the Minister will be able to enlighten us.
</p>








<p><a name="st_77"><a name="51103-10_spmin0"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department  (Paul Goggins): </b> 
 The hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve) referred to an amendment that had not been selected, but we have an opportunity to discuss the clause. I think he agrees with the Government that proscription is an important weapon in the fight against terrorism. He mentioned the word &quot;glorification&quot;: there was some discussion about that yesterday, and the Committee settled its opinion.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-10_para4">
<a name="stpa_47">Proscription is an important weapon in the fight against terrorism, but more would be required than for an individual member of an organisation to make glorifying statements. The organisation itself would have to be aligned with those opinions. It should also be&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stressed that glorification of terrorism applies only when an audience can reasonably be expected to infer that what is being glorified is conduct that should be&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;emulated in existing circumstances. Glorification of terrorism in itself is not sufficient ground for proscription.
</p>








<p><a name="st_78"><a name="51103-10_spnew12"><b> Mr. William Cash  (Stone) (Con):</b> 
 When deciding whether particular organisations should be proscribed, might we not encounter a difficulty? A mosque, for instance, consists of a body of people&#151;the jurists on the one hand and the imam on the other&#151;who may say certain things. I do not pretend to know the answer to the problem, but, as I tried to explain yesterday, we could find ourselves on extremely dangerous territory because of aspects of the universalism of the religion in&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;question, and the interaction between religion and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;politics&#151;which, in the context of the Koran, are inseparable.

<p><a name="st_79"><a name="51103-11_spnew0"><b> Paul Goggins: </b> 
 Even communities such as the Muslim community have organisations and structures, although overall the Muslim religion is not as highly structured as&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;some other religions. Each mosque has its own management committee; nothing is left to one individual. The clause relates to organisations, and it would be for Ministers to consider and make recommendations in respect of any specific organisation once all the evidence had been carefully considered.

 I support very strongly what the Government are trying to do in&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;general through this Bill, but we are right to ask for&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a certain amount of caution at various points, and this is&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;probably one of them. During our proceedings, the so-called Mandela test has been raised in a number of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ways. Of course, the fact is that these provisions apply not only to this country but internationally&#151;to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;organisations and activities elsewhere. There is a fundamental difference between societies that have democratic, liberal political systems and those that do not, and between the appropriate political responses. We should never forget that terrorism is always an act of mass murder, but the context in which it operates is profoundly different when there are no opportunities for&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;normal means of political opposition. So giving some kind of credence&#151;or, indeed, support&#151;to organisations operating in such a context is clearly different from giving it to the organisations that we are primarily dealing with today.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-11_para2">
<a name="stpa_50">I suspect that in the past all of us have flirted with supporting organisations that would come a cropper under this Bill. Many of my generation had a picture of Che Guevara on their walls, and not many of us regarded Nelson Mandela as anything other than a great icon. That suggests that we should proceed with great care in making sure that we get this Bill right. Of course, in a sense these provisions apply to past activities, not just current ones. In Westminster Hall, there is a splendid exhibition about Guy Fawkes, and we can buy commemorative mugs showing pictures of the Guy Fawkes conspirators. In fact, I just met someone dressed as Guy Fawkes walking into Portcullis House, and I am sure that there are Guy Fawkes commemoration societies and various other such bodies.

<a name="stpa_51">We do not want to be silly about this, but the fact is that we tend to regard things that happened a long time ago rather differently from those happening currently.

<br>&nbsp;<br>exactly how this provision will be applied. I agree with what has just been said, in that the wording is very broad and could cause difficulties.

The situation in Ireland is very much improved, but there are still extremists there.

 The Bill seems not to require that, to be caught by this provision, the person or organisation singing the republican songs must be intending to provoke further violent conduct; it is simply a question of whether it might reasonably be expected that someone will take from such songs a general encouragement to emulate such conduct in current circumstances. I can think of situations where that might be so&#151;if, for example, an event were taking place in the Province at a very sensitive time.

<p><a name="st_85"><a name="51103-11_spnew6"><b> Mr. Peter Robinson: </b> 
 In attempting to intervene earlier, I wanted to make a point similar to that made by&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke). I can foresee circumstances in which the police might have to scoop up half the population of Northern Ireland. Some, for example, glorify the 1916&nbsp;rebellion, and parades are regularly held to glorify those who were arrested in the post office and later executed. A large section of the community glorifies the actions of 1912&nbsp;and the defiance of the Ulster volunteers; indeed, even today there are bands named after the Ulster volunteers. All such forms of glorification would&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;clearly be caught by the net of this Bill. The only&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;criterion that the Government have offered is the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Director of Public Prosecutions&#039; sensible use of the 

<br>&nbsp;<br>

If it proceeds to the House of Lords, it will get into increasingly deep trouble.

Beatification is still an issue, as is the fate of people such as St. Edmund Campion and others. For instance, in the persecutions of the late 16th century, 30&nbsp;people who attended my old school were martyred.

<a name="51103-12_para0">
<a name="stpa_59">Clause 21&nbsp;is very anti-history&#151;so much so that it seems that Parliament is trying to strike a blow against the past. Most of the countries that we hold in high esteem have a myth about their creation and celebrate, 

<br>&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>for instance, a glorious revolution or the overthrow of a colonial power. Their histories are often held up as examples of how direct and positive action can bring about change for the better.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-12_para1">
<a name="stpa_60">Holding up as such an example, even the progress to liberal democracy, if that involved acts covered by the terms of the Bill, would be deemed fundamentally unlawful. However, that is often the truth behind many modern societies.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-12_para2">
<a name="stpa_61">We reason by cases, and the United States is worth considering in that connection. President Bush, like all his predecessors, is almost obliged to esteem the actions of those who rose against Britain&#039;s sovereignty in America&#039;s internal affairs. Another example is Italy&#039;s revolt against the Austrians. Garibaldi sought the emancipation, in one sense, of the south of Italy, and was treated as a national hero when he arrived here: all of London turned out to celebrate the courageous acts of one of the great 19th century figures.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-12_para3">
<a name="stpa_62">I know that the Home Secretary will say that all that happened a long time ago. In the historical analysis that he presented on Second Reading, he said that he considered progress to be ineluctable. We know that it is not; what we think of as progress can turn out to be regress, and it is possible that that is what is happening in certain central Asian states today.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-12_para4">
<a name="stpa_63">The notion of glorification as presented in the Bill goes against the principles of liberal democracy that the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Home Secretary is endeavouring to protect. In his&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;endeavours, he contradicts something that is profoundly important to our society.

<p>
<a name="51103-12_para5">
<a name="stpa_64">Furthermore, my reading of the clause suggests that a&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;record company distributing records by groups such as the Clancy Brothers could become a proscribed organisation. In the same way, the distributors of Neil&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jordan&#039;s film &quot;Michael Collins&quot;, which came out five or six years ago and which I suspect most hon.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will have seen, could become a proscribed organisation in the UK. That is because it could be reasonably expected that some people living in Ireland&#039;s 32 counties might start emulating the activities with which Michael Collins was associated in the period&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;between 1919 and 1921. Those activities included blowing up British forces and, on occasion and by accident, civilians.

<p><a name="st_90"><a name="51103-12_spnew3"><b> Mr. Grieve: </b> 
 I am very grateful to all those who have participated in this short debate, which has highlighted some of my anxieties about the clause. My party accepts that a problem exists in connection with organisations in this country that regularly glorify acts of terrorism currently taking place around the world, and that that problem must be addressed. As so often, however, there is a difficulty with how the clause is worded.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-12_para7">
<a name="stpa_66">In its present form, clause 21&nbsp;is a catch-all provision. It could be used to proscribe any organisation that glorifies any past act of terrorism. When I was at university, many left-wing organisations gloried in all sorts of activities that took place in the past. An example of that might be the peasants revolt, whose acts of terrorism were especially&#151;and regrettably&#151;targeted against lawyers.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-12_para8">
<a name="stpa_67">If a group is founded that calls itself the John Bull society, for instance, or the Wat Tyler club, its aim might&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be to promote radical political change. Such organisations might well draw inspiration from figures from the past who committed acts of violence, but the result is that they would be liable to be caught by clause 21. The Minister will no doubt fall back on the old mantra and say, &quot;It&#039;s all right, the DPP will know how to distinguish between various groups,&quot; but that will not be good enough.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-12_para9">
<a name="stpa_68">If the Government want to go down this road, they must produce a coherent argument that makes it clear what they are aiming at. They must narrow the definition sufficiently to allow the Committee as a whole to agree about the groups that would be caught. Otherwise, the Bill will create an absurdity, with endless challenges when attempts are made to proscribe organisations.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-12_para10">
<a name="stpa_69">Without that narrower definition, there will be allegations of unfairness. Other organisations will be&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;brought into the argument, and it will be contended that all sorts of bodies celebrate past violence. The Government should focus attention on the clause&#039;s use of the expression


</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3">&quot;whether in the past, in the future or generally&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-12_para11">
<a name="stpa_70">I accept that the matter is not an easy one but, if it turns out to be impossible to produce coherent grounds for proscription, that would be a good reason for saying that we should not have the clause at all.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-12_para12">
<a name="stpa_71">I do not intend to force a vote at the end of this debate, as I support the Government&#039;s underlying intention with the clause. I believe that Ministers will consider the other, linked issues relating to glorification between now and next Wednesday, when the Bill returns on Report. I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hope that they will reassure the House then that there is a form of words that meets the Government&#039;s intended target. Otherwise, the Government should not be aiming at a target at all, regrettable though it might be that that would allow some organisations to glorify terrorism. I hope that the Minister will be able to provide us with some reassurance that the Government will go away and consider that.

 We have had a useful discussion, but one aspect that needs to be emphasised is an echo of yesterday&#039;s discussion on clause 1. It is a fact that it is possible for&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;an individual, as well as an organisation, to fall foul&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the provision merely because of a perception

<br>&nbsp;<br>on&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;somebody else&#039;s part. We should criminalise the intent&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the individual or organisation, not the way in which somebody else might see their actions. Many organisations that try to highlight issues in connection with places such as Palestine or Kashmir will have to tread an exceptionally fine line, and it should not be the business of the House to proscribe their activities simply because somebody else may feel that they have crossed that line.

 As I predicted earlier, some of the discussion on this clause has reflected our earlier considerations in Committee.

 Will the right hon. and learned Gentleman give me a second, because I was about to come to the point that he raised? He asked me for specific examples, and some of our discussions have related not to the specific issue that we are discussing here, which is proscription, but to the conduct of individual people. With individual people, it would be for the courts to determine whether glorification had actually taken place in a specific case. Now, however, we are discussing glorification by an organisation to an extent that requires it to be proscribed.
</p>








<p><a name="st_95"><a name="51103-12_spnew8"><b> Mr. Clarke: </b> 
 The clause extends the existing definition in the Terrorism Act 2000. My recollection is that no one in the House objected to the powers taken in 2000&nbsp;to proscribe organisations promoting terrorism. However, clause 21&nbsp;implies that the Government have had a difficulty&#151;that they have wanted to proscribe an organisation but because what it was doing was glorifying past terrorism, they were unable to do so. The Minister may be able to cite some particular organisation, or at least to describe anonymously some problem that has arisen involving an organisation that ought to have been proscribed, but as its activities were based on glorification of martyrs, past causes, freedom fighters or whatever, in some other part of the world, it could not be proscribed. I am not aware of the Government having been prevented from using their powers in such circumstances. Can the Minister let us&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;know what provoked this measure, and why it is necessary to extend the definition? What are the organisations that now get through a loophole that will be closed by the strange introduction of the concept of &quot;glorifying&quot; as a particularly worrying action?

 If we were to go through the clauses in which the term &quot;glorification&quot; crops up&#151;including the definitions at the end of the Bill, the convention offences and the other stuff with which the Minister will be familiar&#151;and we stick to the wording, but exclude all the subsections and paragraphs that include a reference to &quot;glorification&quot;, we would still deal with the mischief that the Minister and the rest of the Government seek to overcome. That is a sensible proposition&#151;and we would also link the provisions to the proscribed organisations, while knocking out the increasingly threadbare argument that the notion of glorification adds anything useful to the process. In fact, that notion is dangerous and unproductive. Furthermore, some have said&#151;I do not want to make this into a certain accusation&#151;that it was the Prime Minister who used the word &quot;glorification&quot; at some stage.

 The hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Carmichael) raises an important point. It is not an easy matter; the criticism that can be made of the approach he advocates is that if a list has to be produced of what the acts happen to be, it could become unnecessarily prescriptive. One cannot always predict the act or conduct that first highlights the intention to give effect to committing an act of terrorism.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-14_para13">
<a name="stpa_92">It is worth bearing in mind the possible scope of the legislation, however. In that sense, it is similar to the old treason statutes&#151;compassing and imagining the death of the king. One would not have to do very much to be liable to imprisonment for life. If someone decided that they wanted to become a terrorist and the first thing they did was to buy a new suit to wear on the day that they&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;blew themselves up, they would be liable, without doing anything else, to imprisonment for life, if it could be proved that the buying of the suit was linked to the intention to become a suicide bomber.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-14_para14">
<a name="stpa_93">That example seems rather a good one because, on the face of it, such a situation would be caught by the clause. I do not know how much reassurance the Minister can provide about how the clause would work in practice. That is what we need to examine. As the Minister knows, we have not expressed opposition to the clause in theory but as so often happens the theory, the detail and the practice&#151;how the measure operates&#151;are different things.

 I am most grateful to my hon. Friend. Often confidences are imparted to one&#039;s tailor or to the person in the shop.

 The first thing one should do when considering legislation is to conclude how it may work in practice, and in practice that example would not be fanciful for the person concerned.

Perhaps he could give us some examples of the categories of conduct that the Government are trying to catch. Clearly, that is important and it might provide some justification for the amendment proposed by the hon.

</p>








<p><a name="st_139"><a name="51103-15_spnew6"><b> Mr. Peter Robinson: </b> 
 I caution against the amendment. The wording of the clause is such that the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;inclusion of the word &quot;relevant&quot; is not necessary. Its only purpose is as something on which to hang the subsequent amendment, which defines aspects of relevant conduct. However, that list could be so extensive that the Government could not possibly envisage what its future terms might be&#151;whether catching a bus, buying a battery or a cell phone; the list could go on for ever.

<a name="stpa_94">The fact that the provision would be implemented through secondary legislation does not satisfy me. That would mean that the Government were always chasing the terrorists.

<br>&nbsp;<br>cell. It may not be possible to know the precise atrocity that was being planned&#151;indeed, the terrorists themselves might not have made up their minds about a specific target; nevertheless, the offence requires clear evidence of intent to commit a terrorist act, which is of course a serious criminal matter, as the hon. Gentleman said.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-15_para4">
<a name="stpa_98">The hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve) rightly emphasised that the key feature of the &quot;acts preparatory&quot; offence is that it can be used when terrorists&#039; exact plans are unknown. He asks how this will work in practice. I am sure that he well understands that preparatory acts can be proven to have taken place only when the connection is made between the specific action and the terrorist act itself. Purchasing a car on its own is not an act preparatory to terrorism, but once it has been connected to the act of terror, it becomes a preparatory act. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman appreciates that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-15_para5">
<a name="stpa_99">Obviously, the offence must be drawn widely to include all the possible acts that could be preparatory acts. Attempting to create and maintain a list of all those acts that could be considered as being preparatory to a terrorist attack would be, frankly, impossible, as the hon. Gentleman made it plain before. If we had a list that included buying a suit, we would have a very long list indeed. Of course that would not be a practical or feasible challenge.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-15_para6">
<a name="stpa_100">The second and perhaps more important point is that it is likely that any list would be reactive. In other words, we would learn about preparatory acts based on the last terrorist atrocity, rather than being able to anticipate what might come in the future. It would be possible for&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mischievous terrorists to work their way around that provision if we were to include it in secondary legislation, as the amendment suggests.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-15_para7">
<a name="stpa_101">We need an open situation where any preparatory act that can be linked to terrorism is captured by the offence. The risk of terrorists devising new methods of preparing for terrorist acts is too great to allow such an approach. We cannot give the opportunity to terrorists to evade prosecution in that way. Again, Lord Carlile has described clause 5&nbsp;as


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_10">&quot;a proportional and proper response to achieve the criminalisation of the conduct described.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-15_para8">
<a name="stpa_102">I conclude by once again thanking hon. Members on both sides of the Committee for their warm and general support for this new provision on preparatory acts. We hope that it will help us to bear down more successfully in future on those who would carry out acts of terror against innocent people.

I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fear that this may yet prove problematic. However, I fully accept that the inclusion of intent in the creation of the offence is a very important safeguard. Given the

 May I tell my hon. Friend the Minister that the wording of clause 5&nbsp;underscores yet again the difficulties that we have as legislators in defining terrorism? Given the way the clause is worded, as I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;understand it, if I give 25p to collection for the Karen National Liberation Army in Burma, I can be sentenced to life imprisonment. As someone who wishes to fight oppression and has been political all his life, and recognising that the state of Burma is in no way democratic, that it should be resisted and that that resistance should occasionally take a quasi-military form against the military, I find that outrageous. Given the difficulty with the lack of clarity about what is terrorism, if I give 25p to the KNLA or a similar organisation, I can go to prison for life.
</p>








<p><a name="st_145"><a name="51103-15_spnew10"><b> Paul Goggins: </b> 
 In response to my hon. Friend the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Rob&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marris), who wants to take us into slightly wider territory, I can only repeat that clause 5 deals with preparatory acts, that it has been warmly welcomed by both sides of the Committee and that Lord Carlile sees it as being proportionate. My hon. Friend admits in his contribution that he wants to take the debate wider than that. He has concerns about the definition of terrorism. No doubt, we will return to those issues in future, and I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;am sure that he will have the opportunity to make his concerns clear to the Committee again.

For an organisation to plan and commit an act of terrorism, it requires explosive devices, munitions or a combination of the two and they must be purchased, and in making such a donation, the hon. Gentleman is therefore providing the organisation with the wherewithal to do so. I would be very anxious if we lost his services. I might have made a financial contribution to the Karen National Liberation Army and therefore I also speak with the authentic voice of self-interest in the matter.

 The Minister is being very good natured and generous in these exchanges, which is seriously appreciated, but we must be careful about the use of the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;word &quot;remote&quot; as though that disposed of the argument.

 I just want to respond to the question asked by the hon. Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine (Sir Robert Smith). The clause provides for such a penalty because an act preparatory to an act of terrorism, which can wipe out the lives of innocent men, women and children, is serious. It is quite right for such a serious act to carry the highest possible penalty.

The words &quot;shall be liable&quot; in subsection (3) effectively mean that a person shall be at risk, on conviction on indictment, of imprisonment for life, so the sentence could be anything from a probation order to imprisonment for life.

 I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his intervention. We have had many such discussions in&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the past. It is of course not for us to define precisely what the penalty should be.

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_13">&quot;A person commits an offence if . . . he provides instruction or training in any of the skills mentioned in subsection (3); and . . . at the time he provides the instruction or training, he knows or suspects that a person receiving it intends to use the skills in which he is being instructed or trained . . . for or in connection with the commission or preparation of acts of terrorism or Convention offences; or . . . for assisting the commission or preparation by others of such acts or offences.&quot;</p>

<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_14">&quot;the making, handling or use of a noxious substance, or of substances of a description of such substances . . . the use of any method or technique for doing anything else that is capable of being done for the purposes of terrorism . . . and . . . the design or adaptation for the purposes of terrorism, or in connection with the commission or preparation of an act of terrorism or Convention offence, of any method or technique for doing anything.&quot;</p>

<a name="51103-17_para5">
<a name="stpa_115">The Minister will be aware of examples of the people about whom we are talking that spring to mind from experience, such as somebody who trains someone else in chemistry, which enables that person to make explosives. Another example is someone who might train someone else to fly a small aircraft, to which could be attached crop-spraying equipment through which noxious biological or chemical substances could be distributed. A further example is someone who teaches someone else to fly, and then the plane might be used as a missile, as happened in the events of 2001&nbsp;in the United States. The range is vast.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-17_para6">
<a name="stpa_116">I do not suppose that the House of Commons would have any trouble criminalising someone who, in the knowledge that an individual was asking for instruction in any of the areas to which I have referred, knew also that that knowledge would be used for the purposes of terrorism. There would be no difficulty in saying that such a person should be treated as a criminal if they had that knowledge. However, the way in which the Government have worded the clause means that it applies not only to someone who knows, but to someone who suspects. The use of the word &quot;suspicion&quot; in this instance can be very wide. Many things can give rise to suspicion, but suspicion in itself need not necessarily be grounded in fact. Someone may suspect someone else, but it may turn out that they are wrong. Suspicion is when we start feeling a little uneasy.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-17_para7">
<a name="stpa_117">There are some obvious examples. There is that of a teacher of chemistry at university giving a lecture to students. The teacher is dealing with substances that could be used for explosive purposes. A student in the room asks him a question, which although it might have an innocent explanation also suggests that he might have an interest in explosive properties. Experience of chemistry students at university suggests that many of them have a great deal of interest in the explosive properties of some of the substances that they use, but for frivolous purposes rather than terrorism.

<a name="51103-17_para8">
<a name="stpa_118">As I read the way in which the clause is drafted, unless the university lecturer immediately says to the class, &quot;I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;am sorry, but this class cannot continue with the presence of the individual who asked that question&quot;, he would have committed a criminal offence. I do not think that that can be the way that the Government intend the provision to work in practice. No doubt we shall be told again about the discretion of the Director of Public

<a name="51103-17_para9">
<a name="stpa_119">One approach is that of amendment No. 57, which would provide that an offence cannot be committed merely on suspicion&#151;there has to be actual knowledge. However, although that amendment is the lead amendment in the group that is before us, it is not my favoured route. The Minister will be aware that other legislation we have considered, especially money laundering provisions, also had &quot;knows&quot; or &quot;suspects&quot; as the grounds for the commission of many criminal offences&#151;but it did at least have the saving clause that if someone believed that it was not his job to stop something, he should instead report his suspicion to a relevant authority.

<p>
<a name="51103-17_para10">
<a name="stpa_120">That, too, is far from ideal. The point has been well&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;made by the academic lobbies that have written, I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;suspect, to many right hon. and hon.

<a name="stpa_121">The anxiety that has been expressed from many academic quarters&#151;I could quote the publication if the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Minister so wished&#151;about the implications of the clause is real. Amendment No. 58&nbsp;tries to deal with that by providing:


</p>
<ul>

 Clearly, the university lecturers are not making a frivolous point.

 That is right. We know from the past that many of the experts in weapons of mass destruction in Iraq&#151;technical engineers&#151;were trained at Imperial college. The foundations of the Iraqi nuclear research programme were based on the knowledge of the students who had been on the relevant courses, to such an extent that I understand that now there is an informal system of regulation to try to provide a degree of vetting of those who undertake courses that may be particularly sensitive in terms of technology being imparted to such people.

<p>
<a name="51103-18_para0">
<a name="stpa_124">These are real issues, which I acknowledge, but we&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;must live in the real world. A university lecturer who&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is delivering a course is placed in a difficult position if he begins to worry about a perfectly ordinary undergraduate. It is the same for someone who is training someone else to fly a small aircraft. The worry for him is that if something subsequently emerges about the individual, the chain will be followed up in exactly the same way as it was after the events of September 2001. He will then be questioned and might even be prosecuted and liable to 10&nbsp;years&#039; imprisonment. The Government must provide a let-out clause to ensure that people are not placed in an impossible position.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-18_para1">
<a name="stpa_125">The reality of most contractual relationships is that if a student pays money to acquire a skill, the classes cannot be discontinued half way through because it is thought that he is an unsavoury character. Either there has to be a fail-safe mechanism so that the student can be reported and the teacher told whether he should continue with the classes, or there must be some protection under the law. That is what amendment No.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;58 is designed to achieve.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-18_para2">
<a name="stpa_126">I take amendment No. 58&nbsp;seriously and regard it as more than a probing amendment. Unless the Minister can provide me with some assurance that the Government will reconsider this issue between now and next Wednesday, or can give me a positive response in this debate, I intend to put the amendment to the vote. There must be a safeguard that enables people to report to their employer or to someone in authority, saying, &quot;I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;am troubled by this student but I cannot really say anything more about it.&quot; That person would know that he was protected and would not subsequently be open to prosecution.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-18_para3">
<a name="stpa_127">The same thing, but in rather a different context, will apply to attendance at a terrorist training camp. I am sure that we all agree that that should be made a criminal offence. There is ample evidence that individuals have attended places that provide terrorist training&#151;they went there because they wanted to be trained as terrorists. The difficulty arises over what happens if individuals find themselves at a place of terrorist training for good, valid or innocent reasons. There is no mechanism in clause 8&nbsp;for any exoneration of such a person. The only fall-back position will be the discretion of, presumably, the Attorney-General&#151;I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hope that the terrorist training place is abroad, but I suppose that it could be in the UK&#151;or the DPP not to prosecute. There is a way through that difficulty that improves the clause, and that is what amendment No. 59&nbsp;is designed to achieved. It states:

: I have some sympathy with the amendment, which is seeking to tease out the purpose of the clause. However, I am cautious about paragraph (b) because it is very broad. Anyone who merely sought instruction could use the defence that they were gathering information about instruction or training.

 A different wording is, of course, possible, and I am happy to listen to any variants that the Minister may suggest. There is nothing sacred in being a journalist, just as there is nothing sacred in being a Member of Parliament or anything else. Categorising journalists as a separate group is not necessarily helpful. Someone may wish to be present to gather information about instruction or training, and an undercover journalist is an obvious example. However, I do not see&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;why the provision should be restricted. I fully acknowledge that it may provide a get-out clause because people could claim that they attended the camp only to gather information. A jury, however, would ask, &quot;For what purpose?&quot; A coherent reason&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;would have to be provided. A BBC journalist, for example, could say that they had heard about a camp. The police were not interested, so they sent an undercover journalist to find out what was happening. If someone simply says that they went along because they were intrigued they are unlikely to be believed. Alternatively, someone could say that they heard what was going on and were worried about it, so they decided to find out what was happening before tipping off the authorities. That person needs to be covered as well as the journalist.

 The hon. Gentleman makes a good point. I suggested that in our legal system traditionally the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;burden of proof lies with the prosecution who, on the whole, must prove a case. There are examples in criminal law, however, where once the main facts are established the burden of proof can be reversed, although never beyond the test of reasonable doubt. On the balance of probabilities, the defendant must give a&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;legitimate reason for doing something. I share the hon. Gentleman&#039;s discomfort because I am not usually in favour of such legislation, but the Government have a difficulty in dealing with a particular problem. Proving beyond reasonable doubt that someone was at a camp for the purpose of gaining instruction can be a very hard test. If the purpose behind the clause is to deter people from going to camps abroad to receive terrorist training, the Government are entitled to wield a heavy club.

<a name="stpa_131">The hon. Member for Beaconsfield strikes exactly the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;right balance in his amendments to clause 8.

<br>&nbsp;<br>people&#039;s suspicions. Amendment No. 42&nbsp;offers a small measure of protection, because any such suspicion must be reasonable&#151;it does not cover suspicions borne of prejudice or mere fancy. The common theme of clauses 6&nbsp;and 8&#151;we dealt with it at length yesterday&#151;is that it is all too easy to blunder unknowingly into a situation and fall foul of the legislation. I cannot see that that is what the Government intend, but it is unfortunately the consequence of the clauses&#039; drafting. As hon. Members said yesterday in the context of clause 1, people must be&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;able to regulate their conduct according to this legislation, which, frankly, is not possible at the moment.

<a name="stpa_132">The concern that I seek to highlight in relation to clause 8&nbsp;relates to &quot;legitimate research purposes&quot; and investigative journalism, which often performs an important function in these situations. The Government might believe that suspicions should be investigated not by journalists but by the appropriate authorities. We all&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;know that in the real world matters can often be rather more complicated. The British Government of the day might choose, perhaps because of some wider concern, to ignore something that is going on in another&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;country that constitutes a training place for terrorism. Yesterday, we spoke about Uzbekistan. The Government of Uzbekistan have had the benefit of a great deal of very benign doubt from the British Government, if I may put it like that. Who is to say that, if a training camp were to be established in Uzbekistan, we might not go looking too hard for it? An investigative journalist, however, might want to undertake some sort of expos&#233;, but, under the clause, he or she could feel constrained from legitimately exercising professional freedom.

I suspect that often in such circumstances a lecturer would initially downplay his or her suspicions because they did not want to cause offence in a social sense, but they would then be committing an offence in the legal sense, and there should be a middle ground, such as is set out in amendment No. 58, although I am not sure that its wording is quite right. Such suspicions could be reported to someone in authority, with the lecturer saying, &quot;I haven&#039;t yet confronted the student, but I want to alert you to the fact that I think that they are taking a rather unprincipled interest in the chemistry I am teaching them.&quot;

 The hon.

The range is vast, so how will the providers of such training decide whether they should suspect someone? There is a question about the degree to which they should suspect that people engaging in otherwise entirely legitimate and innocent activities are engaged in preparation for terrorism. I understand that terrorists often engage in such innocent activities for the purposes of team building and to increase a feeling of camaraderie. They might engage in such activities as part of a larger group. There is a lack of clarity for training providers.

<a name="stpa_136">A further question that I worry about is not directly related to the clause, but if a group of young Asian men, possibly Muslims, turn up in white, Welsh-speaking north Wales to go white-water rafting, is the provider of the activity to suspect them merely because they are a group of young Asian males?

</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-19_para7">
<a name="stpa_137">The Bill gives itself a universal jurisdiction and seeks to cast the net very widely over potential suspects. Many of us who represent inner-city constituencies are familiar with accusations that places such as community centres and mosques are being used for terrorist training&#151;it is easy to make such an accusation, in the same way as it is&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;easy for people to accuse their neighbours of being drug dealers. We must therefore be&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;extremely careful in drawing the net so widely that people are automatically guilty by association. I appreciate that any prosecution must occur within the terms of the Attorney-General&#039;s decision, but the matter poses some serious dangers.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-19_para8">
<a name="stpa_138">The Bill says that anyone who has visited a terrorist training camp anywhere in world is guilty by association, and I think that amendment No. 59 probably helps with&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that problem. I have visited a number of refugee camps in central America that were characterised by their opponents and neighbouring Governments as terrorist training camps. During the war in El Salvador, El&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Salvadorian refugee camps in Honduras were routinely accused of being terrorist training camps. I do not believe that they were terrorist training camps, but the accusation was and is made frequently. The Bill could lead to doubtful hearsay evidence of attendance at such places being used to accuse and prosecute somebody. The Minister must think carefully about amendment No. 59, which would improve clause 8.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-19_para9">
<a name="stpa_139">My final point applies to the whole Bill. The tenor of the Bill is to try to charge people as widely as possible with advocacy of, preparation for or association with terrorism, which will alienate large numbers of people who already feel quite alienated from normal British society. Many young Muslims who live in inner-urban areas already feel alienated. Are they in danger of being prosecuted for attending classes in which someone speaks or going to a community centre where it is alleged that training activities have taken place? We could end up not only criminalising the innocent by detaining

<br>&nbsp;<br>them for 90&nbsp;days without charge, but reducing the likelihood of co-operation with the authorities on genuine cases in which someone is seriously planning to commit criminal acts either in this country or anywhere else. We should learn from the experience in Northern Ireland between 1968&nbsp;and 1971, when alienation grew so rapidly that it led to 20&nbsp;years of troubles. I fear that we will alienate people who do not want to be alienated and who want to live in a decent, free-speaking, democratic society, because we are in danger of driving them in the other direction.

<a name="stpa_141">The Committee knows that it is a requirement of the Council of Europe convention on the prevention of terrorism, to which the UK is a signatory, to criminalise terrorist training. A number of those offences are already contained within British law in section 54&nbsp;of the Terrorism Act 2000, which relates to weapons training, among other things. Clause 6&nbsp;adds to section 54&nbsp;of the 2000&nbsp;Act to close the gap on other forms of training for terrorist purposes. That includes training to use noxious or hazardous substances, providing training in certain skills, methods and techniques where one knows or suspects that the person receiving the training is doing so for the purposes of terrorism and receiving any of that training with the intention of using it for terrorist purposes. There is currently no specific offence relating to attendance at a terrorist training camp, and clause 8&nbsp;is intended to close that gap by criminalising attendance at such a camp.

<p>
<a name="51103-20_para3">
<a name="stpa_143">Amendment No. 57&nbsp;removes any concept of suspicion, which, as the hon. Member for Beaconsfield has acknowledged, would significantly narrow the scope of the offence. If someone does not know that terrorist training is taking place, they will not be caught by the offence. If we remove the word, &quot;suspects&quot;, however, the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;offence would not cover someone who provides training and who has every reason to suspect, but does not know as an absolute fact, that their students are planning to use their skills for terrorist purposes. What is more, that person could continue to provide such training with impunity for as long as their suspicions do not turn into certain knowledge, which is not a satisfactory situation.

<a name="51103-20_para5">
<a name="stpa_145">Amendment No. 89&nbsp;takes a rather different approach. It retains, rightly, the concept of suspicion, but would qualify it with the word &quot;reasonably&quot;. That is not necessary. Whether or not somebody suspects is simply a fact that the prosecution would have to prove in a given case.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-20_para6">
<a name="stpa_146">Amendment No. 58&nbsp;would provide a defence of informing the police&#151;or, in the case of an employee, the employer&#151;of that suspicion. I understand the intention behind it, which is to provide a defence to those who take steps to make others aware, but it is unnecessary. In reality, it is highly unlikely that someone who had been to the police and reported his suspicions would ever be prosecuted. I doubt that the consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions would be forthcoming in such circumstances. However, we would certainly not want a person who had reported their suspicions to the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;police to have carte blanche. Their suspicions could be reported in such a way as to play those suspicions down, or they could be so ambiguous that the police would find it difficult to follow them up, and the trainer could then carry on providing the terrorist training with impunity. Even if he was given ever-stronger reasons for knowing that the training would be used for terrorist purposes, he would fall outside the scope of the clause if the amendment were to be made.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-20_para7">
<a name="stpa_147">I turn to the amendments to clause 8. On amendment No. 42, it is certainly not the Government&#039;s intention to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;catch people who could not reasonably be expected to know that they were at a training camp. Subsection (2) 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>3 Nov 2005 : Column 1015</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>provides that in order for an offence under the clause to be committed, the prosecution has to prove that the person knew or believed that training for terrorist purposes was taking place, or could not reasonably have failed to be aware of that. If the person had no reasonable grounds for believing that he was at a place where terrorist training was taking place, clearly he would not have committed any offence. The first part of the amendment is therefore unnecessary.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-20_para8">
<a name="stpa_148">The second part of the amendment would provide a defence of attending a terrorist camp &quot;for legitimate research purposes.&quot; That would create a major loophole, to say nothing of a significant definitional headache for the courts in having to interpret it. The Government do not believe that attendance at a terrorist training camp can ever be considered legitimate. It has been suggested, not least during this debate, that attendance at such a camp, perhaps by journalists or by a non-governmental organisation, may be considered valid. However, we consider that attendance at terrorist training camps by such individuals lends legitimacy to such groups and creates an environment in which terrorism may flourish. That is wholly wrong. The Government do not consider that there can be justifiable reasons for knowingly attending a terrorist training camp at which individuals are trained in acts of terror that would lead to innocent people losing their lives. Terrorism is not a valid form of political expression, in this country or abroad.

<p>
<a name="51103-21_para0">
<a name="stpa_152">The Government&#039;s argument to my hon.

</p>








<p><a name="st_225"><a name="51103-21_spnew2"><b> Sir Robert Smith: </b> 
 The Minister seems unwilling to address the point that someone might be attending the terrorist camp with the express purpose of exposing it and trying to get it closed down to prevent the threat of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;terrorism.

 If somebody has reason to believe that they know where a training camp is, they should report it to the authorities so that they can deal with it. It is not for an individual journalist to go on a maverick expedition to ascertain the truth.

<p>
<a name="51103-21_para3">
<a name="stpa_155">Amendment No. 59&nbsp;deals also with those who may, against their will, be at a place where terrorist training occurs. Again, I am not sure that that is necessary because clause 8&nbsp;provides that a person commits an offence if he &quot;attends&quot; a place where training occurs. Attendance implies voluntary participation rather than being kidnapped or held against one&#039;s will. Attendance implies that the person has some intention of being there. The context is important but the change would create a loophole, which terrorists would not be slow to exploit.

The said individual could be aware of his attendance on the site but engaged in a wholly unrelated activity.

<p><a name="st_230"><a name="51103-21_spnew7"><b> Paul Goggins: </b> 
 I repeat that attendance implies a voluntary presence. That is clear. Anybody who is held against their will would not be caught by the clause. However, those who are there voluntarily, in whatever role, will be caught.

<p><a name="st_231"><a name="51103-21_spnew8"><b> Ms Keeble: </b> 
 I want to consider the point about the journalists and the mad trips. If journalists had heard a rumour that something might be going on but there was no substantial suspicion, gained entry to the relevant place, found that training was happening and then left, they would not be caught by the clause because they had left and reported the matter. It would therefore be possible for journalists to act, provided that they did not&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;knowingly enter something that was obviously a terrorist training camp. Is that how the clause would work?
</p>








<p><a name="st_232"><a name="51103-21_spnew9"><b> Paul Goggins: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is right. Journalists who found themselves in a terrorist training camp, realised what was happening, left and reported its existence to the authorities, would clearly not be caught by the offence. However, if they remained there, they could be caught. As I have made abundantly clear, if people know that terrorist training is taking place but continue to participate and be present there freely, not against their will, they could and should be caught by the clause.

<a name="stpa_156">I stress to the hon. Member for Beaconsfield that my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary and I are prepared further to consider the point about the chemistry teacher or lecturer that my hon. Friend the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Member for Wolverhampton, South-West raised to ensure that the Bill contains the assurance that we all want. As to the rest, the hon. Gentleman must make his own decision.
</p>








<p><a name="st_233"><a name="51103-21_spnew10"><b> Mr. Grieve: </b> 
 I have listened carefully to the Under-Secretary. He knows that I did not intend to press amendment No. 57&nbsp;to the vote because I accept that&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;suspects&quot; is necessary. We should therefore concentrate on the safeguards that may provide a let-out for those who would otherwise be criminalised.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-21_para5">
<a name="stpa_157">I am slightly reassured by the Under-Secretary&#039;s comments on the point about the university lecturer. However, that slight reassurance is heavily tempered by his suggestion that our proposal would create ambiguity in that someone could report a suspicion to the police but continue to help in training in the knowledge that it was intended for terrorist purposes. That is rather far fetched and I am unable to accept it. Let us consider the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;basis for the money-laundering provisions. For all I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;know, solicitors or accountants may report suspicion in the belief that they could be exonerated from subsequent participation. The Under-Secretary&#039;s 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>3 Nov 2005 : Column 1018</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>argument would be equally valid in that case, yet the Government were happy to provide a framework similar to our proposal.
</p>








<p><a name="st_234"><a name="51103-21_spnew11"><b> John Bercow: </b> 
 I wonder whether I understood my hon. Friend correctly because the scenario that he outlined is even more bizarre than I imagined. Does he suggest that the Under-Secretary depicted a scenario in which an individual is so foolish or reckless as to notify the state of the existence of a training centre of which it is not aware only to continue his nefarious activities there? He would be something of a chancer.
</p>








<p><a name="st_235"><a name="51103-21_spnew12"><b> Mr. Grieve: </b> 
 The Under-Secretary certainly appeared to imply that. He argued that my suggestion that people who had a suspicion could escape prosecution by showing that they had told their employer, the head of the department where they were working in the case of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the university lecturer, or the police, was somehow not appropriate because it would facilitate such training. For that reason, I intend to press amendment No. 58&nbsp;to the vote because I want to encourage the Under-Secretary in the review that he will conduct between now and next Wednesday. Similarly, I shall seek to press amendment No. 59&nbsp;to a vote thereafter, with your leave, Mr. Cook, because there is a real issue involved here in respect of attendance at a place where terrorist training takes place. So, with the leave of the Committee, I seek to withdraw amendment No. 57, and I hope that I shall be able, initially, to put amendment No. 58&nbsp;to the vote.

<p><a name="st_260"><a name="51103-23_spnew6"><b> Paul Goggins: </b> 
 I wrote earlier this week to the right hon. Member for Haltemprice and Howden (David Davis) and the hon. Member for Winchester (Mr. Oaten) to explain the purpose of these amendments. The clause makes it a criminal offence to trespass on a licensed nuclear site. By their very nature, such sites contain hazardous material and hazardous activities are carried out there. Although all sites are guarded, unauthorised entry deflects the guard force from its primary duty of securing the site and could also be used by terrorists as cover for an attack. Unauthorised entry to sites could lead to dangers to individuals, not only from the possibility of injury from the plant and equipment present, but from the risk that they could be seen as a terrorist threat and met with an appropriate response. The Government therefore believe that it is right that in the current climate we do what we can to strengthen the security regimes at those sites.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-23_para2">
<a name="stpa_162">As currently drafted, the offence will apply to all areas of a licensed nuclear site, plus to any other premises that&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sit within the secure perimeter boundary. That is because sometimes, the fences can sit just outside the area of the licensed site. Since the Bill was introduced, we have looked again at the provisions with a view to ensuring that no more land is covered than is strictly necessary.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-23_para3">
<a name="stpa_163">At a small number of licensed nuclear sites, there are significant pieces of land which are part of the licensed site&#151;

 But outside.
</p>








<p><a name="st_262"><a name="51103-23_spnew8"><b> Paul Goggins: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman reads my mind. There are some parts that sit outside the security perimeter.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-23_para4">
<a name="stpa_164">No licensable activities have ever taken place on that land; indeed, sometimes it is used by members of the public, under local arrangements with the site operator. It has never been the Government&#039;s intention to have the criminal offence of trespass apply to activity outside the secure perimeter boundary at nuclear sites, and it is clearly important that the premises to which the new offence applies should be evident and unambiguous.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-23_para5">
<a name="stpa_165">The group of four amendments will make it clear that the criminal offence applies only to trespass beyond the secure perimeter that is relied on to protect the nuclear site from intruders.
</p>








<p><a name="st_263"><a name="51103-23_spnew9"><b> Jeremy Corbyn: </b> 
 The amendment suggests that anyone outside the perimeter fence, whether at Fylingdales or somewhere else, would not be guilty of trespass. At what point, as they approach the fence, do they become trespassers? Do they have to touch the fence, climb it,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;look at it, hang something from it, cut it&#151;[Hon.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members: &quot;Sit on it?&quot;] That does not often happen in this place. Will the Minister clarify the amendment?
</p>








<p><a name="st_264"><a name="51103-23_spnew10"><b> Paul Goggins: </b> 
 I hope that I can clarify things to my hon. Friend&#039;s satisfaction. When people are outside the security perimeter any invasion beyond the perimeter fence would be an offence, but if they were on the licensed site, outside the perimeter fence, they would not 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>3 Nov 2005 : Column 1028</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>be caught by the offence. We want it to be clear that the perimeter fence is what counts. Any movement beyond the perimeter fence would be caught by the measure.
</p>








<p><a name="st_265"><a name="51103-23_spnew11"><b> Jeremy Corbyn: </b> 
 May I press the Minister a little on the matter? I have some experience of visiting nuclear sites and I want to know at what point I could become a criminal. If a group of wholly innocent people were encamped outside AWE Aldermaston to protest about the development of a new generation of nuclear weapons and if, to protect themselves from rain and wind, they attached the edge of a tarpaulin to an outside perimeter fence, but had not crossed the fence, would they be committing a criminal act?
</p>








<p><a name="st_266"><a name="51103-23_spnew12"><b> Paul Goggins: </b> 
 If they remained outside the perimeter fence they would not be caught by the offence, although I imagine that the people responsible for the site might want to engage them in discussion about the tarpaulin that they had put up against the fence. Provided they&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;remained outside the fence, they would not be committing an offence under these provisions.

 Perhaps I can help the Minister. Unless the law has changed, the hon.

I do not know whether that is helpful or whether the Minister agrees; perhaps he would like to tell me.
</p>








<p><a name="st_271"><a name="51103-23_spnew17"><b> Paul Goggins: </b> 
 We seem to be getting into deeper water than anticipated. I think that my hon. Friend the Member for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor) wanted to intervene&#151;

<p><a name="st_273"><a name="51103-23_spnew19"><b> Paul Goggins: </b> 
 As does the hon. Gentleman. This is sparking a lively and interesting discussion. I do not know how many times I shall need to say that the point at which people go beyond the fence is when they will be&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;guilty of an offence under the clause. As long as they&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;remain outside the fence, even if the site is licensed, they will not be committing an offence.
</p>








<p><a name="st_274"><a name="51103-23_spnew20"><b> David Taylor: </b> 
 One of the branches of pure mathematics that I greatly enjoyed was topology. At what point does the fence end and outside the fence start? That is a serious point. Does being outside the fence include touching it or putting one&#039;s fingers through it? Will my hon. Friend define the helpful definition that we heard a few moments ago of a substantial intrusion through the fence, so that innocent protesters are not caught by the clause?
</p>








<p><a name="st_275"><a name="51103-23_spnew21"><b> Paul Goggins: </b> 
 The hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve) may be more familiar than me with the

<br>&nbsp;<br>precise wording, but there would have to be substantial entry beyond the fence. That is clear. My understanding is that the individuals concerned would physically have to go beyond the fence; in that sense there would need to be substantial entry to the site. In fact, the amendments are intended to be helpful and to clarify where people would not be committing an offence, whereas if we left the Bill as it is, they would be committing an offence even if they stood outside the perimeter fence and were on a licensed site.

 My fear is that this is a rather academic argument. [Hon.

Experience outside RAF Fairford in Gloucestershire shows that people can be arrested under previous terrorism legislation simply for wandering around outside a designated area.

<p><a name="st_277"><a name="51103-24_spnew0"><b> Paul Goggins: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman may regard this as an academic exercise. The Government&#039;s intention is to make it clear that those who may be outside a perimeter fence but on a licensed site are not committing an offence. If we left the Bill as drafted, they would be doing so. We do not think that fair or appropriate. We want to clarify the law, and I hope that the Committee will find these amendments helpful.
</p>








<p><a name="st_278"><a name="51103-24_spnew1"><b> Mr. David Drew  (Stroud) (Lab/Co-op):</b> 
 I apologise for missing the earlier remarks; I was in Westminster Hall. Will the Minister clarify what happens when a site is de-licensed. From my dealings with British Nuclear Fuels Ltd over the years, I think that the rights of someone to enter such a site are perfectly clear at the moment. If the status of a site changes, will the provision remain in place, or will it go, as the site is de-licensed?
</p>








<p><a name="st_279"><a name="51103-24_spnew2"><b> Paul Goggins: </b> 
 I can confirm that the provision will cease to apply when a site is de-licensed. I hope that that gives my hon. Friend the confirmation that he seeks. With that, I conclude my remarks.
</p>








<p><a name="st_280"><a name="51103-24_spnew3"><b> Mr. Grieve: </b> 
 I am delighted that the Government have moved the amendment. I had read the text as it stands and, indeed, had drafted an amendment, but I then discovered that the Government had got there first, whereupon it did not seem necessary to table such an&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;amendment myself. The Bill as drafted is deeply ambiguous about whether the provision would apply to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the area outside the perimeter fence that was subject to the current restrictions. As I understood that the Government wanted to restrict things in that way, I am delighted that they have made it clear that that is not their intention.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-24_para0">
<a name="stpa_166">As for the questions that were asked earlier, my recollection&#151;I may have this wrong&#151;is that the definition involves effective and substantial entry, so that touching the fence would not constitute entry, but cutting the fence with wire cutters and starting to crawl through it almost certainly would, apart from the fact that the criminal damage to the fence would enable one&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to be instantly arrested. As for climbing over, when one is on top of the fence is the point where one would be caught by the provisions.

<a name="51103-24_para1">
<a name="stpa_167">It may be of interest to the Committee if I add that the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;key case is called R. V. Collins, which is well known to all law students. It concerns a naked young man, wearing only socks, perched on top of a ladder that was resting on a house that he was about to enter as a burglar.

<a name="51103-24_para2">
<a name="stpa_168">I welcome what the Minister has said; and, of course, we accept these amendments.
</p>








<p><a name="st_283"><a name="51103-24_spnew6"><b> Mr. Heath: </b> 
 I also welcome these amendments&#151;they are obviously a sensible adjustment to the original text&#151;but I want to enter an appropriate reservation. The Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005 was&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;enacted not many months ago, and it is slightly disappointing to be revisiting provisions that we extensively debated so recently during the passage of that Act. I wish that we could get legislation right and encompass the correct areas in the first instance, rather than having to return to it constantly, perhaps because it was introduced in haste and with insufficient care. Other than making that point, I support these amendments.
</p>








<p><a name="st_284"><a name="51103-24_spnew7"><b> Mr. Drew: </b> 
 I want to pursue my earlier inquiry a little further.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-24_para3">
<a name="stpa_169">Our debate relates closely to what has happened at RAF Fairford, which I have visited on several occasions to talk to my constituents and others. Part of the problem surrounding the dispute and the question of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;section 44 powers under the Terrorism Act 2000 was&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;disagreement about where the actual perimeter was. During the course of the conflict&#151;it was a real conflict&#151;the authorities moved the perimeter, which forced people away from their original encampment because they were told that it was within the site perimeter.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-24_para4">
<a name="stpa_170">It might be that the boundary around nuclear sites is more established and understood, but I know from my experience at Berkeley that disputes are ongoing about exactly where the full perimeter goes. I know as someone who is trying to pursue the de-licensing of that site that&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the matter is subject to arguments about land ownership. The situation is thus not as straightforward as simply saying, &quot;This is the site, so everyone knows where they are.&quot;
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-24_para5">
<a name="stpa_171">Will the Minister clarify whether the exact perimeter of a site will have to be laid down before people are excluded from it? The matter might be fairly academic, as the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heath) suggested, but a nasty situation can arise in the case of a dispute, because people can feel that their rights are being taken away if the designation of a perimeter is changed.
</p>








<p><a name="st_285"><a name="51103-24_spnew8"><b> Jeremy Corbyn: </b> 
 I listened carefully to what the Minister said about the Government amendments. If they clarify exactly where people may be before they

<br>&nbsp;<br>become miscreants under the Bill, they will improve the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;situation. However, I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew) that there is a question about what the actual perimeter is. I heard what the Minister said about the perimeter fence, but I can envisage a situation in which the people who are protesting at the Atomic Weapons Establishment site at Aldermaston and occupying the ground and car park outside the fence could rapidly find themselves encircled owing to an increase in the size of the fence and site. One can imagine a situation of continual encroachment.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-24_para6">
<a name="stpa_172">Why is clause 12&nbsp;in the Bill at all? What is the purpose behind it? Its whole purpose seems to be an attempt to close down, limit and restrict legitimate and peaceful demonstrations against nuclear power, the development of nuclear weapons and nuclear missiles. It could criminalise many people who are undertaking legitimate protest against the immoral possession of nuclear weapons.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-24_para7">
<a name="stpa_173">When we think of the famous demonstration that took place at Greenham Common for a long time, the current demonstrations at Faslane and Aldermaston and the frequent demonstrations outside Fylingdales and several other places, we realise that we could end up&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;criminalising many people who are undertaking something that I believe to be a perfectly correct and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;moral activity. The Government should explain why nuclear sites are covered by the Bill at all. The&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government amendments represent a bit of an improvement, but as my hon. Friend the Member for Stroud pointed out, they will be open to all kinds of misinterpretation and smart fiddles at a later stage.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-24_para8">
<a name="stpa_174">Under the clause, as amended, the authorities in charge of any of the designated sites could presumably move the boundaries quite easily. What is the point at which the boundary will be registered, and who will know what it is? Will it be clearly delineated and marked? Such questions matter because the measure might cause people serious legal problems. I hope that the Minister will clarify my points, some of which have been expressed to me by many in the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament and a lot of peace protestors throughout the country.

I honestly do not see the point of the clause standing part other than gratuitously to criminalise a large body of people who act for entirely peaceful purposes and who have brought about significant political changes. That is simply not a sensible way to proceed. It will further alienate large sections of the population who do not want to be alienated, but do want to engage in serious political debate about the morality of nuclear weapons.

<a name="stpa_180">It would be helpful if the Minister explained exactly what he meant, because it appears to me that the provision is gratuitously trying to entrap large numbers of peace movement members within the ambit of terrorism. At the moment, they would probably be charged with criminal damage for breaking a fence and also trespass. Anyone who plants a bomb commits several criminal acts, not least acts preparatory to murder, which are already within the ambit of criminal law. Why, therefore, are nuclear sites and bases included in the Bill? What information is displayed outside bases to make clear the point at which someone becomes a suspect under the terrorism legislation when they cross a threshold? Will signs be put up on all those sites, and will they be designated in that way? These are serious matters as a substantial number of people may end up in prison for a long time.

 I fear that unless I explain the point it might sound frivolous when it is not. It is important that&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;people should be notified and forewarned, because I rather suspect that at the Labour party conference the individual concerned was not remotely conscious that he was within an environment in which, by virtue of his attendance and noise, he could be charged under the legislation under which it was proposed that he be charged.

As far as I can see, clause 12&nbsp;makes no mention directly of terrorism. It is an amendment to the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005. When I look at the explanatory notes for clause 12, they make no mention of terrorism or terrorists, or any such word. Will my hon.

They are not one and the same thing, and people legitimately standing outside a site might be arrested on terrorist offences because they happen to be on what is decreed to be part of the licensed site even though they may be outside the perimeter.

<a name="51103-26_para0">
<a name="stpa_181">I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Rob Marris) that this is a completely inappropriate place to introduce this change. I shall make my point as succinctly as I can. For all sorts of reasons, our nuclear establishments are secure places, but by their very nature they are working places. People who go on to them are passholders and as such they have an obligation to do their job and not in any way threaten the country by the nature of their work. As much as we are trying to keep people out, this has implications for people who work on the inside of such an establishment. I am not sure whether this measure has been thought through sufficiently. If we are talking about someone who did something as a member of staff, that could bring in the whole question of whether they were acting illegitimately and therefore threatening the country and so would be subject to the Bill and deemed to be terrorists. This is beginning to open up a can of worms. I ask the Minister, in the nicest possible way, to reconsider the clause. It may have been inserted with good purpose, but it gives rise to a lot of questions that I am not sure can be answered at this time.

 I am at a peculiar disadvantage, although I do not think that I am uniquely in that position to judge by the contributions that have been made so far.

I would go further and vouchsafe to the House that I do not have a copy of the Act or any part thereof readily to hand. However, there is a serious issue here. Clearly, clause 12&nbsp;is designed to amend the provisions of that Act passed only a short time ago this year.

 In reply to the hon.

In this country, there is a respected tradition of the right to protest, but there is no right to trespass.

<a name="stpa_184">I suspect that many of my hon. Friends, including my&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hon. Friends the Members for Islington, North (Jeremy Corbyn) and for Stroud (Mr. Drew), would not be happy with the provision, regardless of the legislation in which it was introduced. As I have said to my hon. Friend the Member for Islington, North, the offence of trespass is wider than only terrorists, but it should be extended in this Bill because someone who trespasses on a nuclear site poses a terrorist risk. The hon. Member for&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Buckingham (Mr. Bercow) said that he cannot see the relevance of clause 12, but the offence would be extremely relevant if a terrorist were to gain access to a nuclear site.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-26_para4">
<a name="stpa_185">The purpose of clause 12&nbsp;is not only criminalising people who protest, but protecting them properly. If a protester got on to a nuclear site, it may be assumed that he is a terrorist and that he presents a risk, in which case the action taken may be wholly disproportionate to what the individual concerned intended, so the fact that someone is on a nuclear site without authority puts him at risk. Clarity around the law will protect the interests of protesters, who should know where they stand and where they can and cannot go.
</p>








<p><a name="st_310"><a name="51103-26_spnew4"><b> Mr. Mike Weir  (Angus) (SNP):</b> 
 The Minister has confused me. He is discussing the presumption that someone is a terrorist if he is on a particular site. Notwithstanding the fact that that will be an offence under the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005, will such a person be detained under the provisions passed yesterday?
</p>








<p><a name="st_311"><a name="51103-26_spnew5"><b> Paul Goggins: </b> 
 Will the hon. Gentleman reflect on a situation in which somebody, whether he is a terrorist or a protestor, trespasses on to a nuclear site, and those responsible for security must make a quick decision about that individual&#039;s purpose and intent? I assume that those responsible for security would fear the worst and act accordingly. Clause 12&nbsp;makes it clear that people are not permitted to trespass on such sites and that there are consequences to doing so. The last thing that we want is for somebody who is a terrorist to stray on to a nuclear site and do dreadful harm with the machinery and power that exists there.
</p>








<p><a name="st_312"><a name="51103-26_spnew6"><b> John Bercow: </b> 
 Notwithstanding the Minister&#039;s explanation and justification, I find myself unpersuaded. Given that he prays in aid the importance of achieving clarity, will he be good enough to tell the House with what precise offence the individual would be charged if it&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;transpired that he was not a terrorist but merely a&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;trespasser? Given that the Minister refers to the consequences that must flow from the act, what would they be in terms of the range of penalties?

 As I said in response to the hon.

The signs at the site should make the legal position of anybody who trespasses very clear. I assume that that is so, but I will check to make sure. Certainly, as the new powers and new offence come into operation we will need to ensure that the information provided is accurate and up to date.
</p>








<p><a name="st_314"><a name="51103-26_spnew8"><b> Jeremy Corbyn: </b> 
 At many sites, it is clear where the fence is but not clear who owns, controls or occupies the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;land immediately outside it, so one could easily end up criminalising people for taking part in a legitimate and peaceful demonstration. Will the Minister clarify that?

<a name="stpa_188">Let me put another scenario to my hon. Friend. What if a terrorist decided to enter an unauthorised nuclear site posing as a protestor, perhaps even with other protestors?

 The Minister is extremely courteous, and I appreciate that. Given that he talks about clarity, let me probe him a little further. If the individual is not&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a terrorist and is present for what many people, including the hon. Member for Islington, North (Mr. Corbyn), would regard as a much more modest and innocent purpose, would that be reflected in the penalty that he or she might face? Will it be among the penalties in the 2005&nbsp;Act, which I do not have in front of me and would need to know more about, or is the driving criterion the seriousness of the establishment that is being attended? There is a great deal of confusion and uncertainty, and it is not only in my head.

<p><a name="st_319"><a name="51103-27_spnew1"><b> Paul Goggins: </b> 
 In order to give the hon.

It would of course be for the court to decide on the appropriate penalty in the light of all the circumstances. I would assume&#151;I think that it is a fair assumption&#151;

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>3 Nov 2005 : Column 1038</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>that if somebody was there as a protestor, albeit that he had committed an offence, the court would bear that in mind when setting the penalty. Anyone who was there and proved to be a terrorist might face an even heftier penalty because he might be guilty of other offences. I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;therefore hope that I can assure the hon.

It would be for the court to decide, but a serious penalty is associated with the specific offence because it may be appropriate.

<a name="stpa_189">I shall write to my hon. Friend the Member for Stroud and place a copy of the letter in the Library. He raised important issues on clarity about authorised sites and the perimeter fence. They require a detailed answer and I am happy to provide it.
</p>








<p><a name="st_320"><a name="51103-27_spnew2"><b> Lynne Jones  (Birmingham, Selly Oak) (Lab):</b> 
 Like many hon. Members, I am oscillating about the clause. Like my hon. Friend the Member for Stroud (Mr.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drew), I have constituents who were detained, stopped and searched and, in many cases, harassed under the Terrorism Act 2000&nbsp;for protesting peacefully outside Fairford&#151;I have good evidence that they were inappropriately harassed. I am worried that similar circumstances could arise under the Bill. Although I am clear about the boundary and I can understand that someone who crosses the boundary commits an offence, I remain unclear about the reason for including such a provision in the Terrorism Bill. If someone got over a&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;perimeter fence and proved to be a terrorist, surely he could be charged under other legislation rather than simply being charged with crossing the perimeter fence.
</p>








<p><a name="st_321"><a name="51103-27_spnew3"><b> Paul Goggins: </b> 
 Indeed, there may be other legislation. My hon. Friend the Member for Stroud speculated about someone who might be authorised to be on a specific site, for example, through working there, but had a malevolent purpose and might be a terrorist. That person would be guilty of other offences and charged appropriately. People who trespass might be guilty of other offences and charged appropriately. I hope that I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;can offer the clarity that my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Selly Oak (Lynne Jones) seeks. Her constituents, to whom the police may have spoken and intervened in their activities, would not be guilty of trespass under the clause if they were outside the perimeter fence, even if they were on a designated site.

 As the Under-Secretary should know, the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;problem at Fairford is that the police determined the perimeter around the base.

<a name="stpa_201">I can see a counter-argument, which I ask the Minister to confirm is the Government&#039;s view: if it were to be restricted, individuals who were indictable for the offences, and who could not be extradited either to their country of origin or the country in which the crime was committed because of our treaty obligations, would not be subject to due legal process. Britain would therefore provide a service in allowing for a prosecution where otherwise the person would go free because the crime of which they were accused was committed in a country that perhaps retained the death penalty, thus making extradition impossible. Will the Minister therefore confirm the categories of crime that he expects to be caught under the purpose of the clause, and that we are applying a principle of universal jurisdiction in this area? If that is the case, he will have the support of the Liberal Democrats.

<a name="51103-28_para4">
<a name="stpa_202">The effect of clause 17, as I understand it, is to make it a criminal offence for any person of any nationality to commit an act as described in the whole of part 1&nbsp;of the Bill in any part of the globe, and to make that person subject to criminal prosecution when they come to this country. Somebody yesterday described the jurisdiction being sought as extraterrestrial&#151;it does not go that far, but it is certainly extraterritorial on a grand scale. If one considers the totality of part 1, one realises that it is extraordinary that we are being asked to contemplate that proposition.

 The right hon. Gentleman has made a point that I intended to make. That is the other snag involved in relying on the Attorney-General&#039;s protection.

The Russians would certainly regard many people from the Caucasus as terrorists, and we might not find that a non-controversial assertion.

In modern times, it is possible to organise a terrorist act in a very different jurisdiction thousands of miles away. But part 1&nbsp;of the Bill, which includes this particularly difficult provision on encouraging terrorism, is not concerned with that category. I regard as utterly fatuous opening the door to Governments throughout the world making representations that a particular person in this country is &quot;encouraging&quot; terrorism&#151;in the very soft terms that this Bill uses to create that offence&#151;and demanding that we arrest the person and put them on trial in the British courts.

I put it to him that there is another concern in this context. Given that a large proportion of asylum seekers come to this country from countries where civil conflict or human rights abuse is a fact of life, is there not a real concern that if this clause is unamended, countries from which people are fleeing will demand that the terms of this legislation be used against those individuals, or that they be herded back en masse to face a pretty grim form of justice at home?

This is in no way a routine part of the Bill and I do not understand why we are being asked to give this provision universal application.

 I agree with what others have said about clause 17&nbsp;and the two amendments to it, both of which I support. We have had this discussion about extraterritorial jurisdictions before, and the turning point was the case of General Pinochet. The case for his extradition to Spain was brought here, and the historic ruling of the House of Lords was that crimes against humanity, genocide and torture were universal in their jurisdiction. That is now accepted as fact, and everyone will agree that such major crimes should be universal. But I find it bizarre that this Bill seeks to make its many catch-all clauses universal, in terms of the jurisdiction of this country.

<a name="51103-29_para0">
<a name="stpa_210">Successful asylum seekers have gained asylum and refugee status in this country because it was deemed that they would be subject to irrational, unusual or dangerous punishment if they were deported to their country of origin; that is not, however, a judgment one way or the other on what they were doing in that country. Indeed, many of us have supported asylum seekers in their right to seek asylum in this country with whose politics or religion, for example, we profoundly disagreed.

Much would depend on the current state of our relations with a country, whether some fraught issue was coming up at the United Nations on which we might require that country&#039;s support or whether some trade negotiations were imminent. If the Egyptian Government suggested that someone here was encouraging terrorism in their country through their speeches or the way in which they sang songs that appeared to glorify terrorism, or if the Turks had trouble with some Kurds living here, or the Indians had&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;trouble with some Kashmiri, the Attorney-General would have to ring the Foreign Office for the public&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;policy on whether to be helpful, friendly and co-operative with the country concerned. The Home Secretary has to do that sometimes. I remember negotiating an extradition treaty with the Indian Government that was closely bound to their relations to the Foreign Office.

 Indeed. Our obligations under the convention require that wider international context. That applies not only under the European convention but also under the UN nuclear convention. We need to consider the Bill within that wider context. The hon. Gentleman&#039;s amendments would limit the fight against terrorism only to instances where there was harm or threat of harm to a UK national. That would put the Bill out of kilter with existing legislation and would also mean that we could not prosecute those who prepare acts of terrorism against fellow human beings who are not British. For example, an attack planned against a British company in another country which employed only locally engaged staff would not be covered if the hon. Gentleman&#039;s amendments were agreed.

 Are not the extraterritorial powers and their application similar to the South African legislation under which Mark Thatcher was caught when he tried to get involved in activities in a third country?

 My hon. Friend knows more about South Africa and the reach of its laws than me, but I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;draw to her attention the fact that we have obligations under the treaties and conventions that we have signed and we need to fulfil them. The proposed legislation will enable us to do so.

 I should be very surprised indeed if there were a Council of Europe provision that mandated the inclusion of clause 17. If such exists, it is incumbent on the Minister to write to all Members specifying exactly what it is. I put to him in all sincerity that there is a circularity about the argument that he is deploying. He told my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke), in all innocence and with a degree of insouciance, that of course the Attorney-General would make judgments on those matters because that is what he does. But what I say to the Minister, and what I think my right hon. and learned Friend was saying, is that of course the Attorney-General will do what he is obliged to do by the law, but it is quite wrong to pass a clause that requires him to behave in that way. That is the point. By the way, I am sure that the Minister will not forget to deal with the 

<br>&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>issue of asylum seekers that I raised, or with the concerns expressed by the hon. Member for Bishop Auckland (Helen Goodman).
</p>








<p><a name="st_374"><a name="51103-31_spnew1"><b> Paul Goggins: </b> 
 I hope to have the opportunity to do so in due course, and I am certainly happy to clarify the issue in writing to the hon. Gentleman, with copies placed in the Library for other hon. Members to look at.

<a name="stpa_225">What reciprocity is there with any other country in the world that has sought universal jurisdiction for any&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;offence committed under some form of terrorist legislation? How does the provision fit in with the normal extradition process?
</p>








<p><a name="st_376"><a name="51103-31_spnew3"><b> Paul Goggins: </b> 
 The hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve) mentioned the new world order. We are dealing with a challenge of global proportions, and in meeting that challenge, it is important that we draw up agreements with one another across the international stage and that we honour those agreements. In passing clause 17, we would put into effect a number of our obligations under existing conventions and agreements.
</p>








<p><a name="st_377"><a name="51103-31_spnew4"><b> Mr. Kenneth Clarke: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman wisely cited his strongest point when he talked about the preparation of terrorist acts, which is covered by the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill. Speaking for myself, I would be prepared to contemplate British courts having jurisdiction over someone who came here if they were guilty of preparing to carry out a terrorist activity elsewhere. I hope that, before Report, he will try to think what the arguments are for extending that to the encouragement of terrorism, with all the arguments that we had about it yesterday, or to attendance at training places, given that he has said today that any kind of innocent attendance at a training centre is a loophole in the law that cannot be conceded. So a humanitarian worker is guilty of a criminal offence unless he leaves immediately when he suspects that some men are coming in from the woods in the evening and training somewhere on the edge of the village. Extending the proposal to those sorts of offence in the whole of part 1&nbsp;makes clause 17&nbsp;ridiculous and will impose all kinds of diplomatic and political problems for the Attorney-General and other Ministers as soon as other Governments realise that they can pursue their enemies here and try to get them arrested.
</p>








<p><a name="st_378"><a name="51103-31_spnew5"><b> Paul Goggins: </b> 
 I know from the right hon. and learned Gentleman&#039;s earlier comments, which he now reinforces, that he has serious reservations about the range of offences covered by clause 17. I do not share his view that some bits of terrorism are more important or serious than others. If anyone participates at whatever level in either preparing for or carrying out an act of terror that results in the loss of innocent lives, that is a serious role and it needs to be covered by the Bill. Of course the court will take a decision about the appropriate penalty in the given circumstances of the case. I do not agree with him that some offences should be excluded and others included. The range of offences that we have included is fair.

<br>&nbsp;<br>prosecuted in this country for an offence is prosecuted only if sufficient evidence can be adduced in court to mount such a prosecution. Cases cannot be spurious: there must be proper and serious evidence. Clearly, if an offence that is caught by the provision is committed abroad, the evidence to prosecute here must come from abroad. However, of course, the evidence must fit our rules of evidence. If a case is tried in a UK court, the UK rules of evidence apply even though the evidence may have come from another country. The provision is not unusual. It applies to sections 62, 63&nbsp;and 66&nbsp;of the Terrorism Act 2000. So this is not a new power; it already exists. Clearly, we must apply the same rules of evidence as those that apply normally in our courts, even though the evidence may have come from another country because that is where the act was carried out.

<a name="stpa_227">The hon. Member for Buckingham (John Bercow) and my hon. Friend the Member for Bishop Auckland (Helen Goodman) asked about the way in which the Bill will interact with the Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Bill. Although they are two separate measures, I can appreciate how they interconnect. The Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Bill will allow people to be excluded on the basis of acts carried out overseas, but people who come here as asylum seekers may be prosecuted under this Bill if they have committed an offence under it. Such people may be prosecuted, but whether they could be excluded would be another matter because of our obligations in such circumstances.
</p>








<p><a name="st_379"><a name="51103-31_spnew6"><b> Mr. Geoffrey Cox  (Torridge and West Devon) (Con):</b> 
 Does that not mean that the very reason why someone might be seeking refuge in this country could be the basis&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on which he is prosecuted when he arrives here seeking asylum? As my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve) said, the measure is dangerous nonsense.
</p>








<p><a name="st_380"><a name="51103-31_spnew7"><b> Paul Goggins: </b> 
 What the hon. Gentleman says is true. People who come here to seek asylum who have carried out terrorist acts may be prosecuted in a court in this country if there is sufficient evidence. However, it is equally true that under our international obligations, such people could not be excluded if there was a threat that their lives could be taken if they were returned to their country of origin. The two processes are not contradictory. People who apply for asylum may receive it, but they cannot be excluded if there would be any risk to their life if they were returned to their country of origin.
</p>








<p><a name="st_381"><a name="51103-31_spnew8"><b> Mr. Denham: </b> 
 Does not my hon. Friend realise that the provision could cover people who had not taken part in any terrorist activity at all in the other country, but had glorified terrorism, which might not even have been an offence in that country? If such people came here as asylum seekers, however, they would be guilty of an offence and thus face seven years in jail. It is ludicrous to jail people in this country for doing something in another country that is not an offence there, but the Bill makes that possible.
</p>








<p><a name="st_382"><a name="51103-31_spnew9"><b> Paul Goggins: </b> 
 I do not dispute what my right hon. Friend says&#151;he explains the situation clearly. A person who was in this country and had committed an offence 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>3 Nov 2005 : Column 1052</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>by glorifying acts of terror could be caught under the Bill due to the international obligations that are being put into effect. That is a proportionate and reasonable response to the threat of terrorism that exists not just in this country, but in many countries throughout the world. We need a proper response to that terrorism.
</p>








<p><a name="st_383"><a name="51103-31_spnew10"><b> John Bercow: </b> 
 I am genuinely astonished by the Minister&#039;s response to the right hon. Member for Southampton, Itchen (Mr. Denham). He agreed with the thrust of the description of the position that the right hon. Gentleman pithily gave, but then dissented from the right hon. Gentleman&#039;s verdict on that description. It is extraordinary that someone should be incarcerated here for something that is not illegal in the other country. I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;politely put it to the hon. Gentleman, who has served with distinction as a prisons Minister, that there are great pressures on the Prison Service, but we are not a prison service for the world.
</p>








<p><a name="st_384"><a name="51103-31_spnew11"><b> Paul Goggins: </b> 
 I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his comment. I was giving an honest response to my right hon. Friend the Member for Southampton, Itchen, but it might well be that there is still disagreement between us. I take people who glorify and encourage acts of terror that result in the loss of people&#039;s lives&#151;in whatever country they are, whatever their nationality and whatever their origin&#151;very seriously. The Bill puts&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in place powers to enable us to deal with that not just here, but internationally. It gives effect to the obligations to which we have signed up through the various conventions to which I referred.
</p>








<p><a name="st_385"><a name="51103-31_spnew12"><b> Ms Keeble: </b> 
 May I flag up the opposite position to that put forward by other hon. Members? It is clear from several decisions of appeal tribunals that some people who apply for asylum here have been involved in activities that would rightly be considered to be offences under the Bill. Most of us would accept that the behaviour of some of those people has been unacceptable, but their lives could be at risk if they were deported. We must ensure that there is justice on both sides of the equation.

<p><a name="st_388"><a name="51103-32_spnew2"><b> Mr. Heath: </b> 
 We have had an interesting debate. I began by saying that I was moving a probing amendment. Goodness, we probed! The amendment has had the effect of probing a hornets&#039; nest. We are now clear that what the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Minister is proposing goes well beyond what is necessary to meet international obligations. It goes well&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;beyond what some of us would see as a sensible extension of extraterritorial jurisdiction&#151;I almost said extraterrestrial again, to please the right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke)&#151;in dealing effectively with those who commit or are to a serious extent planning terrorist offences abroad.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-32_para2">
<a name="stpa_230">Points have been made about the difficulty of those who seek asylum in our country. It is right that if someone is a terrorist they should not be given asylum in the United Kingdom. The problem with the Bill is that it goes well beyond the convention definitions of terrorism and introduces offences in this country that would be unknown to any other jurisdiction. It extends the scope well beyond that which is reasonable to exclude people from asylum in this country on that basis. That worries me. People have to give a truthful answer when they are asked what their experiences are in their country of origin when they apply for asylum. They are required to give evidence that will then be used to prosecute them because they have encouraged someone or a group within their country, whose members they believe to be freedom fighters in the context of their country&#039;s circumstances but in British law will be termed a terrorist organisation. That poses real problems.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-32_para3">
<a name="stpa_231">As I have said, the difficulty is still one of definition. It is a debate that we are still to have, unfortunately. When I listened to the Minister&#039;s response, including his truthful but extraordinary response to the right hon. Member for Southampton, Itchen (Mr. Denham), I was convinced that we could not leave the issue to Report. We need to tell Ministers that they need to tighten these definitions considerably if we are to agree to them at a later stage in our consideration of the Bill.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-32_para4">
<a name="stpa_232">On behalf of my right hon. and hon. Friends, I still maintain the position that there is a possibility of finding an extraterritorial jurisdiction that is based on clear definitions that meets our commitments by treaty that we would be happy to support. What we have heard from the Minister this evening suggests that we are a long way from that. On that basis, I think that we need to test the opinion of the Committee.

 Clause 18&nbsp;extends a liability for offences under the Bill to bodies corporate. Where an offence by&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a body corporate is committed, the liability will also lie with company directors and other officers. Under subsection (1), a
</p>





<br>
<a name="amdt_26">
<br>
&quot;director, manager, secretary or other similar officer of the body corporate, or . . . a person who was purporting to act in any such capacity&quot;
<br>







<p><a name="st_394">will be guilty of an offence committed by a body corporate. Such an offence can be committed because the person consented or connived in it, or because it was attributable to neglect on his part.</p>













<p><a name="st_395">That is a fairly remarkable concept. I am familiar with the form of words, because my experience of practising in health and safety at work tells me that it is lifted 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>3 Nov 2005 : Column 1058</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>directly from that field. That may be appropriate when one is trying to achieve a degree of regulation, and when the maximum penalty is a fine, but it is a rather novel concept that a person should be sent to prison for life for having been neglectful in allowing his company to commit an offence.</p>













<p><a name="st_396">The provision could extend in directions that I suspect the Minister may not have intended. I am grateful to the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Rob&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marris) for giving me an example a moment ago. He suggested that if a licence was applied for to collect money in the street on behalf of an organisation that was acting unlawfully under the Bill, because it was raising money for terrorism, the mayor and the officers of the corporation who granted that licence would be liable to lengthy terms of imprisonment for failing to carry out checks on the organisation concerned. I cannot believe that the Government genuinely intend that. Yet again, we have an example of a provision that has been drafted astonishingly broadly and is capable of having consequences that are not only unintended but manifestly unjust.</p>













<p><a name="st_397">The amendment would allow for the liability of company directors and other officers in cases of consent or connivance but remove it in the case of neglect. I hope that the Under-Secretary can accept it.</p>











<p><a name="st_398"><a name="51103-33_spnew2"><b> Mr. Michael Fallon  (Sevenoaks) (Con):</b> 
 I support the amendment. As my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve) pointed out, the clause has a wide application. It covers part 1&nbsp;and is therefore extremely broad in scope. I believe that it goes too far,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;especially in its inclusion of neglect, which the amendment would rightly exclude.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-33_para0">
<a name="stpa_238">Neglect is not the opposite of connivance or consent and does not complete every other possibility, but it imposes a substantial onus on a director, member, officer and so on to be absolutely sure that nothing he does could prevent the dissemination of a relevant publication.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-33_para1">
<a name="stpa_239">Perhaps my hon. Friend could advise me&#151;at no charge&#151;whether the term &quot;body corporate&quot; in the provision goes wider than a private company or, indeed, the public corporation that he mentioned. It appears to me that the trustees of a library, the secretary of a research institute and even the treasurer of a very respectable mosque might be caught if they had not taken every conceivable precaution to ensure that they could not be charged with neglect in the undertaking of their functions.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-33_para2">
<a name="stpa_240">The clause applies to a large part of the Bill and its drafting is far too wide. The least we can do is remove the provision for neglect.

 Amendment No. 33&nbsp;stands in my name and that of my hon. Friend the Member for Erith and Thamesmead (John Austin). I would also like to say a few words about the other amendments in the group. Amendment No. 33&nbsp;covers an issue that I raised on Second Reading. I refer hon. Members to paragraph 19&nbsp;on pages 4&nbsp;and 5&nbsp;of the explanatory notes to the Bill, which makes it clear that a person would be regarded as committing a terrorist act if they did something


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_27">&quot;for the benefit of a proscribed organisation.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-33_para6">
<a name="stpa_244">I shall repeat the example that I gave on Second Reading. If an hon. Member, either directly or through intermediaries, urged Hamas to desist from its military and terrorist activities and to get involved instead in the democratic process in the west bank and Gaza&#151;this is not a theoretical point; these arguments are taking place&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in Hamas at the moment&#151;I would suggest that&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that activity would be for the benefit of a proscribed organisation. Hamas is definitely a terrorist organisation, and it is definitely proscribed under existing legislation. My reading of the Bill as it stands is&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that such an act would become unlawful. That is ludicrous.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-33_para7">
<a name="stpa_245">When I put this to my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary on Second Reading, he was very definite in his response. He said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_28">&quot;First, it would be to the benefit of that organisation, and secondly, it would not be criminal.&quot;&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 26&nbsp;October 2005; Vol. 438, c. 339.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-33_para8">
<a name="stpa_246">I appreciate his giving me that assurance, but I still do see that in the Bill. It is what is in the Bill that is important, so I would appreciate it if he would tell me what he can do to clarify this matter, perhaps on Report.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-33_para9">
<a name="stpa_247">The main question that we are dealing with in regard to this group of amendments is the definition of terrorism. Yesterday, I was struck by the speech made by my hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham, South (Alan Simpson), when he read out a passage from &quot;Homage to Catalonia&quot;. That book also had a major impact on my political thinking, particularly when I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;became a student in the early 70s. Within a month of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my going to York university, Salvador Allende&#039;s Government in Chile was overthrown by the Pinochet regime. Throughout the 70s, while I was at university, I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;found out a lot about what was going on in Chile. Exiled Chilean students came to my university, and I got to know them and learned a lot from them about what people were going through in Chile at that time. People were being herded into football stadiums; there were death squads. Some of those students said that they wanted to take up arms against the fascist regime, but I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;could not regard them as terrorists. However, under the definition in the Bill, they would be.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-33_para10">
<a name="stpa_248">These amendments have to be considered in the context of clause 1. It would have been wrong if those people who opposed the Pinochet regime in Chile had murdered civilians. That would have been wrong even then. Even if they had urged such action, I would certainly have argued with them and disagreed with 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>3 Nov 2005 : Column 1061</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>them, but whether I would have wanted to criminalise them is another matter. However, clause 1&nbsp;as it stands would criminalise them. If we are going to have such provisions in clause 1, it is essential that, when we define terrorism, we draw a distinction between actions taken against civilians and non-combatants&#151;which are not justifiable&#151;and actions taken against the forces of a regime similar to the Pinochet regime. That seems to be the crux of the amendment of my right hon. Friend the Member for Southampton, Itchen (Mr. Denham).
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-33_para11">
<a name="stpa_249">One of the criticisms of the amendment is that it would not regard attacks on British troops as terrorist, which is true. In my view, however, anybody in this country who urged attacks on British troops would be guilty of at least incitement and probably treason. The fact that someone is attacking troops does not of itself make the attack terrorism. It might make it unjustifiable, abhorrent or treasonable, but it does not necessarily make it terrorism. Let us remember that every regime in the world that has faced some kind of insurgency&#151;the South African one springs to mind&#151;always describes forces that take action against it, if they are not regular forces, as terrorist. While we might want to tidy up provisions to deal with matters regarding British troops, we must not succour to oppressive regimes who want to describe people as terrorists not because of what they do, not because they target civilians and not because they are involved in genocide, but simply because they oppose them. Such a tightening of the definition of terrorism is the purpose of this group of amendments.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-33_para12">
<a name="stpa_250">I hope that my right hon. Friend will be able to reassure us on the matter later so that we can discuss such issues in more detail on Report.

<a name="stpa_251">As the hon. Member for Birmingham, Northfield rightly remarked, clause 20&nbsp;really applies to the entirety of the Bill as it contains the definition of terrorism. As&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the hon. and learned Member for Medway (Mr.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marshall-Andrews) reminded us yesterday, it applies particularly to clause 1, which he rightly described as the most offensive part of the Bill, and I agree with him. The question of what is terrorism brings us face to face with the most difficult decision: what is a&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;freedom fighter, and who is a terrorist? It is extraordinarily difficult. At the moment, the Bill applies equally to those whom this House would regard as freedom fighters and those whom the House would regard as terrorists. The definition makes absolutely no distinction between the two. The question that we must ask is whether that is what we really want to do.

In this context, the Attorney-General is a Minister and his decisions will reflect not a legal but a political judgment. I do not believe that we should legislate for prosecutions only to follow a political judgment. I hope that the Home Secretary and his colleagues will think again about whether we can somehow restrict the definition of terrorism so that we strike only at that which is deeply offensive and do not find ourselves outlawing the freedom fighter or those who wish to support him&#151;as many right hon. and hon.

<p>
<a name="51103-34_para7">
<a name="stpa_258">My amendments may not be perfect, but nor is the Bill. Attention has already been drawn to the anomaly of it being legal to invade Iraq to get rid of Saddam Hussein, but illegal to support the Iraqi people if they acted in the same way. I want to discuss the problem of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;definitions more narrowly. There is nothing magic about the definition in the Terrorism Act 2000. It is not&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;based on international law. Other definitions are significantly different. The European Union Council framework decision, for example, lists much the same offences, but involves a much higher threshold. It refers to &quot;seriously intimidating a population&quot;, to

<a name="stpa_260">Those are high thresholds and they do not exist in our own national legislation. It is true that we have to ratify the Council of Europe convention, but it does not define terrorism. We are free to define terrorism as we want, as&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;long as we include certain specific offences, so there is no single agreed definition of terrorism. I am looking for a wording that we can apply to the new situation&#151;the international spread of terrorism aimed directly at the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mass murder of civilians.

</p>








<p><a name="st_425"><a name="51103-34_spnew9"><b> Mr. Denham: </b> 
 I will touch on that issue, which relates&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to the report from which I took the wording of my amendment, in a moment. That report was by the high-level working group established by the Secretary-General of the United Nations in preparation for the 60th anniversary world summit. The group addressed the problem of defining terrorism legally, politically and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;specifically. It concluded&#151;I am paraphrasing, but I hope fairly&#151;that actions of states such as war, occupation and genocide are already covered by international law in one way or another. Attempts to agree international laws on terrorism, excluding specific offences, have so far always foundered on what has been described as the freedom fighter problem&#151;one man&#039;s terrorist is another&#039;s freedom fighter. In the past, that problem most obviously preoccupied the UN in respect of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, the Israeli occupation since the &#039;67&nbsp;war, and so on.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-34_para10">
<a name="stpa_261">The high-level working group made a very persuasive point. It said that there should be some international norms, and it approached the issue not from the political basis of the action that might be carried out by civilian or non-state combatants, but according to the type of action that is acceptable. It said that it does not matter what the cause is&#151;deliberately targeting civilians is wrong. That is the basis on which it produced the wording that I have used in my amendment.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-34_para11">
<a name="stpa_262">There are two reasons to commend this definition to the House today. First, although it is not an intergovernmental agreement, it did come from a legitimate international process set up under the auspices of the UN. Secondly, it deals with the problem that this House has been wrestling with for the past few days, and for that reason it is to be greatly preferred, in dealing with the offences under consideration, to the Government&#039;s definition. Any Member of this House should be prepared to argue with their constituents that deliberately setting out to kill civilians and non-combatants&#151;be it in Burma, Chechnya, Kashmir, Palestine or any future trouble spot&#151;is wrong, no matter what the history, grievance or repression. That is why the wording of my amendment has been drawn directly from the working group report.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-34_para12">
<a name="stpa_263">I acknowledge that my amendment is not perfect. First, it should certainly apply to clause 21&#151;the proscription clause&#151;which was discussed earlier. Secondly, a number of colleagues have raised with me the fair criticism that we cannot appear to endorse attacks by terrorist groups on British troops, or attacks on those of our allies with whom British troops may be serving, for example, under UN mandate or under the auspices of NATO, as in the Kosovan war. That is an issue, but it is perfectly clear&#151;I have examined it in some detail&#151;that there are a number of ways in which we could bring within the terms of this Bill such attacks on British troops and other troops serving the UN.

We should recognise that openly as a problem, but the debate has shown that a much bigger problem exists with the way terrorism is defined for the purposes of clauses 1&nbsp;and 17.

Terrorism is not new,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the type of terrorism associated with al-Qaeda and the tactics that are used around the world are new. If that were not the case, we would not be debating the Bill. The definition of terrorism that we use should be focused as closely as possible on the new problem that we are trying to tackle. My amendment is not perfect, but it begins to show the way forward. I hope that it will receive a positive response from the Home Secretary and that we can explore it in more detail next week.

I do not know whether amendment No. 69, tabled by the right hon. Member for Southampton, Itchen (Mr. Denham) is perfect.

I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wrote to the Chairman of the Committee following my evidence on this very issue and I pointed out that there is no agreed international definition of terrorism and that all the existing alternative definitions are unsatisfactory in some way. I cited the EU code, to which my right hon. Friend the Member for Southampton, Itchen referred, and the state of affairs of the current United Nations discussions to try to address the issue.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-36_para5">
<a name="stpa_283">I need to be clear about this issue because of possible misunderstanding. I accept that it is a difficult issue and that there are problems with the definition in the Act. I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;accept and acknowledge that those problems exist. However, I also think that there are problems with the definition that my right hon. Friend offers us, although I mean no criticism by that. Therefore, it is important that we discuss precisely how to deal with the issue so that we may reach agreement on Report about how best to proceed.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-36_para6">
<a name="stpa_284">Having acknowledged the difficult nature of the issue, I wish to make a couple of specific points. The whole terrorist/freedom fighter debate has been dominant for some time, but I must say&#151;I know that no one has suggested it&#151;that al-Qaeda is not in the same spirit of freedom fighting that many &quot;terrorists&quot; have claimed in the past. However, that does not absolve me from dealing with the problem that the hon. Member for Buckingham (John Bercow) mentioned about definition.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-36_para7">
<a name="stpa_285">I wish to make a couple of points about the possible definition that we could reach. It has been suggested that only attacks that endanger life should be covered and that we should exclude attacks on property. I find that difficult and I remind the Committee that our existing definition includes only serious attacks on property and ask Members to recall the Provisional IRA&#039;s attacks on the City of London in the mid 1990s. To suggest that such acts were not terrorist attacks seems to be missing an important point. The simple &quot;property or not&quot; definition does not entirely work.
</p>








<p><a name="st_441"><a name="51103-36_spnew1"><b> Mr. Denham: </b> 
 Although such an attack is clearly terrorist and would be defined as such in the 2000&nbsp;Act, the point is that we are considering new laws that we never thought it necessary to introduce when we faced the PIRA attacks. That is why we need to look at the definition of terrorism that is appropriate to the new laws. My right hon. Friend is being very helpful, but I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;caution him that relying on retrospective events for the basis of the definition, when we did not think that these proposed laws were necessary at the time, is a rather dangerous line of argument.
</p>








<p><a name="st_442"><a name="51103-36_spnew2"><b> Mr. Clarke: </b> 
 I understand that very real point, but if the 9/11&nbsp;attacks had taken place when there was no one in the World Trade Centre or in the aeroplanes, the symbolism of the attack on property would have none the less been profound, as it would have been in an attack on the Pentagon or wherever it might be. I do not dispute my right hon. Friend&#039;s central point, which is that we need a different definition in the Bill than in other Bills. I understand that; his point is well made and I accept it for the purpose of the discussion. But simply to exclude property altogether raises certain questions that need to be addressed.


<br>&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-36_para8">
<a name="stpa_286">Another suggestion is that only attacks on civilians should constitute terrorism. Again, I understand that; it is a logical point. However, I have to put to the Committee that there are definitional problems. Do the police count as civilians? What about off-duty soldiers who happen to be wearing their uniform? What about British soldiers currently serving in other parts of the world? I acknowledge that I do not solve those problems merely by referring to them, but they are real and they need seriously to be addressed.
</p>








<p><a name="st_443"><a name="51103-36_spnew3"><b> Mr. Cash: </b> 
 Does the Home Secretary take my point about the problem that arises in the context of civil war? For example, there is the Spanish civil war on the one hand or the situation in Ireland on the other. Will he give careful consideration to such questions before Report? Otherwise, we shall be in a hopeless situation.
</p>








<p><a name="st_444"><a name="51103-36_spnew4"><b> Mr. Clarke: </b> 
 I will give them serious consideration, but I make the point&#151;not in an antagonistic spirit&#151;that the definition of civil war is often just as difficult to achieve as the definition of terrorist or freedom fighter. There is no easy definition that solves the problem.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-36_para9">
<a name="stpa_287">I want explicitly to acknowledge the concerns raised by my right hon. Friend the Member for Southampton, Itchen in his amendment. It is categorically our view that we need a definition that is wide enough to encompass the types of matter that I have addressed and we also need to restate the commitment made yesterday by my right hon. Friend the Minister for Policing, Security and Community Safety to look again at the issue of intent&#151;a key point to which my right hon. Friend the Member for Southampton, Itchen also referred. Clearly, if we have a tighter intent test, the number of people who would fall within the ambit of the new offences in clauses 1&nbsp;and 2&nbsp;would be restricted, which might meet some of his concerns about the type of terrorism we would be covering. However, those are difficult questions and we acknowledge the points that he and others have made, including my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Hall Green (Steve McCabe) in his intervention today, and we are happy to see whether we can reach agreement in a way that achieves more consensus on that point for Report. I acknowledge the fact that my right hon. Friend the Member for Southampton, Itchen seeks a slightly different definition in different areas to try to deal with those points.
</p>








<p><a name="st_445"><a name="51103-36_spnew5"><b> Mr. Hogg: </b> 
 The Home Secretary may have just answered my question. Is he giving the Committee an undertaking that he will revisit the question of terrorism for the purposes of the clauses currently under discussion?
</p>








<p><a name="st_446"><a name="51103-36_spnew6"><b> Mr. Clarke: </b> 
 I am. I shall also try to seek agreement. As with all these things, I cannot promise to reach agreement because the issues are difficult. I should like to achieve a state of affairs whereby the UN provides clarity, which is why the discussions in the UN on the convention are so important. To be candid, I discussed the matter with the Secretary-General of the UN only a couple of weeks ago and there is an absolute ambition to achieve that situation. I am glad that the UN is taking a

<p><a name="st_447"><a name="51103-37_spnew0"><b> John Bercow: </b> 
 I hugely appreciate the spirit in which the Home Secretary is addressing the issues raised by the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;right hon. Member for Southampton, Itchen (Mr.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Denham), my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham (Mr. Hogg) and others. I appreciate that the Home Secretary is looking at the nature and range of activities that need to be included in a definition. Notwithstanding the real difficulties, is he also considering the other side of the equation: the need to look at the environment in which people operate? If he wants to have an extraterritorial competence, it seems necessary to take account of the circumstances in which people are fighting.

 Following on from the previous point, not all hon. Members share the Home Secretary&#039;s very optimistic picture of the state of the world today.

<a name="51103-37_para0">
<a name="stpa_288">Before I sit down, I need to make one other point in relation to the previous conduct of the Committee. In&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;exchanges yesterday with the right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke) and others, I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;suggested that I had received specific advice from the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Attorney-General that the Bill is compliant with the European convention on human rights. I should clarify that the clear legal advice that I received was on the Bill&#039;s&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ECHR compliance, which enabled me to sign the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;section 19&nbsp;statement to which I referred, and did not come from the Attorney-General personally. Further, in making that statement, I inadvertently breached the long-standing convention over many Governments that the fact that the Law Officers have or have not advised on any matter and the content of their advice should not&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be disclosed. For breaching that long-standing convention, I want to apologise to you, Mrs. Heal, and to the Committee.

 I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;am most grateful for being given the opportunity to initiate this debate on an extremely important subject. At the same time, I am disappointed that I need to join the long line of right hon. and hon. Members in speaking to and questioning Ministers about the funding of children&#039;s hospices. Such hospices have been in our communities for almost 25&nbsp;years but there is still no proper means of funding their vital work.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-38_para9">
<a name="stpa_301">The current situation is disgraceful. We have a national health service that is being transformed for the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;better by reform and new investment. It is a transformation that is designed to give local communities a proper say in how NHS money is used. It is a transformation that means that primary care trusts are receiving record amounts of money. I believe that the average PCT budget will grow by almost &#163;42 million by 2006&#150;07.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-38_para10">
<a name="stpa_302">In previous debates and questions Ministers have made various excuses for why children&#039;s hospices have&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not been funded. For example, it has been said that children&#039;s hospices are badly supported by the NHS because they are relatively recent. After 23 years, that excuse can be dismissed.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-38_para11">
<a name="stpa_303">The single and most often repeated reason has been that it is not up to the Government to dictate to PCTs how much funding should be given to children&#039;s hospices. It has been said that there is no upper limit on how much money PCTs can give, but that it is up to the individual hospice to negotiate with the PCT on service delivery.

 I am pleased that my hon. Friend has been able to secure the debate on such an important subject. I wonder whether my hon.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Friend has shared my experience when speaking to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;people involved with children&#039;s hospices; there is a feeling of utter frustration. On the one hand, Ministers say that money is available, but the problem appears to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be that it is allocated to the primary care trusts. That is where it gets stuck. Only today I was told by the chief&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;executive of a hospice that there needs to be joined-up thinking and joined-up working between the Department and the PCTs. That is where the biggest problem is.

<p><a name="st_485"><a name="51103-38_spnew3"><b> Mr. Flello: </b> 
 I am grateful to my hon. Friend for raising those issues, which I hope to cover in my speech. It is incredibly frustrating that staff who do a fantastic job in this sector do not receive the recognition and support that they need from the PCTs whereas our communities are supporting them all the way.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-38_para12">
<a name="stpa_304">I shall take a typical example, that of the engagement of Treetops children&#039;s hospice which is in my constituency, with the 10&nbsp;PCTs in the area that the hospice serves.

<br>&nbsp;<br>the &quot;Every Child Matters&quot; initiative. That document set out a requirement for local statutory services to work with organisations such as children&#039;s hospices on the planning, funding and commissioning of local services. In practice, however, of the 10 PCTs contacted by Treetops&#151;it was Treetops that initiated the contact, not the PCTs&#151;only five agreed to face-to-face contact. One PCT has not replied to any letters and, in some cases, it took many months before a reply was extracted from the remaining four. Those replies basically said that the PCT was not interested. So much for full engagement by PCTs with service providers.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-38_para14">
<a name="stpa_306">How much have the five PCTs that met Treetops contributed to the hospice services that are recognised as important by the framework? One PCT chief executive asked that very question, and was suitably shame-faced when he was told, &quot;Absolutely nothing.&quot; Incidentally, he has not put the situation right. How much do PCTs pay Treetops for supporting about 135&nbsp;life-limited children and their families, more than half of whom are referrals from the PCTs themselves?
</p>








<p><a name="st_486"><a name="51103-38_spnew4"><b> Lynda Waltho: </b> 
 Does my hon. Friend acknowledge that there is an additional problem for hospices that cover a larger area? Acorns children&#039;s hospice covers the west midlands, Shropshire, Herefordshire, Gloucestershire, Warwickshire and Worcestershire, so it has the tremendous problem of negotiating with 33 separate PCTs. I appreciate the problem my hon. Friend has raised, but in fact it can be even larger.
</p>








<p><a name="st_487"><a name="51103-38_spnew5"><b> Mr. Flello: </b> 
 My hon. Friend has highlighted the fact that hospices are dealing with a vast number of PCTs. It is a huge effort to extract any reply at all from some of them, and that problem is exacerbated if hospices have to write to even more PCTs.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-38_para15">
<a name="stpa_307">PCTs do not pay Treetops anything for supporting life-limited children and their families, more than half of whom are referrals from the PCTs. The hospice is funded almost entirely by public donations, and has also received some money from the New Opportunities Fund over a three-year period. The picture is the same up and down the country.
</p>








<p><a name="st_488"><a name="51103-38_spnew6"><b> Adam Afriyie  (Windsor) (Con):</b> 
 Like the hon. Gentleman I serve on a hospice committee, and I support the Sebastian Gates action trust in my constituency. He alluded to the voluntary sector and the private donations that help to keep children&#039;s hospices going. Will he join me in commending the people who donate their time, energy and resources to those private trusts and hospices, because that fills the gap in Government funding?
</p>








<p><a name="st_489"><a name="51103-38_spnew7"><b> Mr. Flello: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman is quite right, and I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;join him in commending the work done by many people who put themselves out no matter what the weather, and who work hard to raise much-needed money from communities that want those services.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-38_para16">
<a name="stpa_308">Given the lack of funding, one might wonder whether the Government genuinely accept the need for children&#039;s hospices. The national service framework, however, states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_35">&quot;Palliative care services can include short-term breaks, counselling, family support services, pain management and symptom control.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>




<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>3 Nov 2005 : Column 1077</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-38_para17">
<a name="stpa_309">Those services, the framework states, should be


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_36">&quot;easily accessible, timely and in the setting of the family&#039;s choice.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-38_para18">
<a name="stpa_310">It goes on to say that co-ordination and close liaison between agencies, including children&#039;s hospices, is thus essential. There is therefore strong Government commitment, which has been utterly ignored by PCTs.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-38_para19">
<a name="stpa_311">As for adult palliative care commitments by the Government, in the Labour election manifesto we gave a commitment to increase funding for palliative care, but that does not extend to children. We have the perverse situation at the moment whereby a 17-year-old with cancer is not deemed suitable to fund, whereas an adult is. Can we really say that a child under 18&nbsp;cannot be funded to die with all the support that a hospice can give, whereas a young person over 18&nbsp;can have funded support? Does the Minister not agree that our manifesto commitment should cover children as well as adults?
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-38_para20">
<a name="stpa_312">I am not, as the Minister might think, standing here asking for unlimited funding for all children&#039;s hospices, despite the Government recognising that there is no upper limit on the money that could be available, but I am standing here asking for fairness. It is quite simply shameful that PCTs can decide who to talk to and who to fund, and yet pay no heed either to what the Government are asking them to do with taxpayers&#039; money, or to those taxpayers themselves.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-38_para21">
<a name="stpa_313">The Government have previously said that they cannot blanket fund all the costs of running children&#039;s hospices. But, again, that is not what I am asking for. The cost of running all the services, using my example of Treetops, is around &#163;4,000&nbsp;a day, a figure that I believe is comparable across the country, and yet the cost of medical care for each child is just &#163;240&nbsp;a night. Is it really too much to ask the NHS to pay for medical care? Is not that part of its remit?
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-38_para22">
<a name="stpa_314">In some parts of the country, PCTs are at least going some way towards meeting their obligations to the communities that they serve by providing up to 10&nbsp;per cent. of running costs for some hospices. But I am looking for a directive from the Government to primary care trusts, not asking them perhaps to think about it and if they cannot be bothered even to reply to letters, not to worry, but ordering them to instigate a process whereby PCTs must passport the medical costs of children using hospices to the hospice in question.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-38_para23">
<a name="stpa_315">To return to Treetops, let us take the example of a wonderful little girl who was telling me recently all about her visit to see &quot;Disney on Ice&quot;. If she chooses, with her parents, to go to a hospice for respite care, the cost of the medical element should be met by the PCT covering the area where she lives. It does not need to be complicated; it just needs to happen. Where is the NHS free at the point of need for our children?
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-38_para24">
<a name="stpa_316">I urge the Government, through the Minister, first to widen the scope of additional palliative care funding to include children; secondly, to put in place a process that will force PCTs to engage properly with children&#039;s hospices in accordance with the national service framework; and thirdly, to put in place a process that forces PCTs to commission properly children&#039;s hospice services in a manner that passports the funding for medical care.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-38_para25">
<a name="stpa_317">Before I close, I again pay tribute to everybody within the children&#039;s hospice movement and the caring public who support them.

<p><a name="st_490"><a name="51103-39_spmin0"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health  (Mr. Liam Byrne): </b> 
 I am grateful to my hon.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, South (Mr. Flello) for instigating today&#039;s debate. I must congratulate him on his focus upon the work of children&#039;s hospices&#151;hospices that make such a difference to the lives of his constituents. I am shortly to visit his constituency, and I look forward to meeting some of the people about whom he spoke tonight. In particular, I congratulate him on his work with the Donna Louise trust&#039;s Treetops children&#039;s hospice, based in his constituency, and congratulate him on his work to launch its funding for life campaign. Other hon. Members will have an equal interest in their own children&#039;s hospice and will want to hear what the Government have been doing to ensure that these and other support services grow and thrive.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-39_para0">
<a name="stpa_318">If the House will permit me, I should like first to set out the seven steps that the Government have taken since 1997 to weave a web of care around the protection and care of children. Since 1997, there has been a transformation in the understanding of the needs of children with life threatening illness and their families.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-39_para1">
<a name="stpa_319">Step one was the Department&#039;s immediate commendation of a report by the Association for Children with Life-Threatening or Terminal Conditions and their Families. That was closely followed by the second step, which was the NHS Executive guidance in 1998 which drew together the lessons learnt during a series of projects providing a range of care to families.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-39_para2">
<a name="stpa_320">Also in 1998, step three, a team headed by the Treasury invited applications to establish Diana children&#039;s community nursing teams throughout the country to build upon the work undertaken during the pilot project programme, and to blaze a trail for the development of home care for children with life-threatening illnesses. Additional funding of nearly &#163;1.5 million for England was provided by the Treasury enabling eight Diana children&#039;s community nursing teams to be introduced in England during 1999.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-39_para3">
<a name="stpa_321">Step four occurred in 1998, when the Association of Children&#039;s Hospices was registered as a charity to promote the interests of the children&#039;s hospice movement and to develop public awareness and support for children&#039;s hospices and paediatric palliative care. The Department of Health has worked closely with the association since then to develop a better understanding of the issues. In particular, it commissioned the association to provide a quality assurance package to enhance the quality of care provided by children&#039;s hospice services.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-39_para4">
<a name="stpa_322">Step five occurred in 2000, when we started discussion with the New Opportunities Fund, the Department for Culture, Media and Sports and voluntary organisations to promote palliative care services for children. That resulted in the 2003&nbsp;NOF awards, in which more than &#163;45&nbsp;million was awarded to 135&nbsp;projects, including 71&nbsp;awards to home-based palliative care teams.
</p>








<p><a name="st_491"><a name="51103-39_spnew0"><b> Adam Afriyie: </b> 
 I am delighted that this debate is taking place, because the mark of a civilised society is how we treat our children. The Minister has mentioned the New Opportunities Fund: will he make it perfectly clear that the moneys from the New Opportunities Fund have absolutely nothing to do with the Government and concern expenditure by lottery distribution funds?


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>3 Nov 2005 : Column 1079</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br></p>








<p><a name="st_492"><a name="51103-39_spnew1"><b> Mr. Byrne: </b> 
 I will consider that point later in my remarks.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-39_para5">
<a name="stpa_323">Furthermore, 39&nbsp;awards were made to bereavement teams and 25&nbsp;awards, totalling &#163;15&nbsp;million, were made to children&#039;s hospices. Those projects are being assessed over a three-year period with a view to filling gaps in services and making children&#039;s palliative care provision far more mainstream.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-39_para6">
<a name="stpa_324">Step six occurred in 2003, when the National Institute for Clinical Excellence commissioned the National Collaborating Centre for Cancer to develop service guidance on child and adolescent cancer services, including palliative care and bereavement support. NICE service guidance supports the implementation of the national cancer plan and forms an additional structure to provide for children&#039;s palliative care needs.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-39_para7">
<a name="stpa_325">Step seven involved work with the Association for&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Children with Life-Threatening or Terminal Conditions. The Department of Health funded the production of and commended the ACT care pathway guidance, which was launched last year to complement the children&#039;s national service framework on disabled children and young people.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-39_para8">
<a name="stpa_326">As my hon. Friend has argued so eloquently, however, seven steps are not enough, and we can and must go much further. To identify how the Government can best support hospices, we must understand how hospices are started, how they work and how they provide the services that make such a difference. That difference is already being made in my hon. Friend&#039;s constituency, where I understand that Staffordshire Moorlands PCT hosts the children&#039;s community nursing team on behalf of all four PCTs in north Staffordshire. The provision of palliative care for children is implemented through a team that provides comprehensive packages of care through two respite workers who work closely with families, and a nursing team that has two part-time social care workers, one of whom is from the city council and one of whom is from the county council.
</p>








<p><a name="st_493"><a name="51103-39_spnew2"><b> Mr. Flello: </b> 
 I hear my hon. Friend the Minister&#039;s comments about the PCT&#039;s good work. Where was the collaboration?
</p>








<p><a name="st_494"><a name="51103-39_spnew3"><b> Mr. Byrne: </b> 
 I agree with my hon. Friend and will address that remark directly in a moment.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-39_para9">
<a name="stpa_327">Several key themes emerged from ACT&#039;s work. In particular, it highlighted the importance of positively influencing the planning and development of future hospices. The association&#039;s experience suggests that the desire to set up a hospice often comes from the tragic struggle of a particular family, which can generate enormous energy and a single-minded determination to see through an important dream. To help ensure that such energy is channelled in the right way, the Department can do a great deal more to support innovative services. Crucially&#151;this point lies at the heart of the debate&#151;we must ensure that such services are sustained in the long run once they have been started.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-39_para10">
<a name="stpa_328">To help those with ambitions to set up hospices, the Department has provided funding for ACT to develop a toolkit on how children&#039;s hospices work. The toolkit aims to provide references to the sources of information 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>3 Nov 2005 : Column 1080</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>that are required successfully to plan and establish a service, so that any new services can make more informed decisions about how a venture should look. The toolkit will provide a far better understanding of what is involved in starting and running a children&#039;s hospice service and an overview of the challenges and pitfalls that such a project may involve.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-39_para11">
<a name="stpa_329">Most importantly, the toolkit will emphasise the importance of consultation at the beginning of the process. It will also emphasise that children often need different sorts of services, particularly hospice-at-home services. ACT has commented that although establishing a hospice-at-home service is not an easy task, it is often possible to get it up and running far more quickly. Moreover, it can provide a more flexible option by responding to changes in families&#039; needs and expanding or reducing in response to other external factors. Day care and hospice-at-home services should not be viewed as second-class options.

<p><a name="st_496"><a name="51103-39_spnew5"><b> Mr. Byrne: </b> 
 I give way to my hon. Friend, who has such services in her constituency.
</p>








<p><a name="st_497"><a name="51103-39_spnew6"><b> Lynda Waltho: </b> 
 I appreciate all the work that is being done to assist with new hospices. However, I am concerned about current funding for hospices that are jumping through all the hoops. They are being assessed by the National Care Standards Commission and providing exemplary care, but they are struggling. That is the biggest problem.
</p>








<p><a name="st_498"><a name="51103-39_spnew7"><b> Mr. Byrne: </b> 
 I completely agree with my hon. Friend.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, South on securing this important Adjournment debate. I am sure that he is aware that I have tabled early-day motions on the subject and had a similar Adjournment debate in the last Parliament. I am pleased to see the Minister in his place, because he replied to that debate as well.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-39_para12">
<a name="stpa_330">The crux of the problem is that children&#039;s hospices receive only about 7&nbsp;per cent. of their funding from the NHS, whereas adult hospices receive about 33&nbsp;per cent. of their funding from the NHS. It is unfair to compare adult hospices with children&#039;s hospices, as the Minister said in the previous debate and today. Nevertheless, the fact is that adult hospices generally have to deal with only one, two or three primary care trusts because they&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;generally represent one town&#151;for example, the St.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peter&#039;s hospice in Barnsley and the Doncaster hospice&#151;while children&#039;s hospices can be covered by up to 33&nbsp;PCTs. The onus should be on the PCT to contact the children&#039;s hospice to set up an agreement rather than the other way round.

</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-40_para0">
<a name="stpa_331">Let me cut immediately to what the Government should now do, because we can and must do more. At the heart of the concern of my hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, South is the way in which the local

<b>3 Nov 2005 : Column 1081</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>NHS works together to put in place services that make a difference to children&#039;s lives. He says that those services must change, and I agree. I will shortly launch dedicated guidance for that purpose&#151;work that will build on and realise the intentions expressed in the national service framework for children and young people, which is mandatory on the NHS. That guidance for commissioners of palliative care is in the final stages of development, and I will ensure that the comments made by hon. Members are brought to the attention of the officials who are drafting it, which will be beneficial. The&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;guide will support health care organisations, local authorities and other partners, working together with them in children&#039;s trusts to understand and develop children&#039;s palliative care services and to apply the mandatory children&#039;s national service framework in its delivery.
</p>








<p><a name="st_501"><a name="51103-40_spnew1"><b> Mr. Flello: </b> 
 It would be beneficial for the Under-Secretary to see a children&#039;s hospice for himself. I invite him to Treetops to see the work that is done there so that, when he reads the paperwork that his civil servants prepare for him, he knows exactly what that means in practice.
</p>








<p><a name="st_502"><a name="51103-40_spnew2"><b> Mr. Byrne: </b> 
 I look forward to visiting my hon. Friend in his constituency.

<a name="stpa_332">The guidance will set out a service model, describe the elements that should be present in the services that are&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;commissioned and give practical examples of approaches to providing children and young people with the services. It will detail the role that we expect commissioners to play in ensuring that they commission the right services in the right place at the right time.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-40_para2">
<a name="stpa_333">As my hon. Friend pointed out, the local NHS receives record funding. There is no ceiling on the money that it can give to children&#039;s hospices, but the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;funding must be co-ordinated. Hospices must not be trapped in a paper chase or, worse, at the end of a telephone, with no reply. The NHS and the local children&#039;s hospice sector have asked for guidance on important matters, and I am pleased that we can assist them through the publication of the guide. On publication, I shall ensure that copies are placed in the Library.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-40_para3">
<a name="stpa_334">The second step that we must take is ensuring that specialist commissioning is much sharper. My noble Friend Lord Warner made a ministerial statement on Wednesday 19&nbsp;October announcing a review of NHS specialist services. A new taskforce will be headed by Scotland&#039;s former chief medical officer to investigate how the NHS currently commissions specialist services and consider ways in which to tighten those commissioning arrangements so that there is much greater consistency throughout the NHS. I undertake to ensure that the review is alerted to the specific needs of children&#039;s hospices.
