 Local authorities have legal responsibility for determining the pattern of school provision most appropriate to their areas, taking account of parents&#146; wishes.

 The hon. Gentleman should note that we have reduced the number of rural school closures significantly, from a peak of 127 in 1983 to an average of just six a year over the last 10 years. The guidance to which he referred should be read in its entirety: it makes clear that if access for young children is to be preserved there may be a need for more surplus places in rural schools, and acknowledges that it will not always be practical or desirable to remove all such places.

 As my hon. Friend knows, we always want to put children first, but I repeat what I said to the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath).

 The Minister said that the number of closures of small schools in our rural areas&#151;against which the Government made a strong commitment in 1998&#151;had declined to only six a year, but the fact is that we now have some 1,200 fewer small schools in our rural areas than we had in 1997 when the Government came to power.

 The hon. Gentleman should consider his own bureaucracy when he quotes completely false figures. Statistics of that kind do not relate to the number of schools that have been taken out of communities. They relate to the closure of schools as a result of mergers between infant and junior schools to form primary schools, and to a range of factors that do not feature in the rurality classification used by DEFRA. The statistics that we use are consistent. The hon. Gentleman should remind himself of the trend that we saw when his party was in power, which, as I have said, resulted in a peak of 127 closures of small rural schools in 1983.</p>

 I am happy to commend the job done by Leicestershire county council in managing its schools against the background of a relatively difficult funding arrangement, although even in Leicestershire funding has increased significantly over the last 10 years, and its dedicated school grant will include funds for sparsity.

 I am reassured by the Minister's emphatic statement that there should be a presumption against the closure of rural schools. Does he accept that, often, the school in a village is the only major facility, so keeping it open is of great importance? Does he believe that federation of some schools is a good way of getting over the problem facing many local education authorities? Perhaps a merger between a Church of England school and a Catholic school to make an all-faith school can help in keeping small schools, village schools and rural schools open.</p>

 I never thought that I would say that I hope that local authorities have the imagination of the hon. Gentleman. He is entirely right that we should be looking more at federations. In my own constituency, hard federations have resulted in school buildings remaining open in two villages, but under a single head teacher and a single governing body. That has been extremely successful. In Somerset, as a result of a move towards federation that encompasses all but five of its primary schools, just 9 per cent. of primary school places are surplus places. That is the kind of thing that we want to see, alongside co-location of services, so that a range of children's services and other services can be offered from a village school to keep village communities alive.</p>

Will he help me on Canvey Island, where one of my small schools is under threat of closure from Essex county council because of low numbers, even though much more building will be forced on Canvey Island, which will increase the capacity requirement on the island?

 Will my right hon. Friend join me in congratulating the primary school teachers in my constituency? Over the past five years, there has been a greater than 40 per cent. increase in the children&#146;s English ability and more than a 25 per cent. increase in their maths ability. That is astounding delivery by the primary sector. What are we going to do to improve further primary school education?</p>

 My hon. Friend is right, as the facts show. In 1997, only 63 per cent. of children reached key stage 2 level 4 at the age of 11; that proportion has now increased to 80 per cent., and in maths it has increased from 62 per cent. to 77 per cent. That is a real improvement in standards, but it is not enough; we want to get to much higher levels even than those. That requires us to do even more to back the learning of our primary school pupils and to tackle the barriers to learning both in and out of school. One way to make sure that we can do that is to improve even further the teaching of reading in the earliest years. Along with Lord Adonis and Professor Jim Rose, I visited a school on Friday to see how it is using phonics in the curriculum. That is now being done extensively in three quarters of all schools, but we want to get to 100 per cent. and we will do so over the next year.</p>

Can he therefore confirm the Government&#146;s policy? Is it that schools should use synthetic phonics, as recommended by Jim Rose, or is it a return to the mix of strategies that was the hallmark of the national literacy strategy?</p>

 I know that no one is more keen on taking forward the issue of phonics and synthetic phonics in our curriculum than the hon. Gentleman. I am very pleased, therefore, that he read my press release. He will see that the first quote in it came not from myself, but from Sir Jim Rose himself; it was his findings that I was quoting. He was reporting on the progress on implementing his report and he says that all schools are using phonics, but that only three quarters are using them in the way that he would like&#151;and we would like&#151;which probably means using synthetic phonics in the way that the hon. Gentleman suggests. That will differ school by school, depending on the needs of different individuals, but Jim and I are clear on what needs to be done. We need to make sure that this is across all schools in the curriculum. The school that we visited was really interesting: 95 per cent. of children did not have English as a first language, and phonics was being taught not just in reading but in PE and right across the whole curriculum. I can therefore assure the hon. Gentleman that we are taking forward this agenda with determination, and we will make sure that the right kind of phonics are taught in all schools for all pupils.</p>

 I would not agree at all with the hon. Gentleman that the report identified significant risks. We commissioned the Deloitte report to look over the ContactPoint project, and it confirmed that ContactPoint has been developed very much with security in mind. The database is very important, and I hope that at some stage the Opposition will look very seriously at why we are setting it up. For example, there has recently been quite a bit of publicity about forced marriage. If we are to be able to identify young people who are at risk, we need to be able to share information between the professionals working with them.

Some 55 per cent. of families in the UK with disabled children are living in poverty.

We now have a higher proportion of children being brought up in workless households than any European country, and they stay in poverty for longer. Given the disproportionate effect on disabled children, who are twice as likely to live in poverty and twice as likely to leave school with no qualifications compared with their peers, thus reinforcing the cycle of generational underachievement, is not the Minister embarrassed by the Government&#146;s lack of a truly joined-up approach to disabled children and poverty involving employment, education, transport, health and housing&#151;or is this just another case of so what?</p>

I imagine that it is a combination of the two, but I leave hon. Members to reflect on where the balance lies. That does not take away from the need to do more about gender stereotyping. I saw an excellent example in a school that took year 7 pupils and gave them taster sessions of work experience that did not fit their gender stereotype.

 In constituencies such as mine, there is enormous stress and upset over secondary school admissions at this time of year.

That is despite the best efforts of the Conservative council in Hammersmith and Fulham to extend secondary school choice, so why does the Secretary of State simply say that parents should &#147;engage in the appeals process&#148;, when the real issue is that there are not enough quality secondary school places?</p>

 The hon. Gentleman is right in his figures: about 60 per cent. of parents in his area got their first choice, and 90 per cent. got one of their preferences. I agree with him&#151;in the end, the only way to deliver fairness for all parents is to make sure that every school is a good school. If we do not do so, we will always have some schools that are over-subscribed. I know that in his area there are three single-sex faith schools that are particularly over-subscribed. That is why I hope that he will back my national challenge programme, which seeks to reduce to zero the number of schools where less than 30 per cent. of pupils get five good GCSEs including English and maths. In 1997, that was the case in more than half of all schools&#151;more than 1,600. We have got that number down from 1,600 to 638, and our pledge is to get it down to zero.

 I am happy to have that meeting with my hon. Friend and the Minister for Schools and Learners. The situation in Slough is quite concerning; the numbers there are substantially out of line with those in comparable authorities in the south-east. The number of pupils getting their highest preference was 38 per cent. in Slough, compared with an average of 79.5 per cent. in the south-east. As I look at the list of numbers in front of me, Slough seems to be at pretty much half the level of every other area in the south-east. Clearly, that is not acceptable.

 Last week, on the day that we discovered that 100,000 families had been denied their first choice of school, the Government named three local authorities in which they claimed that a significant minority of schools were in breach of the admissions code. The Secretary of State said that a disproportionate number were voluntary aided&#151;that is, faith schools. This was not a handful of schools, he said&#151;it was certainly in the tens. He specifically drew attention to schools demanding money for places. However, we now know that the allegations were made after what he has conceded was &#147;unverified desk research&#148;.

That is good news, not bad news, and I am very proud of what has been achieved in that respect. As I said in my statement last week, we did an internal piece of work that showed that although the vast majority of maintained schools and academies were compliant with the code, a significant minority, which are disproportionately voluntary aided and foundation schools, were non-compliant. The advice that I received, which I took, was that we should verify the data before making them public school by school, but I felt that it was right that if I was verifying that information around the country I should also make it clear and public what we were doing, and that is what I did.

 With permission, Mr. Speaker, I would like to make a statement about the European Council held in Brussels, which I attended with the Foreign Secretary on 13 and 14 March.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o10"><a name="80317-0003.htm_para7"><a name="08031713000151">I begin with the most important concern that the Council addressed: the need to ensure that, faced with global financial turbulence and what the Council identified as a deteriorating global economic outlook, high global oil and commodity prices and volatility in exchange rates, we continue to do all we can, with co-ordinated action at European and global level, to maintain stability and growth.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o11"><a name="80317-0003.htm_para8"><a name="08031713000152">All European member states agreed to measures for greater financial market transparency: first, prompt and full disclosure of exposures to structured products and off balance sheet activities; secondly, more rigour in credit ratings; thirdly, improvements in valuation standards, particularly for illiquid assets; and fourthly, a strengthening of risk management under the capital requirements directive.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o12"><a name="80317-0003.htm_para9"><a name="08031713000153">Given the globally transmitted nature of the risks, it is clear that many of those recommendations&#151;the changes to credit rating agency operations and assessments; risk management and disclosure by global financial institutions; changes to capital adequacy rules; and arrangements for valuing financial instruments&#151;which have also been proposed as measures for change by the American Administration, can best be implemented at a global level.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o13"><a name="80317-0003.htm_para10"><a name="08031713000154">In welcoming that international dialogue as the first step in reform, I can tell the House that the Chancellor of the Exchequer is today writing to the G7, the International Monetary Fund and the Financial Stability Forum to call for co-ordinated international action on transparency and disclosure, better risk management and action on credit rating agencies to be agreed when the G7 and the IMF meet from 10 to 12 April.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o14"><a name="80317-0003.htm_para11"><a name="08031713000155">In line with the approach of other major central banks, the Bank of England has this morning announced a further &#163;5 billion liquidity support to financial institutions, and a new group has been set up to improve liquidity in the mortgage market.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o15"><a name="80317-0003.htm_para12"><a name="08031713000156">At the European Council I made it clear that, while our economy is resilient and fundamentally strong, we will at all times remain vigilant and, especially at this time of global uncertainty, continue to take whatever action is necessary to maintain economic stability and growth.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o16"><a name="80317-0003.htm_para13"><a name="08031713000157">The Council also discussed a new approach to the rising number and economic power of sovereign wealth funds. I strongly welcome the conclusions. Sovereign wealth funds are now worth $2 trillion, but may soon potentially be worth $10 trillion. Our new approach&#151;calling for a voluntary code of conduct based on best practice, openness, transparency and corporate governance&#151;is one that will enable funds to show that they are commercial in their operations.</p>

financial turbulence was not a reason to postpone fundamental economic reforms that are essential to building a more competitive European economy. We agreed that we should now press ahead with the liberalisation of markets and with new investment in knowledge and innovation. That includes further liberalisation in the energy, post and telecoms markets, which could generate up to 360,000 new jobs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o18"><a name="80317-0004.htm_para1"><a name="08031713000159">We discussed the need also for an economic reform strategy that looks beyond Lisbon&#151;a comprehensive strategy to improve the business environment, strengthen relations with China and India, put our creative and knowledge industries at the forefront of the world economy, and make European universities leading global players, in particular through increasing their contacts with business. So the next stage of the Lisbon agenda will include a review of human capital and skills in Europe, and a renewed focus on competition policy in the single market.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o19"><a name="80317-0004.htm_para2"><a name="08031713000160">The second major issue discussed by the Council was climate change, and it is essential that we achieve our ambitions of a comprehensive post-2012 agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and of Europe leading the world in a low-carbon economy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o20"><a name="80317-0004.htm_para3"><a name="08031713000161">In December, the united European front at the climate change negotiations in Bali played an important part in the historic breakthrough that agreed the need to make large cuts in emissions and achieve a new climate deal within two years. Only a common European approach&#151;a Europe with Britain not at the margins but at the centre, leading the world&#151;can ensure a global low-carbon economy founded on our proposal of a global carbon market.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o21"><a name="80317-0004.htm_para4"><a name="08031713000162">Building on this commitment, the Council agreed an ambitious schedule for adopting a package of measures to cut emissions by 20 per cent. by 2020 or by 30 per cent. as part of an international agreement. The Council also agreed with the UK on the need for an effective EU emissions trading scheme to provide the incentives to drive carbon reductions in the most cost-effective way and for a cap on emissions set centrally, with a clear emissions reductions trajectory to give investors the predictability that they now need.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o22"><a name="80317-0004.htm_para5"><a name="08031713000163">The Council also considered a report from the EU high representative on the security implications of climate change and, at our request, agreed to submit recommendations on follow-up action&#151;including intensifying co-operation with countries outside Europe&#151;by the end of the year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o23"><a name="80317-0004.htm_para6"><a name="08031713000164">Meeting the EU&#146;s climate change targets requires not just action to reduce carbon emissions from energy suppliers and industry, but incentives to change individual behaviour. The Council will now invite the Commission, in bringing forward its legislative proposals on VAT rates, due in the summer, and working with member states, to examine areas where economic instruments, including VAT rates, can play a role in increasing the use of energy-efficient goods and energy-saving materials, from, as the UK has proposed, insulation and household materials to energy-efficient electrical goods, where VAT is cut.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o24"><a name="80317-0004.htm_para7"><a name="08031713000165">The Council also agreed on the importance of achieving a fully functioning and joined-up internal energy market, as an essential condition for the secure, sustainable and competitive supply of energy across  <br>

The Council agreed to build on existing co-operation to establish a &#147;Union for the Mediterranean&#148;, to promote security and stability in the wider region and to provide a framework for co-operation between the EU27 and other Mediterranean coastal states on political and security issues, as well as economic, social and cultural affairs.

<p><a name="stpa_o26"><a name="80317-0004.htm_para9"><a name="08031713000167">We also agreed that international development issues and the achievement of the millennium development goals, as well as Europe&#146;s continuing leadership as the biggest contributor of aid in the world, will be the subject of a major discussion at the European Council in June.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o27"><a name="80317-0004.htm_para10"><a name="08031713000168">The outcome of the Council and the preparations that are being made for June affirm the conclusions of the debate that we have had in the House over the past nine weeks: they demonstrate that, with the completion of the Lisbon treaty, we now have an opportunity to move beyond institutional issues to create a more outward-looking, flexible and global Europe, and to address the challenges that matter most to the citizens of Europe.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o28"><a name="80317-0004.htm_para11"><a name="08031713000169">With three quarters of a million businesses, 3.5 million jobs and 60 per cent. of British trade dependent on our relationship with Europe, we should do nothing to put the stability of that relationship at risk. It is only by working constructively and remaining fully engaged with our European partners that we properly address the challenges ahead.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o29"><a name="80317-0004.htm_para12"><a name="08031713000170">As we prepare for the European Council in June and the French presidency later this year, our aim is that European countries working together can lead the way on climate change, on security, on international development and on the response to global financial turbulence. I will be discussing with President Sarkozy when he visits Britain next week how we can take all these challenges forward during the French presidency. I commend this statement to the House.</p>

 I welcome the focus of this Council: global competitiveness, global poverty and global climate change. This is the right agenda. On climate change, the first thing that Governments should do is get their own house in order. The draft communiqu&#233; included specific targets to reduce energy use in Government buildings, offices and cars. Will the Prime Minister explain why those specific targets were removed from the final text agreed at the weekend? Looking at our own record here in the UK, does the Prime Minister accept that 14 Government Departments are less energy-efficient than they were eight years ago, and that 15 Government Departments have actually increased their carbon emissions during that time&#151;<i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> He asks what this has got to do with Europe.

<p><a name="stpa_o30"><a name="80317-0004.htm_para13"><a name="08031713000172">The Prime Minister is right to say that the success  of the emissions trading scheme is vital. Will he acknowledge, however, that the Lisbon treaty is completely irrelevant to making that happen? There are six words on climate change in the treaty and, as the House of Lords Committee pointed out last week, they have no legal significance. Is it not the case that we do not need a new constitution or a new treaty to deal with climate change at EU level?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o31"><a name="80317-0004.htm_para14"><a name="08031713000173">Everyone will welcome the Prime Minister&#146;s intention to use indirect taxes, including VAT, as incentives for green behaviour.

<p><a name="stpa_o34"><a name="80317-0004.htm_para17"><a name="08031713000176">On the economy, Ministers discussed the recent turbulence in the financial markets. Clearly, proper co-ordination by central banks is going to be essential. Will the Prime Minister guarantee that his approach of putting the Financial Services Authority, rather than the Bank of England, in the lead to rescue British banks in distress will not make the process more difficult?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o35"><a name="80317-0004.htm_para18"><a name="08031713000177">The final communiqu&#233; from Brussels warns Governments across Europe about the dangers of high deficits. Will the Prime Minister confirm that Spain&#146;s budget is in balance, and that Germany, the Netherlands, Denmark and Sweden all have budget surpluses, while Britain has the largest budget deficit in western Europe? Does he now regret the fact that we are the one country that failed to prepare for the downturn by putting money aside in the good years?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o36"><a name="80317-0004.htm_para19"><a name="08031713000178">The other main issue for Europe to focus on is global poverty and the urgent need to make rapid progress on the Doha round. Will the Prime Minister tell us why the EU seems to be showing so little urgency in getting the deal moving again? The commissioner in charge of those negotiations is Peter Mandelson. Whatever any of us may think of him, I have always had very helpful briefing from him on trade and, I have to say, on other issues, too&#151;<i> [</i><i> Laughter.</i><i> ]</i> The Leader of the House should not laugh; she might put herself in jeopardy. What matters is that there should be a clear decision on whether he is going to serve another term. It cannot be in anyone&#146;s interests for the commissioner&#146;s future to be the subject of endless speculation. Will the Prime Minister tell us today whether Peter Mandelson is going to go on doing his job, or whether that decision is to be the subject of further dithering?</p>

An EU statement on Tibet has been issued today, which I am sure the whole House will welcome. Britain rightly works closely with China and we very much welcome the way it has opened up its economy, but is it not vital that the Chinese Government understand that with the greater role they play in the world comes greater responsibility? Does the Prime Minister agree that the strong relationship we all want with China requires us to be candid and frank, even on issues where we disagree?</p>

 I will deal with each point, but is it not remarkable when 3.5 million jobs are dependent on our membership of the European Union and when European co-operation on the environment was crucial to what happened at Bali that the right hon.

<p><a name="stpa_o39"><a name="80317-0004.htm_para22"><a name="08031713000182">The right hon. Gentleman says that the environment is nothing to do with the European reform treaty, but it is the first time we have set down as a strategic objective that the environment is an important issue and it is there in the treaty. All the other parties in Europe believe it is important that the environment be at the centre of Europe&#146;s work and if I may say so, if we are to lead the world on the environment, we will need to co-operate with our European partners.</p>

We are one of the few countries meeting our Kyoto targets and we will continue to do so. One of the reasons why we are meeting them is that we implemented early on in our Government the climate change levy, which the Conservatives continue to oppose.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o41"><a name="80317-0004.htm_para24"><a name="08031713000184">I find it very strange for the right hon. Gentleman to be raising issues that compare us with the rest of Europe in terms of economic progress. We have lower inflation than the rest of Europe and we have a history of stability and growth. He will find, during the course of this year, that the American deficit will be higher than the British one because people are taking the right action to deal with the global financial turbulence. I am sorry that the right hon. Gentleman has so little to say in support of the action that the European Union and, indeed, all international authorities are taking on the economic issues confronting them. If the Conservatives want to be a serious party, perhaps they could actually address the serious issues of economic progress.</p>

Gentleman is absolutely right that, although it was not discussed at the European Council, all of us are concerned about what is happening there. We have made our views known to the Chinese authority: we believe that there should be restraint and an end to violence; and we believe that there should be a dialogue between the different authorities, which should happen soon. It is very important to recognise that at this time the whole world is looking to China to see what the reaction will be.</p>

Is that really the best way to show leadership and do business in the EU? My worry is that the manner in which the proposal was spun in the press had as much to do with obscuring the Government&#146;s woeful record on the environment, compared with that of other EU countries.</p>

We have a recycling rate well behind that of France, Germany, Spain and other countries.

For instance, will he commit today to giving support to a new draft directive on the geological storage of carbon, which is being drafted in the European Parliament and which would oblige all member states to accelerate the use of carbon capture technology at all the coal-burning power stations?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o48"><a name="80317-0004.htm_para31"><a name="08031713000194">I strongly agree with the Prime Minister that there is a pressing need to move towards a fully integrated and competitive energy market in the single market. In particular, the EU needs the powers to take action against monopoly energy providers in markets such as France and Germany. Does he agree that the new Lisbon treaty would give the EU precisely those powers further to liberalise the EU energy market, and that that is just another example of the benefits that the treaty would bring the British economy, which the Conservative party is so keen to deny the British people?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o49"><a name="80317-0004.htm_para32"><a name="08031713000195">I warmly welcome the Prime Minister&#146;s remarks about co-ordinated action at European level to ensure stability and greater transparency in the financial markets.

That is why we must also now pioneer reforms to the system of lending to ensure that we do not find ourselves in a similar position in years to come.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o51"><a name="80317-0004.htm_para34"><a name="08031713000197">Does the Prime Minister agree that while it is critical that the capital requirements directive be reviewed if we are to prevent a further boom-and-bust cycle in the credit markets, we must be prepared to use levers to control supply as well as demand for credit?</p>

 I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman. First, may I correct him on VAT? I first raised the issue months ago with our European colleagues; I have been following it up ever since. I am grateful that we now have an agreement to look in detail at whether VAT reductions on matters such as household materials and electrical goods can be beneficial both in encouraging people to use energy-efficient products and in stimulating a market where Europe can benefit in the future. So, he is wrong to say that this was raised only on the day of the Council. We have been pressing our European colleagues on the matter for some time.</p>

Again, I have to correct him. Carbon capture and storage is something that we have been pushing right across the EU. There will be 12 demonstration plants, and one of them, we believe, will be in the UK, but we want the European Commission to make it possible for there to be greater incentives so that people will develop carbon capture and storage at a quicker rate.</p>

In June, this matter will be discussed in detail at the European Council as a report is being prepared already by Mr. Barroso, President of the Commission, about the progress that has been made and the progress that has still to be made. That will lead through to September, when there will be a special session of the UN&#151;called by the Secretary-General&#151;to look at what we must do next to achieve the MDGs.

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o63"><a name="80317-0006.htm_para1"><a name="08031713000255">A constituent of mine first drew my attention to nail bars and the potential problems posed by what one might describe as the bargain-basement end of the market. My constituent, who runs a reputable nail bar in central Milton Keynes, became very concerned by the damage that had been done to the nails of some of her customers by other, less reputable establishments. Since I first raised this issue in the House on 15 November 2007, I have received feedback from across the UK showing that this is a widespread problem&#151;a point reflected in the wide geographical spread of the sponsors of this Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o64"><a name="80317-0006.htm_para2"><a name="08031713000256">It might help Members who are not familiar with the nail bar business if I briefly describe what nail bars are and the procedures they use. Nail bars are a relatively recent import from the US. They are a part of the beauty industry, and offer artificial nail extensions that can then be painted or decorated. In reputable nail bars with properly qualified nail technicians, nail extensions are created from mixing a polymer powder with a polymerising agent called ethyl methacrylate, or EMA. The resulting nail extension is flexible and easily attached to the natural nail. Unfortunately, the expansion of nail bars has led to a rise in the number using unqualified technicians and using an alternative polymerising agent called methyl methacrylate, or MMA. The agent is banned in nail bars in the United States, Australia and New Zealand, but there is no such ban in this country. The attractions of MMA to the operative is that it is much cheaper than EMA, at between a third and a sixth of the price, and that it forms the extensions more quickly, enabling non-standard nail bars to undercut the prices of the more reputable businesses.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o65"><a name="80317-0006.htm_para3"><a name="08031713000257">The customer might not be aware until it is too late that MMA has serious disadvantages, however. The nail extension is much more rigid and does not adhere well to the natural nail, so the natural nail has to be drilled or etched with an electric file to help adhesion. Unlike EMA, MMA polymers continue to polymerise once attached, and the MMA penetrates and damages the nail bed. Long-term use of MMA is associated with respiratory problems and serious allergic skin reactions, and the staff using it usually protect themselves, including from the dust generated by the electric filing, by wearing gloves and masks. That ought to suggest to the customer that the use of MMA is not risk free.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o66"><a name="80317-0006.htm_para4"><a name="08031713000258">The other consequence for the customer of using MMA is that the extensions are so rigid and so tightly stuck to the nail that if they get caught or jammed the natural nail can be ripped off. Pain is caused by the drilling, and the permanent ridging and damage to the natural nail and nail bed can take a long time to grow out. To compound matters, MMA extensions are much  <br>

more difficult to remove than those formed with EMA. <i> [Interruption.] </i>I can see that I am catching the attention of the hon. Member for Putney (Justine Greening). Several of the nail bar technicians who have contacted me have shown me graphic pictures of the damage that MMA has caused to the nails of patrons of sub-standard nail bars.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o67"><a name="80317-0006.htm_para5"><a name="08031713000259">One way to deal with the problem is to improve awareness among the public, particularly young girls and women, of the damage caused by MMA and the importance of ensuring that, before anyone tampers with their nails, they check that the person is properly qualified. I know of one scheme that is to be launched shortly, which will allow potential customers to check a website for reputable nail bars in their area. I very much welcome that, but simply improving public awareness will not stop the continued spread of non-standard nail bars. Such bars not only risk affecting their customers but undercut the credibility of the whole sector and those who try to provide a high-quality service.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o68"><a name="80317-0006.htm_para6"><a name="08031713000260">London councils within the M25 already have the power under part II of the London Local Authorities Act 1991&#151;&#147;Special treatment premises&#148;&#151;to license nail bars, and thus in principle to impose standards, including the appropriate level of qualification for staff and restrictions on the chemicals that can be used. However, the contacts that I have had suggest that even in London, where licensing powers exist, council licensing officers may be focusing on hygiene&#151;that is important, because hepatitis C can be spread through the use of electric drills on nails&#151;and may not be aware of the specific risks of MMA or of the need to check the qualifications of staff.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o69"><a name="80317-0006.htm_para7"><a name="08031713000261">Outside London, the situation is even more confused. Nail bars do not come within the scope of the Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1982, and therefore cannot be subject to licensing. Environmental health staff can give advice on the use of chemicals, but their only enforcement powers come through the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974, which is relevant to employees, not to customers. Trading standards can respond to customer complaints, but most customers do not realise that the pain and damage that they experience because of MMA are not just a normal part of the process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o70"><a name="80317-0006.htm_para8"><a name="08031713000262">Although the problem of MMA seems well known in the industry, it seems to be below the radar of public authorities. In response to earlier comments that I have made in the House, the Department of Health has told me that it has made no assessment of the public health  <br>

risk of MMA in nail bars, and the Health Protection Agency has no record of ill effects to customers or employees in the last three years. The HSE&#146;s health and safety laboratory is apparently reviewing health issues for technicians in nail bars, but it seems that, once again, the effect on the customer is being ignored&#151;perhaps because damaged nail beds are not regarded as a terribly serious public health issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o71"><a name="80317-0006.htm_para9"><a name="08031713000263">That is not satisfactory. Most of the customers of non-standard nail bars are likely to be young women and girls on low incomes, for whom the low prices that those businesses can charge make nail extensions seem much more accessible. Customers need to be protected from unscrupulous operators, which is why I propose that the powers already enjoyed by London councils to license nail bars and a number of other similar businesses should be extended to all local authorities across England.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o72"><a name="80317-0006.htm_para10"><a name="08031713000264">The chief environmental health officer at my local council in Milton Keynes tells me that following an inspection, tattooists, for example, like to have a document from the local authority as it drives the cowboy operators out of business. It helps to bring in customers if businesses can advertise that they are registered with the local authority. Among qualified nail technicians, there is also strong support for regulation. At present, an astonishing 85 per cent. of nail technicians do not have NVQ level 3 qualifications, and have no incentive to invest in the training as it gives them no competitive advantage.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o73"><a name="80317-0006.htm_para11"><a name="08031713000265">A proper licensing regime across England would protect customers, drive up standards and reward those businesses investing in training. It would mean that girls and young women could use nail bars and be confident that they would suffer no ill-effects.</p>

 I welcome the opportunity afforded by the Budget debate to discuss the challenge that we face as a country and as a world to move from our historical reliance on a carbon-intensive way of living towards a sustainable, low-carbon economy. Wherever we look, whatever goods and services we buy, whatever things we do, all of them have a carbon footprint. Carbon is currently central to our way of life, but we need that to change if emissions are to decline in the way that is necessary.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o80"><a name="80317-0006.htm_para18"><a name="08031713000279">The UK has made progress. We have broken the link between economic growth and growth in carbon emissions. The economy has grown by about a quarter in real terms in the last 10 years, whereas greenhouse gas emissions have fallen by 7.6 per cent. But for the action that has been taken, greenhouse gas emissions would now be about 15 per cent. higher than they were in 1990; instead, we will more than meet our Kyoto target. However, as the facts of climate change become more stark, we will need to be even more radical, and the Climate Change Bill will enable us to do just that. For the first time anywhere in the world, a legal requirement will be placed on the Government of the day to ensure that the country&#146;s carbon account does not exceed its carbon budgets. Budgets will be set in legislation.</p>

 If the hon. Gentleman will bear with me, I shall give some of those figures in the course of my speech. The facts, however, are that the independent climate change committee, the shadow version of which met for the first time last week, will of course propose the first of the three carbon budgets at the end of this year. At the same time, it will advise the Government, as my right hon. Friend the Chancellor outlined last week, on whether we should go further than the 60 per cent. reduction by 2050 and strengthen it to an 80 per cent. reduction.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o81"><a name="80317-0006.htm_para19"><a name="08031713000282">Our task now is to ensure that the UK meets those budgets. That will require a contribution from every business and every household in the land as well as co-ordinated efforts across government. That is why the Chancellor announced last week that the first three carbon budgets will be set alongside the Budget next year. That is a sign of the Government&#146;s determination to put reducing carbon dioxide emissions at the centre of policy making and of the economy.</p>

 The Secretary of State will be well aware that measuring the right thing is critical. He will know that the narrow measure used for Kyoto tells one story while the broader measure in the nation&#146;s environment accounts, produced by the Office for National Statistics, tells a different story. Does he accept that on that basis, according to a comprehensive measure, CO2 emissions have not fallen at all since 1990 and have increased since 1997? Is that not a cause for grave concern?</p>

 According to the measure that we use to report to the United Nations, because that is the way it asks for the figures to be submitted, it is clear that UK emissions of greenhouse gases have fallen by 15.4 per cent. and emissions of CO2 by 6.4 per cent. We also report to the UN figures on emissions from aviation and shipping, which are included in a footnote when they are published. As the hon. Gentleman will be aware, the ONS does its own estimate in the environmental accounts. That calculates emissions from flights in a different way and also includes estimates resulting from UK citizens who live and work in other countries. It clearly would not make sense for those figures to be included in the UK totals that are reported to the UN framework convention on climate change. The way in which we report fulfils the requirement that the UN places on us, and we are making the progress that has been set out. Aviation and shipping are issues that we need to deal with internationally.</p>

The House will, I am sure, appreciate that that is a profound change in the way in which we do things. As the first of its kind in the world, the Climate Change Bill is also a sign of the UK&#146;s international commitment. As the House will be aware, the world agreed in Bali just before Christmas to start negotiations on a new global climate deal to take us beyond 2012.</p>

now. We have to get every country in the world to play its part. That is why leadership in Europe is so important. As we have just heard from my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister, the European Council has reaffirmed its commitment to cut greenhouse gas emissions in Europe by 20 per cent. by 2020, with legislation next year. Part of the agreement is that Europe will go further, with a 30 per cent. reduction by 2020, if an international agreement is reached.</p>

We can bring to the negotiating table only that which we can contribute at home.

<p><a name="stpa_o85"><a name="80317-0007.htm_para2"><a name="08031713000288">Our approach to reducing emissions across the economy&#151;in our homes, our businesses, the public sector, transport and energy supply&#151;is based on three principles. The first is pricing carbon, through a trading tax or through regulation, to get the most cost-effective reduction. The second is encouraging innovation in low-carbon technologies, and the third is removing barriers to action, including encouraging long-term behavioural change. The Budget does those things by setting out the steps that we intend to take in each of those areas. Each of us as individuals has a role to play in tackling climate change.</p>

 Before the Secretary of State gets to the meat of the three principles, may I point out that both he and the Chancellor in his Budget have been entirely silent about using taxpayers&#146; money to buy carbon credits in overseas markets to allow us to fulfil our ambitious carbon targets? The National Audit Office estimates that the cost to British taxpayers will be about &#163;5 billion by 2020; what is the Government&#146;s estimate?</p>

<p><a name="st_o151"><a name="08031713000290"><a name="80317-0007.htm_spnew1"><a name="08031713000739"><b>Hilary Benn:</b>
 It will depend on the decision that the Government take about the use of international credits. As the hon. Gentleman will be aware, the Bill provides for the Committee on Climate Change to give us advice on the use of international credits. The Government will have to look at that advice in due course, when we receive it. In another place, there was a lively debate about the use of international credits, and we will no doubt have such a debate in the House when the Bill comes before us. As I am sure the hon. Gentleman accepts, it is entirely legitimate to make progress partly by using international credits because in the end, from the world&#146;s point of view, it does not matter where emissions are saved, as long as they are saved. That is why the Government&#146;s view is that carbon trading and the purchase of credit have an important role to play.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o86"><a name="80317-0007.htm_para3"><a name="08031713000291">Some 40 per cent. of emissions are the result of choices that we make as individuals, so the Government want to help people to make low-carbon choices, and to ensure that our homes and products are working towards low-carbon living. That is why we launched a big public awareness campaign last year to encourage people to act on CO2. I saw that campaign working for myself in Leeds last Friday. The online carbon calculator has already been visited by about 800,000 people. It is practical and simple; it helps us as individuals to understand what our own carbon emissions are, and gives practical ideas on how to reduce our carbon footprint.</p>

That will help to save 4 million tonnes of CO2 a year by 2011, and deliver a typical saving of &#163;90 on fuel bills. The green homes service, which is to be launched next month, will provide people with comprehensive advice on how they can reduce their carbon footprint, and will connect people with the offers that are available from energy companies and with other support.

We have introduced regulations to improve the energy efficiency of new homes. Today&#146;s buildings are 40 per cent. more energy efficient than those built before 2002, and 70 per cent. more efficient than those built before 1990. In under a decade, all new homes will be zero-carbon. We will set out the definition of a zero-carbon home for the purposes of the 2016 target by the end of 2008, following a consultation in the summer.

 As the hon. Gentleman will no doubt be aware, we are considering the role that feed-in tariffs could play in ensuring that people do the things that he sets out.

The experience of other European countries that have adopted feed-in tariffs for microgeneration is that it brings forward investment: the renewables obligation certificates work better for large-scale generation.</p>

The carbon reduction commitment will cover the non-intensive business sector. Up to 5,000 large public sector organisations and businesses, such as banks and supermarkets, will participate in the scheme. It will save at least 4 million tonnes of CO2 per year by 2020 and will save the organisations involved some &#163;755 million through lower energy bills.</p>

 My right hon. Friend referred to feed-in tariffs, which we welcome&#151;they cover revenue costs and help with day-to-day costs. However, the capital cost of installing solar panels, for example, is very high. There was a Government scheme for 50 per cent. grants; if that were available generally, I am sure that solar panels would rapidly be installed across the whole country.</p>

 Following the consultation that the Government are going to undertake on them, feed-in tariffs would encourage people to invest and encourage others to lend money for people to invest, by providing the income stream for the years ahead. As I have said before, I think that way of doing things is better than the Government giving out grants to achieve the same effect. The tariffs would incentivise the system; that is why the Secretary of State for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform has announced that we will consider them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o91"><a name="80317-0007.htm_para8"><a name="08031713000303">However, we need to go further still. That is why the Chancellor announced in the Budget our aim that all new non-domestic buildings be zero-carbon from 2019, with the public sector leading the way. It is already the Government&#146;s aim for all new schools to be zero-carbon from 2016; we want all new public sector buildings to be zero-carbon from 2018 and we will establish a taskforce to advise on the timetable and on how to reduce carbon emissions in the intervening period. To help public sector bodies in England, including local authorities and hospitals, I have already announced an extra &#163;30 million over three years in interest-free loans for energy-efficiency projects through the Salix scheme.</p>

Changing the transport sector to meet the demands of business and personal travel while reducing carbon emissions is clearly important. That is why the Government have provided sustained year-on-year investment in public transport. One consequence has been that passenger numbers on our railways are up&#151;from 735 million passengers in 1994-95 to 1.16 billion in 2006-07.

In response, the Government have made clear their support for an EU-wide target for vehicle manufacturers to reduce average CO2 from new cars to 100 g per kilometre by 2020. That would be on top of the provision for 130 g of CO2 per kilometre currently being discussed in Europe.

 From memory, I think that the best-in-class 4x4 has an emissions figure of 151 g of CO2 per kilometre. If the hon. and learned Gentleman looks at the new table for vehicle excise duty, he will see that that figure is well below some of the others. The aim of the change to vehicle excise duty is to encourage people purchasing new vehicles to choose the most fuel-efficient and least polluting in class. That is why individuals who buy the most polluting, fuel-hungry vehicles will have to pay &#163;950 in the first year, 2010-11, which is more than double the current rate, while those who buy the cleanest&#151;those emitting 130 g of CO2 or less per kilometre&#151;will pay nothing.</p>

 I will be happy to write to the hon. Gentleman with a list of the best in class for all the different categories showing what vehicle can be purchased and what are the CO2 emissions in grams per kilometre for those vehicles. The change is intended, first, to incentivise the purchase of low-emission vehicles and, secondly, to incentivise the manufacturers to invest more effort in producing more vehicles that have lower emissions. That is one of the changes that must be made if we are to make progress in meeting the aims of the Budget. Although I understand the Opposition&#146;s wish to raise these points, in the end this is about making choices. It is all very well to talk about the need for green taxation, but when measures come along to create an incentive structure for vehicles in order to lead to a change, the House should support that.</p>

It is a difference that the Government do not seem to get and, as a result, a difference that the public do not get either.</p>

He proposes increasing car taxes to generate an additional &#163;735 million in revenues while the tax cut on low-carbon cars will give back to us &#163;15 million. To put it another way, the Chancellor is raising 50 times more tax than he is cutting. In the light of that fact, it is extraordinary for the Chancellor to claim that an average family will be no worse off as a result of those changes, when seven in 10 motorists will pay more in vehicle excise duty.</p>

 Is not the position actually worse than that? In the next two years, the take on the vehicle excise duty change will be &#163;1.2 billion. Given that amount of extra yield, does it not indicate to the hon. Gentleman that the Government are not planning for any behavioural change? It is indeed just a tax.</p>

According to <i> The Guardian</i>, it will help reduce CO2 emissions from the transport sector by less than 1 per cent. So, it is not a green tax; it is not a meaningful part of the solution to the greatest challenge that we face. It is a stealth tax. I cannot think of a better way to alienate the public from the whole green agenda than dressing up stealth taxes as green.</p>

 Clearly, there are two points here: what happens to the money and the structure of the tax. If all the money raised through the increased tiered VED had gone on some other tax cut, would the hon.

However, the important caveat that we have made clear is that any revenues from additional green taxes should not just disappear into the Exchequer, but should be used to cut taxation on families and on other things that help society and help to make the country a better place.</p>

The Fed has intervened, and for the first time since the great depression has extended its lending rights to companies that are not banks or investment banks. Such is the level of concern about the extent to which conventional money markets have been creating funny money and a bubble economy that is now bursting all around us, and shows no sign of coming to an immediate end. It seems to me that we cannot have this Budget debate without seeking to engage with the fact that we may have to think about systems failure on a global scale, and about what the United Kingdom must do to manage what is within our grasp in the context of that failure.</p>

 Sadly, that is precisely what I am saying. We are going back to the days of the south sea bubble, when money in the private sector could be created without constraints on a scale that led the world in pursuit of follies for which we all paid a phenomenally high price. What makes the present position harder is the fact that it comes at the same time as other developments. Today oil hit a record price of $111.80 a barrel, from which it has just slipped back. The oil companies are beginning to say to us openly that the world will face an oil crunch by 2015. That means they understand that the last four years, in which oil production has never really exceeded 85 million barrels per day, have nailed the lie that there are vast untapped reserves that will just cope with the burgeoning demands on oil from India and China and from developing nations. We live in an era of declining quantities of available oil and escalating oil prices, and even according to the oil industry&#146;s calculations, that will hit us by 2015.

United Kingdom, and the ethical basis on which those markets work. Perhaps it is a good time to cut out the Chancellor as the middleman in that process. Easy and available mechanisms are on offer to us today, if only we had the willingness and the vision to reach out beyond our shores, or beyond the Treasury mindset, to see how those might work.</p>

I begin with financial accountability. There are no easy solutions to paper over the mess that has been created within the international financial systems, but we should be saying that the UK will place two principal requirements on how our financial systems work. First, we should introduce legislation that says that directors will be made personally liable for anything not reported in their annual accounts. That would bring to an end the off balance sheet accounting and securitisation of assets that have allowed the creation of Mickey Mouse money on a colossal scale.</p>

 I would include the Government. In fact that was my second point. The second rule that I would bring in would say that no public contracts should go to any company that was registering its activities in an offshore tax haven. As an adjunct to that, it should be a precondition of all public sector contracts that they would not include any entitlement to shift the company or the assets offshore for the duration of the PFI contract. It seems that large numbers of contracts are shifted offshore to make them more tax-advantageous to the companies that have been getting them. It is wrong for us in government to preach one set of ethics if we practise another, so we should set that as our own requirement and set those preconditions for all other companies.</p>

The best example of how to do that is in Germany and it is in the context of energy. Opposition Members and a number of Members on the Government Benches have tried over a number of years to get the Government to do precisely what the Secretary of State has now said they will do, which is to look at feed-in tariff legislation and the way in which it works in Germany. However, it is not enough to say that we will be looking at that. That system has a proven record of delivery. How it works is simple. Germany introduced market rules that gave citizens the right to supply clean energy. In addition, the Government placed a requirement on the energy sector, saying, &#147;You will pay your customers four times the market rate on 20-year guarantee periods, reducing at 5 per cent. per year, for the clean energy that you   <br>

supply in the system.&#148; Yes, other customers within the energy system have to pay for that. It worked out at an average of &#163;12 to &#163;14 per year per household energy bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o162"><a name="80317-0009.htm_para28"><a name="08031713000410">When I tried to raise that with Government civil servants in the Department for Business, as Usual, they said, &#147;It is an interventionist measure, which we do not support.&#148; I said to them, &#147;You do support interventionist measures; it is just that you support only incompetent ones.&#148; We have the renewables obligation, climate change agreements, the climate change levy and commitments to carbon emissions trading. They all add costs to people&#146;s bills, amounting to &#163;140 a year on the average household bill. For that we get one tenth of the carbon savings that people get in Germany for their &#163;12 a year. This is not about market intervention; it is about shaking off the shackles of our own incompetent intervention. I hope that amendments&#151;supported by Members of all parties&#151;will be tabled to the Energy Bill that say at the very least, &#147;Yes, by all means look at feed-in tariffs, but we should be under a statutory obligation to bring in a scheme of feed-in tariffs within one year of the passing of the Bill&#148;. There should also be a commitment to extend that not only to electricity, but to gas. We must look into that; I know that the Secretary of State has looked into it in terms of his own Department.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o163"><a name="80317-0009.htm_para29"><a name="08031713000411">There are some rules that we must change. Green energy electricity suppliers have been queuing up in the UK for up to 10 years to get access to the system. They cannot do so because the existing suppliers have first call on access to the system and the rules are that only if they cannot meet the energy demands of the day are new suppliers to be drawn in. Therefore, as Kingsnorth comes from an existing supplier, it will take precedence over a green energy supplier that has been in the queue to get access to the system for 10 years. We must give green energy suppliers preferential access to the system.</p>

Germany, however, has been putting decayable waste not into landfill or incineration, but into anaerobic digesters. It therefore turns the waste into energy and puts the gas back into the system, and it does so at the locations&#151;the communities, towns and villages&#151;that the waste was collected from. The waste is used there in combined heat and power plants to deliver a local energy system. We cannot do that because our current system of renewables obligations applies only if the gas is converted into energy at the anaerobic digester plant, as a consequence of which there would be the huge cost of ducting heat for many miles, which would be utterly uneconomic. We need, therefore, to change the market rules for our energy systems.</p>

 I do agree, and I ought to say that I was the chair of a waste disposal company in Nottinghamshire that was responsible for the incinerator we have in Nottingham. At the time, we dramatically raised standards in filtering and emissions. I look back at that and think it was a half-good idea for the second half of the last century, but it is a hopeless idea for the beginning of this century. We ought not to be wasting a moment in going down that path now, when the true visionary steps take us outside such conventional boxes and into a different framework of thinking about, and delivering, sustainable energy from our own waste.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o166"><a name="80317-0010.htm_para0"><a name="08031713000416">I have a confession to make. Over just this past week I have come to realise that I have become a Brownite. Unfortunately my political conversion is to the beliefs of, Lester Brown, whose book, &#147;Plan B: Rescuing a Planet under Stress and a Civilization in Trouble&#148;, sets out how we can transform our economy to deliver 80 per cent. carbon reductions by 2020. Achieving that, however, requires us to give industry the responsibility of being, and the incentive to become, the driver of its own transformation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o167"><a name="80317-0010.htm_para1"><a name="08031713000417">Let me illustrate how that would work with transport. It is essential to say that we require something more than a raising of the vehicle excise duty on gas-guzzling vehicles, so what would be seen as transformational? Let us say that we extended the German energy model to our own approach to vehicles. The sensible approach would be to require the industry to impose a levy of, say, &#163;3,000 on all gas-guzzling vehicles, but which can be a transfer payment to meet the cost of hybrid, low-carbon vehicles in a given manufacturer&#146;s own range. That way, our citizens face the prospect of a cash incentive to transfer to low-carbon impact modes of transport, rather than high-carbon, so it should be economically advantageous. For manufacturers who do not produce hybrid or low-carbon vehicles, the money should go into an industry-administered fund that pays for the retroconversion of vehicles to meet low-carbon emission standards. That way, the industry is made responsible for its own transformation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o168"><a name="80317-0010.htm_para2"><a name="08031713000418">I should point out that in 1998, the Government reached an agreement with the motor manufacturing industry that by 2008 it would have reduced carbon emissions from 190 g per kilometre to 140 g. My understanding is that there is not a cat in hell&#146;s chance of its doing that. As someone who has been somewhat sceptical about voluntary agreements, I say, let us take this one at its word. Let us say, &#147;Fine&#151;there will also be a levy of &#163;1,000 on every vehicle you sell that does not meet the 140 g per kilometre standard. You keep that money in an industry fund to pay for conversion to low-carbon vehicles.&#148; People may say that that is somewhat draconian, but even if we wait for the oil industry&#146;s 2015 figure, we will face an oil price crunch that will lead to a crisis in terms of the unaffordability of the conventional ways in which we have tried to move around the country. We should anticipate this, live with it and engage with it. We should move towards transformational budgetary economics, rather than adopting the &#147;steady as you go&#148; approach, with the notion that, hopefully, someone else will dispose of the crisis for us.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o169"><a name="80317-0010.htm_para3"><a name="08031713000419">We could do exactly the same with aviation. It would be really helpful if we did not put all our eggs in the  <br>

presumptive basket of the carbon emissions trading scheme, which is a Mickey Mouse idea at best. All the nations that have been in that scheme cheat, and so do we. At the end of the day, it is the scope for dishonesty that will sink the scheme. The truth is that it is those who act as middlemen in the financial system, and the largest polluting industries, that have really made the money out of emissions trading. Even if all the permits were auctioned, that would still prompt the question whether that money would go directly into funding behavioural changes that would transform our approach to sustainable economics. I do not think that it would.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o170"><a name="80317-0010.htm_para4"><a name="08031713000420">The simpler way, to pick up on a point made by the hon. Member for Altrincham and Sale, West (Mr. Brady) in a previous debate, is to say that not all aircraft are the same in terms of their carbon emitting standards, which is absolutely true. We could classify aircraft in the same way that we classify fridges. We could say to airports, &#147;On the basis of your last year&#146;s journeys in and out, you will be allocated a carbon miles quota. Next year and for every year after that, that quota will reduce by 5 per cent., and it is up to you to work out how you manage the affordability and frequency of flights, the balance between long and short haul and the balance between passenger and freight. However, none of it escapes a direct and easily measurable quantum that establishes that the carbon mileage entitlement is being reduced by 5 per cent. per year. That is the way we have to go.&#148; Indeed, we could do exactly the same with shipping. That is a measurable, rather than speculative, approach to transforming the way in which the markets operate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o171"><a name="80317-0010.htm_para5"><a name="08031713000421">My final point concerns food. One point that has emerged from the changes in oil prices in the past year is the realisation that the impact kicks in in our shopping trolleys far sooner than it does at the petrol station. We will be faced with real problems about how people can survive, not only in the eating part of everyday life but in the heating part. Henceforth, all Governments will be required to produce budgets that address their own food security needs. We must refocus on that responsibility, because of the extent to which the UK has walked away from it on a presumption that globalised food trade will always provide an answer from somewhere. Whether we put it down to climate change, peak oil or economic collapse, that ain&#146;t gonna happen any more.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o172"><a name="80317-0010.htm_para6"><a name="08031713000422">We need to relocalise our presumptions about food markets, in exactly the same way as other parts of Europe have maintained their strong, regionalised food systems. In many cases, they highlight the ecological virtue of those systems by pointing out where they lower carbon miles, reduce pollution and congestion, and strengthen the lines of food accountability from the local producer to the local consumer.</p>

If that can be done on a simple scale locally, it can be done on a national scale. We need to do it because tomorrow&#146;s economics will not be a continuation from today of business as usual.

 It is always refreshing to follow the hon. Member for Nottingham, South (Alan Simpson). Of the three contributions so far, his gave us the breadth of vision to match the scale of the problem. I come to the issue relatively fresh, having been the party spokesman only since Christmas. I have been astonished by the gap between the scale of the problem, as per the rhetoric in the Budget and the scientific evidence, and the time scale and scope of the proposed measures. The Budget is a classic example of the contrast between what is actually being done and what needed to be done. My hon. Friend the Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable) described the contrast between the &#147;apocalyptic language&#148; and the &#147;minimal and deferred&#148; changes, which summed up the situation nicely.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o174"><a name="80317-0010.htm_para8"><a name="08031713000425">It is important to give the background to the Budget, as the hon. Member for East Surrey (Mr. Ainsworth) did. It is timely that the National Audit Office produced over the weekend the report that he cited, because it gives us a different take on what has been going on&#151;a take that does not reflect terribly well on successive Governments&#146; approach to climate change. I think that it was the Minister for the Environment who at Thursday&#146;s oral questions gave us the figures for carbon dioxide cuts. The figures he gave were technically correct with regard to the Kyoto definitions, but he will know that they are narrow definitions, although I fully accept that they are internationally standardised.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o175"><a name="80317-0010.htm_para9"><a name="08031713000426">In response to an intervention of mine, the Secretary of State said that aviation and shipping were a footnote to the international statistics. <i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> As he says from a sedentary position, that is where they are&#151;they are a footnote. He knows perfectly well, as we do, that in reality they are a huge and important issue. In judging how well this country is doing on this vital issue, surely we should look for the most comprehensive measures possible, not congratulate ourselves on progress against a narrow measure that simply excludes a whole set of carbon emissions that are just as damaging as the ones in the figures. That is not just a debating point or a claim that the Government pick the figures that look best and the Opposition pick the figures that look worst. We should be concerned about the real impact of CO2 emissions, which are surely most relevantly measured against the broadest measure produced by the Office for National Statistics.</p>

 I do not want to take up time, but I must say in response to a point that has been made in the debate and in national newspapers that the figures I gave, as I said at oral questions, related to greenhouse gases, not specifically to CO2. The Government have always been clear about the difference.</p>

I accept there is an issue about British people overseas, but the exclusion of those factors is fundamental.

Member for East Surrey called indulgences&#151;or the buying of credits. In a sense and at one level, the Secretary of State is right. What matters is that we get emissions down, and it could be argued that it does not matter so much where that happens, but in the long term buying credits puts off the day of transformation to the low-carbon economy that the hon. Member for Nottingham, South mentioned, while other countries make the necessary changes. If we believe that the situation is really urgent, what we do should be additional to what other countries are doing, as far as possible. We should not allow them to do it instead of us, because that just puts off the evil day.</p>

 I do support such a cap, and before the Bill reaches this House, I shall read the debates in the other place, in which their lordships agreed a figure of 30 per cent. I shall certainly oppose Government attempts to reverse that, but I have an open mind on whether it should be lower. The key point is that we need to lock into a low-carbon structural economy, and buying our way out simply defers that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o179"><a name="80317-0010.htm_para13"><a name="08031713000434">The other contextual point that I want to make is about the contrast between the bits and pieces&#151;such as the plastic bags&#151;and the fact that in almost the same week the Government encouraged expansion at Heathrow and Stansted. A whole new generation of coal-fired power plants, without carbon capture and storage, is likely to go ahead. Marginal changes are being made, but the whole thrust of policy in other areas, run by different Departments&#151;that is a key point&#151;is in completely the other direction. All hon. Members in their places today would probably wish more power to the Secretary of State&#146;s elbow. We wish that he had more influence on the Government, but so often his Department nibbles around the edges and does its best, but another Department comes trampling down the track and reverses that.

unleaded petrol. Actually, that was a green subsidy, not a green tax&#151;a differential in favour of unleaded petrol. At the start of the 1980s, who would have thought that by the end of the decade cars that ran on leaded petrol would be oddities? It did not take long to change because the incentive structure was put in place. The same could happen with the vehicle excise duty tiering that we have heard about&#151;</p>

Why not persist with it? Given that the purchase is the critical decision, why not keep the VED at that rate for the lifetime of the vehicle? That would send a strong signal and it would encourage manufacturers to start thinking about the new cars that they put on sale. That might lead to a much quicker transformation in what is offered.</p>

 We certainly think that the increased VED should continue: it should not be a one-off hit. We also think that green tax, as broadly defined, should represent a significantly bigger share of the total tax take. As the hon.

a certain amount in taxation, surely it is common sense to raise that on pollution and the marginal choices that increase carbon emissions, rather than on income and the things that we want people to do. The present balance is wrong, and I do not understand why the Government do not address that. I take the point made by the hon. Member for Nottingham, South that the risk is that the Government will totally discredit the notion of green taxation, which is one of the key levers we have at our disposal.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o184"><a name="80317-0010.htm_para18"><a name="08031713000443">How much green taxation was in the Budget? The Institute for Fiscal Studies says that by 2010 additional green taxation will be &#163;1.8 billion a year. In the context of Treasury estimates of revenue, that is a rounding error. The Chancellor routinely revises his income and expenditure figures by far more than that every six months. The idea that the Budget contained some huge tax switch that will transform our battle against climate change is nonsense, and in his heart of hearts the Secretary of State knows that. The scale of what is proposed is simply not up to the scale of the problem.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o185"><a name="80317-0010.htm_para19"><a name="08031713000444">We have heard of the endless deferral&#151;to 2019&#151;on new buildings. The schools programme has a target of 2016. The Department for Children, Schools and Families is rebuilding schools up and down the land, so for another eight years new schools, which will presumably stand the test of time for decades, will be built to inadequate standards, locking in sub-standard carbon performance. That should be dramatically improved&#151;and quickly.</p>

The Secretary of State used to hold the same position at the Department for International Development. The British Government will clearly contribute worldwide to attempts to deal with the consequences of climate change, and we know that many of the poorest countries will be the first to suffer. Does he therefore share my view, and that of the leader of the Liberal Democrats, that our spending on alleviating the consequences of climate change should be additional to the 0.7 per cent. target and should not eat into it? Surely it would be a double penalty on the world&#146;s poorest people to say, &#147;Actually, we were planning to spend money on clean water, education, disease protection and all those things, but we are not going to spend as much on them. Our actions of decades past are ruining your natural environment, so we will take a bit of the money that we were going to use to try to stop your children dying before the age of five to make sure that your earth doesn&#146;t flood.&#148; Surely, if 0.7 per cent. of GDP was a proper target for the humanitarian and infrastructure work that needs to be done anyway, the climate change mitigation work that we will do overseas should be additional. I hope that the Minister who responds to the debate will give us the Government&#146;s position on that.</p>

The people who perform the home installations reckon that compared with the previous three-year period they will soon be able to do fewer houses.

<p><a name="stpa_o188"><a name="80317-0010.htm_para22"><a name="08031713000447">Warm Front is a highly impressive, highly effective programme. It is not without its flaws, but it is an excellent scheme. I am therefore concerned that cuts have been made. When we ask Ministers about that, they cite other schemes and initiatives, such as the carbon emissions reduction target&#151;CERT&#151;but that is not an adequate substitute. It is not as good, for a number of reasons. For example, it rewards a company for saving carbon emissions among its customers. However, a company gets a better return from saving carbon emissions for a big, wealthy customer with high carbon emissions than it does for a small consumer&#151;perhaps a single pensioner living on their own. In other words, for a given amount of insulation, companies get more return by going for, in some cases, the more prosperous.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o189"><a name="80317-0010.htm_para23"><a name="08031713000448">I know that there are minimum quotas, but they have gone down, too. I understand that the number who have to be in the target groups has gone from 50 to 40 per cent. and that the target groups have been broadened, which is crazy. We want the priority to be the fuel poor. The Government know who the fuel poor are, broadly defined&#151;they certainly know who receives means-tested benefits. Companies in the CERT programme do not know which of their customers are on means-tested benefits, so they have to spend time, effort and money finding out or speculating about that, when the Department for Work and Pensions knows.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o190"><a name="80317-0010.htm_para24"><a name="08031713000449">I hope that the Secretary of State&#146;s Department&#151;<i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> The Minister for the Environment says it is because of data protection. I quite understand that the Department for Work and Pensions cannot simply hand over benefit details, but why, for example, could not every recipient of pension credit receive a certificate, once a year, with their annual uprating statement? They used to get certificated housing benefit, entitling them to a rent rebate and to have their council tax paid. Why should they not receive a certificate of eligibility for Warm Front or CERT, or for whatever scheme happens to be running, that they take to their supplier? The supplier would not have to know which benefit they were on or what their income was. No databases would have to change hands. It is a relatively simple idea. The mailing is going out anyway. I am reassured that the Secretary of State is reaching for his fountain pen, and if it happens, I am happy to share the glory with him.</p>

 I am grateful to my hon. Friend. There is probably a variety of ways of doing it, of which that is one. My central point is that expecting the fuel companies to try to identify their poor customers, when the Government already know&#151;when one bit of government wants it done but another will not give that information&#151;does not seem to be joined-up government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o191"><a name="80317-0011.htm_para0"><a name="08031713000454">I want to raise another point that might interest the Minister, about which something could be done quite quickly. We know that over the next 10 years or so the Government want everyone to have a smart meter. One of the key issues for me is the potential smart meters have to benefit the environment and tackle fuel poverty. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o192"><a name="80317-0011.htm_para1"><a name="08031713000455">I have in mind what I would call a super-smart meter. The big worry about the domestic energy market is the alleged lack of competition. All sorts of investigations are going on, and consumers think that the companies all put their prices up together. Clearly, we want maximum switching and want people to go for the best tariff for them. We want energy efficiency tariffs and so on. If a smart meter records someone&#146;s actual consumption of gas and electricity, why should not the information be sent to a website such as moneysupermarket.com&#151;it has to be a two-way flow of communication&#151;so that it can look at all the tariffs and shop for the customer? The customer would not have to be online, web-savvy or anything like that. The smart meter would do it for them. It would come back and&#151;it might have a Stephen Hawking-style voice&#151;it would say, &#147;It&#146;s EDF for you this quarter&#148;, or whatever else. In other words, it would match customers&#146; circumstances with the optimum tariff and switch them to it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o193"><a name="80317-0011.htm_para2"><a name="08031713000456">The technology would probably be fairly straightforward. The company would need bank details&#151;practical issues would have to be resolved&#151;but instead of having managed methods of controlling the energy market and competition, it would almost be the economist&#146;s dream of perfect competition. We would have an almost infinite numbers of buyers, perfect information, negligible transaction costs and regular switching, which keeps companies on their toes. Fuel companies will hate it, because they will not have the stickiness that means customers stay with them when they should not. I say this to every Minister I meet, and I hope that at some point someone will take me seriously and adopt it. <i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> I am pleased to hear the Minister for the Environment say that it is a good idea. I am grateful for that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o194"><a name="80317-0011.htm_para3"><a name="08031713000457">I have a couple of final observations. I listened with interest and a lot of sympathy to the hon. Member for East Surrey. I agreed with a great deal. I waited for the answer. He came up with some of the things that the shadow Chancellor has said, many of which are gimmicks. He asked where the green ISAs were. I travelled in by tube from Paddington to Westminster, and there is an advert that says, &#147;Get your green ISA.&#148; </p>

<p><a name="st_o210"><a name="08031713000458"><a name="80317-0011.htm_spnew0"><a name="08031713000798"><b>Gregory Barker:</b>
 With respect, before the hon. Gentleman starts to criticise policy he ought at least to take time to understand it. A green ISA would be an extra amount in addition to the current ISA, which could be invested exclusively in companies at the forefront of green innovation and on course to meet our national CO2 reduction targets. It is in addition to the existing ISA, not just another product. Perhaps he could take time to understand the idea before he attacks it.</p>

 It clearly is a gimmicky idea, and I say that for a reason. There is a cost-benefit analysis for each measure, as we heard from the hon. Member for Nottingham, South. Each scheme has a cost and a return. The idea that the presumably higher rate tax relief for many investors delivers the best bang for the buck in delivering improved energy efficiency is extremely  <br>

implausible. The investment will be made in tiny chunks. The scale of investment needed for such things is vast. A few thousand pounds will come in from, on average, relatively wealthy individuals at the cost of a hefty tax break. Essentially, such ISAs are tax breaks for the well-off. There are far better ways of spending that money that would benefit the fuel poor, such as home insulation. I put it to the hon. Member for Bexhill and Battle (Gregory Barker) that money spent insulating a poor pensioner&#146;s draughty house delivers a vastly better return for Government cash than tax breaks for high earners through additional ISAs.</p>

<p><a name="st_o212"><a name="08031713000460"><a name="80317-0011.htm_spnew2"><a name="08031713000800"><b>Gregory Barker:</b>
 The hon. Gentleman does not grasp that we need to do all those things. Is he aware that there are 17 million ISA savers&#151;albeit that most of them currently hold those accounts in cash because of the unfortunate economic situation? As there are 17 million ISA holders, they are not just the prerogative of the high-income few. This is about driving dynamic industrial change across our economy, making genuine change, driving capital markets and recognising excellence in British companies.</p>

<p><a name="st_o213"><a name="08031713000461"><a name="80317-0011.htm_spnew3"><a name="08031713000801"><b>Steve Webb:</b>
 There was an interesting elision&#151;in fact, the hon. Gentleman corrected himself as he spoke. He knows full well that the majority of ISAs are cash ISAs. He is talking about a further tier of ISAs, so the savers who can make that additional contribution will, by definition, be the wealthiest. The poorest people cannot even reach the existing threshold. They would need thousands of pounds more. A relatively small proportion of ISAs are equity ISAs, and I will bet any money that a high proportion of the equity ISA holders tend, on average, to be higher income earners. This is potentially a highly regressive way of delivering marginal benefit. There are so many better and more efficient methods, but because the shadow Chancellor has no substantive policies, he goes for these grand gimmicks.</p>

 I want to make a point in support of the hon. Gentleman. He says that investing in insulating poor people&#146;s houses is a much better way of spending money. There is an opportunity cost to both courses of action, but we should spend all the money on investing in poor people&#146;s home insulation, to the benefit of everybody.</p>

 I certainly share the view that that is a priority, and it is an improvement that we can make now, rather than in 2019 or whenever. To draw together the threads of my speech, my priority is to stress the urgency of the situation. There is a mismatch between the grave tone of the rhetoric and the scale of the problem on the one hand, and the extreme modesty of the measures on the other.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o196"><a name="80317-0011.htm_para5"><a name="08031713000469">I want to mention one other thing that can be done now. We know that even sober-suited organisations such as Ofgem have said that there is a &#163;9 billion windfall for energy companies in the second round of EU emissions trading. It is a huge opportunity to spend money on the things that we have been talking about&#151;home energy insulation and encouraging renewables&#151;without increasing the tax burden. As the hon. Member for East Surrey says, we do not have to wait until the third round of EU emissions trading in 2012; the windfall in the current round could be used to encourage renewables through feed-in tariffs, which we support. The windfall could also be used for investment in carbon capture, which is another part of the mix. That would have been so much bolder, so much more effective, and so much more in line with the scale of the problem. We have had a huge disappointment. I hope that in years to come we do not rue the fact that we failed to take action now, and do not, as Nick Stern says, have to take much more expensive and dramatic action.</p>

 I want to speak about the Budget overall, but I shall start by giving my pennyworth on the environmental issues. First, I agree with the Secretary of State that the main tool the Government have is not the Budget but the Climate Change Bill, and I therefore look to him and the Government to agree to including much stronger carbon emission targets in the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o197"><a name="80317-0011.htm_para6"><a name="08031713000471">Secondly, I welcome the 10 per cent. increase in air travel tax in the Budget; it is now the plane that is taxed, rather than the passenger, but we have to do more than that because air travel is a key source of carbon emissions, and we need to get a grip on the issue. The Government cannot increase the size of every airport, either. They have to curtail airport expansion as part of a proper climate change policy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o198"><a name="80317-0011.htm_para7"><a name="08031713000472">My third point is on traffic congestion. Again, the Chancellor was right to put a tax on the gas-guzzlers&#151;the high-carbon vehicles&#151;but the Government need to be more courageous on price, including petrol price, and on public transport. I know that there has been a big increase in public transport, and I welcome that, but more needs to be done. More investment is needed in green public transport; that is where the emphasis should be. We need to move away faster from oil-based fuels.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o199"><a name="80317-0011.htm_para8"><a name="08031713000473">On energy efficiency, the priority must be that which the Government set in their early years in power&#151;helping vulnerable people in their homes. We must go back to that target. I shall say a bit more about that in the main part of my speech. We should encourage combined heat and power schemes, the use of solar panels and microgeneration in new homes, and there should be lots of incentives for people to use those technologies in existing homes, too. We also need promotions encouraging people, in a sensible way, to use less energy. That is an important point, and we could start with public offices, where the lights are burned all day and night, unreasonably. They could set an example.</p>

The emphasis has to be on renewables; I think that they are a national priority. They should be considered to be in the national interest, including when there are objections to them. Of course we will still need to give the issues proper hearings, but national interest should be a factor in decisions relating to renewables.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o201"><a name="80317-0011.htm_para10"><a name="08031713000475">I now turn to my main comments on last week&#146;s Budget. The TUC called it</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o202"><a name="80317-0011.htm_para11"><a name="08031713000476">and I agree with that assessment. When the Chancellor was interviewed on the radio the morning after the Budget, he said:</p>
<a name="80317-0011.htm_brev1"><a name="08031713000548"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;We are where we are&#148;.</p>

That was really an admission that he did not have a great deal of room for manoeuvre in the circumstances. Those circumstances include a possible world recession owing to the crises in the American finance and mortgage markets and very high oil prices. Maintaining economic stability in the UK in the face of that is essential, so it was a holding Budget, and in many ways I understand why.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o204"><a name="80317-0011.htm_para13"><a name="08031713000478">However, when we consider where we are, we have to take into account the wasteful cost of the wars, including the war in Iraq, which contributed to high oil prices, and the unwise handouts given to private companies so that they can encroach on public services. That includes the almost &#163;2 billion for the London underground that was wasted on Metronet. There has also been no proper check on the speculation by finance capitalists that engendered the current downturn. The horse has now bolted, but I still think there need to be controls on the credit and profits with which those finance capitalists can speculate.</p>

In addition, extortionate, exorbitant amounts are charged for any changes to PFI contracts, as was pointed out in a recent National Audit Office report. Millions are being charged. The contracts are not even being tendered; they go straight to the existing PFI contractor, and that has implications for the green agenda, because in time we will want to change the buildings concerned and make them more green-sensitive. The PFI contract owners will have us over a barrel and will charge what they like. The Treasury has to look at that aspect of PFI.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o208"><a name="80317-0011.htm_para17"><a name="08031713000483">I started with the issue of fairness and I return to it now. I support a non-dom tax on the super-rich who turn up to make profits out of Britain without living here. Such a tax is reasonable. However, the Chancellor said that he would look to close the loopholes. I have been in the House a long time and I have heard that said in virtually every Budget. As the TUC points out, big companies and the super-rich use plenty of loopholes to avoid paying their proper taxes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o209"><a name="80317-0011.htm_para18"><a name="08031713000484">I refer the House to the booklet &#147;The Missing Billions: The UK Tax Gap&#148;, which was written by the accountancy and tax specialist Richard Murphy. He looked at 50 top companies and says that their effective corporation tax rate is 22.5 per cent., not the 30 per cent. agreed by Parliament. He says:</p>
<a name="80317-0011.htm_brev5"><a name="08031713000551"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The fifty largest companies almost always pay 5 per cent. less tax on average than they declare in their accounts.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o210"><a name="80317-0011.htm_para19"><a name="08031713000485">He goes on to say that in the seven years to 2006, those companies&#146; effective tax rate fell by 0.5 per cent. each year. The leaflet shows how super-rich individuals avoid paying their fair share of tax and that &#163;3.2 billion is lost by turning earned income into investment income, which is taxed more favourably, or by shifting the income to others, such as spouses, in lower or nil tax bands. Another &#163;3.8 billion is lost because transactions are moved out of the UK; &#163;0.5 billion is lost by turning income into a capital gain and &#163;4.8 billion is lost from various kinds of tax planning.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o211"><a name="80317-0011.htm_para20"><a name="08031713000486">The leaflet says that half the amount lost to tax avoidance could raise the level at which the higher rate tax starts being paid by &#163;10,000 a year. That would offer significant help to those on middle incomes. The same amount could increase the state pension by 20 per cent., reduce income tax by 3p in the pound or build an extra 50 hospitals a year. Half the amount lost to tax avoidance could do one of those things.

Furthermore, the pension credit rises to a guaranteed &#163;124 for a single pensioner and &#163;189 for a pensioner couple, and 6,000 pensioners are being taken out of income tax.</p>

Interestingly, the Conservatives did not put forward a single proposal, and there is already talk of their leader flip-flopping on some of the commitments, or near-commitments, that he has made.

 It has been interesting to be present at this debate, which is a bit like &#147;Groundhog Day&#148;. We had a themed debate rather like it as part of the European scrutiny process, and we will doubtless have a similar debate on Second Reading of the forthcoming Climate Change Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o234"><a name="80317-0012.htm_para12"><a name="08031733000008">We have seen the three Front-Bench spokesmen all tiptoeing towards the proposition that people should have to pay more for their energy but understanding, as politicians, that that is an extremely difficult thing to sell to them. We have three variants. The Government&#146;s view is that this is probably the least bad excuse to use for raising more money, because they are desperately short of money; Conservative Front Benchers are saying that green taxes should be entirely balanced by other tax cuts so that people would be able to afford them, assuming that the distribution was fair; and the Liberal Democrats are in their usual muddle saying that there is a bit of this and a bit of that, but undoubtedly wanting to tax people more&#151;rather more, I suspect, than the Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o235"><a name="80317-0012.htm_para13"><a name="08031733000009">The tragedy of all this is that those who want to redistribute income cannot guarantee to do it effectively by this particular route. People on low incomes need access to energy and transport just as people on high incomes do, so the Government are driven back on proposals in the Budget to have a one-year increase in the amount of fuel payment assistance for pensioners. That goes a little way towards helping, and other methods will need to be developed if the political classes decide to carry on with accelerating the progress of the market and having ever-dearer energy. We have already seen in recent months a huge energy price signal sent by the big increase in oil prices and the attendant changes in gas prices, coal prices and so forth. If the political classes want to accelerate that process even further by separate carbon levies, carbon trading with artificial prices and other regulatory and tax costs, more work will have to be done on how to do something about the fairness of distribution of those tax rises and cost rises, and there will have to be ways of offsetting those so that people on low incomes do not feel that they are taking a disproportionate share of the burden and are the ones who are deprived of transport and home heating.</p>

 I think that the hon. Gentleman knows me well enough to be aware that that is not my view of the world. More people can be got out of poverty and into work by moving generally towards lower taxes than towards higher taxes. However, I was making a specific point on the content so far of today&#146;s Budget debate and reminding all those involved in policy formation that one cannot simply carry on with the idea that extra taxes, extra levies and extra regulatory costs can be heaped on to energy without having consequences not only on the rich but on the poor and without needing to have some kind of alternative package. If we are not careful, we just end up with massive administrative churn costs because of the imposition of a lot of administrative costs in raising the levy, the charge and the tax, and then a lot more administrative costs in giving money back to people so that they can afford the levy, the charge and the tax, and we do not achieve what we are trying to achieve. I rather like green promotion in the form of lower taxes for better behaviour. It is good that we have already heard that that worked, as it did very quickly, when we did it for unleaded petrol, which showed that people prefer an incentive to tax increases.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o236"><a name="80317-0012.htm_para14"><a name="08031733000012">It is important that people listening to our debates, as I hope that some still do, understand that we know that a very big financial crisis is under way in the world and that that crisis has moved on at breakneck speed during the course of the Budget debates. We heard a few brief remarks from the Prime Minister in his statement earlier, but we have not yet had the benefit of Treasury Ministers explaining in this House how they responded to the Bear Stearns catastrophe and the rescue that has been mounted so quickly and successfully in the United States of America; nor have we had from them proper comment on the actions being taken to co-ordinate putting liquidity into markets and seeing the market through the crisis.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o237"><a name="80317-0012.htm_para15"><a name="08031733000013">In the Budget speech, the Chancellor rightly had a paragraph or so of reference to the world financial background, explaining that it was bleak, but he claimed, with a hint of complacency, that the UK is uniquely best placed to deal with this crisis. We should try to ensure that the Chancellor and his colleagues have thought through the gravity of the world situation in which we find ourselves and the way in which, in some circumstances, the UK is not uniquely well placed but has its own home-grown problems, which we need to take very seriously. After all, it would be foolish to be complacent given that it was the United Kingdom that had the first run on a retail bank&#151;and, I am pleased to say, the only run; let us hope that it turns out to remain so&#151;whereby retail depositors were so worried that they were rapidly pulling out their deposits, which is what finally triggered the intervention and action over Northern Rock. Bear Stearns is a different kind of run by a different type of investor and depositor&#151;equally lethal but not as telegenic and not affecting people on low incomes as the Northern Rock run visibly and clearly did.</p>

It was clear to the markets in London in August, if not July, that there was not enough money in circulation, and clear to those watching the markets that there was the potential for a financial disaster or a banking problem. I did not write down the names of the banks that were being mentioned at the time, but Northern Rock was the one that people most feared for, and it was widely rumoured in the markets. It would have been crass to mention it because the last thing that one wants to do is to play any small part in helping to undermine an important institution, crucial as Northern Rock has been to the success of the north-eastern economy and crucial as it is to all the small shareholders and depositors particularly concentrated in the Newcastle and wider north-eastern region.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o239"><a name="80317-0012.htm_para17"><a name="08031733000015">The Bank of England was placed in an extremely difficult position in August and September. The reforms of 1997 had left it ill-placed to understand the nature of such a banking crisis and to be able to respond positively to it. My first recommendation is that the Chancellor urgently look again at the regulatory and banking control framework that he inherited from the 1997 reforms and that he come to this House rapidly to introduce proposals for their improvement and updating.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o240"><a name="80317-0012.htm_para18"><a name="08031733000016">A central bank is more than a regulator. A good central bank is more, even, than a hands-on referee in a free-flowing game. It is a player in the money markets that it has to supervise, and has to keep liquid, honest and successful. The problem for the Bank of England in August and September, when the money market participants could see that there were difficulties, was that, since 1997, it has lacked two important flows of information that most central banks regard as normal. First, a central bank needs to know everything that the Government are doing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o241"><a name="80317-0012.htm_para19"><a name="08031733000017">The Government are usually one of the biggest operators in the money market&#151;particularly a heavily borrowing Government like the present one&#151;and the timing and nature of debt that the Government issue is crucial to the functioning of the market. In 1997, the then Chancellor nationalised the function of running the Government&#146;s debt by taking it out of the Bank of England and putting it into the Treasury. The modern Bank does not have the same minute-by-minute detailed sight of or responsibility for Government business in the market that it had prior to 1997.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o242"><a name="80317-0012.htm_para20"><a name="08031733000018">The second big problem that the Bank of England has is that prior to 1997; it was the day-by-day banking supervisor of all commercial banks, particularly the main credit-creating clearing banks that run our system. The Bank could see all of that business, and knew about it day by day, hour by hour and minute by minute. It had a close relationship with those banks&#151;the famous Governor&#146;s eyebrows would rise wisely or angrily if anything went wrong. The Bank knew whether they were liquid enough, whether they had squared their positions early enough in the day and whether they were taking a sensible position in the markets, so the banking system worked well.</p>

struck, it was always likely that it would be more difficult to control and resolve because the principal central bank player did not have all the regular information or history and knowledge of marketplace activity that a central bank should have. That is why I warned, in an economic policy report that I wrote for the Opposition, that we had a weak structure in Britain, and that when there was a financial difficulty&#151;I did not forecast Northern Rock, but I had something like that in mind&#151;things would go horribly wrong because the Bank no longer had those important powers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o244"><a name="80317-0012.htm_para22"><a name="08031733000020">The next curious matter is that just prior to the run on Northern Rock, the tripartite system clearly misread the situation very badly. Both the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Governor of the Bank of England made fierce speeches in which they said that the banking system in Britain had made lots of mistakes by lending too much money to the wrong people, and that it had to meet the consequences of those mistakes&#151;there would be no bail-outs. That would be a heroic thing to say at the best of times; in practice, no Government can allow a major bank to go bust in our global system because many poor and rich people would suffer badly, and there could be a systemic crash throughout the world. It was particularly odd, however, to make such statements when they must have known that they were on the verge of a difficult crisis over Northern Rock, with a possible run on the bank. They had to eat their words a matter of hours later when the run got out of control and the Chancellor said not only that he would guarantee all the deposits in Northern Rock&#151;big though that task was&#151;but the deposits of any bank found in a similar position, leading some to speculate who else in the markets he might have in mind. There was a worry that the run on Northern Rock would lead to a run on other institutions, which there is no need to name here. It is good that we are through that part of the crisis, that there is such a guarantee and that the tripartite system understands that it has to stand behind the banking system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o245"><a name="80317-0012.htm_para23"><a name="08031733000021">The guarantees, offers made and the nationalisation of Northern Rock now going ahead have not solved the problem, however. We are now in what some call the second leg of it. I do not think that the problem has legs; it is a continuing problem that will take some time to resolve, and we have just had another nasty chapter in the story&#151;or drama, if you like&#151;with the collapse of Bear Stearns on the other side of the Atlantic.</p>

 My right hon. Friend speaks with a great deal of expertise, but would he agree that one of the interesting features of the scenario is that the business models of Northern Rock and Bear Stearns had one item in common? The level of deposits in both were low compared with the amount of money lent out to customers and the wider market.

for further collapses and bear raids on other American banks was considerable, and it is good that the American authorities responded strongly and positively because there would have been knock-on effects across the Atlantic on British institutions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o246"><a name="80317-0012.htm_para24"><a name="08031733000024">The American authorities are behaving rather differently from those in the UK. The American authorities believe the crisis to be so serious that they need to do two things: first, they need to keep driving interest rates down, and secondly, they need to continue making large sums of money available to keep the banking system liquid. In the UK, the authorities seem reluctant to move interest rates down because of the persistent but historic inflation we have to live through because of past monetary excess and difficulty, and they are making little money available&#151;although they do occasionally make a co-ordinated effort to help to keep the banking system a little more liquid, as we saw in recent days. We need to ask why the matter is being dealt with in different ways, and which is right.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o247"><a name="80317-0012.htm_para25"><a name="08031733000025">Critics of the Americans say that it is crass to lower interest rates because there is still an inflationary problem, and they go on to say that lowering interest rates will not make any difference because it is not that kind of crisis. Of course lowering interest rates makes a difference; the crisis is due to the fact that some people cannot afford to pay the interest on their debt and repay their loans. If the cost of the loans is lowered through a lowering of the general interest rate&#151;a lot of the loans are linked to that rate&#151;the process would be a bit easier. Some people will not go bust and some will still be able to afford their homes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o248"><a name="80317-0012.htm_para26"><a name="08031733000026">It is a bit odd that people are down on sub-prime lending. I would have thought that some in this House would have been overjoyed that people had come up with a way of letting the poor buy a home. Is that not rather a good thing to have done? It is a great pity that the process was overdone and that those involved did not back off sooner and realise that they needed controls that were a bit tighter, but we do not want to bring the whole edifice down and say that poor people can never borrow money to buy a home. Surely it is good news if the lower interest policy in the United States can see some people through this difficult period.</p>

 Is not one of the problems with the sub-prime business model that it factors in the cost of debt recovery? In other words, it is based on an assumption that many of the people they are targeting will not be able to afford the repayments that they are being offered. Does that not border on the immoral at times?</p>

 All banking factors in the probability that some people will not be able to repay. There is not one single sub-prime business model, but lots of different business models for those making loans to people who are a bit hard up. Of course making loans to those who are hard up is more difficult than making loans to those who are rich, but there are not enough rich people, and there are not enough rich people who want to borrow, so it is necessary to lend quite a lot of money to those who are hard up. The art of banking is in deciding how much one can offer and under what conditions. If the authorities can see more of those poor people through by making sensible interest rate adjustments, I say, &#147;Thank goodness for that&#148;, rather  <br>

than, &#147;Serves them right&#151;let&#146;s keep the interest rates high, push more of them under and put them back into the trailer park.&#148; That is not a particularly nice thing to do.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o249"><a name="80317-0013.htm_para0"><a name="08031733000029">Will the policy be inflationary? I find it difficult to understand how people can say that the American authorities are irresponsible to cut interest rates because that will cause inflation, while at the same time they say that America is already in recession&#151;a questionable proposition&#151;and that it will have a hard landing in a very bad recession. If America is going into a bad recession, bankruptcy, unemployment and falling prices, not inflation will be the problem. The crash in house prices will extend to other goods and assets. I am therefore in favour of lowering interest rates in the conditions that we are considering to try to save something from the mess.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o250"><a name="80317-0013.htm_para1"><a name="08031733000030">Should more money be made available to the banking system? The answer is simple: of course it should. Whatever people think of bankers&#151;I know that several hon. Members are not best friends with bankers or have various political causes on which to fight them&#151;one cannot live in a modern, sophisticated economy without them. We need people who assess risk, make loans and so on. If they get it catastrophically wrong and we push them all under, we simply make our lives worse, too. There must be moderation in the response, and understanding that we must see enough banks and lending through the crisis so that, if we handle it properly, normal life can be resumed and reasonable economic growth can continue. Money must therefore be made available to the banking system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o251"><a name="80317-0013.htm_para2"><a name="08031733000031">That brings me to my next policy recommendation to the Government. One reason why UK authorities cannot do much to make the system more liquid is that too many of the resources of the Bank of England and the Treasury have been expended on nationalising Northern Rock. The sooner the Northern Rock position is unwound, the better because our nation and our monetary authorities cannot afford to have so much tied up in a single, medium-sized&#151;by international or even national standards&#151;mortgage bank. Although the sum of money is small in world financial markets, it is large to the British taxpayer and the Government, and certainly to the Bank of England.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o252"><a name="80317-0013.htm_para3"><a name="08031733000032">When the Bank of England mounted its rescue of Northern Rock, the former was only 40 per cent. of the size of the latter. It was therefore impossible for the Bank of England to mount a full rescue by itself and that is why&#151;I presume&#151;the Treasury got involved and there had to be proper Treasury guarantees and promises. Taking on something the size of even Northern Rock&#151;a relatively small bank by international standards&#151;required the whole weight of the consolidated fund of the UK and the Government&#146;s money-raising powers. The Government therefore need to accelerate the process of either running off the business or developing new business under whatever model the managers can devise so that we get the &#163;25 billion back as quickly as possible. The Bank of England would thus have a better profile of assets and liabilities again, and more money with which to play in the markets.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o253"><a name="80317-0013.htm_para4"><a name="08031733000033">In the meantime, perhaps the Government should consider the financing of the Bank of England money market operations, because I do not believe that it is  <br>

playing with enough money, and it needs to have a bigger cash reserve available to keep the banking system more liquid during the difficult times. It will not be easy. I am an optimist and I believe that we can get to the other side, but it will require a more intelligent approach by the British authorities than they employed in August and September, and more weaponry in the form of lower interest rates and cash availability in the UK, just as enormous firepower is required in the United States as it, in the eye of the storm, tries to make its way through it more quickly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o254"><a name="80317-0013.htm_para5"><a name="08031733000034">The general problem is over-indebtedness worldwide, especially in the American, British and similar economies. The good times were a period of easy credit, when the authorities on both sides of the Atlantic kept interest rates a bit lower than was sensible and either encouraged or turned a blind eye to the most massive build-up of debt under new types of debt obligation and debt structure, which we had not previously experienced. In a way, the regulators fuelled much of that. The Basel rules of capital adequacy told all sensible banks that wanted to grow quickly and increase their profits, &#147;Do so off balance sheet.&#148; The rules encouraged&#151;in a way, forced&#151;them to do that. Surprise, surprise, the banks went for massive off-balance-sheet financing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o255"><a name="80317-0013.htm_para6"><a name="08031733000035">Now, many in the Government and elsewhere have become critical and say that perhaps off balance sheet was overdone and not properly appraised and controlled. However, the Government are up to their neck in the off-balance-sheet operation because they are the biggest exponent by a mile of such financing in the UK. In the Red Book, the Government show roughly &#163;500 billion of borrowing for the state in an economy of about &#163;1,300 billion. The Government state that they are keeping their debt to around 40 per cent., which is the target that they set themselves.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o256"><a name="80317-0013.htm_para7"><a name="08031733000036">When I last did the sums and considered the UK in the way in which a finance director would have to examine it to stay out of jail when reporting, rather than by using the Government&#146;s method, I concluded that the British state&#146;s true indebtedness is &#163;1.3 trillion&#151;&#163;1,300 billion or 100 per cent. of GDP. I reached that conclusion because of the huge unfunded pension liabilities and the large pension deficits in the state sector, the private finance initiative and public-private partnership obligations, publicly owned companies, such as Network Rail, whose debt should be part of the state sector, and now, of course, the full consolidated sum for Northern Rock. Just as Northern Rock consolidated the whole of Granite, so the Government, having acquired Northern Rock, should consolidate the whole of it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o257"><a name="80317-0013.htm_para8"><a name="08031733000037">There is, therefore, a large debt on the state sector books, but much of it is suppressed from the general public gaze because of the accounting conventions that the Government deploy, which are so different from those that are required of the private trading sector. The Government need to start reducing their debt burden and demonstrating that they are serious about helping to unwind the debt crisis, taking a different attitude to PFI, PPP, off balance sheet and guarantees of trading companies, into which they entered so liberally in recent years.

help the state sector in all sorts of ways. It would help not least the money market, which would have a little more leeway if there are squalls ahead in the private banking sector, which need liquidity or financial instruments to be traded in open market operations.</p>

I am happy that the elderly will get a bit more help with their fuel bills. One would expect a Secretary of State or a Minister from the relevant Department to make such a statement. One would also expect it to be a good news item. However, Budgets are about influencing the general direction, shape and size of the British economy. If a Chancellor currently wishes to make a decisive impact, the Budget must move around &#163;7 billion, &#163;10 billion or &#163;15 billion. Several billions must be involved if the Chancellor is to have any impact other than a nice warm glow and a few pence in the pockets of a target group that he may wish to woo on Budget day.</p>

From memory, the supplementaries added up to an astonishing &#163;22,000 million of additional spending. Some of that may be good spending and a little of it may be policy change, but most is testament to the fact that the Government have lost control of their public spending. They tell us one thing on Budget day about what they will do and the balance between spending and revenue, then, towards the tail end of the year, in November and March, they set out colossal sums of money and say that, Department by Department, quango by quango, by big or little numbers, huge overruns have occurred. The figures go through automatically, without debate, yet they are far more significant&#151;they will make an impact on the economy&#151;than the measures mentioned in the Budget.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o260"><a name="80317-0013.htm_para11"><a name="08031733000040">I therefore recommend to the Government that, to try to get the British economy through the extremely difficult period in world finance, we need proper expenditure controls, Department by Department. We also need the side of the Treasury that the Chief Secretary leads to have much more of a grip on and daily information flow about what is happening and what is going wrong in order to intercept the overspends earlier, emphasise that they are unacceptable when it is still possible to do something about them and redouble the efforts, which are stated to be part of the Government&#146;s policy in the Budget, to root out the abundant waste, inefficiency and incompetence.</p>

We cannot afford another one, and it was a very expensive rescue that had to be mounted.

However, 87 per cent. of the money has been found and the depositors have been paid back most of what they had, although many have suffered greatly because it took so long to pay them back. The bankers&#151;the employees&#151;have found it difficult to find employment. A repetition of the catastrophe that was the closure of BCCI was avoided by the Government.

The British Medical Association has stated that a 10 per cent. rise in price could cut such deaths by up to 30 per cent. Evidence from Finland suggests that that could be right. A 33 per cent. cut in excise duty there in 2004, introduced to deal with cheap imports, led to a 17 per cent. rise in alcohol-related mortality. We therefore welcome the Chancellor&#146;s decision not to reduce the price of alcohol.</p>

 Would the right hon.

 As I have said, I am not an expert on beer drinking, but I have seen many people get very drunk on beer. People can get drunk on beer, although I have never had the pleasure&#151;perhaps I should not call it a pleasure&#151;of being in that position. I understand the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point.

Only last week, while launching a campaign called &#147;Mothers in Arms&#148; in <i> The Sun</i>, she urged the Government to do more to stop people drinking to excess. The British crime survey of 2006-07 revealed that 46 per cent.&#151;nearly half&#151;of all violent crimes were believed to have been committed under the influence of alcohol. That figure rose to 58 per cent. in cases of attacks by people unknown to the victim. In more than 1 million violent attacks, the aggressors were believed to be drunk.

I am not normally in agreement with the chief executive of Tesco, bearing in mind the huge Tesco store that was created on the north-west side of my constituency and the fact that it does not always collect its trolleys on a Friday. However, he, and the chief executive of Asda, were right to say that the availability of cheap alcohol&#151;which is virtually given away in supermarkets, although it is not entirely free&#151;means that young people can either go in and buy it, or get other people to go in and buy it for them. I am afraid that the number of prosecutions of people involved in such activity has been very small. It is not just a question of putting up the tax on alcoholic beverages; we must also look at the role of supermarkets and other retailers.</p>

The decision several years ago to raise the state pension by, I think, either 1p or 10p remains a blot on the history of this Government. That was a terrible error of judgment. The measures in this Budget are the right thing to do, however. It is right to raise the winter fuel allowance from &#163;200 to &#163;250, and from &#163;300 to &#163;400 for those over the age of 80. That is exactly the right approach to dealing with spiralling energy costs. It was right, too, to increase child benefit to &#163;20 a week and to bring that forward by a year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o277"><a name="80317-0014.htm_para1"><a name="08031733000072">I shall not spend much time dwelling on the environmental aspects of the Budget, partly because the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs made such an eloquent speech that there is no need for me to repeat everything that he said. I very much agree with what he said, and I am glad that he had the opportunity to put forward those views. Like all hon. Members, I am deeply concerned about climate change, and about what Governments such as ours can do on their own without the support of economies such as India and China. My hon. Friend the Member for Middlesbrough, South and East Cleveland (Dr. Kumar) is the chairman of the all-party British India group. It is all very well to say to the Indian and the Chinese people, through their Governments, that they have to control their growth, while we&#151;and the United States in particular&#151;continue to do what we are doing and to make the ozone layer even thinner and the hole in it even bigger. </p>

I have done so for the last eight months, and I am glad that I bought it before all the Budget changes. I am sure that many people will now be rushing to buy these green cars. It also saves me a lot of money because I do not have to pay the congestion charge. I am not a walking advertisement for Toyota, but I believe that it is important that other car manufacturers follow its lead. The choice of such vehicles on offer at the moment is not that great, as we can see when the ministerial cars rush into Speaker&#146;s Court. Unfortunately, I have got into the wrong car once or twice, believing it to be my own, and surprising the Minister sitting in the front seat. The choice of such vehicles should increase greatly, to allow more opportunity for people to buy them.</p>

have pointed out, this Budget was memorable for being very boring, and for having a great deal hidden away. For example, one of the most significant parts of the Budget was not even mentioned by the Chancellor in his Budget speech. That was the raising of the earnings ceiling for national insurance by &#163;100 to &#163;770 a week, which will mean that anyone earning more than &#163;40,000 will pay an extra &#163;520 a year. That stealth tax has been hidden away, and I wonder how many other horrors are lurking in the fine print. Perhaps this is not surprising, however, given that this country has the largest budget deficit in western Europe.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o281"><a name="80317-0014.htm_para5"><a name="08031733000077">It is tough out there for small businesses at the moment. The report produced by the British Chambers of Commerce in March 2008 stated on page 5:</p>

If you add these factors to the UK&#146;s growing regulatory burden&#151;the cumulative cost of new regulation to business since 1998 is now nearly &#163;66 billion&#151;then SMEs are going to find it tougher to grow in the coming year.&#148;</p>

<a name="80317-0014.htm_brev1"><a name="08031733000370"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;For small micro-businesses, taxation is clearly the priority, followed by increased concern over late payment and bad debt.

<p><a name="stpa_o284"><a name="80317-0014.htm_para8"><a name="08031733000080">Of course we welcome the further &#163;60 million allocated to the small firms loan guarantee scheme&#151;an excellent scheme, brought in under the previous Conservative Government&#151;which will support a 20 per cent. increase in lending. We also welcome the &#163;12.5 million from the Treasury for a venture capital fund to back women-owned businesses. Furthermore, there is a new &#163;30 million enterprise capital fund to help provide debt and equity finance for small and fast-growing businesses. The Chancellor, in common with previous Chancellors over the last 10 years, has said that the Government are now going to make a real effort to bear down on regulation. Well, we have heard that before. We are also to have a review of Whitehall procurement to see how the 30 per cent. procurement figure can be reached by small businesses.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o285"><a name="80317-0014.htm_para9"><a name="08031733000081">All that is positive news, and although we are talking about a few tens of millions of pounds here and there&#151;I do not begrudge it&#151;those measures pale into insignificance when compared with the &#163;1 billion hit that small firms will have to take as a consequence of the increase of 21 per cent. in the small firms corporation tax rate. We also need to compare any positive changes with what is happening on the capital gains tax front. CGT on business assets, as announced last year, is going up by 80 per cent. to 18 per cent.

delay until next year and the fact that there will be further consultation, but surely after all the Government have done to try and encourage husband and wife businesses and small businesses to incorporate, that is exactly what the Government should not be doing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o287"><a name="80317-0014.htm_para11"><a name="08031733000083">I am also very concerned, as is the whole small business community, about the plans announced in the Budget fine print to give tax inspectors the right to turn up unannounced to demand records at a premises without an official warrant. I find that very disturbing. I know that the Government are very keen to give tax inspectors the same powers as customs officials, but they perform very different roles. Customs officials can, quite rightly, bug telephones to intercept letters and e-mails in the fight against drugs and gun crime. I believe that giving tax inspectors this power of entry without an official warrant will undermine trust and confidence in the small firms sector. When combined with the Government&#146;s other plans to require banks, building societies and other third party operations to hand over customer records, we clearly have a recipe for the destruction of confidence in this sector and a worsening of its relationship with the Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o288"><a name="80317-0014.htm_para12"><a name="08031733000084">Small businesses face many particular and difficult challenges in rural areas, so will this Budget help them at all? It may provide a small amount of help at the margin, but it certainly will not help those post offices whose closures are due to be announced later this week. In my constituency, there may be 17, 18, 19 or 20 small post offices closing, in addition to the dozens that have already closed in such areas and in addition to those already closed in towns under the Post Office urban renewal scheme.</p>

If they offer those services, they will not receive the compensation, which I find quite disgraceful. I am sure that Opposition Members who represent rural constituencies will feel the same&#151;[Hon. Members: &#147;Hear, hear.&#148;] Why are the Government restricting the trade of sub-postmasters when all they have left is their village shops and of course they want to offer other services?</p>

Let us consider pubs or public houses, which are so often the focal point in villages. Up and down the country, 56 pubs are closing every month. They are being sold off for housing or for development and they are faced with many problems arising from the smoking ban, the availability of cheap drink in supermarkets, the impact of the breathalyser and so on. I am not saying that we should not have had some of those changes, but now is not a good time for the Budget&#146;s increases on beer, wines and spirits, which will hit pubs disproportionately and put extra pressure on public house trade.</p>

brighter lights. I opened a new refurbished pub last Friday&#151;the Crown in Middleton, which has been bought by an entrepreneurially inclined publican who has three gastro-pubs. He has done a complete refurbishment in that pub and I was extremely impressed by the work he put in. I have no doubt that, with his determination and the staff&#146;s commitment, that pub will be a great success. On the other hand, the outlook is bleak and it will only get worse, thanks to the changes announced by the Chancellor in the Budget.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o292"><a name="80317-0014.htm_para16"><a name="08031733000088">What about the elderly and pensioners in our constituencies? The hon. Member for Nottingham, South (Alan Simpson) made an excellent speech on that subject and his arguments were reinforced by the hon. Member for Leyton and Wanstead (Harry Cohen). Much of the very good work done by the Warm Front initiative has now been undone&#151;so much so that 4 million households now face fuel poverty.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o293"><a name="80317-0014.htm_para17"><a name="08031733000089">Many pensioners in my constituency&#151;and in the constituencies of my hon.

That needs to be looked into further. I certainly agreed with the hon. Member for Nottingham, South when he said that the winter fuel payment increases were welcome, but were certainly not likely to make up for the continuing increases in fuel prices.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o294"><a name="80317-0014.htm_para18"><a name="08031733000090">There is one other measure in the Budget that many pensioners in my constituency will find very difficult to understand&#151;the abolition of the 10 per cent. income tax band, which will have a serious impact. Many pensioners who retired before 65 and are on modest incomes of between &#163;5,700 and &#163;16,500 will be seriously disadvantaged. On an income of &#163;10,000 in 2007-08, they would pay &#163;782 in tax, but the abolition of the 10 per cent. tax band will mean such a pensioner having to pay about &#163;150 more. That is a lot of money for people on fixed incomes. Those are the same people who have been subjected to year-on-year inflation-busting increases in their council tax bills.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o295"><a name="80317-0014.htm_para19"><a name="08031733000091">I do not blame Norfolk county council, the main precept raiser in Norfolk, as it has been asked to provide many more services and functions with less Government grant. It has been asked to take on those commitments and it is providing those services, but it has been faced with the invidious choice of either cutting services or putting up the council tax. It has gone for modest council tax increases, but year on year, those are inflation-busting. Of course, the increases will hit hardest of all those people on fixed incomes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o296"><a name="80317-0014.htm_para20"><a name="08031733000092">In my constituency, those people&#151;the pensioners in particular&#151;will also be hit by the closure of post offices. They have been hit, too, by the increase in motoring costs. Often, their one luxury is going down the pub. That is also being penalised, so their quality of life is deteriorating, but we heard nothing in the Budget that will put their minds at rest, certainly as far as the council tax is concerned. Therefore, I urge Ministers and the Secretary of State to consider devising a scheme to give pensioners a discount on their council tax. That is what my party offered at the last election, and indeed at the election before that. We offered a straightforward non-means-tested discount to pensioners, because we felt the council tax was simply far too great a burden for many millions of people up and down the country.</p>

We need to do so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o304"><a name="80317-0014.htm_para28"><a name="08031733000101">I want to talk more broadly about the Budget. Like others, I think it is a &#147;wait and see&#148; Budget. I think that the Chancellor looked over a chasm and thought, &#147;I am not going to do anything too radical today, because tomorrow there may be all sorts of problems, depending on what happens in the American economy in particular.&#148; So, he has made relatively marginal changes&#151;some of them welcome, and I applaud him for that&#151;but done nothing very radical.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o305"><a name="80317-0014.htm_para29"><a name="08031733000102">If, as seems likely, recession takes hold in America, spreads to the rest of the world and has some effect on us as well, the Chancellor may need to take more radical measures to deal with it, but if we have a recession of any kind, one should expect a spending deficit, because that is what happens in recessions. One does not want a tightening of fiscal policy at the beginning or in the middle of a recession. We should be relaxing fiscal policy, and we may need to do so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o306"><a name="80317-0014.htm_para30"><a name="08031733000103">We are now realising that we must re-establish the importance of all the levers of macro-economic policy and put them in the hands of the Government. Interest rates&#151;in theory at least&#151;are with the Bank of England, but it is unthinkable that the Bank would look at just the inflation rate and decide interest rate policies on that basis. It must consider the performance of the economy as a whole. Unusually, I agree with the right hon. Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood), who said that the last thing one wants to do in a recession is raise interest rates to deal with inflation. Inflation will be ironed out by the recession.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o307"><a name="80317-0014.htm_para31"><a name="08031733000104">Much more dangerous than inflation at such times is deflation, as the Japanese found in the 1990s. Falling prices and people abstaining from spending because they anticipate price falls can create a vortex that causes terrible damage to an economy. That must be resisted at all times. Apparently, the Japanese have as a national characteristic a compulsion to save all the time. In recessions, we want people to spend, not save. The Japanese Government apparently gave tokens to poor people to get them to spend&#151;they would not spend money&#151;but they started to save the tokens, so there was a serious problem. Deflation is much more worrying than inflation and the Government should ensure that the Bank of England does not start tightening interest rates at this moment. In my view, interest rates should indeed be considerably more relaxed.</p>

 I am grateful to my hon. Friend for giving way to a former NALGO member. He talks about the need for a fall in the value of the pound, but in recent months it has fallen by about 15 per cent. against the euro. He suggests it should fall even further. Does not all that point up the correctness of the policy of the former Chancellor, who is now Prime Minister, to keep us out of the euro currency zone at any cost, by means of his five tests?

 My hon. Friend, as he often does, anticipates one of the major aspects of my speech: to applaud the Prime Minister for keeping us out of the euro.

One certainly should not tighten fiscal policy during a recession or difficult times&#151;during a downturn in demand&#151;but there are ways in which one can maintain a reasonable balance if one is prepared to tax in the right way.

 Sometimes they put their money offshore. Those people have a low propensity to consume, as it is called in the jargon, so taking a little bit more money away from very rich people does not damage demand in the economy a great deal. If that money is handed to pensioners, poor people and families with children, who tend to spend every penny that they get to live on, that helps to sustain demand in the economy. That is a simple way of keeping the economy going while not having too big a spending deficit.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o313"><a name="80317-0015.htm_para5"><a name="08031733000114">That is the situation without looking at indirect taxes. &#147;Measuring Indirect Tax Losses&#151;2007&#148;, a fine book produced in October by Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs, draws attention to the vast amounts of revenue lost, especially through VAT fraud. The VAT tax gap is about &#163;13 billion. The book also examines tobacco and alcohol duties. Tobacco smuggling alone accounts for a loss of about &#163;3.5 billion a year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o314"><a name="80317-0015.htm_para6"><a name="08031733000115">Large sums could thus be collected without changing tax rates at all.

Let us talk about a third of that sum: &#163;20 billion a year, which would be extremely useful. We could use it to help pensioners and children more. We could spend more on investing in energy conservation and alternative energy. We could even close the budget gap a little more and reduce Government debt. If we collected that money, we could choose to do those things.</p>

 I agree entirely with my hon. Friend. Many hon.

However, those in the middle have lost out, and one of the reasons is the gradual creeping down of the higher rate tax threshold. If that threshold had been raised&#151;indexed, effectively&#151;over time, many people who are paying 40 per cent. tax would not be doing so and would be better off. There are other factors that explain why those middle-of-the-road people&#151;the very people whom all parties want to reward, because they tend to vote and to be the sort of people whom we want to persuade to vote for us&#151;are not doing very well at the moment.</p>

 I am not at all relaxed about that. I have no envy in my nature at all, but I believe in justice. Social justice requires that the rich should pay a little bit more&#151;a lot more, in fact&#151;and that the poor should benefit from that extra taxation on the rich.</p>

 Under Denis Healey, the top marginal rate was 83 per cent. and there was a 15 per cent. surcharge for unearned income on top of that, so some people were paying 98 per cent.

 I am surprised and disappointed. There is a lot of talk about child poverty. The proportion of children living in poverty in 1979 was considerably lower than it is now. We could deal with child poverty immediately, but it would take an act of great political will to redistribute income massively from the rich to the poor. However, that is not impossible. In Sweden, child poverty is a fraction of that in Britain. I ask the Ministers present, especially those from the Treasury, to think about that. I do not expect it to happen overnight. However, we should aim to achieve it quickly, hopefully before the next election, because I am sure that we would be rewarded electorally for such action.</p>

I was unhappy that we abolished the bottom 10 per cent. income tax band. Additionally, the threshold for the 40 per cent. band reaches down too low. I suggest that we put back the 10 per cent. rate, have a 20 per cent. band, and introduce a 30 per cent. rate for those on the lower part of the 40 per cent. band to reflect where the 40 per cent. band should really start. To compensate for that, we should have higher tax bands beyond that. My simple rule of thumb&#151;I think that I suggested this last year&#151;is that there should be a 50 per cent. rate for taxable incomes over about &#163;60,000, and a 60 per cent. rate for those over &#163;100,000.

The Chancellor rightly raised the winter fuel allowance, but I do not think it has been raised enough, and I should like it to be paid differently. I think that it should be paid as part of the basic state pension, but that people should be given double payments before and after Christmas. It would be easy to administer, everyone would receive it, and it would be taxed. The rich would not receive a tax-free lump sum at Christmas, which is what happens at present. If the sum were built into the basic state pension and taxed, it could be recycled to make a larger winter fuel allowance for those at the bottom of the income scale who pay little or no tax.

 We are all aware of the constraints within which the Chancellor operated this year. We are also aware of the sense of a gathering international storm which we hope will not engulf our own economy and others across Europe: the credit crunch and all the rest. But despite the massive considerations that clearly conditioned so much of what the Chancellor could do or was prevented from doing, when some of the headline announcements in the Budget are set not in the immediate context or the context that has developed internationally since last summer but in the context of the last decade, we see that very little in the Budget does any more to redress the growing sense of social imbalance that has been such a feature of this Labour decade.</p>

A good deal of the domestic situation has to do with the stewardship of the former Chancellor, now the Prime Minister of the country. The sad fact is, however, that despite the undoubted greater wealth generated in the country, the social division between those at the bottom end of the income and opportunities spectrum and those at the top end has both widened and deepened, and the Budget has not redressed that. Because of the circumstances it was probably not possible for it to do so, but I think that in the context of fundamental social justice it is worth repeating that point.</p>

side argument for another day&#151;but with the absence of something for which I and others have called for many years: a fairer approach to fuel duties, given that, as the Chancellor himself has acknowledged, they are being levied on this occasion with not just the environmental agenda but the revenue-taking agenda in mind.</p>

I first raised the issue in Brussels, along with my friend Jim Wallace, who was then Member of Parliament for Orkney and Shetland and who went on to become a Member of the Scottish Parliament and Deputy First Minister of Scotland. Jim and I worked closely on the issue in the 1980s and beyond, and spent a great deal of time exploring how other European Union member states were able to deliver derogations on fuel duties if their geography involved, for instance, islands or considerable areas of peripherality, if their Governments were enthusiastic about the idea, and if fuel costs had a disproportionate impact on fragile, socially remote areas.</p>

But where there is a political will there is a way. We have seen the system delivered in other EU member states, although it has never been delivered here.</p>

I use the words &#147;from time to time&#148; advisedly, because the petrol station tends to come and go depending on community initiatives of one kind or another, on the existence of a willing supplier, and on general concerns related to viability. Travelling from Applecross to the nearest permanent petrol station involves a round trip of 35 miles, and the price paid at the pump in Applecross compared with that paid in the metropolis called Inverness&#151;let alone in the central belt of Scotland or the south-east of England&#151;is gigantic in terms of mark-up. In a community where there is very little in the way of viable or regular public transport to meet people&#146;s needs, the motor vehicle is in no sense a luxury; it is an absolute necessity. Such communities would benefit from a derogation which the Treasury could pursue at Brussels level, and which would deliver a fairer distribution of the fuel tax take.

Easter Ross (John Thurso), but it does seem remarkable that a so-called genuine consultation exercise should result in only a single alteration to the original blueprint. To me that does not smack of genuine consultation. My other parliamentary neighbour, my hon. Friend the Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey (Danny Alexander), is to open an Adjournment debate on the issue in Westminster Hall at lunch-time tomorrow, and he will go into more details. I will say now, however, that the Budget contains nothing at all that shows, against that backdrop&#151;particularly in fragile rural areas&#151;a commitment to making the surviving post office network genuinely sustainable. That is the bigger long-term worry. This is not by any means the end of the story: it is the second round of Government closures. If the Government persist in office, I will not be surprised if they are back for a third and subsequent rounds of closures. That must give rise to great concern about the underpinning of the rural economy.</p>

 Has the right hon.

The sub-postmaster or postmistress, for whatever personal reasons it may be&#151;retirement, or moving on to something else&#151; gives up the tenancy and the professional contract to provide those Post Office services. That outlet then undergoes a period of temporary closure, but all too often that temporary closure slips into permanent closure. That does not appear necessarily on the radar as part of the formal consultation, but the impact in many of these communities is every bit as real because the net conclusion is identical. Therefore, not least in rural Britain, there is disappointment that the Budget is not taking more cognisance of the effects of other Government policies. Most of the measures in the Budget are certainly not seeking to ameliorate those effects.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o329"><a name="80317-0015.htm_para21"><a name="08031733000140">I requested of the Chief Secretary to the Treasury earlier this year a meeting with colleagues from the Scottish highlands to press our particular concerns about what has happened there. They are particular to the Scottish highlands, but they are not unique in the UK by any means. Housing debt there, running at approximately &#163;160 million, remains with the councils after tenants locally, in a highlands-wide referendum, rejected the stock transfer proposals. The difficulty is that councils in that position need to be given an option by the Treasury to help them to address the existing maintenance backlog as well as to expand affordable housing stock. At the moment, they are caught in the middle. They can do neither, because of the position they find themselves in. In an area such as our own, it is especially pressing owing to the enormous difficulties in meeting energy efficiency and fuel poverty standards&#151;in many areas there is an absence of domestic gas supply&#151;against a backdrop of soaring fuel bills. I hope that the Minister or the Whips who are listening will be able to encourage a positive response from the Treasury to our request. There is a genuine desire to have a serious and constructive discussion about that matter because it is a pressing one.</p>

However, within those constraints and against that backdrop, I think that on those three areas in particular&#151;fuel duties, the future of post offices and the Post Office network, and housing debt&#151;for large swathes of Britain and for my own part of the country in the highlands, there is much disappointment that there is nothing at all in the Budget to address them. For that reason, among others, I will oppose it in the Division Lobby tomorrow night.</p>

These are not unreasonable people; if they were convinced of the urgent necessity, in the interests of our country and of the world, for renewable energy to have an adverse and unwelcome impact not only on the quality of their lives as they see it but on their businesses, their bed and breakfasts, their restaurants, their tourism industry, their tranquillity&#151;because I have the honour to represent one of the last areas of rural tranquillity in England&#151;</p>

am a member of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee. We looked into this last year, and we considered that it represented a powerful means of encouraging microgeneration, but why is it that only now do we have a commitment&#151;even though it appears to be only lukewarm&#151;to look into a feed-in tariff?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o337"><a name="80317-0016.htm_para6"><a name="08031733000153">The respective benefits of a feed-in tariff and the current low-carbon buildings programme simply do not match up; I think that the Secretary of State agrees with that. Frankly, the low-carbon buildings programme has been a failure. It has produced solar voltaic panels in 270 houses. In Germany, 130,000 households took up such panels in the last year alone. That situation is reflected across all the diverse range of renewable energies. The low-carbon buildings programme is bureaucratic, it has too many conditions and it is not worth it. I recently had solar thermal panels installed in my home. I looked into the low-carbon buildings programme, but it was too much hassle, there was too much bureaucracy, and there was too little money because the grants simply are not high enough. Therefore, I agree with the Secretary of State that the way forward is a feed-in tariff. If it is set correctly, it is likely that there will be an explosion of interest in microgeneration. There are hundreds of thousands of such households in Germany. It is becoming standard in some German states for there to be some form of renewable energy in a household, but not in this country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o338"><a name="80317-0016.htm_para7"><a name="08031733000154">If my constituents see that there is a comprehensive and coherent Government policy that deals with all aspects of renewable energy and allows them not only to be taxed but to gain from renewable energy by a sensible feed-in policy, they will be much more likely to give their assent to intrusive technologies as part of an overall package of measures. However, they are likely to become cynical if they see only a Klondike-style gold rush of large-scale commercial wind companies coming to their villages and communities to erect 400-ft tall wind turbines and nothing else&#151;no way they personally can become engaged in the battle to fight climate change, but simply the profits disappearing a long way from their communities. Similarly, when they see the Budget measures for green taxation, they are likely to become cynical because they do not sense that the Budget has introduced its environmental measures in the service of some coherent grasp of what is necessary. They sense only that it is another stealth tax-raising measure.</p>

We cannot preach to them. We cannot simply expect them to accept having foisted on them unwelcome and intrusive technologies such as wind turbines that frequently damage the communities they are sited in&#151;for instance, in terms of the effect on tourism and the perception at least of an effect on the quality of life of the communities. We cannot expect them to take those measures and to take the taxation as well.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o341"><a name="80317-0016.htm_para10"><a name="08031733000159">I remind the Secretary of State that across my constituency, which as he knows is extremely rural, there are many hundreds of farming communities and farming people have little option but to use a strong 4x4 vehicle to perform many of the intensive tasks that are required to be done on often remote land. Yet those who go to buy a new Land Rover after the relevant change comes into force&#151;tomorrow or next month or whenever it will be&#151;will find that they have to pay an extra &#163;950 or &#163;1,000, and they will feel that they are simply on the receiving end of repeated blows from the Government.

I accept that entirely, but we will not win the assent of the people of this country if we do not show them that we are bringing forward policies with a profound sense of purpose, such as that which the hon.

If there is a coherent vision driving the Government&#146;s policy on the environment, why only now in the Energy Bill is the banding of the renewables obligation certificate being introduced? A criticism that has been made for many years is that because renewable energy technologies are in different states of evolution, and particularly because onshore wind is in an advanced state of evolution&#151;it is ready now&#151;the renewable energy obligation favours the established technologies. I welcome the proposals to band the renewables obligation, but why is it being done 11 years after this Government came to power? Why was it not done much earlier?</p>

If you will indulge me, Mr. Deputy Speaker, I will seize this opportunity to put on the record my congratulations to Edward Gillespie and everyone involved in the festival in Cheltenham for having put on such a wonderful show this week, despite extremely challenging circumstances at the beginning of it.</p>

Not only was this issue not tackled in the Budget; the Chancellor took the opportunity to increase amusement machine licence duty above the rate of inflation, thereby adding to the pressure on an industry that is already suffering.</p>

Having visited clubs in Cheltenham, I am satisfied that they perform an important social function, particularly for some of the less well-off communities and older members of society. I am also convinced that patrons generally bet only what they can afford. Therefore I hope that future Budgets will look more kindly on the bingo industry.</p>

That would have been timely, as the United Nations environment programme has just reported that the rate of glacier shrinkage appears to have doubled in less than a decade&#151;a grim addition to the already worrying body of scientific evidence about climate change. Yet actually, the Chancellor was three quarters of the way through his speech before he even mentioned the environment or climate change. We then had the traditional series of re-announcements. Amazingly, there was the re-announcement of the Climate Change Bill, which I thought we all knew about, and there was more about the Bali conference and more about low-carbon buildings by 2016. At one stage, the Chancellor even seemed to be taking credit for the European emissions trading scheme.</p>

In fact, if we look at the figures since 2002, it does not matter which of the methodologies we use&#151;the situation is getting worse. Of course, we all know that this great claim of the Government&#146;s to have met the Kyoto target is really only a result of the original dash for gas, which took us down below the Kyoto target many years ago.</p>

Among all this, strangely, there was no mention of the savage budget cuts to green projects such as the National Industrial Symbiosis Programme and the Waste and Resources Action Programme. Such cuts make it highly unlikely that business will be able to continue to improve its performance on waste reduction, in the way that it was able to do with the assistance of those two organisations.</p>

When challenged earlier, the Secretary of State dodged a question on carbon capture and storage by saying that it is a matter for the Minister for Energy. Well, it is relevant to an economic debate.

In fact, Northern Rock and the credit crunch have demonstrated the truth of what the Communities and Local Government Committee tried to tell the Treasury two years ago: many other factors in addition to the supply of land influence house prices, including the availability of credit, interest rates and so on. That is particularly true at national level, but there are myriad other factors locally. In my constituency of Cheltenham and the neighbouring borough of Tewkesbury, quite a large quantity of land has been released for housing over the past few decades, adding significantly to the total size of the town, yet we still experience relatively high house prices. That is the case because Cheltenham is still a wonderful place to live; it still has good schools and 98.5 per cent. employment, whereas other areas in the same travel-to-work area do not have such unaffordable housing.

The importance of the issue in the context of growth assumptions and the Budget&#146;s gloomy growth forecasts is that, if the growth points are established, they will become the only areas that are targeted by developers; if there is a general downturn, developers will end up going to those profitable greenfield sites first, under the growth point policy.

On transport, we heard in Question Time last week that the Prime Minister appeared keen to alter the carbon reduction target to 80 per cent. by 2050.

Just as the 2p income tax reduction was exposed last year as a tax con because of the removal of the 10p tax rate, those changes will hit families hard and result in a stealthy tax gain for the Government.</p>

The fuel duty on that greener, cleaner and more efficient fuel has spiralled in recent years, and the proposed increase in the Budget&#151;to come into effect from October&#151;will give little comfort to owners of LPG vehicles or the industry. In 2005, the duty on LPG stood at 9p per kilogramme. The 2006 Budget increased that by 3.21p, or 36 per cent., to 12.21p. Last year&#146;s Budget increased that by another 4.28p to 16.49p&#151;a rise of 35 per cent. And this year&#146;s Budget points to a further increase of 4.28p, which is a rise of 26 per cent. That means that owners of LPG vehicles will, from October, have to pay 20.77p per kilogramme, which is 11.77p more than just three years ago, or an increase of 130 per cent. Similarly, the duty paid on compressed natural gas will soar by 52 per cent. as a result of this Budget, from 9p per kilogramme in 2005 to 13.7p.</p>

on the same day as the Budget. Professor King highlighted four key challenges for reducing carbon dioxide from road transport. These included reducing CO2 through fuel efficiency and enabling an expansion of low carbon fuels. LPG and compressed natural gas fulfil those functions. The King review comments that there should be an:</p>
<a name="80317-0017.htm_brev4"><a name="08031733000383"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;increased use of alternative fossil fuels such as LPG and CNG which can both offer small but significant life-cycle CO2 savings over petrol and diesel. Cars capable of using LPG or CNG currently represent less than 1 per cent of the total car stock but there is scope to expand their use.&#148;</p>

The Government have their hands around the necks of LPG and CNG users, and are getting ready to throttle them. This was not a green Budget, but a green stealth tax Budget.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o382"><a name="80317-0017.htm_para18"><a name="08031733000204">Turning to the issue of biofuel and its environmental potential, the Budget has again failed to address the inherent weaknesses in Government policy towards this fuel. In spite of widespread criticism, the Government are pursuing the renewable transport fuel obligation to increase biofuel use, but, because the sustainability criteria have not been produced&#151;if indeed they are developed at all&#151;the relentless growth in biofuels may continue in an irresponsible way. We have seen the push for biofuels, particularly in the USA, leading to significant increases in food prices. In the last year alone, the price of corn has risen by 31 per cent., of soya by 87 per cent. and of wheat by 130 per cent. That has a knock-on effect right the way down the food chain. The consumer is hit with higher prices, and the rise in prices is also forcing domestic farmers into financial difficulties. Pig farmers are being especially squeezed, with the cost of feed doubling in the last year alone. If the industry does collapse, cheaper imports of animals reared&#151;this is very important&#151;to lower welfare standards will flood the domestic market adding to shoppers&#146; carbon footprints.</p>

The demand for palm oil for use in biofuels as well as in food and cosmetics is leading to the destruction of the rainforests of Borneo and Sumatra. As much as 10 million hectares of habitat could be lost, and that is having a devastating impact on orang-utan populations, which might be as low as 7,000 in Sumatra. They could face extinction within five years.</p>

I am warned that it might be only five years before we lose our sustainable population of orang-utans in the wild. It may take that much time to get sustainable palm oil on to our shop shelves. I fear that if palm oil comes into our fuel tanks without awareness among the general public, an explosion in the demand for that palm oil would quickly lead to the loss of those great apes. Sime Darby, a major palm oil producer that seeks to ensure that it can deliver sustainable palm oil, has invited me to visit Malaysia and Borneo to see what is being done to preserve the habitats of those great apes.

This year&#146;s Budget is what I would call eco-spin of the most cynical kind. Environmental taxes generated &#163;35 billion for the Government in 2006. That might sound like a lot of money, but despite all that tax, the Office for National Statistics tells us that environmental tax receipts as a percentage of gross domestic product have actually fallen from 3.6 per cent. in 1999 to just 2.7 per cent. in 2006. Moreover, environmental taxes as a percentage of total taxes and social contributions have decreased from 9.7 per cent. in 1999 to just 7.3 per cent. in 2006. We are going in the wrong direction. That is because green tax rises have been dwarfed by the Government&#146;s wider stealth-tax agenda over the past 10 years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o401"><a name="80317-0018.htm_para3"><a name="08031733000227">Putting aside for a moment the issue of green tax revenues, we have to ask whether the agenda has had a positive impact.

Is she prepared to publish the Treasury&#146;s assessment of how many cars there will be in each of the vehicle excise duty bands over the next three years&#151;the assessment that led to the Government&#146;s calculation in the Red Book on the vehicle excise duty tax take?</p>

He raised not only the issue of climate change, but the peak oil challenge, the current stock market and the credit crunch. He underlined the need for successful action in the coming years.</p>

Friend the Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood), who pulled together the strands of the various challenges that we face, not only with the climate change agenda but particularly acutely with the problems in the world stock markets. I thoroughly agreed with him when he described the Chancellor as complacent. The issues that we face in the world financial markets are certainly not ones to be complacent about. He contrasted very well the US Government&#146;s speed and effectiveness in handling the issues of Bear Stearns in recent days with our own Government&#146;s handling of the terrible problems at Northern Rock, which still continue to play out.</p>

He covered the problems of small businesses, for whom there certainly was not much in the Budget. He discussed the closure of post offices, which are themselves small businesses, and the plight that they are facing. He spoke about pubs&#151;another form of small business that was just mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Ribble Valley (Mr. Evans). He clearly set out the challenges that many of our pensioners face&#151;not only in meeting rising fuel bills but, given their inability to switch to lower-emitting vehicles overnight, as a result of the Government&#146;s measures on vehicle excise duty.</p>

It is concerning that we are not in a position to do that because of the way in which the Government squandered so much of the economic growth that we have had over the past 15 years.

Member for Cheltenham (Martin Horwood) initially talked about matters that had nothing to do with climate change, including bingo and double taxation, but went on to discuss his concerns about the low-carbon energy strategy and the shadow price of carbon. There are some serious debates to be had about the shadow price of carbon, which is a vital piece of any calculation for understanding the impact of carbon emissions on the environment and, specifically, alternative policy options. If that carbon price is not set correctly, not just today but as it changes over the longer term, we will get bad decision making by Government.</p>

Friend the Member for Leominster (Bill Wiggin) made an impassioned speech in favour of low-carbon transport, which I thoroughly agree with. He mentioned the electric bikes that he has ridden. One of that company&#146;s competitors turned up in my surgery a couple of Saturdays ago. All the companies involved are keen for that market to expand and be opened up so that people are able to do the right thing and start to use bikes and motorbikes that emit less than the ones that they have to use today. Finally, he talked about something close to his heart: cider. It is important to him and many hon. Members, and he was quite right to say that the Government&#146;s approach to alcohol taxation was a blunderbuss approach.</p>

Emissions from transport have risen by just under 6 million tonnes of carbon between 1997 and 2005, and 21 per cent. of the UK&#146;s total CO2 emissions now come from transport. We all know that there are those who are wedded to their cars, and however hard we try, we just cannot get them to take any other form of transport, even for the shortest journey.</p>

Perhaps the key to success in good environmental tax policy might be for the Exchequer Secretary to have a chat with her friend the Secretary of State and see what policies could be introduced to get him out of his car. It is lucky for us that most other people in this country do not follow his example&#151;who knows what CO2 emissions would be if they did?</p>

Perhaps more than 80 per cent. of car owners will pay more as a result of the changes to taxes on motorists. Many will be penalised for doing nothing more than owning a car in which to drive their family around. Those are the same families who face rising mortgages, energy bills and food bills. At the very time that they are experiencing more pressures on their disposable income&#151;what is left at the end of the month&#151;the Chancellor comes along, kicks them when they are down and says, &#147;Thanks very much.

That pales into insignificance when compared with the tax rise for polluting cars, which the Red Book shows comes to a massive &#163;750 million. Again, I ask the Exchequer Secretary if she could provide more details of the behaviour that the tax change is meant to drive. Otherwise, many of us in this House and the public outside will have no alternative other than to conclude that it is a stealth tax, designed to get the Government out of their public finance hole. It is not just we who are concerned. Edmund King, president of the Automobile Association, has warned that the new bands could be a green smokescreen.

The irony is that it is very much, &#147;Do as I say, not as I do&#148; from the Government. It turns out that last year, the Government bought 1.2 million plastic bags to help raise the profile of various Whitehall bodies at a cost of about &#163;90,000.

Friend the Member for East Surrey (Mr. Ainsworth) told us that, at the end of 2007, six homes had qualified. I can update the figure, which has risen. I am sure that he will be pleased to hear that, at the end of February, nine homes had qualified. <i> [Interruption.] </i>Labour Members say that that is a 30 per cent. increase, but the bad news is that the rate is reducing.

That is the sombre background to our debates.</p>

Clearly, we must tackle the current position, but we must also prepare our economy for the medium and long-term challenges that we will also face.

right hon. Member for Witney (Mr. Cameron) has repeatedly claimed, we have attended to the necessary roof repairs. We have also renewed the rotten foundations that we found when we took over responsibility for the lease and have completely modernised the inside of the house. After the years of neglect and decline that went before, the Government have ensured that we can all inhabit a more secure and dependable family home. There is clear evidence of the progress that this Labour Government have been able to make in the 10 years during which we have been responsible for the lease of the building.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o429"><a name="80317-0018.htm_para31"><a name="08031733000258">In 1997, Britain was the least stable economy in the G7. After 10 years of Labour stewardship, we are now the most stable economy. If we compare the record of our first 10 years of economic stewardship with the last 10 years of the Conservative Government, we begin to see why. Labour has achieved inflation rates that are on average half what they were when the Opposition were in government. Interest rates have been half what they were under the Tories, too, yet growth has been double what they managed to achieve. Employment rates are now at record highs, with the creation of 3 million extra jobs, and there are nearly 2 million extra homeowners. Household net income has increased by 25 per cent. since 1997 and net wealth has increased by 72 per cent.</p>

 We had the highest rate of growth in the G7 last year, at 3 per cent. The hon. Gentleman fails to talk about the figures that demonstrate the strength of our economy and he makes a partial case. The UK has been the fastest or the second fastest growing economy in the G7 for six of the past seven years and has achieved the fastest growth in income per head among all G7 countries in the past 10 years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o430"><a name="80317-0018.htm_para32"><a name="08031733000261">That record of success and stability means that, despite the global economic turbulence that we now face, the forecast evidence points to a slowdown, but not the end of growth in the UK economy. Our economy is strong, stable and resilient. In the testing conditions that we now face, that flexibility will stand us in good stead. Therefore, in last week&#146;s Budget, my right hon. Friend the Chancellor had to consider what action he needed to take in the short term to assist with the challenges that we face due to global conditions. He also had to look through the short-term turbulence and uncertainty to prepare our country for the challenges that undoubtedly lie ahead. It is that longer-term challenge to which I want to turn.</p>

We have since had 10 years of stable public investment and have got that figure up to 2 per cent. That is why, when I walk past schools and hospitals in my constituency, they are no longer falling down; they are in new buildings of which we can all be proud. It is because of the sustainable investment rule, which was created to ensure that we can invest in our public infrastructure as we need to, that we have enjoyed the success that I am talking about.</p>

 I notice with great pride that this Government have ended the connection between age and poverty for the first time ever. There is now no longer a correlation between a person&#146;s age and the likelihood of their living in poverty.

Friend the Chancellor had to consider what action to take in the short term to assist with the challenges that we are facing due to global conditions. He also needed to look ahead. Perhaps the most serious and demanding issue facing us is the question of how to tackle catastrophic climate change. We are in the forefront of the efforts to meet what Lord Stern has referred to as the &#147;greatest market failure&#148; the world has ever seen. Internationally, we are leading action aiming for a post-Kyoto agreement next year in Copenhagen.</p>

The Climate Change Bill will make us the first country in the world to legislate for carbon budgets, and my right hon.

The Energy Bill and the Planning Bill will enable us to begin the work of decarbonising our own economy and ensuring that we are able to meet the extremely challenging targets for renewable energy generation that we have been set by the European Union.</p>

He will also know that my right hon. Friend the Chancellor has been dealing with his counterparts in the EU and the G7 to determine what lessons need to be learned from the new threats and issues that global financial markets face as a result of the huge increase in globally mobile capital, to which the right hon.

The shadow Chancellor also argued that all green tax revenues should be used to cut taxes elsewhere. Again, we have heard plenty more comments about that in tonight&#146;s debate. Yet this weekend, the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond), the shadow Chief Secretary, was pronouncing that there should be no new tax cuts during the first term of any future Tory Government.

 I am grateful for the opportunity to speak about the winter fuel allowance, especially at such an appropriate time, given that the Government set out their policy on it in last week&#146;s Budget. As we have extra time, I am happy for my hon. Friend the Member for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor) to take part in the debate. The winter fuel allowance administration centre is in his constituency.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o453"><a name="80317-0019.htm_para22"><a name="08031733000305">Context is all-important when discussing the payment. Account must be taken of factors such as energy prices, inflation and the history of the allowance, and some of the criticisms of last week&#146;s Budget show a lack of appreciation of that. As I am sure my hon. and learned Friend the Minister will emphasise, there would be no winter fuel allowance if it had not been introduced by the Labour Government in 1997. When it was introduced it was &#163;20, but from next winter the basic rate will be &#163;250 and the higher rate will be up to &#163;400. In the light of that, some criticisms that I have read are reminiscent of the People&#146;s Front of Judea&#151;or should I say the Judean People&#146;s Front?&#151;wondering what the Romans, or in this case the Government, have ever done for us.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o454"><a name="80317-0019.htm_para23"><a name="08031733000306">It is important to recognise the Government&#146;s efforts to tackle fuel poverty. I welcome the recent increases in the winter fuel allowance. The Opposition talk about a revenue-neutral Budget&#151;incidentally, when that is coupled with deterrent taxation, it inevitably means cuts to services&#151;and the shadow Chancellor will not commit to even a one-off increase in the winter fuel allowance, so I know that people in my constituency are far better off under this Labour Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o455"><a name="80317-0019.htm_para24"><a name="08031733000307">The payment operates against the backdrop of the cost of energy. It is interesting to note that this year&#146;s increases have taken prices in real terms to the levels of the 1980s. There was no hint of assistance at that time from the incumbent Conservatives, which was no doubt one reason why 6.5 million households were in fuel poverty when Labour came to power in 1997. Furthermore, that situation had come about after a fall in energy prices that was more than three times the size of the reduction between 1997 and 2004. In the light of that, the Opposition&#146;s claim that progress on eliminating fuel poverty has been down to even cheaper prices beggars belief. In Scotland, the Scottish National party is failing vulnerable groups, such as disabled children, and, with its planning policy it is tying Scotland&#146;s future to the fluctuation of carbon prices, so my comments on the winter fuel allowance are made in recognition of the fact that the Government have done more than any other party on this front.</p>

about our vision of a fairer society. One aspect of that is our target to end fuel poverty among vulnerable groups by 2010, and completely by 2016.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o457"><a name="80317-0020.htm_para1"><a name="08031733000311">Before 1997, fuel poverty&#151;which is defined as when a person pays more than 10 per cent. of their income on heating their home&#151;had deliberately not been identified as something the Government should be worried about. In 2004, owing to a combination of declining retail prices and substantial Government assistance, 4.5 million homes had been lifted out of fuel poverty. However, with the winter fuel allowance remaining static and with steep increases in energy prices, the trend has unfortunately been reversed. By the end of last year, about 2 million households had fallen back into fuel poverty, taking the total to 4 million before the recent rises.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o458"><a name="80317-0020.htm_para2"><a name="08031733000312">Since December last year, all but one of the six major energy providers have imposed double-digit increases averaging about 15 per cent. The starting gun was fired by npower with a 17 per cent. increase in the price of gas, the main source of heating in the United Kingdom. It was followed by EDF and British Gas, within three days of each other, and by Scottish Power and E.ON within a week of each other. I echo the concern of Energywatch, which has observed that while citing different rises in wholesale costs, with a &#163;1,000 energy bill the major players come within &#163;13 of each other. What a remarkable coincidence. Inquiries into the market by both Ofgem and the Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Committee are welcome, and I look forward to the results.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o459"><a name="80317-0020.htm_para3"><a name="08031733000313">It is important to note that while the energy companies have blamed increasing wholesale prices for the price rises, their own profits have rocketed. British Gas recently announced that its profits had risen by 500 per cent. That, in my view, reflects the fact that the motivation behind companies&#146; actions is profit. They are a front for investment, and they are not in business with a moral mission. We need to ask why they have nevertheless been given a free rein with customers. I hope that the lesson from this is not lost on the Government, given the Chancellor&#146;s threat of legislation if energy providers fail to increase spending on social tariffs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o460"><a name="80317-0020.htm_para4"><a name="08031733000314">As for this year&#146;s price increases, the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform estimates that for every 1 per cent. rise, 40,000 people are pushed into fuel poverty. The recent price hikes will therefore have pushed at least half a million more homes into fuel poverty, which means that the figure was about 4.5 million before last week&#146;s Budget.</p>

 Does my hon. Friend agree that one of the prime reasons for the excessive price increases of recent months is that the market has moved on from the post-privatisation position, when the number of companies was in the teens? As a result of mergers and acquisitions, a mere handful now operate in an oligopolistic fashion, driving prices up to a higher level than the market would generate. Does my hon. Friend hope that our hon. and learned Friend the Minister will ask the Minister for Energy for an investigation of the apparent market failure?</p>

 My hon. Friend is right. During the Committee stage of the Energy Bill we took evidence from the various companies, and I posed a similar  <br>

question to them. They assured me that that could not possibly happen, and that the increases were due to external forces and nothing to do with profits. That was at the time they were telling us about the 500 per cent. increase in profits. I am sure that that will not have been lost on the Minister for Energy, because he was present during the evidence sessions, and I think that some of the things the Chancellor said last week might have something to do with it. It is important for us to keep tabs on those companies. They seem to be getting their money awfully easily nowadays, and they are certainly not contributing enough to look after those who need to be looked after the most.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o461"><a name="80317-0020.htm_para5"><a name="08031733000317">I must ask you to excuse my bad throat, Mr. Deputy Speaker. I was at a football match yesterday, and I did a bit more shouting than usual.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o462"><a name="80317-0020.htm_para6"><a name="08031733000318">I wrote to the Chancellor in February asking for double the increase that he eventually announced. I want to focus on the current amount of the payment, and also to take this opportunity to urge the Chancellor, and the Minister, to consolidate the additions and not to leave them as a one-off with an uncertain future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o463"><a name="80317-0020.htm_para7"><a name="08031733000319">The basic rate for 60 to 79-year-olds was raised by &#163;50, from &#163;200 to &#163;250, while the payment for those over 80 was raised from &#163;300 to &#163;400. Those increases were the first since the introduction of the higher rate in 2003 and the first change in the &#163;200 rate since 2001. As a proportion of the payment, they represent an additional 25 and 33 per cent. respectively. One immediate question I wish to ask the Minister is why there is that discrepancy, with the majority of claimants, at a ratio of 3:1, being paid at the lower rate. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o464"><a name="80317-0020.htm_para8"><a name="08031733000320">Over the same period that saw increases of 25 and 33 per cent. in the allowance, based on figures from both the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform and British Gas, energy bills in real terms have gone up by 50 per cent. That would mean a significant shortfall of itself, but there is a far greater deficit. The retail prices index, against which energy bills are measured, shows inflation of around 18 per cent. since 2001, and 14 per cent. since 2003. That would mean real-terms increases of around 7 per cent. and 19 per cent. for the winter fuel allowance against 50 per cent. for energy bills. Perhaps the Minister could confirm that the calculations that I have done are correct.</p>

 My hon. Friend refers to the desirability of consolidation of the basic allowances, rather than a one-off payment. I think that most people would agree with that, but others might argue that it would be better still to incorporate the amounts into the basic pension entitlement, so that payment becomes part of that from here on in. Half the amount could be paid at the start of winter, on 1 December, and half the amount at the end of winter, the end of February. That approach would commend itself, and indeed higher amounts could be paid to recognise the fact that better-off pensioners would pay tax on the sums that they receive.</p>

 I thank my hon. Friend for that intervention. I will touch on that matter at the end of my speech. I do not necessarily come to the same conclusion, but I do come to a conclusion, and I hope that the Minister will comment on my suggestion.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o465"><a name="80317-0020.htm_para9"><a name="08031733000323">By the measure that I have outlined, the Government have a long way to go simply to get back to the stage we were at four years ago when 2 million homes were in fuel poverty. Roughly 600,000 of those were pensioners and I believe that, on the figures I have outlined, a far greater number will be in fuel poverty next winter.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o466"><a name="80317-0020.htm_para10"><a name="08031733000324">I have no doubt that the Minister will rightly want to point out that the winter fuel allowance is not the only tool the Government use to tackle fuel poverty. Warm Deal, for instance, or Warm Front for those living in England, has helped more than 1 million homes at a cost of &#163;1.4 billion. As he will be aware, however, that is available to more numerous groups than the winter fuel payment, such as those on certain income-related benefits or disability living allowance. Therefore, it is not directly comparable to the allowance figures. I ask the Minister, if he does cite Warm Deal as helping in that regard, how many of those it has helped are pensioners.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o467"><a name="80317-0020.htm_para11"><a name="08031733000325">In answer to a written question from the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey (Danny Alexander) on the proportion of a pensioner&#146;s bills which the payment would cover, the Minister said in <i> Hansard</i> on 6 December 2007, at column 1512W, that pensioners' incomes had grown by 29 per cent. in real terms between 1996 and 2005. If we take the state pension from 2001 and 2003, the more significant dates in examining the recent Budget increase, they have increased by 21 and 25 per cent. respectively, so only 3 and 11 per cent. in real terms. That, once again, means that there is a large deficit in the rate at which pensioners' incomes have increased, even with the winter fuel payment, in comparison with the 50 per cent. rise in energy bills.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o468"><a name="80317-0020.htm_para12"><a name="08031733000326">As with the Warm Deal scheme, I should point out that any comparison between the state pension and the allowance will be inexact because entitlements to them are not co-extensive. Moreover, with food prices&#151;another staple for pensioners&#151;having increased by 6 per cent. this year, energy bills are not the only burgeoning demand on their finances.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o469"><a name="80317-0020.htm_para13"><a name="08031733000327">The trend in fuel poverty has been going in the wrong direction for the past few years and because the payment has remained static, for the next winter pensioners will be far worse off than seven years ago. If we are serious about eradicating fuel poverty, there is clearly a need for the winter fuel allowance to be directly linked to fuel prices by some mechanism. The tragedy of the situation is summed up by the fact that we collate a statistic entitled &#147;the excess winter death figure&#148;, which stood at just under 24,000 for 2006. If the Government can afford to double the allowance for inheritance tax, I humbly submit that we can find the money to prevent pensioners from freezing in their own home.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o470"><a name="80317-0020.htm_para14"><a name="08031733000328">The final issue I wish to discuss is entitlement to the allowance. All people over 60 are entitled to receive the payment and need specifically to claim to do so. The need to claim the allowance&#151;rather than, for instance, it being an addition to the state pension or paid directly to energy companies&#151;significantly reduces the chance of the targeted group receiving it. From my surgeries, I know that perceived entitlement to financial help does not go hand in hand with actual entitlement to it. In particular, many pensioners I meet do not want to claim for assistance, believing that they can get by without it and should make do with what they have, or feeling that it is charity. In this context, Help the Aged  <br>

estimates that about &#163;4.5 billion in various benefits goes unclaimed by pensioners each year. All the calculations I have outlined are predicated on the assumption that there is full take-up of the allowance, so the situation is likely to be even worse than I fear.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o471"><a name="80317-0020.htm_para15"><a name="08031733000329">Perhaps the rationale behind requiring a claim to be made is that that will deter those who are perfectly  well off from applying for the payment simply to supplement their finances. If that is the case, will the Minister assure me that the relevant segment of the unclaimed &#163;4.5 billion comes from the over-60s who are not in need of the allowance failing to claim it, rather than those in fuel poverty and in dire need of assistance towards their bills? Has any assessment of this been made?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o472"><a name="80317-0020.htm_para16"><a name="08031733000330">This issue also highlights the fact that the winter fuel payment is indiscriminate, given that all those over 60, regardless of whether they are still in work and regardless of their resources or incomes, are entitled to receive the payment. It is bizarre that the payment is used as a blanket income supplement across the board for over-60s alone, when many vulnerable groups such as children and the disabled are equally susceptible to fuel poverty and receive no assistance at all from the allowance.</p>

 I am sure that my hon. Friend agrees that the scheme could be improved in numerous ways without great cost being incurred. One way would certainly be for those who reach the pension age of 60&#151;or 80 for the higher level&#151;during the winter period to be entitled to the amount, rather than having to have reached that age by the fixed date in September. In some of the correspondence I receive, that is identified as an anomaly. Does my hon. Friend get similar correspondence from pensioners?</p>

 I do, but at the end of the day we must ensure that the money goes as far as possible; I believe we have to look after all our pensioners, but that we also have to look after those with the greatest needs, and that is where I would like the money to go.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o473"><a name="80317-0020.htm_para17"><a name="08031733000333">The point about identifying those whom we need to support also applies to social tariffs. In a briefing from British Gas, the company mentioned</p>

The Government, however, collect such data for tax purposes and I suggest that a more targeted approach would save money and help those most in need, and, if operated in conjunction with energy providers, this identification could be carried out and they could be engaged with social tariffs. I see no reason why the cost of this should not be met out of their incredible earnings and obscene profits.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o475"><a name="80317-0020.htm_para19"><a name="08031733000335">One further change that I urge the Minister to consider is the direct payment of the allowance to the provider as part of that, so as to remove the problem of unclaimed funds. While I recognise the need to be flexible and respond to how individuals want to receive the support, the issue of unclaimed benefits can undermine all of our efforts.</p>

I reiterate that we can discuss increasing, extending and modifying the payment, and discuss fuel poverty&#146;s being an issue, only because of a Labour Government.

This amounts to &#163;11.5 billion a year more than was spent on pensioners in 1997. We are right to be proud of our achievements, but there is more that we need to do. We want to ensure that pensioners claim all the benefits to which they are entitled. I wrote to Members of this House three weeks ago outlining some of the measures that we are taking to simplify application procedures, and informing them how they can get their older constituents to claim the various benefits available to them. A lot of pensioners are still not claiming sufficient benefits. The money is there, we are waiting to pay it and we need those applications to come in.</p>

 We can actually get to every pensioner; the problem is getting those pensioners to whom we can get to recognise that if they are on a low income, they can apply for further benefits. In the past 18 months, we have written in some instances up to four times to people whom we think may be entitled to claim the pension credit, help with their council tax and perhaps housing benefit in respect of their social housing rent. Many of them are not responding. We know their addresses and can write to pensioners, but it is getting the response that is sometimes the problem. We are trying to encourage working with partner organisations and the Pension Service to get more pensioners to claim the benefits. Tackling broad poverty is crucial, but, as my hon. Friend says, we must go further.</p>

 It is vital that pensioners can keep their heating on, secure in the knowledge that they can pay their fuel bills. The key to dealing with pensioner fuel poverty is therefore ensuring that pensioners have sufficient money to pay those bills. That was why we introduced the winter fuel payment in 1997&#151;the first ever support targeted to help pensioners with their heating costs. It currently helps more than 8.5 million households, and nearly 12 million people. It has taken us away from the cold, dark days of the last Conservative Government, when freezing pensioners were offered minimal support to stay warm. Instead, Health Ministers went around telling pensioners to buy long johns and woolly nightcaps if they wanted to stay warm in winter.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o483"><a name="80317-0020.htm_para27"><a name="08031733000347">We have moved on since then. Back in 1995, just &#163;65 million was spent on cold weather payments for the vulnerable. Last winter we spent more than &#163;2 billion on winter fuel payments. Today, the debate is not about whether we should give pensioners help with heating costs, but about how much more help we should give. In the past decade the winter fuel payment has risen tenfold, and stood at &#163;200 for the over-60s and &#163;300 for those over 80 last winter.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o484"><a name="80317-0020.htm_para28"><a name="08031733000348">But we are not complacent. Last year we launched a cross-Government strategy to target the most vulnerable and to ensure that everyone can keep warm and keep well in winter. It brings together the priorities of my Department with those of the Department of Health, the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform, and other agencies to provide a one-stop shop for help and advice on keeping warm and obtaining benefits. Schemes such as Warm Front, which my hon. Friend mentioned, have helped more than 2 million low-income households to improve their energy efficiency, through better heating or insulation. In fact, every minute of the working day, a home receives a new heating system as a result of the scheme. </p>

million customers on prepayment meters. Energy companies currently spend about &#163;50 million a year on social tariffs. We want to see that treble to at least &#163;150 million a year in the period ahead. We want to work with the energy companies, but we will take any necessary steps&#151;I say this very clearly&#151;to ensure that that happens.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o486"><a name="80317-0021.htm_para1"><a name="08031733000350">I welcome the announcement last week by my right hon. Friend the Chancellor that we will provide an additional payment of &#163;50 for the over-60s and &#163;100 for the over-80s, to sit alongside the winter fuel payment. That vital extra support underlines our commitment to tackling pensioner fuel poverty. It shows that the Government can react quickly to changing fuel prices, and it will ensure that the winter fuel payment continues to provide a significant contribution to winter fuel bills, providing an extra &#163;575 million and benefiting nearly 12 million individuals. Pensioners can therefore heat their homes with more confidence next winter. It sits alongside measures announced last year that will take a further 600,000 pensioners out of paying income tax. I hope that those positive measures will be widely welcomed in the House. They provide significant extra support to our older citizens.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o487"><a name="80317-0021.htm_para2"><a name="08031733000351">The generous payments that we have already put in place have, to some extent, been affected by increasing fuel prices. Back in 1997, we were getting the benefits of North sea oil and gas, and there were quite considerable beneficial changes in the world energy market. The result was that during the late &#146;90s and the early part of this century, fuel prices were lower than earlier in the &#146;90s. The benefits from the winter fuel payments were therefore considerable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o488"><a name="80317-0021.htm_para3"><a name="08031733000352">In the past two or three years, we have seen that some of the benefits from North sea oil have been eroded, because much of the energy it supplies has been used. It will be around for many years to come, but the easily accessible oil and gas reserves in the North sea have now been exploited. Some of the new areas will be more difficult, and therefore more expensive, to access.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o489"><a name="80317-0021.htm_para4"><a name="08031733000353">We have also seen changes in the international fuel market, with extra demand coming from China, India and several other sources. The world price of energy has therefore risen, just at the point when we have to import more energy than ever before. I well remember that, when I was the Minister with responsibility for energy, I signed the agreement with Norway that would bring about a fifth of our gas from the Norwegian gas fields into Scotland through the Langeled pipeline. That is very beneficial, but we are now much more subject to world fuel prices than we were only seven or eight years ago. The result is that our fuel prices are rising, and that is having an impact on pensioners&#146; budgets.</p>

 Does my hon. Friend and parliamentary neighbour agree with those observers who remark that it is easier for a smaller number&#151;now five&#151;of major energy companies to form an unofficial cartel to hold prices at higher levels than they should be, or to push them to levels that the market does not dictate? Would not that be worth investigating? Many observers think that it should be investigated.</p>

market is operating properly and the interests of the consumer are paid due attention. My hon. Friend suggests that the consumer comes off worst, but Ofgem&#151;an independent regulator proud of its independence&#151;is aware that, especially at a time of fast-rising fuel prices, we need to ensure that energy companies are responding to the concerns of their customers and operating the best competitive market. We rely to some extent on Ofgem to carry out its regulatory and policing activities to ensure that the consumer is protected.</p>

 To back up the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for North-West Leicestershire, the difference in price between the dearest and cheapest energy suppliers is only 1.3 per cent. Is that likely to happen if we are in a competitive market?</p>

<p><a name="st_o321"><a name="08031733000357"><a name="80317-0021.htm_spnew3"><a name="08031733000512"><b>Mr. O'Brien:</b>
 That depends on whether they are competing at the lowest possible price. If they are, that might well happen. It does not necessarily mean that the market is not working effectively. It is possible that several companies are competing with each other and offering similar low price levels. However, if the prices were not low, but were agreed in some way, that would be improper and a matter that we would expect the regulators to address. Certainly, my hon. Friend the Minister for Energy has indicated that we are keeping a close eye on these issues, to ensure that the energy companies are operating fairly within the market. The extra payment promised by the Chancellor will mean that the winter fuel payment for those over 60, including the &#163;50 top-up, will total &#163;250 next winter. That is a 25 per cent. rise on last year. For those over 80, the winter fuel payment and the &#163;100 additional payment will total &#163;400, a rise of one third on last year. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o490"><a name="80317-0021.htm_para5"><a name="08031733000358">Last year, the winter fuel payment covered more than half of the average winter fuel bill. Next year, with rises of &#163;50 and &#163;100, the winter fuel payment will continue to make a significant contribution to pensioners&#146; winter fuel bills. It is difficult to give a precise figure because we do not know precisely what the winter fuel bills will be. These measures will, I hope, ensure that many more pensioners can keep their homes warm, safe in the knowledge that they can meet their fuel bills.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o491"><a name="80317-0021.htm_para6"><a name="08031733000359">My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, North-West suggested that we should extend the winter fuel payment to other groups. We provide a range of benefits to meet different people&#146;s needs and we have a series of benefits in place that are designed to help people who are terminally ill, cannot work or are in need of further help from the state. Older people are particularly vulnerable to the effects of cold weather during winter months. That is why we created the winter fuel payments. They give pensioners the reassurance that they can afford to heat their homes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o492"><a name="80317-0021.htm_para7"><a name="08031733000360">Other groups also have issues, such as the disabled. However, 60 per cent. of those who receive disability living allowance or attendance allowance are over 60 and already receive winter fuel payments automatically.

months. The disability living allowance is worth &#163;109.50 and will increase to &#163;113.75 from April this year, while the poorest are entitled to some extra help through the disability premium in income-related benefits.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o493"><a name="80317-0021.htm_para8"><a name="08031733000361">My hon. Friend wanted to know whether it would be possible to reconsider the issue of having two bands, one for those over 60 and one for those over 80. He suggested that it might be possible to have a more targeted, nuanced payment system and drew attention to the fact that some people on relatively high incomes also receive the supplement. We could do various things to change all that. For example, we could take the view that those on higher incomes would be taxed on their winter fuel payment. We could take the view that people on higher incomes would not receive a winter fuel payment and that we would only perhaps allocate it to those who were on pension credit.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o494"><a name="80317-0021.htm_para9"><a name="08031733000362">There are all sorts of things that the Government could do to change, alter and redirect the payments. We considered all that and took the view that there was an expectation among pensioners that we would make winter fuel payments to them as we did in the past and as the Government had committed to do in their election manifestos, and that we ought to continue to do that. If there needs to be a debate about changes to the system, let us have a debate by all means. At the moment, the Government&#146;s view is that we have made commitments on winter fuel payments and we want to keep to them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o495"><a name="80317-0021.htm_para10"><a name="08031733000363">The two age-related bands make the system easier for people to understand and help older people plan ahead secure in the knowledge of the contribution they will receive towards their winter fuel bill. The current age split takes account of the fact that older pensioners over 80 are more likely to live alone or in less energy efficient homes. They are more likely to have a lower income than recently retired people. People over 80 are less likely to have well-paying final salary pension schemes. Many of those who are retiring now will have good quality final salary pension schemes, although not all of them will. People over 80 tend to spend a higher proportion of their income on fuel. Our view has been that there is a strong argument for making payments to those over 80. Of course, those older pensioners are also likely to be most vulnerable to not sensing that they are getting cold and are the most likely to fall victim to hypothermia. There is an argument for ensuring that we keep things simple while recognising that the over-80s deserve an extra payment. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o496"><a name="80317-0021.htm_para11"><a name="08031733000364">My hon. Friend has made a powerful argument, and I congratulate him on raising the issues, which do call for a wider debate. The Government are committed to tackling pensioner poverty, including fuel poverty. We have made considerable progress in the past decade, with pensioner poverty falling significantly. The winter fuel payment is an important part of our strategy; we know that our cold winters affect older people more than the rest of the population. The winter fuel payment provides a guaranteed payment to all older people. It is an important contribution towards household fuel bills.</p>
