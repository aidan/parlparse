 It is important that we monitor very carefully the way in which these funds are being used.

As the hon. Gentleman knows from our correspondence, we are currently considering all 200 projects. I am ensuring that information about all those projects and the work that is going on will be placed in the Library next week. Monitoring is absolutely essential.

 The hon. Gentleman does not need to tell me because I read the <i> Evening Standard</i> last Friday, as he did. I also read the press release that he put out on that day. It is interesting that he was not on his feet talking about the LDA back in the summer when it delivered the land required for the Olympic park on time&#151;the most complex and largest compulsory purchase order project for the past 20 years. That may have something to do with the elections in May. The fact is that the Mayor we have has been an outstanding leader for London.

 I hope that the Minister will take time to read the LDA&#146;s report, because the truth is that his washing of his hands is wholly unsatisfactory. Even that report, despite its clear inadequacies, acknowledges the need to review the role of mayoral advisers, based on the limited evidence that resulted in half the instances it investigated being referred to the police. The LDA was criticised in November over some 61 wholly separate grants. It was found that it had not demonstrated that it would get what it expected in return for the funding given, that it had not adequately monitored outcomes, and that it was unable to explain the criteria on which it had based some of its decisions. Government action is needed because the LDA is a serial offender in such matters; it has more form than the Kray brothers.</p>

The housing revenue account is not merely a problem for authorities in negative subsidy. The housing revenue account system is a problem in that an authority can get penalised for building new homes and, if tenants want to opt for improvements, they cannot pay extra rent to cover the cost. There is a fundamental dislocation between the service provided and the rents that are charged. For all those reasons, I am sure that my right hon.

Such a complex system is not in the interests of people who run housing revenue accounts throughout the country. A system that better rewarded long-term planning and long-term decision making by local councils would be preferable.

It is important that local communities are involved in deciding what kinds of homes need to be built, and where homes need to be built, in their areas. That is why we have made changes to the planning policy statement for housing. Councils should be using those new powers to support development in their communities, but they also must recognise that we badly need more homes in this country to meet the needs of families in overcrowded accommodation, families on council waiting lists and future first-time buyers.

 I am sorry that the hon. Gentleman missed what was a sensible discussion of the housing revenue account system and how it works. There is an element of redistribution in the account, and that is important because council housing has been funded in different ways historically and there are huge variations. There are also huge variations in need, so it is right that the system has an element of redistribution. However, there are problems with the system as it stands, and that is why we are conducting a serious long-term review and piloting different approaches.

 I am sure that the Secretary of State will have been saddened by the evidence presented at last week&#146;s inquest into the death of baby Rhianna Hardie, who was scalded in a tragic accident caused by a faulty thermostat. The coroner noted that the Health and Safety Executive thought that a similar fatality in 2002 sufficiently serious to bring it to the attention of the predecessor Department, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister. However, the Department did not pass on that warning to local authorities. Has the Secretary of State been able to ascertain why the ODPM did not pass that information on to local authorities?</p>

 This matter is of the utmost concern. It was a terrible tragedy, although thankfully rare, and our sympathies are very much with Rhianna Hardie&#146;s family. The hon. Gentleman is right that there was a similar case in 2002, and consideration was given then to whether a new British standard should be introduced for immersion heaters to ensure that it did not happen again. All new installations now have to have a secondary thermostat to prevent overheating. There is also a full review of building regulations to look at the issue, which started last summer and is an ongoing process. We will consider the comments made by the coroner in the latest case very carefully, because it is important to have clarity between my Department and the Health and Safety Executive on responsibilities and lines of communication.

 That is very helpful. It might also be helpful if the Secretary of State would consider placing in the Library the correspondence between the HSE and the ODPM on the issue. In the course of the review, it might be helpful to look at the protocols for her Department on how information from the HSE is treated.

 I do not want to pre-empt the review of the building regulations that is being undertaken to consider that matter, which will be comprehensive and thorough.

He and the House might like to know that as at 14.16 today, 63 flood warnings and no severe flood warnings were in place, while nine all-clears had been given.</p>

An escape of LNG would vaporise and form an unstable, unconfined, highly combustible cloud which, on ignition, would explode and burn at extremely high temperatures, destroying everything in its path.

The Health and Social Care Bill will transfer those functions to the office of the health professions adjudicator, so those two bodies will no longer have to meet those costs. We have therefore tabled a Government amendment to allow the office of the health professions adjudicator to charge fees to the General Medical Council and General Optical Council.

 The regulatory bodies such as the GMC, the GOC and possibly others that come under the independent adjudicator&#146;s remit will pay the fees, based on the workload of the independent adjudicator in any one year. Individual doctors now pay a levy or a membership fee to the GMC. They will continue to do so, and out of the funds that that raises, the GMC&#151;or the GOC, or other appropriate body&#151;will pay a fee that will be set after consultation with everybody, including Members of Parliament, and approval by the Secretary of State in laid regulations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o38"><a name="80115-0004.htm_para27"><a name="08011598000192">We are doing some independent research with the GMC into its current costs. It is rather difficult to disaggregate the cost of the adjudication process from the overall costs that the GMC incurs, but our estimate is about &#163;11.5 million a year. That is the figure that we are working on. That is the current cost, which is met by medical doctors and others who are members of those organisations and pay their annual subscription to those organisations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o39"><a name="80115-0004.htm_para28"><a name="08011598000193">The new clause about fees must be authorised by a Ways and Means resolution. The House authorities, I understand, reached this conclusion because the new office of the health professions adjudicator will be for the benefit of the general public, rather than just for the benefit of the professions regulated by the GMC and the GOC. In addition, the fees charged by the OHPA will cover all of the body&#146;s costs, rather than costs incurred before a day to be specified in regulations or costs incurred for a purpose specified in regulations. That is the difference between the fee-charging powers of the Healthcare Commission and the future care quality commission. In other words, the fees will be calculated by reference to the total expenditure of the OHPA, rather then to the individual service that it is providing to an individual organisation.</p>

 In speaking to this Ways and Means resolution, I am mindful of the words of my late, great colleague on the Conservative Benches and champion of the rights and duties of this House, the former Member for Bromley and Chislehurst, Mr. Eric Forth. He noted:</p>
<a name="80115-0005.htm_brev0"><a name="08011598000792"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;It is always a great pity that these apparently innocuous Ways and Means resolutions attract such relatively little attention from colleagues in the House, because they are, of course, a very important part of what remains of the House's influence on the sort of measures that flow from legislation. I should like to think that in some ways Members would be more interested in Ways and Means resolutions than in many other aspects of the Bills themselves.&#148;&#151;[<i> Official Report</i>, 15 November 2004; Vol. 426, c. 1064.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o41"><a name="80115-0005.htm_para1"><a name="08011598000196">I pay tribute to the fact that the Conservative Members who sit on the Committee considering this Bill are present for this Ways and Means resolution debate; apart from the Minister, only the Parliamentary Private Secretary and the Whip are on the Government Benches. That is a shame. Furthermore, it is notable that the Minister chose not to answer the direct questions put to him, quite properly, by my hon. Friends the Members for Buckingham (John Bercow) and for Woking (Mr. Malins); my hon. Friend the Member for Woking brings expertise to this subject from his past.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o42"><a name="80115-0005.htm_para2"><a name="08011598000197">The Minister has just said that the House authorities deemed it necessary to bring this stand-alone, separate Ways and Means resolution to the Floor of the House today. I remind the House, however, that that would not have been necessary had the Government got their act together sufficiently in advance of publication and the commencement of the Bill&#146;s proceeding through the House. They should not have left outstanding a series of open-ended negotiations so that the resolution could not be recognised in the Bill when it was first published.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o43"><a name="80115-0005.htm_para3"><a name="08011598000198">According to House rules, when the Government table a new clause a Ways and Means resolution is necessary if the new clause would raise a new fee structure or a tax&#151;and I shall argue that new clause 7 does. The Government are responsible for taking up the time of the House on this matter, which is important, given that we are already in Committee and considering the very issues to which it relates.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o44"><a name="80115-0005.htm_para4"><a name="08011598000199">This debate arises from Government new clause 7. The Committee has not yet debated or voted to amend the Bill through the new clause. It is therefore valid to ask whether we should take up the House&#146;s valuable time at this point of the Committee&#146;s proceedings.</p>

 Is my hon. Friend saying that the issue has not yet been fully debated in Committee? That comes as a great surprise, particularly as I understand that many Labour members of the Committee are not here today. Have not Labour and Conservative Committee members already had a full opportunity to debate the new clause and its financial implications? If they have not or are not going to, that is astonishing.</p>

 I am sorry to have to confirm to my hon. Friend that he has to be astonished. We have started the Committee&#146;s proceedings and taken the new form of oral evidence, but new clause 7 was tabled at a such a point that it does not even come up for consideration by the Committee for some time.</p>

If the matter is to be effectively implemented by regulation&#151;and I do not cavil at that&#151;is it not a good idea, and should not Parliament demand, that we as a House have sight of a draft version of the regulations before the final passage of the Bill?

Given the absence of the clause on Second Reading, we are now in the impossible position of being called to vote on fee-charging powers that we have not had the opportunity to discuss. That is somewhat contemptuous and not in line with the Prime Minister&#146;s assertion, just a few months ago, that he would hold this place in much higher regard than the Prime Minister whom he succeeded. By the Government&#146;s own admission, they found themselves still in late negotiations with the General Medical Council long after the Bill had found its way into the House&#146;s calendar. The resolution has either been proposed too early or proposed too late, but it certainly should not be taking up the House&#146;s time as it is. However, that is what we are faced with, so we must deal with the facts as we find them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o46"><a name="80115-0005.htm_para6"><a name="08011598000205">To understand the context in which the resolution is being considered, I remind the House that the office of the health professions adjudicator is a new body that is being set up under the Bill to take over the adjudication of fitness to practise panels from the GMC and the General Optical Council. It is being established in response to Lady Justice Smith&#146;s recommendations in the Shipman inquiry. Under the new procedure, we had the benefit of her being able to give us direct oral evidence, and it was incredibly persuasive and powerful. I dare say that the whole House will join me in agreeing that we, as a legislature, never want a repeat of the appalling Dr. Shipman&#146;s atrocities. There is a question mark over the creation of the OHPA. The GMC noted in its written evidence that, by any objective measure, its adjudication track record is extremely good, and that over the past two years, 2006-07, there had been 2,480 hearings regarding doctors&#146; fitness to practise, with all decisions challengeable by reference to the High Court.</p>

 I am grateful to you, Mr. Speaker. The fact that we have to vote on this now means that we must raise the issues about where fee charging is dealt with. I recognise that that is the definition of your ruling. Absolutely germane to what my hon. Friend the Member for Woking (Mr. Malins), with all his experience, rightly says, is the question of whether what two bodies carry out, through two distinct functions, in relation to a matter that was previously dealt with under one body, has a significant bearing on the costs and amounts that may be charged through them as a tax, not necessarily falling on general taxation powers. Perhaps it would have been helpful to have had the benefit of the opinion of the Chairman of the Select Committee on Health; it is a shame that he is not here. <i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> Indeed&#151;as he is a GMC member.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o47"><a name="80115-0005.htm_para7"><a name="08011598000211">Critical to our decision on the resolution is whether we have resolved an issue of serious contention in Committee&#151;whether the new bodies being set up under the Bill, not just this body but other bodies, are truly independent of Government. As an indicator of the Government&#146;s intent, if those bodies are truly independent, we would expect them to be able to charge a fee. I have to say that based on all the evidence so far in Committee, it has not yet been established that they are truly independent&#151;far from it&#151;and we have criticised them for that. If they are not independent, we are not considering a fee but a substitution of vicarious taxation of the members of professions covered by the new body for recovery of costs.</p>

resolution will be garnered from the General Medical Council and the General Optical Council, as the Minister has admitted. That will have a direct impact on the fees charged by those bodies to their membership. The full GMC registration fee on the medical register will rise to &#163;390 per annum with effect from April this year, having been frozen at &#163;290 per annum since 2002. GOC registration stands at &#163;169 per year. My hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham (John Bercow), whom I see is still just in the Chamber, raised the essential question of what the costs were, and we heard that there will be a massive increase. According to the Minister, it will be &#163;11.5 million, which, by a quick calculation, means an extra &#163;100 per doctor. It is that sort of detail that my hon. Friend was trying to winkle out of the Minister to find out what extra costs to constituents and the professional community we are truly sanctioning.</p>

Currently, neither the GMC or GOC is registered for VAT, partly because of their charitable status; I hope that that is not news to hon. Members. However, the new office of the health professions adjudicator will immediately slap a 17.5 per cent. uplift on the fees payable to it, irrecoverable against the fees paid to the GMC or the GOC. The Minister should explain fully how the resolution will affect that arrangement. Where will the VAT loss fall, and upon whom?</p>

In addition to what is currently proposed to ensure that a fee is passed on vicariously to the members of the various professions involved&#151;because it is no longer an independent body in our view, we consider this to be a tax-raising power&#151;the Minister told us in Committee on Thursday that the establishment of the care quality commission as a successor body to the Healthcare Commission, the Commission for Social Care Inspection and the Mental Health Act Commission will cost &#163;7 million, as outlined in the regulatory impact assessment. The transition cost will be &#163;140 million, which includes the costs of redundancies, estate rationalisation and a planned reduction of operating costs. Creating responsible officers will cost between &#163;3.1 million and &#163;16.7 million per year, and extending direct payments will cost &#163;1.5 million to &#163;8 million a year.

 Although it is true that the Committee has not yet dealt with new clause 7, reference has been made to fees and costs in relation to the regulatory impact assessment, which the Minister has made available to the Committee.

The Minister was asked in Committee whether he could identify how much in those figures represented economy of scale savings from bringing three bodies into one and how much represented contributions from fees earned.

 In fairness to him, the Minister offered to send a letter setting out some of the financial parameters. I want to ensure that my hon. Friend thinks that he covered that and that it is adequate for the purposes of passing the resolution that we should not have received those details until after we have challenged the Government on whether it is the appropriate way forward.</p>

 My hon. Friend is exactly right. Notwithstanding the promise that the Minister made in Committee to give more clarification on the figures, it is difficult to make head or tail of them if we cannot disaggregate the fee contribution in the calculations that the Minister has offered. When he replies to my contribution, will he be so good as to elaborate on exactly how the fee-bearing side of the regulations will contribute to the broader figures in the regulatory impact assessment?</p>

 I am sure that the hon. Member for Tiverton and Honiton (Angela Browning) will know that the fees to which she referred are connected to the establishment of the new care quality commission. That is outwith the remit of this resolution, which deals with the independent adjudication of the medical professions. As the hon. Member for Eddisbury (Mr. O'Brien) reminded her, I promised to write to members of the Committee with more details of those costs, and I shall do so, but they are nothing to do with the resolution that we are debating today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o60"><a name="80115-0006.htm_para0"><a name="08011598000233">Given the amount of time that we have spent discussing this matter, I do not intend to detain the House further by responding to the many and, I have to say, mainly extraneous and inaccurate points made by the hon. Member for Eddisbury. I shall simply point out to him that we cannot debate them under new clause 7 in Committee until this resolution has been authorised.</p>

 I beg to move,</p>
<a name="80115-0006.htm_brev0"><a name="080115102000158"><ul><p class="tabletext">That the draft Payments into the Olympic Lottery Distribution Fund etc. Order 2007, which was laid before this House on 25th October, in the last Session of Parliament, be approved.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o62"><a name="80115-0006.htm_para2"><a name="080115102000003">I recently met two young Olympic hopefuls. One was an incredibly impressive young woman who gets up every morning and does two hours of swimming before school and two hours after school in pursuit of her dream of competing at the London Olympic games in 2012. The second is a young disabled athlete who is hoping to compete at table tennis, and whose father told me that even before there was the possibility of his son&#146;s going to the Olympics, the very fact of training transformed his confidence to such an extent that he now goes on training weekends without his carer&#151;something he would never have done before. Those are just two young people, but our Olympics will be an inspiration to a whole generation. It will be one of those events where hyperbole is justified. It will be a once-in-a-lifetime experience. It will bring the country together. It can transform Britain&#146;s reputation overseas. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o63"><a name="80115-0006.htm_para3"><a name="080115102000004">The Olympics can be all those things, but we have set ourselves a bigger goal: we want it to be the best Olympics ever. My right hon. Friend the Minister for the Olympics has put in place the best preparations ever seen for an Olympics at this stage; those are not my words, but those of Jacques Rogge, president of the International Olympic Committee. There are three building blocks to those preparations. First is a clear organisation with the right structure and world-class leadership&#151;we have that. Secondly, like any team, our success will depend on our cohesiveness and support&#151;and with 76 per cent. of the population backing the 2012 games, rising to 90 per cent. among young adults, we have that, too. The third element is a robust funding package, and that is exactly what we have. Last March, my right hon. Friend announced a &#163;9.325 billion public sector funding package for the games, including contingency funding to manage risks. Of that total, &#163;6.09 billion was identified for Olympic Delivery Authority costs. The remaining contingency funding will be released only if needed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o64"><a name="80115-0006.htm_para4"><a name="080115102000005">Cross-party consensus is undoubtedly important to speed our progress towards the best ever Olympics, but there is also, of course, a legitimate space for scrutiny and challenge. That is why my right hon. Friend provided Parliament with details of the ODA baseline budget in December, as soon as it was confirmed, and why she has agreed to provide every six months a full update of progress of the Olympic spend against the budget and the breakdown provided in December. The motion puts in place an important part of the funding package.

 Actually, that is not correct: we found &#163;11.2 million, I think, which is more than we were required to find by the bid for the capital of culture, which asked for &#163;10 million.

stories in the press this morning reporting pessimistic forecasts for growth in land values. The headline in this morning&#146;s story is highly misleading, because the Olympic budget does not rely on land sales&#151;there is no black hole in the Olympic budget. What has been said&#151;the Mayor said this as early as April last year&#151;is that we have to make estimates about the increase in land values. The prudent basis on which the London Development Agency has always made its assumptions is that values would grow at the rate of 6 per cent. But the Mayor also said in April that, given past trends in growth, it was possible to estimate much higher growth, up to 19 or 20 per cent. We are therefore confident that we would be able to repay the lottery if those levels of growth were achieved, but that does not create a black hole in the funding and there is nothing new about the story in the papers today. Those figures have been in the public domain for some time.</p>

 The Secretary of State suggests that the Olympic budget somehow remains intact, but the public at large see an overall package for the cost of the Olympics. It is not simply a matter of the budgetary figures; there is also the notion of repaying the lottery in the way that he has described. If land values fail to go up, the lottery will not be fully reimbursed. Therefore, our concern is that the financial package is incomplete. The budget may be intact, but that is not to say that the lottery will not be raided.</p>

It was not raised by 20 or 50 per cent., or even doubled: instead, it was nearly tripled, to &#163;9.3 billion. Did the Opposition withdraw our support for the Olympics, or say that it was a mistake to spend the extra money or to have bid for the games in the first place? No, we did none of that. Our support for the Olympics has been rock solid&#151;rather more so than the Secretary of State&#146;s. When the bid was being assembled, he was leading the charge against it, so we will take no lessons from him about the need for an Olympics consensus.</p>

responsibility to scrutinise the use of taxpayer&#146;s money, to protect the good causes for which the lottery was set up and to ensure that the games are on a sound financial footing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o81"><a name="80115-0007.htm_para13"><a name="080115102000055">In the spirit of bipartisanship, I spoke to the Secretary of State in the Lobby last week, and I also wrote to him last Thursday. I said that the Opposition would be prepared not to vote against the statutory instrument&#151;even though it is in large measure due to the Government&#146;s financial incompetence&#151;if the Government could reassure us on two matters.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o82"><a name="80115-0007.htm_para14"><a name="080115102000056">The first reassurance that we seek is that the Government will publish proper cash flow figures for the project. Those figures should set out the money that has been spent and contain cash flow forecasts. The Secretary of State will know that, if accounts are to be scrutinised properly, they must contain a profit and loss balance sheet and a cash flow analysis. With a project of this size, however, we can determine whether it is under proper financial control only if we are able to measure the rate at which cash is going out of the door and to compare that with the rate that was predicted. That is why the cash flow forecasts and outcomes are so important.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o83"><a name="80115-0007.htm_para15"><a name="080115102000057">In response to my request, the Secretary of State said that he was prepared to make available any figures that the Department had, but that he did not want to construct figures especially for us because that would involve a cost. He said nothing in his speech about cash flow forecasts for the way in which the Olympic budget will be spent, so are we to take it that no such forecasts have been prepared? If they do exist, will he publish them so that we can scrutinise the progress being made and the rate at which money is being spent?</p>

It was, as the Secretary of State says, a commitment that there would be no more raids on good causes. Why should good causes, which the lottery was set up to protect, suffer from Government financial miscalculations? We have to recognise that the good causes have suffered a triple whammy as a result of the Olympics. There was the original &#163;410 million; then the &#163;750 million from the special Olympics lottery games, which, it now transpires, will cannibalise much of the revenue that would have been raised through the normal lottery games that raise money for the good causes; and then the additional &#163;675 million.</p>

 I thank my hon. Friend. Anyone who has listened to this debate for the past 20 minutes will have been impressed by my hon. Friend&#146;s grasp of the statistics. Does he recognise that our biggest complaint in the past few years has been that the creation of the Big Lottery Fund has made lottery funding that much more opaque? That is one of the reasons why statistics have been bandied around in this debate. We need a clear reassertion of the four main heads of good causes. When the lottery came into being, there was the millennium fund. Does my hon.

 As ever, my hon. Friend has made an excellent point. I think that he is really saying that if the lottery were returned to its original four good causes we would not have a lot of the pain that we are suffering today. The structure that the Government have set up for the lottery gives the Minister the power to determine 50 per cent. of the money from lottery good causes. That has led to a lot of the problems.</p>

It is a pity, therefore, that in 2001 the Tories proposed extra lottery money for local authority-controlled museums and art galleries and, in the same year, &#163;5 million more to protect British heritage overseas. In 2005, they proposed more lottery money for village halls and parish churches and, in their last manifesto, &#163;750 million for their proposed club and school sports programme. Even their leader has been at it: in an interview in 2006, he suggested using the national lottery to fund his proposed national school leavers programme. They say one thing, but act rather differently.</p>

believed that the benefits that would accrue in terms of sport, culture, heritage, regeneration and tourism far outweighed the disbenefit of the cuts to the good causes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o110"><a name="80115-0009.htm_para1"><a name="080115102000125">We assumed that that would be the only time we would be asked to do that, but things have not worked out quite as we expected. Part of the package was the &#163;750 million to be raised by new Olympics-related lottery gains. Of that money, more than half&#151;59 per cent.&#151;was to come not as new money from ticket sales but from cannibalisation, as it were, as people switched from the games that supported the traditional good causes. That would have meant a loss of about &#163;450 million to the lottery good causes&#151;but as the recent report by the National Audit Office pointed out, the cannibalisation rate is much higher, at 77 per cent. That means that even the first agreement to cut money from the lottery good causes has involved an additional, unexpected cut of some &#163;135 million.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o111"><a name="80115-0009.htm_para2"><a name="080115102000126">I am not surprised that that figure has changed. I do not know if any other hon. Members have visited their local lottery distributors recently, but it is impossible to tell from the scratchcards whether they are supporting the Olympics or the traditional good causes. Only in very small print on the back of the cards, not visible to the people who buy them, does it say whether the money is going to the Olympics or to the other good causes. In the outlets that I have visited, a significantly higher proportion of cards were supporting the Olympics than the other good causes. I hope that the Secretary of State will see whether it is possible&#151;I understand that there are difficulties to do with the International Olympic Committee&#151;to make it clearer to those purchasing scratchcards which of the good causes, the Olympics or others, they are supporting.</p>

We now have on record an assurance, which we did not have last time, that there will not be any further raid on the lottery good causes to fund the Olympics.

Before the Minister for the Olympics jumps to her feet, I know that putting it like that is not fair because I have not compared like with like; nevertheless, she will accept that the figures have increased substantially.

That is why we have been in discussion with the Secretary of State, as has the hon. Member for South-West Surrey, and we recognise that others have as well. CCPR has put forward its suggestions in discussions with the Government, including the enhancement of the excellent community amateur sports club scheme through the application of gift aid to junior club subscriptions and the reduction of licensing fees.

change taxation on the national lottery to gross profit tax. We know that they were initially very sceptical about that, but I am delighted that the Treasury has now become agnostic about it, and we seem to be getting some support for the idea from the Department for Culture, Media and Sport. According to independent experts from PricewaterhouseCoopers, if such a change were to go ahead, something like &#163;400 million would go back to lottery good causes by 2019, and a lot of that money would be invested before the 2012 games. I am delighted that the Secretary of State has said that he will carry out a review, but I hope that we will have an absolute assurance in the winding-up speech that such a move will be implemented as quickly as possible if the review says that it would be positive for the Exchequer, because of the extra money for the taxpayer, and for lottery good causes. Thirdly, we asked the Secretary of State to examine what he called the grey areas of lottery-style games. Many people who play the national lottery know that a proportion goes towards supporting good causes. However, in recent years gambling operators have introduced lottery-style betting games, which, they admit, are intended to compete with the national lottery. They look like national lottery games, but they are run solely for commercial gain and they reduce the number of national lottery players. Independent experts have shown that if we can eliminate those games so that players switch back to the national lottery, it would mean, on a conservative estimate, an extra &#163;44 million a year&#151;more than &#163;500 million by 2019&#151;for good causes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o119"><a name="80115-0009.htm_para10"><a name="080115102000139">Fourthly, we asked for clarification of a memorandum of understanding between the Secretary of State and the Mayor of London. The House is well aware that the sale of land and buildings will follow the Olympics and Paralympics. We are all interested in knowing how much money that will generate. There has been much debate today, but the speculation is no different from that of many months ago. I would not like to judge which of the many experts is right about the eventual figure, but if there is more information at any stage, we would like to see it. However, the memorandum of understanding made clear the order in which money would be repaid to the lottery good causes, the LDA and the Mayor of London. I should like to have an assurance, which I have not yet received, that the memorandum of understanding is binding, and that no attempt will be made to try to change the way and the order in which money is paid out.</p>

If we add the possibility of additional money through the third Camelot licence, leading to between &#163;600 million and &#163;1 billion extra for good causes, and the modest but none the less welcome increase in grant in aid to various bodies, we now have a package that assures us that much of the money taken from good causes will go back to them. Indeed, if all our proposals are accepted, in due course they will get more than was taken from them, and more than &#163;400 million will be returned before the 2012 games. That is a good outcome of the discussions between us and the Secretary of State. On that basis, we are prepared to support the Government.</p>

 I will do my best to keep my remarks brief. As so often, it is a pleasure to follow the hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster). I agreed with much of what he said. As the Secretary of State knows, when the Government first decided to bid for London to host the 2012 games, I held the position now filled by my hon. Friend the Member for South-West Surrey (Mr. Hunt). At that time, I expressed the Conservative party&#146;s support for the Government&#146;s decision to bid. I remain of the view that it was the right thing to do, and that the Olympics will greatly benefit the country. The Secretary of State and the Minister for the Olympics occasionally interpret any criticism of the preparations for the games as a lack of support for their coming to London at all, so I put my support on record at the outset.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o123"><a name="80115-0009.htm_para14"><a name="080115102000146">I am encouraged by the evidence that we in the Select Committee have received that progress is on track so far. Although the costs have escalated, at least the timetable appears to have been observed. The Secretary of State and the Minister for the Olympics would have been encouraged had they joined us this morning when we took evidence from the five host boroughs and heard the enthusiasm with which their leaders spoke of the benefits that they saw coming to their part of London.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o124"><a name="80115-0009.htm_para15"><a name="080115102000147">However, if more than &#163;5 billion is being spent in an area, it is not surprising that the local people should expect quite a lot of benefits to come from it. The challenge for the Government has always been not just to ensure that there are benefits for that part of London, but to persuade the other parts of the country that they will benefit, too. In that respect, the order before us will not assist, because not only will there be no huge investments outside London, but money is being siphoned from the pot&#151;the national lottery&#151;from which other parts of the country might otherwise have benefited. That will jeopardise part of the soft legacy, which is the Government&#146;s aim, and it comes on top of the Department&#146;s recent decision to cut the amount of money going to VisitBritain, which will  <br>

jeopardise another part of the soft legacy of the Olympic games&#151;the tourism potential.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o125"><a name="80115-0009.htm_para16"><a name="080115102000148">When the Government originally drew up their funding package, it was to meet an estimated cost of &#163;2.375 billion, of which &#163;1.5 billion was intended to come from the lottery&#151;&#163;750 million from the new game, &#163;340 million from the sports distributors and &#163;410 million from the non-Olympic distributors. In the report that the Select Committee issued a year ago, we expressed concern about the impact that the original &#163;1.5 billion take would have on good causes, in particular sport. We quoted the Central Council of Physical Recreation, which my hon. Friend the Member for South-West Surrey (Mr. Hunt) has also quoted, which said that the move</p>
<a name="80115-0009.htm_brev3"><a name="080115102000173"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;would...reduce...funding available to all other aspects of community sport&#148;,</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o126"><a name="80115-0009.htm_para17"><a name="080115102000149">which would</p>
<a name="80115-0009.htm_brev4"><a name="080115102000174"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;undoubtedly be detrimental to achieving the lasting legacy of sporting participation&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o127"><a name="80115-0009.htm_para18"><a name="080115102000150">We also received evidence from the non-Olympic distributors, such as the Heritage Lottery Fund and Arts Council England, which expressed concern about the money going into the Olympic pot that would be lost to them. That was why the Select Committee concluded that any further transfer of funds out of the lottery to support the Olympics would penalise good causes yet further. We made it clear that that was not our preferred option.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o128"><a name="80115-0009.htm_para19"><a name="080115102000151">When the Secretary of State had to reveal a budget of &#163;9.325 billion&#151;a considerable extra cost, which had to be found from somewhere&#151;it was with some trepidation that we read reports that the extra would come from the lottery. It appears that the Minister for the Olympics achieved a better deal in her negotiations with the Treasury than some suggested she would. We should therefore be grateful that we are debating an order that will take only a further &#163;675 million from the lottery, and not an even bigger sum. However, there is no doubt that taking &#163;675 million, in addition to the original &#163;1.5 billion, will have a further detrimental effect. Indeed, that sum alone will result in &#163;420 million being taken from Big Lottery Fund, &#163;90 million from the Heritage Lottery Fund and &#163;63 million from Arts Council England. Those sums cannot be taken out without a detrimental effect on those bodies&#146; funding programmes. That will make it harder to sell the Olympic games to the other parts of the country, which are not seeing the immediate benefits from the investment in east London.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o129"><a name="80115-0009.htm_para20"><a name="080115102000152">At the time of the report last year, the Committee suggested that the rise in land values that would undoubtedly result from such investment should not benefit just the London Development Agency. We therefore very much welcomed the then Secretary of State&#146;s announcement, a few months later, that part of the money that would become available from the sale of that land in due course would be repaid to the lottery. As has been said in this debate, she set out a clear order of priorities for how it would be allocated.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o130"><a name="80115-0009.htm_para21"><a name="080115102000153">It appears, however, that some doubt has arisen over how much will be available. The Mayor&#146;s office, which gave evidence to the Committee this morning, dismissed the story in <i> The Times</i> and said that it had always been the case that the amount of money raised  <br>

from land sales could be between &#163;800 million and as much as &#163;3 billion. However, when I look at the memorandum of understanding I see no mention of the word &#147;if&#148; in relation to the land sales achieving the necessary &#163;1.8 billion to repay the London Development Agency and the lottery distributors. In fact, it uses clear language, stating:</p>
<a name="80115-0009.htm_brev5"><a name="080115102000175"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;the National Lottery income...will be re-paid&#148;,</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o131"><a name="80115-0009.htm_para22"><a name="080115102000154">and that the LDA will be reimbursed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o132"><a name="80115-0009.htm_para23"><a name="080115102000155">However much it is now suggested that this does not represent a new story, a degree of uncertainty that did not previously exist seems to apply to the likelihood of the lottery being reimbursed for its contribution. That is obviously a matter for concern. Even if the money is repaid in full, it seems unlikely that that will happen until about 2030. The lottery will therefore have to put up with a substantial hit for a considerable time, and it will not be a great reassurance to the bodies that hope to receive lottery funding to hear that the amount of money available will increase again by 2030.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o133"><a name="80115-0009.htm_para24"><a name="080115102000156">The one other concession that the Secretary of State has made this afternoon, which I strongly welcome, is his pledge that the Treasury will look again at the case for a gross profits tax for the national lottery. I am always slightly suspicious when I am told that a taxation change will increase not only the amount of revenue to the Exchequer but the amount available  to good causes&#151;but PricewaterhouseCoopers has apparently assured us that that would be the case, and that should be grounds for at least examining the idea. The Secretary of State has clearly been extremely persuasive in his discussions with the Treasury, so perhaps he could push his luck and ask whether it will reconsider its intention to have its tax take from the national lottery game. That money, too, could provide extra funding that could be better used elsewhere.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o134"><a name="80115-0009.htm_para25"><a name="080115102000157">I welcome the Secretary of State&#146;s concession, and I also strongly welcome his pledge that there will be no further raid on the national lottery. I hope that that will not be necessary, in any case. Of the &#163;9.375 billion, &#163;2.75 billion represents a contingency fund, and we all hope that that fund will not be fully drawn down. We are alarmed, however, by the evidence that has already been given by the permanent secretary in the Department, who stated that he expected that it might well all be necessary&#151;and the Minister has said that she cannot guarantee that the final figure might not prove even higher. We understand that she can offer no such guarantee. I regret the necessity for this order, as I still believe that the Government could have found other sources for the funding that would have been less damaging to the good causes, and I must express my strong hope that it will not be necessary to come back to this issue, either to raid the national lottery or to find some other source of funding because the bill has risen even higher than it is currently predicted to do.</p>

The other Opposition parties were totally silent, so it is perhaps not too surprising that they are not going to act to save those causes this evening. That euphoria has now long gone and there is now a healthy scepticism about everything to do with the Olympics. Thank goodness that at least the other Opposition parties are prepared occasionally to question the Olympic budget. Are we to believe that there will be no more black holes?

In our view it is vital that the lottery does not become a reservoir into which Government can dip when money is needed, or become the poor man&#146;s tax that some commentators have dubbed it, as that would inevitably affect its popularity and thus the amount of money that it is able to distribute to good causes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o147"><a name="80115-0010.htm_para12"><a name="080115125000031">Tonight is not the occasion on which to examine why the Olympic budget went so badly wrong. However, as the Minister for the Olympics will confirm, we co-operated closely with the Government over the London Olympic Games and Paralympic Games Bill, and helped them to get it through in record time. That earned us a commendation from the IOC. I hope the Minister will understand that, given the former Minister for Sport&#146;s countless assurances in Committee and on Report that the original budget was robust and deliverable, we were dismayed to discover that that was so dramatically not the case. For that reason, as well as any Opposition&#146;s democratic remit to hold the Government to account, it would be wrong for us not to seek reassurances over the new budget.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o148"><a name="80115-0010.htm_para13"><a name="080115125000032">The Minister&#146;s recent approach, particularly since November, has helped immeasurably, and I wish publicly to record my thanks to her for that. However, in order to build on that, we want three simple reporting mechanisms: first, a six-monthly report to Parliament; secondly, quarterly ministerial and shadow ministerial briefings; and, thirdly, monthly cash flow forecasts. I cannot see why any of those demands should cause the Government any problems. I am perfectly happy to receive those reports on Privy Council or confidential terms, if the release of any details might affect commercial sensitivities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o149"><a name="80115-0010.htm_para14"><a name="080115125000033">There is also the matter of the legacy, which is why the national lottery is so important. Without the lottery, the amount that can be done in legacy terms will be dramatically less than it would be otherwise. For that reason, I entirely welcome the Secretary of State&#146;s announcement&#151;or concession&#151;this afternoon that the lottery will not be hit again to pay for future cost overruns; I thank him for that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o150"><a name="80115-0010.htm_para15"><a name="080115125000034">Given that concession, for my party this debate comes down to one simple point: will the Government commit to the reporting mechanisms that I have just laid out&#151;a six-monthly report to Parliament, quarterly meetings at ministerial and shadow ministerial level, and a monthly cash flow forecast? If they can give us that assurance, despite our concerns over the budget and the national lottery, in recognition of the Secretary  <br>

of State&#146;s earlier concession and in the interests of maintaining the cross-party consensus that we have all worked so hard to achieve, we will not vote against the Government tonight.</p>

 This has been a good debate, with a frank airing of views from all parts of the Chamber. At least the Scottish National party is consistent. It opposed bidding for the games; it has opposed the Olympic games for the United Kingdom in London root and branch ever since the Government first made the proposition. It, therefore, will have to answer to the seven out of 10 people in Scotland who support the Olympic games. It will also have to answer to its talented young elite athletes who hope to represent Great Britain in Beijing and then to bring glory to Great Britain at the Olympic games in London.</p>

<p><a name="st_o222"><a name="080115125000036"><a name="80115-0010.htm_spnew11"><a name="080115125000639"><b>Barry Gardiner:</b>
 My right hon. Friend says that the SNP has been consistent, but does she recall that on 6 June 2005 the SNP claimed that it</p>
<a name="80115-0010.htm_brev0"><a name="080115125000596"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;gives full support to the London Olympic bid and wishes those leading the London 2012 Olympic bid the very best of luck&#148;?</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o151"><a name="80115-0010.htm_para16"><a name="080115125000037">That does not sound like consistency to me.</p>

<p><a name="st_o223"><a name="080115125000038"><a name="80115-0010.htm_spnew12"><a name="080115125000640"><b>Tessa Jowell:</b>
 My hon. Friend&#146;s excellent research has probably found a sotto voce endorsement by the SNP. However, the SNP is against the Olympic games, and I think it is fair to say that it is the only party in this House that holds that view.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o152"><a name="80115-0010.htm_para17"><a name="080115125000039">Let me begin with the substance of this evening&#146;s debate: the importance of the trade-off involving the Olympic games, and the decision to divert an extra &#163;675 million from the national lottery to the Olympics. The Government considered carefully before coming to the House with the proposal, but just as the Conservative party determined that the millennium would be a further good cause benefiting from the lottery for a period of time, so the Government agreed that the Olympics would be a sixth good cause: 20 per cent. of the national lottery was earmarked for the millennium, and a smaller proportion has been provided to the Olympics&#151;16 per cent. or 23 per cent. of the overall Olympic budget.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o153"><a name="80115-0010.htm_para18"><a name="080115125000040">The safeguards have been addressed by Members in all parts of the House. When I made the announcement in March about revised funding provision for the Olympics, we undertook that no existing lottery funding would be affected, that the Big Lottery Fund would honour its commitment to the voluntary and community sector, and that, in line with the memorandum of understanding, the &#163;675 million would be repaid through land sales. In this debate, we have dealt thoroughly with the prudent assumptions on which those calculations were made&#151;and the Mayor clearly set them out in April last year. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has also made clear the commitment that there will be no further diversion of funds from the lottery good causes to the Olympics.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o154"><a name="80115-0010.htm_para19"><a name="080115125000041">A point was made about legacy transformation. The costs for legacy transformation are provided for within the overall funding package, and the Mayor has already made a commitment of &#163;10 million towards the costs of running the Olympic park. Work is under way to establish governance arrangement for the legacy, the park and so forth. I can also give an assurance that  <br>

once its job is done in 2012, the Olympic lottery distributor will be wound up.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o155"><a name="80115-0010.htm_para20"><a name="080115125000042">Much has been said in the debate about the importance of cross-party support. That is critical to the success of the Olympics, but it must be proper cross-party support. The right to scrutinise and ask questions must not be surrendered, but there must also not be the kind of opportunistic flip-flop that we have witnessed this afternoon, and figures must not be misrepresented, such as those for the cost of the Olympic stadium, which have been carefully and meticulously explained to Opposition spokesmen. I hope that from this evening there will be a new resolution to make this cross-party consensus work properly, and to maintain proper scrutiny&#151;but to do so on an honest basis that reflects the information that has been provided to Members in briefings.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o156"><a name="80115-0010.htm_para21"><a name="080115125000043">We will provide six-monthly updates to Parliament and quarterly briefings to Opposition Members. Next week, the Olympic Executive will publish its first ever annual report, which will set the baseline for that, and I pay tribute to the Select Committee for its rigorous scrutiny in that regard. We will provide continuing and regular financial briefings to Opposition Front Benchers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o157"><a name="80115-0010.htm_para22"><a name="080115125000044">This matter should not be seen as a battle between the Olympics, arts, heritage and sport&#151;the debates on it in this House should not allow that. We decided to bid for the Olympics because we knew that it would give us an opportunity to enhance every aspect of our national life right across the United Kingdom. Through the cultural Olympiad, there will be events and celebrations across the country showcasing the British talent and creativity of which we are so proud, and the lives and opportunities of millions of children in this country will be transformed through sport&#151;particularly those of children living in some of the most deprived circumstances in the poorest parts of London in the boroughs most directly affected. Two thirds of the money that will be spent on the Olympic park will go on regenerating an area that has been wasteland for generations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o158"><a name="80115-0010.htm_para23"><a name="080115125000045">Tomorrow, we will launch a new business opportunities network, extending the practical opportunities for businesses right across the UK to be part of those economic opportunities. Those are the reasons why public support for the UK hosting the games is so high: the Olympics will enthral the nation and inspire a generation&#151;</p>

 In many ways, that betrays the problem with the Opposition&#146;s logic. The hon.

The conclusion of the budget review process, which the new clause mentions, will take some time, I would guess. The date for the ratification&#151;the agreed date by which all member states should incorporate the own resources decision into their domestic legislation&#151;is 1 January 2009, which is less than a year away.</p>

 I am extremely grateful to the Chief Secretary for giving way again. There is a fundamental point. Sir John Major once went to Edinburgh and agreed certain finance arrangements, and it was claimed that the whole of Parliament was bound by the Prime Minister&#146;s undertaking to European leaders. That cannot ever be the position. Parliament is the authority through which the decision is made.

 Given that the decision was negotiated some time ago, perhaps when the Government agreed to it they thought that they could afford to give away &#8364;10.5 billion of hard-pressed taxpayers&#146; money. However, they now cannot afford a decent pay rise, awarded by an independent commission, for the police and they are achieving record levels of borrowing and taxation.

 As the right hon. Gentleman knows, a very prudent decision was taken to increase public expenditure at a lower rate than predicted levels of growth in the economy.

I understand that it will go towards funding enlargement. A third question concerns the treaty&#146;s effect on duties on commodities, such as sugar, that are produced by non-member states.

The rebate at the centre of the argument was won by Mrs. Thatcher because she was strong, and it was conceded by the former Prime Minister in the weak days of his dying regime. If the Minister were forced to go back to Brussels because this House did not accept the dilution of the rebate, his position in negotiations for a better deal would be very strong.

(Mr. Lilley), that is the consequence of a policy of enlargement. It is not possible to argue that enlargement is a one-way process from which the UK gains no benefits. Later, I shall give the Committee figures showing that, already, British companies are doing significantly more trade with companies from the accession states. New opportunities have opened up for British business, as has happened after every round of enlargement, such as when Spain, Sweden and the Republic of Ireland joined the EU, so it is good for the British economy. That contrasts with the view often expressed by the Conservatives that it is a one-way street with no benefits for this country.</p>

 My right hon. Friend spoke briefly about the origins of the rebate. Was it not the case that Mrs. Thatcher was able to negotiate the rebate because the structure of the UK economy in those days was markedly out of line with the structure of the economies of France in particular, and of Germany? Those structural differences&#151;the differing proportions of GDP raised from the agriculture sector in contradistinction to that raised from industry and the service sector&#151;have changed, particularly in France and Germany. The rebate negotiated by Mrs. Thatcher and the basis on which it was negotiated were almost bound to change over time, as the economies of those other main rich western members of the EU changed.</p>

 My hon. Friend is absolutely correct. The point he urges me to move on to, as he did in his previous intervention, is how the decision that we are debating to some extent reforms the way in which the own resources decision is constructed. That is what this decision does. For example, the current arrangements for VAT-based contributions are amended in the own resources decision, with the maximum call-up rate reduced to 0.3 per cent. The effect of that is that member states&#146; residual contributions based on gross national income will increase, further developing the trend toward fair and transparent contributions. People might say that that is only a small step forward, but that is how we have to approach such matters. We make progress where we can.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o176"><a name="80115-0012.htm_para1"><a name="080115125000474">The decision also contains some reform of the common agricultural policy. That, too, is welcome, but it is clear that this country does not believe that the reform is anywhere near enough. That is why we secured the overall budget review as part of the overall package. It was clear at the time that none of the package was agreed until all of it was agreed. There was no pick-and-mix option.</p>

 May I correct the Chief Secretary on a point of fact? The EU had only 12 member states at the time of the Fontainebleau agreement, since when we have had several rounds of enlargement and continued with the same rebate mechanism. There was no conditionality based on enlargement to rich or poor countries during that period. The present proposal is a wholly new departure, which flies in the face of the assurance that the then Prime Minister gave the House:</p>

 We have been over this ground already today. We have preserved the basis of the rebate. The hon. Gentleman is right to correct me. Although I was 14 at the time, I remember Spain joining the EU shortly after&#151;in 1986, I think it was. However, I hope that he accepts that the spirit of my remarks is correct: that the rebate was an acceptable way of calculating fair contributions for the members of the European Union at that time. After the accession of Spain and then the Republic of Ireland, proportionately more structural funding was diverted to those countries to fund their economic development, and the same principle now applies to the accession countries of the former eastern bloc.</p>

 I am mystified by what the Chief Secretary is saying. In previous enlargements, the EU admitted both rich countries, such as Finland and Sweden, and much poorer countries, such as Spain, Portugal, Greece and Ireland, yet the arrangements for the rebate were not changed. The whole premise of his argument&#151;that we have to change the rebate as a condition of enlargement is, if I may say so, absolute rubbish. His Government are committing&#151;to quote the figure that the Library has given us&#151;&#163;7.4 billion over the planned period for absolutely nothing, other than to advertise their utter weakness.

 The hon. Gentleman is advancing a pub argument. He knows that such matters are periodically reviewed by all members of the EU and that the deal that this country secured during the process of negotiation was for approximately &#8364;160 billion less than the European Commission originally proposed. Let me ask him a direct question. Did he believe that there would be a cost to EU enlargement? Did he think that the countries of western Europe would have to make a financial contribution to the enlarged European Union? I reckon that when his right hon.

 I am grateful to the Chief Secretary for cross-examining me on that matter.

 The hon. Gentleman is entitled to reach that opinion. I said clearly that the own resources decision maintains the basis of the rebate as it was first agreed among the 12 countries of the EU, which shortly thereafter became 15. That rebate has remained in place ever since, and stays in place on that basis. It is calculated on all spending&#151;agricultural and non-agricultural spending&#151;in the EU 15.

We have secured the rebate, which will increase in value throughout the course of this financial perspective, and, at the same time, we shall have a fair way of funding the enlargement of the European Union.

 May I clarify whether the rebate arrangement is the same as it was at the time of Second Reading: the rebate is a proportion of the net amount that we hand over to the European Union?

 I think that the United Kingdom should be a full member of the European Union. One of the very few good things that the John Major Government did was to decide, after winning the debate in the European Union, to go for widening rather than deepening&#151;that is, for more members rather than closer co-operation between members. That position was taken initially only by the United Kingdom, with some support from Denmark. What surprises me is the following, on which I would like my right hon. Friend to comment. It is intellectually coherent to say, &#147;We are against enlargement&#148;, as it is to say, &#147;We are in favour of enlargement&#148;&#151;as I am&#151;&#147;but recognise that in reality there will be a cost to that enlargement&#148;. There is indeed a cost to that enlargement. However, does my right hon.

By historical standards, the accessions of first the A8 countries and then the further two former eastern bloc countries are completely different, and when taking such a historic step the European Union has to look again at what it does.

 I shall make progress and get some facts on the record about the effects of the own resources decision. Appropriation ceilings will be frozen at the levels set for the 2000 to 2006 budget period. The ceiling on annual appropriations for payments is 1.24 per cent. of EU gross national income, and for appropriations for commitments it is 1.31 per cent. of EU GNI. Appropriations for commitments are forecast to fall below 1 per cent. of EU GNI during the budget period.</p>

For the same period, gross reductions in GNI contributions of &#8364;605 million per annum for Netherlands and of &#8364;150 million per annum for Sweden are introduced. Both those amounts are in 2004 prices.</p>

 Would I be right in thinking that the way in which Netherlands and Sweden were able to negotiate the figures that my right hon. Friend has just given relates precisely to the point that I made earlier&#151;the structure of their economies has changed, but all 27 economies in the EU are different, and that must be taken into account, as the UK economy has been, in negotiations with our partners?</p>

 That is absolutely the point, and the nature of the complex negotiations that were finalised in 2005. The changes that I am outlining show how we have had to be sensitive to the position of other countries, such as Netherlands which, even after the own resources decision, is still the largest net contributor in percentage terms to the budget per capita. It is important that we keep working to make sure that the budget is as fair as possible. It leaves the UK a mid-ranking net contributor.</p>

 The Minister said earlier that we were not taking into account the way that the EU operates. The problem for him is that we understand far too well how the EU operates. It is a fraudulent and corrupt organisation. He has said in the past that he is concerned about the level of fraud in the EU budget. My constituents cannot understand why he does not say to the European Union, &#147;You are not going to get one more penny from the UK until you sort yourselves out and make sure that all the money that you are spending is properly accounted for.&#148;</p>

 The hon. Gentleman makes a very big statement for somebody who represents a party that claims to wish to remain a member of the European Union. He says that it is a fraudulent and corrupt organisation. I do not agree. In its latest report the European Anti-Fraud Office estimates fraud levels of 0.06 per cent. in agricultural spending, 0.41 per cent. in structural fund spending and 0.03 per cent. in pre-accession spending. That is not to say that there should be any complacency on these matters, or that the European Court of Auditors has not shone a light on aspects that could be much better. There is an argument about accounting standards and ensuring that they are very strong. It is quite another thing to say that the European Commission or the European Union&#151;I do not recall which the hon. Gentleman said&#151;is a fraudulent and corrupt organisation. That is a very large statement with which I do not agree, and with which I do not believe his party agrees.</p>

Finally, the additional UK contribution resulting from the reduction in allocated expenditure is limited to &#8364;10.5 billion, in 2004 prices, over the period from 2007 to 2013.</p>

 It was not my original intention to speak, at least in any substantial way, in the debate on clause 1 stand part. The Opposition are placed in some difficulty by the structure of the Bill. It has only one substantive clause, which contains only four substantive words. They are &#147;and 7th June 2007&#148;. I took the view, for better or for worse, that seeking to amend clause 1 was tantamount to voting against the Bill on Third Reading. Indeed, that is what we shall do, if our attempt to amend the Bill through the insertion of new clause 1, which I hope we will have an opportunity to debate later, is unsuccessful.</p>

To say so is simply wrong. The Government supported EU enlargement; after it was secured, they went in to negotiate the &#147;own resources&#148; decision on the basis that the rebate was not up for grabs.</p>

 My hon. Friend has made his point most eloquently. Will he go on to explain why the rebate is necessary? It is not necessary just because of the imbalance of agricultural expenditure throughout the European Union, but because we trade a disproportionately high share of GDP. We import many products that are instantly exported to the European Union. They attract tariff duties that become payable to the European Union, and we suffer as a consequence. As trade has grown, has not the case for the rebate continued to grow?</p>

 I am grateful to my hon. Friend, who has saved me the trouble of setting out the case for the UK rebate. We had a wonderful cross-party consensus. We Conservatives believe that the UK rebate is fully justified and non-negotiable; on 25 May 2005, the then Prime Minister told us that the UK rebate was fully justified and non-negotiable. One would think in the ordinary course of events that there would not be a difficulty. Unfortunately, however, things did not turn out that way.</p>

Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Rob Marris) told us a few minutes ago would be completely untenable. The Government supported the enlargement of the European Union&#151;indeed, they were a passionate advocate of such enlargement&#151;but, to use the former Prime Minister&#146;s words, they believed that the UK rebate was fully justified and non-negotiable. As we try to have a sensible discussion this afternoon, I hope that we will hear no more nonsense about the change to the rebate being an inevitable part of a deal to secure enlargement. Indeed, I suggest that the only enlargement at stake in Brussels in December 2005 was that of the former Prime Minister&#146;s income and ego, if he is in future appointed President of the European Union, as some have suggested.</p>

The Government moved their position and said that they would consider a concession on the rebate, but only in the context of meaningful and significant reform of the EU budget&#151;particularly of the common agricultural policy. The then Prime Minister said that if we got rid of the CAP and changed the reason why the rebate was there, the case for the rebate would change. I do not think that any Conservative Member would disagree with that. For that reason, the principal thrust of our argument this evening will be to try to improve the Bill and put some backbone back into the Government&#146;s negotiating  <br>

 The hon.

So the answer to the question is no: I do not believe that enlargement would have been possible without an increase in costs to the United Kingdom, and that increase will be borne. However, the Government are asking us to bear a larger increase in costs than would otherwise have been the case, because of the sacrifice of the rebate. I put the question back to the hon.

 I do not know much about the hon. Gentleman&#146;s former working life, although he knows a bit about mine. I have spent many hours of my working life in negotiations. In negotiations, people start with a position, and sometimes with a reserve position. Sometimes, in life, politics or commercial negotiations&#151;I was doing the latter&#151;people learn something and their position changes.

If we fail to succeed in our argument for new clause 1, I shall ask my right hon. and hon. Friends to vote against the Bill on Third Reading. I say that because voting against clause 1 stand part at this point would essentially have the same effect as voting against the Bill on Third Reading. Therefore, I do not intend to divide the House on clause 1 stand part.</p>

<p><a name="st_o323"><a name="080115125000568"><a name="80115-0014.htm_spnew0"><a name="080115125001110"><b>Mr. Austin Mitchell (Great Grimsby) (Lab):</b>
 I have a dreadful feeling that this discussion, which should be about value for money and whether we are paying over the odds to belong to the European Union, is degenerating into the old pro or anti-Europe argument, with those who are enthusiastic about Europe saying, &#147;Pay up&#151;give &#145;em the money, Barney!&#148;, while those who are more critical and sceptical, such as my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, South-West (Mr. Davidson), say that this is a bad deal. And it is a bad deal.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o206"><a name="80115-0014.htm_para4"><a name="080115125000569">The meat of the discussion is in clause 1. That is the meat of the Bill, unless we are going to fight over the short title, which would seem a rather pointless exercise. It is important to recognise that the meat of this debate on the calculation of the European correction is the generosity shown towards Europe by our previous Prime Minister, who seems to have ended his period in office with extraordinarily generous impulses towards Europe, one of which was detailed in the newspapers this morning: a commitment to provide 60 per cent. of energy generation through renewables in accord with European totals. It is a total that we cannot reach, and it is going to be incredibly expensive even to move towards reaching it, but he committed himself to it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o207"><a name="80115-0014.htm_para5"><a name="080115125000570">That is irrelevant to this Bill, as I am sure that you are about to tell me, Mrs. Heal, but what is relevant is his generosity over the rebate. Until that point, we had been told that it was inviolate and sacred, and that it would be there for ever to recognise Britain&#146;s unique situation and contribution, but suddenly it was breached. The interesting question for me is what made our previous Prime Minister so generous on his long march to the Union pour un Mouvement Populaire, fighting against the Socialist candidates in the municipal elections. Was that breach agreed by the Cabinet before the Prime Minister negotiated it? Did the Cabinet authorise the Prime Minister to make that concession? Was it told about it later, or did authorise it before the negotiations started? We need to know that, and we also need to know what the cost will be.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o208"><a name="80115-0014.htm_para6"><a name="080115125000571">I was delighted to hear the Chief Secretary say that the figures will be published. I hope that they will be published annually, because the British people need to know what they are contributing towards Europe and what this institution is costing them. We are told that the money is to pay for enlargement. We already pay over the odds to belong to the club in the first place. There have been certain disagreements about the scale  <br>

of the figures, but those I have had calculated for me show that we are now paying &#163;10 billion a year gross&#151;not euros&#151;and &#163;4 billion a year net. Money comes back to us for projects approved and supported by the EU that we would not necessarily want in the first place, but we do get a return. By 2013, under clause 1, we will be paying &#163;20 billion a year gross under clause 1, and &#163;6 billion a year net.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o209"><a name="80115-0014.htm_para7"><a name="080115125000572">We are talking about billions here, and an increased contribution of up to &#163;3 billion chucked in just like that. We are fighting the police for a measly &#163;30 million, but we are giving away, on this generous impulse of our previous Prime Minister, up to &#163;3 billion by 2013. My right hon. Friend the Chief Secretary told us that that was for enlargement, and part of it is, but it is also for a lot of other purposes decided by the European Community and not by us. It is only partially for enlargement in any case. If we accept this breach in the rebate, to which we agreed to sustain the enlargement of the European Community that we want&#151;wider, not deeper&#151;are we preparing to say, when the enlargement includes Turkey, that we must agree to another reduction and carving of the rebate? I do not want to say that, and we should not be committed to saying it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o210"><a name="80115-0014.htm_para8"><a name="080115125000573">It is a question of money. I think that my figures are accurate, but I hope that the figures will be published annually so that people know what the Bill means to this country, and so that they know how much they as taxpayers are paying to sustain membership of this institution. It is not our only contribution, of course; we are paying &#163;1.8 billion for other programmes. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development calculates that we pay &#163;15 billion to belong to the common agricultural policy&#151;a policy that at every election every party has said will be fundamentally reformed, but it never has been. That policy was to be reformed fundamentally as a condition of our agreeing to the reduction of the rebate, but it cannot be reformed until 2013 in any case, when I have no doubt it will be sustained.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o211"><a name="80115-0014.htm_para9"><a name="080115125000574">Those are the sorts of contributions we make, and if we add the cost of regulations, we find that membership of this institution costs us about &#163;40 billion to &#163;50 billion a year. I would like those calculations to be made public every year so that we know what is going on, and what we are paying. I would also like them to be calculated in terms of the effect on GDP. The contribution is going to be about 0.5 per cent. of GDP. We are struggling as a party to get an increase in GDP up from a measly 2.5 per cent. This year it will be substantially lower than 2 per cent. but we are accepting an increase in the 0.5 per cent. of GDP contribution we pay to belong to the EU. We need to know the figures because any loss to GDP is cumulative; it goes up all the time. The payment is also a payment across the exchanges. I know that the previous Prime Minister is making a magnificent effort to close the balance of payments through his earnings in the United States, but that will not be enough to deal with the fact that the deficit is now running at about 5 per cent. of GDP. We are adding to it through this increase in the contributions set out in the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o212"><a name="80115-0014.htm_para10"><a name="080115125000575">The question we face tonight is one of whether the increase is worth the money. Should we support this increase in contributions to the EU? The new clause  <br>

proposed by the Conservatives, which we shall discuss later, is worthy and well worth accepting. At this stage, I can say only that we are not getting value for money, and that the contribution is not worth making. We are paying over the odds to belong to a club that is doing serious damage to us anyway, and we should not agree to this contribution. I certainly cannot vote for it.</p>

 Like the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond), I had not intended to speak in the stand part debate and was waiting for the interesting discussion of the new clause. However, unlike him, I do not intend to spend 25 minutes saying what I had not otherwise thought it necessary to say.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o213"><a name="80115-0014.htm_para11"><a name="080115125000577">I shall make a few brief comments on our position. I was provoked by the Financial Secretary, who came in with all guns blazing, telling us that it was make-up-your-mind time. The implication of his remarks was that anybody who wanted to exercise parliamentary scrutiny or was critical of the budget settlement was somehow anti-Europe or anti-enlargement. That is clearly wrong. Liberal Democrats are greatly in favour of the European project, greater participation and enlargement. However, we believe that the settlement that the Government reached is not good and we do not understand why we should vote for it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o214"><a name="80115-0014.htm_para12"><a name="080115125000578">I do not agree with many of the things that the hon. Member for Glasgow, South-West (Mr. Davidson) says about the European Union, but he succinctly summarised the issue in an intervention. It is possible to believe that enlargement is necessary, desirable and in the British interest, and that economic and financial consequences are necessary, which means accepting that countries should not continue to support the UK, yet be critical of other aspects of the European budget settlement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o215"><a name="80115-0014.htm_para13"><a name="080115125000579">The key point, to which we shall revert when we debate the new clause, is that the previous Prime Minister either did not perceive or would not act on the link between the British rebate and future negotiations on the agricultural budget. The reason for that is a mystery. Doubtless, historians will tell us why he was unable to use that link and that leverage. Not only those on Opposition Benches but the current Prime Minister was unhappy about the previous Prime Minister&#146;s actions. Leaks from the Treasury made it clear that the current Prime Minister was furious that proper, tough financial negotiation was not taking place. It is important to stress that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o216"><a name="80115-0014.htm_para14"><a name="080115125000580">We will ascertain shortly whether new clause 1 makes it technically possible to retrieve the position. I do not know&#151;I have an open mind and I will listen to the debate. I simply wanted to intervene now to make it clear that being pro-Europe and in favour of enlargement and of Britain&#146;s adjusting its contribution to take account of that does not mean that we support the Bill and the settlement. It was a bad deal and, unless something happens during the debate on the new clause, we will vote against it.</p>

 I welcome the Chief Secretary&#146;s willingness to take so many interventions because that allowed us to hear more about the Government&#146;s position.

our relationship with Europe&#148;. If, every time Ministers go off on our behalf to discuss matters in Europe and come back with a deal that is presented to Parliament for a decision, we cannot reject it because it would result in a complete breakdown of our relationship, we have effectively no parliamentary scrutiny and Ministers are self-employed. We should not accept such a line for a moment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o217"><a name="80115-0014.htm_para15"><a name="080115125000582">The fact that the previous Prime Minister agreed the settlement does not necessarily bind us for all time.

Let us take the monthly commute between Brussels and Strasbourg, with all the boxes in the lorries and so on. We do not have to accept that as the price of enlargement. We could have enlargement without the continuation of those elements. The Government&#146;s inability to negotiate them away is a cause for condemnation.</p>

That is probably true. However, I do not know whether the Chief Secretary or his advisers have ever been negotiators, but I suspect that the Commission was adopting the old stance of trying for 10 per cent. and being prepared to settle for 5 per cent. The Commission&#146;s asking for more money and the Government&#146;s beating it down a bit is not an enormous cause for self-congratulation. The Commission made a bid for more money&#151;that is what commissions do. Of course, the Commission wants more money&#151;it is a self-aggrandising organisation. The fact that it is spendthrift and extravagant does not mean that we must accept everything it proposes.</p>

Of course, a better deal was possible. We tend to get movement from the European Union only in times of crisis and difficulty. Rejecting the budget and showing that we are not prepared to accept what the Government have accepted is for the Government&#146;s own good.

 My hon. Friend deserves some credit for being hyperactive in defence of the Chief Secretary. It is noticeable that the Chief Secretary has more officials than Members supporting him. Only one Member and a part-time Member support him&#151;that shows the support that he enjoys on the Labour Benches.

 Yes, I do accept that France&#146;s net contribution will grow more quickly than the UK&#146;s, but I also accept that France&#146;s net contribution per head is less than the UK&#146;s. Furthermore, I am aware that France is the largest recipient of EU largesse, albeit not in terms of the balance between incomings and outgoings, but in terms of the amount that it receives. We should also recognise that EU funding is a transfer of money to particular groups from particular groups. One of the reasons I am so hostile to the way in which the EU budget is currently constructed is that the money comes from people in my constituency, who pay higher food prices than they would otherwise, and goes to wealthy farmers who neither need nor deserve it.

 Again, however, would my hon. Friend not accept that spending on the common agricultural policy will fall as a percentage of the overall cake during this financial perspective?</p>

 I return to my original point: the deal is not nearly as bad as it could have been, but it is not as good as it should be. I did not join the Labour party to settle for second best. I wanted to see the best that was possible, both for my people and for the area that I represent. I do not believe that what we have been offered is a good deal: rejecting it is the way to a better deal, which is why I intend to do so.</p>

<p><a name="st_o334"><a name="080115138000003"><a name="80115-0014.htm_spnew11"><a name="080115138000708"><b>Mr. Redwood:</b>
 I shall keep my remarks brief, because once again the Government are not allowing us proper time to deal with the matters before us&#151;clause 1 and the very important new clause 1, which we hope will be moved shortly. However, I cannot let the Chief Secretary get away with the disgraceful arguments that he has produced this evening.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o223"><a name="80115-0014.htm_para21"><a name="080115138000004">The Chief Secretary first suggested that Mrs. Thatcher used to negotiate and reach compromises, and that that was entirely comparable to the negotiation, sell-out and giveaway that he has again announced to the House. Let us compare the two negotiations. Mrs. Thatcher went to a Community in which the other 11 countries had no interest in letting us keep more of our money. Any one of them could have vetoed her proposal that we should have a rebate. She managed to talk them round from 11-one down to 12-nil in favour, because she had to win by a unanimous vote.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o224"><a name="80115-0014.htm_para22"><a name="080115138000005">All that the current Government had to do when they went to Brussels was say, &#147;We have a veto and we are not going to give away what Margaret Thatcher so wisely and brilliantly won for the United Kingdom,&#148; but they could not even do that. They gave in under pressure and said, &#147;Oh deary me, no, it would be quite wrong of us to use our veto. We&#146;d love to shell out &#8364;10.5 billion over the first period and much more over subsequent periods, because we now realise that we shouldn&#146;t use the veto and we&#146;re here to give in.&#148; The Opposition are delighted that the Chief Secretary gave way so much in this debate, but we are unhappy that Mr. Blair and others gave way so much when they completed mishandled the negotiations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o225"><a name="80115-0014.htm_para23"><a name="080115138000006">Labour colleagues of the Chief Secretary are present who believe that the sterling equivalent of that &#8364;10.5 billion would be much better spent on public services, which they greatly revere. There are also those on the Conservative Benches, such as me, who believe that, in the light of all the money wasted in public services, that &#8364;10.5 billion should be given back to British taxpayers, who have paid all too dearly for the Government&#146;s inefficiency and their bad negotiations in Europe.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o226"><a name="80115-0015.htm_para0"><a name="080115138000007">The Chief Secretary tells us that we should regard the deal as a negotiating triumph, because although the Government gave away the veto that had been so brilliantly negotiated by a predecessor Prime Minister, they achieved a smaller rate of increase in the budget than the Chief Secretary apparently thinks we achieved 13 years ago. It may be that the Government achieved a smaller rate of increase, but what matters is that the budget increased so much in the early Labour years, after the end of the Tory years, that any increase would be unacceptable. The Chief Secretary cannot get away  <br>

from the fact that the budget that he is recommending is massively higher than that which was recommended by Mr. Major. For that reason alone I cannot accept it, because it is too big a burden on British taxpayers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o227"><a name="80115-0015.htm_para1"><a name="080115138000008">We then heard the myth, which the Government put about, that the proposal is essential for those countries in eastern Europe, which would otherwise be deprived. As my hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond) pointed out, however, enlargement was agreed without the new variant. If we had dug in and used our veto, enlargement would still have happened, but we would not have had to make a disproportionately large contribution to that increased spending in the territories entering through enlargement. Some of the other rich countries of western Europe should also have continued to make a bigger contribution relative to ours, for the reasons that my hon. Friends have already set out.</p>

 I hope that right hon. Friend will not ignore the Chief Secretary&#146;s other two specious arguments. The first was that the deal could have been worse if the Commission had had its way&#151;a suggestion that represents the last resort of the scoundrel. The other was that any objection to what has been negotiated is somehow improper and that the House should not scrutinise the deal that was done. That is the Vichy argument, which has been used by malevolent or misguided Ministers for years in selling this country short.</p>

<p><a name="st_o336"><a name="080115138000010"><a name="80115-0015.htm_spnew1"><a name="080115138000710"><b>Mr. Redwood:</b>
 I am grateful for those extra points. I should like to make some additional ones, to finalise my critique of the Chief Secretary&#146;s position.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o228"><a name="80115-0015.htm_para2"><a name="080115138000011">The Chief Secretary implied that eastern European countries would be short-changed. That is not true. He also assumed that all the EU spending in those countries will be worth while, but as we know, much of it has been shown to be inefficient, wasteful or even fraudulent by the accounts or by the auditors&#146; assessment of them. I fear that there will be more such instances in future years. I am sure that the Chief Secretary will be unable to say now that there will be no more such practices, so we may find ourselves financing more unsatisfactory, unnecessary, inefficient or even fraudulent programmes, which my electors are decreasingly in favour of doing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o229"><a name="80115-0015.htm_para3"><a name="080115138000012">Finally, the Chief Secretary said that we must understand that we will get more trade for British companies out of enlargement and the greater prosperity of eastern European countries. Of course we will, but that is not contingent on giving away our veto and our budget position. Indeed, I would argue that the main reasons for getting more trade from those countries will apply to non-EU members as well as to EU members. Those reasons are the free trade in the world as a whole, through the general agreement on tariffs and trade, and the fact that some of those eastern European states have wisely decided to set much lower tax rates and create a much more favourable climate for enterprise than this Government are creating for the British companies that have to compete with them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o230"><a name="80115-0015.htm_para4"><a name="080115138000013">The Chief Secretary should not suggest that what was negotiated is a great triumph. It was a disgraceful sell-out, and in contrast to the excellent negotiations  <br>

 I shall do my best to respond to some of the points that have been raised, and I shall do so briefly, because there is a desire in the Committee to move on to new clause 1, and I do not want to detain it too long.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o231"><a name="80115-0015.htm_para5"><a name="080115138000015">I assure the hon. Member for South Holland and The Deepings (Mr. Hayes) that my motivations for putting forward the arguments that I have made do not include malevolence. Nor was it my intention to appear arrogant at the start of the debate, if that is how hon. Members interpreted my contribution. In introducing the discussion, I was simply pointing out that it is not possible to go back and ask for small changes here and there, and for a different own resources decision. Essentially, my point was that there should be proper parliamentary scrutiny of the Government&#146;s actions. However, the way in which business is done is that the Government negotiate on behalf of the country, and the House has the opportunity to accept or reject what they have negotiated. That is the opportunity that hon. Members have this evening, and rightly so. I was simply saying at the beginning that we are not engaged in line-by-line considerations, but deciding whether to give an in-principle endorsement of the deal before us.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o232"><a name="80115-0015.htm_para6"><a name="080115138000016">My hon. Friend the Member for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell), who is no longer in his place, asked whether the deal was worth the money. I think that he was really asking about our membership of the European Union in overall terms. The tenor of some of the contributions to this debate was that the EU is a one-way street&#151;that the money goes in and nothing comes back the other way. However, it is important to see how this country&#146;s trade with the EU has increased significantly over recent years. That trade now accounts for 56 per cent. of British trade, and it accounted for 63 per cent. of British goods exports in 2006, totalling &#163;150 billion. I could go through a whole range of examples showing that our economy and jobs benefit from this country&#146;s membership of the European Union.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o233"><a name="80115-0015.htm_para7"><a name="080115138000017">I shall go directly to the question of enlargement, as it is a key theme of our proceedings this evening. Each enlargement of the EU has seen prosperity grow further. When Spain joined, and when Sweden joined, we saw our exports to those countries increase by about a quarter. As a result of such accessions, we have seen direct benefits to British business, British jobs and the British economy. Since the accession of the A8 countries, we have also seen a major increase in UK exports to those countries, totalling some &#163;6.4 billion in 2005, which is up 151 per cent. This process benefits the British economy.</p>

has deepened democracy in countries such as Portugal and Spain, which have emerged from under the yoke of fascism, and in eastern Europe, which has recently emerged from under the yoke of Stalinist communism. That is good not only for the people who live in those countries but for the people of the United Kingdom.</p>

<p><a name="st_o339"><a name="080115138000019"><a name="80115-0015.htm_spnew4"><a name="080115138000713"><b>Andy Burnham:</b>
 I entirely agree. The benefits of the decision that the European Union has taken on helping those economies to grow will have real dividends for this country for many decades to come, following this debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o234"><a name="80115-0015.htm_para8"><a name="080115138000020">I want to respond to a couple of the other points that were raised in the debate. The right hon. Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood) made a few rather cruel sideswipes about my financial acumen that I felt were a tad unjust. He questioned whether I had understood the maths relating to a 22 per cent. increase in the overall European budget in 1994. I assure him that I can understand that the budget was significantly smaller when that decision was taken. I accept that; I understand it. Let us put that point beyond doubt and on the record.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o235"><a name="80115-0015.htm_para9"><a name="080115138000021">The right hon. Gentleman watches and questions public spending in great detail. I read his blog, and I see what he says. Would he ever feel comfortable with a 22 per cent. increase in any public sector budget? That is not the sort of thing that he would normally advocate. My maths are pretty okay, actually, and I want to ask him whether he can recall whether Britain&#146;s net contributions in that period went up by a similar order. Was there not a significant increase, albeit on a smaller base, for Britain? Was not there a significant percentage increase in Britain&#146;s net contributions? <i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> He says that he does not know. Perhaps I can help him. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o236"><a name="80115-0015.htm_para10"><a name="080115138000022">The percentage increase in our contributions from 1994 to 1999 was an increase in gross costs to the UK of&#151;wait for it&#151;73.4 per cent. There is a bit of a difference, really. Okay, they were different times, and it was a smaller European Union and a smaller budget, but let us get some facts on the record. Let us have some long memories in this debate, rather than a few short ones.</p>

<p><a name="st_o340"><a name="080115138000023"><a name="80115-0015.htm_spnew5"><a name="080115138000714"><b>Mr. Lilley:</b>
 On the question of putting facts on the record, the right hon. Gentleman&#146;s Government have already put it on record that the net contribution of the UK as a percentage of its own total managed expenditure is set to rise from 0.64 per cent. to 0.96 per cent. by 2010. That is a 50 per cent. increase in the share of our expenditure that is going to Europe. If he has got a grip on these matters, why is he not keeping that amount down, rather than putting it up?</p>

<p><a name="st_o341"><a name="080115138000024"><a name="80115-0015.htm_spnew6"><a name="080115138000715"><b>Andy Burnham:</b>
 I have referred to these figures before in the debate. The net contribution is published in the pre-Budget report and again in the Budget, and that is a forecast of payments that the country will make. The figures have been set out quite clearly. I do not have the pre-Budget report to hand, but from memory I think that the net contributions over the course of the spending review that we are about to enter are about &#163;5.5 billion, and will stay at roughly that level over the spending period.</p>

not well enough. I accept much of what he said. It is his right as a Member of the House to believe that this is not a good enough deal for this country. That is his prerogative. I would say, however, that if we consider all the elements of the deal, we see that it does the job.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o238"><a name="80115-0015.htm_para12"><a name="080115138000026">What are those elements? They include a rebate that will rise rather than fall during this financial perspective. That sounds pretty good to me. That is within the context of an overall budget that is significantly lower than was originally proposed. The amount spent on the common agricultural policy over the period will fall in value from &#8364;55 billion to &#8364;51 billion in 2004 prices. The British and French net contributions will come into rough parity in that period, which is an important step. As my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, South-West acknowledged, the net contributions that France will make will increase at a significantly faster rate in this financial perspective than they have done previously. Furthermore, we have secured a budget review, which the commissioner has said will open up a consideration in which there will be &#147;no taboos&#148;. Everything will be up for consideration, and we shall be able to secure further progress as part of that review.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o239"><a name="80115-0015.htm_para13"><a name="080115138000027">The allegation from the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond) was that we had meekly accepted everything that was said and not pressed Britain&#146;s interests. As I have just illustrated, however, Britain has demonstrably secured changes that are in our national interest. All the points that I have just made demonstrate that. It is wrong to suggest, as the hon. Gentleman seemed to do, that we have simply accepted whatever was being put forward by Brussels or by other member states.</p>

 My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, South-West (Mr. Davidson) asserted that a better deal was possible. When I asked him for evidence of that, he was unable to produce any. Similarly, neither were the Opposition. Bearing in mind the benefits of this deal, both in economic terms and in terms of the non-economic elements such as furthering democracy, is my right hon. Friend aware of any evidence that a better deal for the United Kingdom was possible, or that one would be possible if this measure were rejected tonight?</p>

 I am not. Throughout the debate, I have said that this was the best possible deal that we could secure. Opposition Members seem to be interpreting that as my saying that it is an ideal, perfect deal. That is not what I am saying. I am saying that we have had negotiations&#151;<i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge is not listening, but I have set out the things that were secured in those negotiations that will benefit this country and that are demonstrably in our national interest. They include a rebate that is worth more to this country over the period, a shift in the amount in percentage terms that we spend on the CAP, and, more than that, reform within the CAP. There is a shift from pillar one to pillar two spending and a voluntary system whereby countries are encouraged to spend more on improving the sustainability of the rural economy rather than just provide subsidies of the sort which my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, South-West finds objectionable, so as to help to diversify the regional economy and help people to develop new business opportunities.</p>

They are the product of good negotiations by a committed British Government who are in there fighting for Britain&#146;s interests. At many points in this debate, the argument has been, &#147;Let us reject the Bill tonight, as that will embolden and strengthen Ministers when you go back&#148;&#151;<i> [Interruption.] </i>I am paraphrasing a point that was put to me about strengthening our hand. It is for each party in the House to decide how it wants to conduct its relationship with our European partners.

 Indeed; it could be substantially worse. I believe that the best way to be heard and get constructive dialogue is not always to adopt a confrontational and knee-jerk response. As I have demonstrated, we have not given it all away.</p>

 The tragedy of the Minister&#146;s opening remarks failed to impress, so he is now obviously trying comedy instead. Surely he would not have the House believe that the falling cost of the common agricultural policy is the result of these negotiations. The falling cost of CAP was predicted at the mid-term review five years ago and is a direct result of the move away from production-based subsidies. The savings now being made as a result of this deal are no greater than those predicted then.</p>

 As the hon. Gentleman knows, the reform of CAP did not begin with this own resources decision. These matters were debated at great length by the previous Government and subsequently by this Government. I acknowledge a long-running debate on the structure, shape and size of CAP; the point I was making is that there is CAP reform within this own resources decision. Let us be absolutely clear, however: we believe that a much more radical reform of CAP is necessary if Europe is to be ready to face the challenges of the years to come. That was why we wanted a &#147;no taboos&#148; full budget review, which is what we secured. That is the Government&#146;s position and it is our objective in that review to secure far-reaching CAP reform, which is what we will now argue for in the negotiations.

Member for Hendon (Mr. Dismore) a break. I am extremely grateful to my right hon. and hon. Friends for the self-restraint that they displayed, ensuring that we are able to debate new clause 1. I shall seek to be very brief and not to rehearse any of the arguments made in the stand part debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o247"><a name="80115-0015.htm_para21"><a name="080115138000042">The new clause is genuinely designed to help the Government by re-injecting a bit of backbone into their negotiating position. It would delay the implementation of this change in the own resources decision until satisfactory completion of the promised review of the European Union. It makes explicit the conditionality that the Government claimed was the basis of their final negotiating position.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o248"><a name="80115-0015.htm_para22"><a name="080115138000043">In the course of the previous debate, the Chief Secretary said that nothing was agreed until everything was agreed. I would suggest, however, that if the new clause were incorporated into the Bill, nothing would be agreed until everything is done. It is about ensuring that what was promised to be done at Brussels in December 2005 is, indeed, delivered. We have already seen that the Government did not go into the negotiations on the basis of having to give away the rebate in order to secure enlargement. That is a spurious argument. What we have emerged with at the end of the negotiations is nothing but the promise of a review. We must now ensure that the promise of the review is turned into a reality.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o249"><a name="80115-0015.htm_para23"><a name="080115138000044">The Chief Secretary told us earlier that defeating the Bill or substantially amending it, as new clause 1 proposes, would create a political crisis in the EU. I see no reason why that should be the case. If everyone has acted in good faith, our EU partners will know that our Prime Minister gave away a large part of our rebate because he had secured a commitment to a fundamental review&#151;with no red lines and no holds barred&#151;of the EU budget. Presumably, our partners entered into that commitment in good faith. There is no reason whatever why they should find it strange that this Parliament wants to ensure that that review indeed takes place, that it is meaningful and that its outcome is, at least as judged by the Treasury, satisfactory to the UK. This is not an anti-EU position, but a pro-British position. No other Government in the EU believe that there is a contradiction between being pro-EU and being pro their own national interests.</p>

The only thing that it brought back was the promise of a review, and unless we give some teeth to that promise and show that this Parliament will insist on its being delivered in good faith, it will have effectively come away with nothing.

from now on, and if our Government have not the backbone for the fight, this Parliament has.</p>

<p><a name="st_o356"><a name="080115138000061"><a name="80115-0016.htm_spnew6"><a name="080115138000730"><b>Dr. Cable:</b>
 I am rather tempted by the new clause. As I said in the clause stand part debate, there was a major failure in the negotiations to establish a link between the rebate and agricultural policy. It seems in principle, unless the Minister can persuade us to the contrary, that the new clause provides a mechanism for retrieving the situation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o259"><a name="80115-0016.htm_para9"><a name="080115138000062">Let us look carefully at what the Prime Minister said about the review in his statement to the House in December last year, when he brought back the agreement. He clearly thought that he had extracted a major concession in return for the negotiations on the rebate. He said:</p>
<a name="80115-0016.htm_brev1"><a name="080115138000688"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Alongside this agreement on... the modernisation of eastern Europe, we also agreed on a fundamental review of all aspects of the EU budget, including the common agricultural policy... with the recommendation that it begin in 2008.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o260"><a name="80115-0016.htm_para10"><a name="080115138000063">The two subsequent sentences are crucial. The Prime Minister said:</p>
<a name="80115-0016.htm_brev2"><a name="080115138000689"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;As the language in the European Council conclusions makes... clear, it is then possible for changes to be made to this budget structure in the course of this financing period.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o261"><a name="80115-0016.htm_para11"><a name="080115138000064">Of course it is possible, but why should the Governments who resist reform of the common agricultural policy agree? What possible incentive is there for them to do so? The French Government will almost certainly refuse to renegotiate. What possible leverage do the British Government have in carrying through the Barroso recommendations?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o262"><a name="80115-0016.htm_para12"><a name="080115138000065">The following sentence is even more substantial. The Prime Minister continued:</p>
<a name="80115-0016.htm_brev3"><a name="080115138000690"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;This will also allow us to take account of any changes agreed in the World Trade Organisation round&#148;.&#151;[<i> Official Report</i>, 19 December 2005; Vol. 440, c. 1564.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o263"><a name="80115-0016.htm_para13"><a name="080115138000066">That is terribly important, because we keep being reminded&#151;rightly&#151;that if the negotiations fail, there will be disastrous consequences for the world economy, for Europe and for the United Kingdom.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o264"><a name="80115-0016.htm_para14"><a name="080115138000067">During the last few weeks, Mr. Mandelson has been ominously quiet. There is a real and growing worry that the negotiations may fail, primarily because of difficulties in the American Congress but also because of the intransigence of agricultural interests in Europe. In the next few months, we may well be faced with disastrous circumstances in which our negotiations fail for the first time since the second world war, opening a Pandora&#146;s box of protectionism. The British Government should be, and according to much of its rhetoric will be&#151;and we hope it will be&#151;in the vanguard of efforts to prevent that from happening. However, what negotiating clout do they have in making other EU members come to an agreement with the Americans at the World Trade Organisation? There is no leverage; there is no negotiating position if it has already been conceded.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o266"><a name="80115-0016.htm_para16"><a name="080115138000071">It is my understanding that on the financial front we would revert to the earlier own resources formula, which in purely financial terms would be better for the UK, so it is clearly not a deterrent in that sense. There is also the mechanics of how payments are made, and whether failure to ratify on time would affect the normal running of payments through the EU. Again, I confess ignorance on that: I do not know at what point a failure to achieve legislative closure affects the day-to-day payments. There is a section in the explanatory notes that I am afraid I do not understand, but the Minister might be able to explain it. It states:</p>
<a name="80115-0016.htm_brev4"><a name="080115138000691"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The additional UK contribution resulting from the reduction in allocated expenditure is limited to &#8364;10.5bn in 2004 prices over the period 2007 to 2013.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o267"><a name="80115-0016.htm_para17"><a name="080115138000072">The implication is that the changes are already in operation and that they will be retrospectively validated by this legislation, so there is nothing to stop these payments occurring now. There is also an implication that the deterrent&#151;the nuclear bomb&#151;is, in the end, largely an issue of face or prestige: the British Government cannot get their own legislature to agree a piece of legislation, which is very embarrassing. But is it more than embarrassment? That is the question that we have to answer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o268"><a name="80115-0016.htm_para18"><a name="080115138000073">If the Government can explain that holding up this legislation in order to achieve these necessary improvements will do serious damage to the functioning of the EU and Britain&#146;s role within it, I would be hesitant to support the new clause, but if all that is at stake is a little embarrassment at the beginning of 2009&#151;which might, indeed, have the effect of stiffening the Government&#146;s spine in what then might be difficult negotiations about the review&#151;I cannot see the harm. As somebody who is a pro-European, I want the Government to explain convincingly to me why I should not support the new clause.</p>

which I made my maiden criticism of the then Prime Minister, Mrs. Thatcher, nearly bringing my career to a premature end. She was seduced&#151;or so it seemed to me&#151;by the argument that in return for a promise from the European Union to be more moderate in its future spending, she should concede an increase in the own resources of the European Community. I asked her at Prime Minister&#146;s questions whether she would follow that logic and reward a drunkard who had signed the pledge by giving him a bottle of whisky. She was not best amused, and I was told my career would not proceed any further. I was wrong, of course, as Mrs. Thatcher was in the process of securing for Britain the rebate that has enabled us to save billions of pounds of contribution to the EU, whereas the present Government are doing the reverse.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o269"><a name="80115-0016.htm_para19"><a name="080115138000075">I mention this because I think it shows that, having been critical of my own Government, I have a reasonable licence to be critical of this Government on this issue. My position in both cases is as someone who does not want to see a waste of public expenditure through an increase in spending that will not be properly monitored or controlled, and will not be in the interests of the taxpayer. I fear that what we are being asked to do today will result in that. That is why I welcome the new clause tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond), because it says that we should not go ahead with this increase in the own resources&#151;the new structure reducing Britain&#146;s abatement by up to &#163;10.5 billion&#151;unless we get something in return.</p>

The Government have been prepared to give us the figures only in respect of France, but the contribution per head that British people will make to the European budget is 20 per cent. greater than that of France. Our net contribution is set to rise significantly under this settlement, as I mentioned in an intervention that the Minister was kind enough to take. The net contribution is rising faster than the generality of public expenditure is planned to do in this country&#151;so much so that our net contribution to the European budget as a share of total public expenditure will rise by half over the time span of the current spending process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o277"><a name="80115-0016.htm_para27"><a name="080115138000083">This is a very inequitable arrangement as far as British people are concerned. It was right to secure an abatement to try to offset some two thirds of the differential between the money that we put in and the money that we get out. Mrs. Thatcher was able to secure it because she had a very good case, she argued forcefully and she persuaded her partners to give it to her. According to the Government, we now have to reduce that abatement and to accentuate again the inequities that the correction mechanism was designed to redress. &#147;Correction&#148; is the word used in the European documents. The correction is to an inequity that Britain otherwise faced.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o278"><a name="80115-0016.htm_para28"><a name="080115138000084">We will get nothing in return, because the CAP budget will continue to rise. According to House of Commons figures, the CAP budget remains 48 per cent. of the total expenditure of the EU. Others claim that it has risen from 40 per cent. a few years ago to 44 per cent. Lord Patten said a year or so ago:</p>
<a name="80115-0016.htm_brev7"><a name="080115138000694"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;We are talking about a budget for research and development that&#146;s been severely squeezed already in order to accommodate a continuing rise in agricultural spending that will actually go up from 40 to 44 per cent. of the overall community budget.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o279"><a name="80115-0016.htm_para29"><a name="080115138000085">So, far from our having secured some degree of reform already that is resulting in a reduction, it remains overwhelmingly a budget that goes on the CAP.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o280"><a name="80115-0016.htm_para30"><a name="080115138000086">The other part is spent on structural funds, and I want to ask the Chief Secretary whether the Government have made any progress in securing the reform that the present Prime Minister sought when he was still Chancellor.

He is now Prime Minister and this is the great vision that he has been seeking to put before the British people. He can do what he indicated in leaks that he wanted to do and give his Back Benchers a free vote on this Bill.

He made a concession, which was a big contribution to his own future campaign to be President of Europe&#151;an undeclared contribution, which dwarfs those of any member of the present Cabinet.

that the deal between them was that the outgoing Prime Minister would stand down, as shown in the recent programme &#147;The Blair Years&#148;, in return for the undertaking that the new Prime Minister would not oppose either the own resources decision or the European treaty, which we will debate next week?</p>

During the years that Mr. Blair was in power, the contribution to the EU made by British taxpayers, adjusted to today&#146;s value of the pound, was more than &#163;100 billion&#151;enough money to run the health service free of charge for this year. We are talking about a change in the formula whereby the EC allocates its budget to individual countries. Each country has the right to debate that new way of raising funds, but I suspect that only this country will have reservations, because only this country is dealt such a bad deal by the formula.</p>

However, a written answer given in January 2006 set the record straight. It stated that in 2007, our net payments to the EU would be &#163;4.7 billion, increasing to &#163;6.8 billion by 2011&#151;an increase of 45 per cent. How can a &#163;2.1 billion increase for British taxpayers be right when we are in the middle of an economic crisis that requires us to have almost a statutory pay limit in the public services?</p>

 My hon. Friend has enlightened the House with those figures. They stand in stark contrast with the assurance that the Chief Secretary gave us from the Dispatch Box a few moments ago that our contribution will be some &#163;5 billion across the economic cycle.

Another interesting element of the written answer to which I have referred has to do with the so-called &#147;dodgy money&#148; that we get back from the EU.

remember driving around a small village in Wales and reading a blue plaque that stated that what amounted to a motorway had been built by the EU. Of course, there were no cars on it at all, but the Bill means that even the dodgy allocation of returned funds that I have described will be smaller. This year, we will get back &#163;5.6 billion, but it is predicted that we will get only &#163;4.2 billion in each year from 2011 to 2013.

 I shall try to answer the points raised in the debate on new clause 1, which talks about the &#147;outcome of the review&#148;. The heart of the matter is the point at which the certificate to be issued by the Treasury would be debated in the House. When I intervened on the shadow Chief Secretary, his answer summed up the problem with the new clause. He referred me to paragraph 80 of the Commission document, which talks about a White Paper or report to be issued in the relevant time frame, but that is not the same as the &#147;outcome of the review&#148;.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman shakes his head and laughs, but that is a very important point. The White Paper would set out strategic, high-level principles, but that is not what the &#147;outcome&#148; of the budget review would be. Therefore, the new clause is immediately defective in that specific regard.</p>

 What the Minister has described does not make the new clause defective. Instead, it makes it much easier for him to accept the proposal, as all he is being asked to agree is that the Treasury should be required to certify that it</p>

The outcome of that review will inform the preparatory work for and the discussions on the next financial perspective&#151;the one that begins after 2013. I say again, essentially, he is asking us to hold up the current financial perspective covering 2007 to 2013, pending the outcome of all of the discussions. The amendment is defective. It would cause us to miss the ratification deadline, and on that basis, I urge hon. Members on both sides of the House to reject it.</p>

Let me be plain: there is no formal sanction&#151;no fine or formal proceedings that could be instituted&#151;but implementation of the present financial perspective could be delayed.

 Let me finish the point. The other consequence is what one might call a diplomatic or political consequence. We have every reason to believe that 26 other member states will ratify the own resources decision into their domestic legislation, so we would face the prospect of being one versus 26 in explaining why we failed to ratify the decision. I do not want to over-dramatise by saying that not ratifying the decision will lead to a complete breakdown, but there would be real consequences to not meeting the ratification deadline.</p>

 I beg to move, That the Bill be now read the Third time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o299"><a name="80115-0018.htm_para2"><a name="080115138000652">This has been a long but good debate. [Hon. Members: &#147;It was short.&#148;] It felt long. I think that Members have been quite clear about where they stand. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o300"><a name="80115-0018.htm_para3"><a name="080115138000653">Let us be clear. This Government will make the case for being part of the European Union, for playing a constructive part in the European Union, and for making a sensible, practical and pragmatic agreement that helps to take the European Union forward into a new era. In our judgment, the own resources decision, which we are asking the House to incorporate into the law of this country, does precisely that. It is fair to the British taxpayer as it preserves the rebate and sees it grow in size over the financial period that we are discussing, but at the same time it will provide the resources for the social, economic and overall development of a peaceful and prosperous European Union. We all, I believe, have a common stake in that.</p>

 We have been over this ground all evening. This Government were clear about what they were seeking to achieve&#151;to preserve the rebate. Whatever fantasy arguments the Opposition wish to advance, at the heart of the own resources decision is an agreement whereby the British rebate rises but is disapplied in respect of non-agricultural spending&#151;the spending that helps economic and social progress in the countries of the former eastern bloc. That is what it pays for. It is absolutely correct to say that the former Prime Minister, Tony Blair, very much had in mind an agreement whereby Britain would retain the rebate and see it rise in value, with a change in the contributions that France makes to the European Union, whereby we now have rough parity between French and British contributions. That is a step forward. I think that he would also have said that Britain should pay its fair share of the costs of an enlarged European Union.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o301"><a name="80115-0018.htm_para4"><a name="080115138000656">The Conservatives have completely failed to demonstrate that the policy of saying, &#147;We support enlargement but we don&#146;t want to face up to the difficult decision of paying for it&#148;, has a scintilla of credibility across the European Union. We have heard no mention of it this evening, and the right hon. Member for Witney (Mr. Cameron) managed to attract only two other members to the new grouping in the  <br>

European Parliament. I gather that there is now just one, Bulgaria&#151;&#147;and then there was one&#148;. We see a party utterly isolated in Europe. Perhaps the shadow Chief Secretary will update the House on how negotiations are progressing.</p>

<p><a name="st_o383"><a name="080115138000657"><a name="80115-0018.htm_spnew3"><a name="080115138001278"><b>Mr. Philip Hammond:</b>
 I have a question for the Chief Secretary. How would he characterise the position of the British Government in the summer of 2005, when they said that they enthusiastically supported enlargement but that the British rebate was fully justified and non-negotiable? How would he characterise that as anything other than, to use his own words, being in favour of enlargement but not being willing to pay for it?</p>

<p><a name="st_o384"><a name="080115138000658"><a name="80115-0018.htm_spnew4"><a name="080115138001279"><b>Andy Burnham:</b>
 We are going over and over this ground, and the hon. Gentleman will not accept that there is a difference between the application of the rebate in respect of the 15 members of the European Union&#151;</p>

<p><a name="st_o385"><a name="080115138000659"><a name="80115-0018.htm_spnew5"><a name="080115138001280"><b>Mr. Hammond:</b>

 In my view, there is a difference between the application of the rebate in respect of the contributions and spending that those countries receive and its application in respect of the new member states. We make a clear distinction between those two groups. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o302"><a name="80115-0018.htm_para5"><a name="080115138000661">Throughout the debate, the Conservatives have failed to give any credible answer about what they would do to contribute to the costs of enlargement. The evidence is clear: they are utterly isolated in Europe. Well, they are not quite isolated; they have one ally among the whole European Union, but some of their new-found friends have dubious connections, we might say. That is not a position of strength, or an intellectual, commanding position from which to lecture us on how to conduct relations in Europe. We have secured a deal that helps to take the EU forward to the next era while securing the British interest.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o303"><a name="80115-0018.htm_para6"><a name="080115138000662">We have seen a great deal of limbering up tonight for the main event. As was said earlier, I am sure that lots of Conservative Members&#146; diaries have been cleared for 15 days running, and I am sure that they will probably want more than that.</p>

<p><a name="st_o387"><a name="080115138000663"><a name="80115-0018.htm_spnew7"><a name="080115138001282"><b>Mr. Bone:</b>
 Is the Chief Secretary making a new announcement? I thought that the Government had provided 20 days of discussion? Is this a new announcement that has slipped out?</p>

<p><a name="st_o388"><a name="080115138000664"><a name="80115-0018.htm_spnew8"><a name="080115138001283"><b>Andy Burnham:</b>
 Not at all. I do not think that he has been listening closely to what I said. <i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> I believed it was 15, but it may be 20. I am sure that he will be there for all 20 days. I say this to the hon. Gentleman. Am I right that the right hon. Member for Witney said&#151;and I paraphrase&#151;that the country would know that the Conservative party had changed when it stopped banging on about Europe? I remember him saying something along those lines. We have heard a lot of banging on about Europe today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o304"><a name="80115-0018.htm_para7"><a name="080115138000665">As I said to the shadow Chief Secretary, we have heard some incredibly inflammable statements&#151;<i> [</i><i> Laughter.</i><i> ]</i> Inflammatory statements, even. We have heard incredibly inflammatory statements from Conservative Members this evening, and I wonder what the parties the shadow Chief Secretary wishes to  <br>

pull into his grouping in the European Parliament would make of sweeping generalisations about the EU&#151;for example, that it is a fraudulent and corrupt organisation. No wonder that their isolation deepens.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o305"><a name="80115-0018.htm_para8"><a name="080115138000666">We will go forward and defend the agreement. The new clause that the Conservatives brought to the House showed the same level of confusion on these matters as their position on the EU reform treaty does. It would seek to unpick and renegotiate matters once the rest of Europe had moved ahead and reached a sensible agreement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o306"><a name="80115-0018.htm_para9"><a name="080115138000667">British business looks to hon. Members and to any party that seeks to form the Government of this country to take a pragmatic approach to Britain in Europe. Yes, it wants us to defend the British interest, but it knows that, above all, its prosperity and that of the British economy is based squarely on good relationships with Europe. As I said, 56 per cent. of British trade is with the European Union. Would Conservative Members serve the interests of British business by leading us to an isolated position, whereby we were the only country to argue against a deal that was struck between 27 members of the European Union? Would that be in the long-term interests of business?</p>

 Let us get down to brass tacks. The hon.

There is already much greater trade between this country and businesses in the accession countries. The hon.

 I am sorry that the Chief Secretary was so disparaging about new clause 1. It was a modestly phrased measure that could have improved the Bill sufficiently for us to tolerate it and extract something from the negotiations in Brussels in December 2005. As it is, without new clause 1, this is a miserable sell-out of a Bill and I shall have to urge my hon. Friends to vote against Third Reading.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o309"><a name="80115-0018.htm_para12"><a name="080115138000677">Let us be clear. The premise on which the Chief Secretary&#146;s arguments have rested throughout today is that anyone who questions any aspect of what the Government negotiated in Brussels is promoting the immediate collapse of the European Union and the casting into outer darkness of every country in eastern Europe, but that is simply not true. Being an enthusiastic member of an alliance is not a reason for abandoning the interests of those whom Governments are elected to serve, but this Government did indeed abandon those interests.</p>

In June 2005, it was not to be negotiated away, period. Before the Brussels summit in December 2005, however, the rebate apparently was negotiable, but only for guaranteed fundamental reform of the EU budget and of the common agricultural policy in particular. After the Brussels summit, the position was that we would give away &#163;7 billion over seven years and much more in the future. The rebate was gone&#151;traded for a vague and some might even think cynical promise from our European partners to review agricultural spending under the presidency of the country that is one of the largest beneficiaries of that spending.</p>

The French believed that they had achieved a great victory in resisting even a review of agricultural spending within the 2013 financial perspective. It is not true, as the Chief Secretary asserted it was, that investment in eastern Europe is dependent upon conceding our rebate. If he believed that, how could his Prime Minister have gone into negotiations in the summer of 2005 with the position that he then took?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o313"><a name="80115-0018.htm_para16"><a name="080115138000681">At a time of huge pressure on UK public spending, the Government should have stood their ground and extracted real and durable budgetary reform, as they promised Parliament and the British people they would, with a mechanism linking the own resources decision, and thus the British rebate, to genuine progress on such reform, instead of a naive wish or hope that that might happen in the future. To their lasting shame, the Government did not do that, adding to a long list of broken promises and incompetent delivery.</p>

 Does my hon. Friend share my concern that, in effect, the British people have been misled? During the general election of 2005, there was no indication from the Labour party that Britain&#146;s membership fee of the European Union would double, from a net contribution of &#163;3.3 billion to at least &#163;6.6 billion. Is that not a huge indictment of the honesty and integrity that we have come to expect from the Government?</p>

 My hon. Friend makes a good point. We are entitled to ask this question: when the then Prime Minister and the current Prime Minister pledged that the British rebate would be non-negotiable, in May 2005 and June 2005 respectively, were they simply being naive or was it worse than that? Did they genuinely believe that they could get through the process without conceding the British rebate, but fail to appreciate how incompetent they were at negotiation, or did they know all along that they would have to break that promise?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o314"><a name="80115-0018.htm_para17"><a name="080115138000684">So &#163;7 billion of potential UK public spending, debt reduction or tax reduction&#151;as some of my hon.

Much worse, however, is the fact that the baseline for future own resources decisions has been shifted downwards, and the cap on the cost to the UK of the surrender of the rebate comes off in 2013. The negotiating ratchet works inexorably against the interest of the United Kingdom.</p>

 Given that those on the Front Benches effectively made their Third Reading speeches in the debate on clause 1 stand part, we do not need to repeat them at great length. I shall simply describe myself as a leading light in the &#147;better off in&#148; group. The Liberal Democrats have no embarrassment in describing ourselves as pro-European. We support British membership and constructive engagement, and we have criticised the present Prime Minister for not being constructive enough. We support enlargement and the financial adjustments necessary to make enlargement possible and to support the weaker countries in eastern Europe. We have no problem with any of that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o317"><a name="80115-0018.htm_para20"><a name="08011610000005">We also believe, however, that it is possible to hold those views while simultaneously believing that the British Government should be tough in defending British interests and British financial interests. Countries that have been in the European Union since its inception, including the Netherlands and France, have Governments who take a very tough line on budgetary matters, and there is no reason whatever why British Governments should not do the same. We also believe that the British Government have a particular mission and an obligation to pursue rapid reform of the common agricultural policy, which is damaging to British and European taxpayers and consumers and to the world trade system. They should be tough on those issues.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o318"><a name="80115-0018.htm_para21"><a name="08011610000006">Our criticism of the Government is that, in these negotiations under the previous Prime Minister, they were weak and made an unacceptable deal. That is why we intend to vote tonight alongside people with whom we would otherwise not share many common views on the European question. It would have been better if the Government had accepted new clause 1, which was objectively helpful. I do not know what their motives were in rejecting it, but if they did not like it, they could have produced their own version of a scorecard to help to strengthen their negotiating position. They did not do so, however.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o319"><a name="80115-0018.htm_para22"><a name="08011610000007">The outcome of all this is rather unfortunate. The Government will have made a substantial concession on the rebate. They will continue to be party to a European Union that is not reforming the common agricultural policy at anything other than glacial speed. We might well be confronted over the next few months with the collapse of international trade negotiations, caused at least in part by the intransigence of European agricultural interests. The British Government will have absolutely no leverage whatever to prevent any of those things from happening.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o320"><a name="80115-0018.htm_para23"><a name="08011610000008">The certain consequence of all those things is that British cynicism about the European project will grow.

 It is a great pleasure to follow the hon. Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable). Although we come from different sides of the argument, we have probably reached the same conclusions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o322"><a name="80115-0019.htm_para0"><a name="08011610000011">In the final stages of today&#146;s consideration, I want to mention how unfortunate it is that so little time has been allowed to debate a Bill that will see &#163;104 billion of taxpayers&#146; money spent over the next few years. It is a great shame that this evening&#146;s debate was not allowed to continue until any hour. I have to have sympathy for the Chief Secretary, who battled hard, although I am afraid he has no support on the Government Benches. He did his best while batting on a very sticky wicket, defending the indefensible. He did not deny the fact that as from 2007, we are going to have a net contribution to the EU of &#163;4.7 billion, which is expected to be &#163;6.8 billion by 2011. That cannot be and is not a good deal for the British taxpayer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o323"><a name="80115-0019.htm_para1"><a name="08011610000012">My most important point relates to what the Chief Secretary said at the very beginning of the debate&#151;that the EU would implode if we did not agree to the Bill tonight.

That is a missed opportunity, which I believe the Government will rue.</p>

It is in the middle of an enormous great bog; it is a very beautiful bog, but a bog nevertheless, with an international airport in it. When one gets out of the plane to get a taxi, one is swept down an amazing highway&#151;a dual carriageway with many beautiful blue signs saying &#147;Made possible by the European Union&#148;. After about 7 miles, one reaches nothing more than a cattle track. It would be argued in Ireland that that is effective spending of European money.

It is not impossible&#151;I cannot believe that it is impossible&#151;for the Government to find a few extra millions, &#163;30 million to &#163;60 million, to ensure that at least prison officers and police officers, who do the hardest job in the country, receive the money that they deserve.</p>

 I listened to much of the opening skirmishes of the debate on clause 1 stand part, and I am afraid that I heard nothing to convince me that it is in the national interest to give the Bill a Third Reading. I put it to the Chief Secretary that he should take his arguments down to his local pub in the constituency, and tell those who are enjoying themselves there that he has personally put through a Bill that will give the European Union an extra &#163;7.4 billion of taxpayers&#146; money over the planned period of the current financial perspective.

This is a serious matter. It is extraordinary that, at a time when the pressure is on public spending and given that the rate of growth of public services such as health and education is to be much curtailed in the years ahead, the Government have squandered such a vast sum on the notion, described to us by the Chief Secretary, that somehow we will get back the money that is to be spent in the European Union through our relationship with the European Union.</p>

The idea that public spending creates prosperity was debunked in the 1970s, and has long been dismissed. There was recently a savage analysis of the efficiency of the European structural funds, showing how inefficiently and wastefully they are spent. That was just adumbrated by my hon.

 I know that the right hon. Gentleman finds it hard to believe, but what has transformed the Irish economy, for example, is not the structural funding, but the much lower rates of taxation. It is possible, I concede, that the substantial subsidies that the Irish received in previous years allowed them to carry a much lower burden of taxation, but what is leading to the astonishing rates of growth in the eastern European countries is the liberalisation of their economies, the cutting away of bureaucratic interference from Government, and the lower rates of taxation. The fastest growing economies in eastern Europe are those with the most dynamic, enterprise-oriented tax systems. One of the things that is eroding our competitiveness is the inexorable rise of public expenditure and taxation, which will, as the shadow Chancellor, my hon.

That rose substantially in subsequent years, and by 2012-13&#151;the year this financial perspective ends&#151;we will have a public debt of &#163;810 billion. That should be set alongside the situation in some European countries, which have no public debt at all because they have managed their economies very much more efficiently than we have.</p>

<p><a name="st_o409"><a name="08011610000028"><a name="80115-0019.htm_spnew10"><a name="08011610000668"><b>Mr. Goodwill:</b>
 On a point raised by the Chief Secretary, he might recall that three years ago his colleagues in Sheffield were crowing about the fact that Polestar publishing had got a &#163;6 million grant to build a new printing plant in Sheffield. At the time, I raised the concern that that would have a direct consequence for the four existing plants, including the one in Scarborough. This week, Polestar has announced 190 job losses in Scarborough as a direct consequence of that European structural funding going into that objective 1 area in Sheffield. So it is not all good news on objective 1 funding.</p>

 I not only welcome what my hon. Friend has said, but I add that if public spending in Scotland and the north-east and north-west was the answer in securing the prosperity of those regions, they would be growing faster than London and the south-east, but they are not. The disparities between those regions and the south of England have widened during this period of Labour government. I think what we need to be looking at is differential rates of taxation throughout the United Kingdom, as the idea that we should have a unitary tax system is holding back the UK&#151;but that is a matter for another debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o330"><a name="80115-0019.htm_para8"><a name="08011610000030">When I think about the money that the House will be committing tonight, I look at my constituency. The Eastern Angles theatre company grant from the eastern Arts Council, for example, is being slashed by &#163;100,000&#151;50 per cent.&#151;which will severely disable that extremely vibrant and capable arts and theatre company that operates throughout the entire region. I also look at the failure of the local health authority to open the Dedham surgery for want of &#163;50,000 a year&#151;not &#163;7.4 billion&#151;and at other surgeries that need to be upgraded. I look at the lamentable state of the A12, which grinds to a halt at least once a week because it is the most stressed piece of dual carriageway in the UK, yet the Government cannot find the money to upgrade it in the way that is necessary for the prosperity of my constituency. I look at the lack of money to spend on special educational needs in Essex schools, despite the fact that Essex is spending above the standard spending assessment on education. I look at the vast overspend on personal social services, particularly child welfare services, in Essex county council, which is not being funded by the Government because they are spending &#163;7.4 billion on the European Union for no reason at all, instead of tackling these problems. This is not banging on about Europe; it is banging on about the needs of my constituency, which this Euro-obsessed Government think are less important than placating other countries&#146; interests in the EU.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o331"><a name="80115-0019.htm_para9"><a name="08011610000031">I also look at the failure to honour the pay increase of the Essex police in my constituency, which is undermining the morale of the police who are fighting for law and order. I look at the Colchester garrison, which is training for operations in Iraq; 16 Air Assault Brigade is due to go to Iraq next spring. It is meant to have 110 up-armed Land Rovers for training in Iraq; it has six of them, because this Government think it is more important to appease EU interests than to fund our own armed forces. I look at the lamentable story of what happened to Corporal Wright, who was not lifted in good time from a minefield in Afghanistan because there were no helicopters with winches in Afghanistan as there should have been in order to address that matter.</p>

 I shall sit down, but I should say that this Bill is about allocating very large sums of money to Europe instead of to those other vital national interests.

 I am sorry; the hon. Gentleman is the former interim leader of the Liberal Democrats. He touched on what unites many of us in this House, strange as it may seem. I profoundly believe in the comity of nations. For the four most recent centuries of this country&#146;s history, it has been vitally engaged in what happens in Europe. Our prosperity as a mercantile nation depends on trade. All those things are true. Where we have common interests, surely we should work together for them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o332"><a name="80115-0019.htm_para10"><a name="08011610000041">At the heart of this matter is the question of who governs. I am delighted to see the Chief Secretary to the Treasury in his post, but goodness knows what has happened to the Treasury. Contrary to the environmental policies of the Government, he paraded a forest-full of notes, letters and papers. They were pushed across to him along the Benches to assist him in trying to define a very curious position.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o333"><a name="80115-0019.htm_para11"><a name="08011610000042">As my hon. Friend the Member for North Essex (Mr. Jenkin) has just said, this is about who bears taxes, how we negotiate and how we achieve the objectives of those who sent us here. What the Chief Secretary has tried to do in presenting this Bill represents an extraordinary distortion of facts that are on the record. We know what Mr. Blair negotiated and what promises and undertakings were given, as do the Liberal Democrats. This is not about Europe per se, in the sense of people being anti-Europe&#151;that will come next week if we are to engage on a great issue. This is about now, and the Chief Secretary&#146;s characterisation of other hon. Members as having a distaff view&#151;if I may put it like that&#151;does no credit to the Government. Each one of us here accounts as best we can for the arguments that we support. We heard the poorest level of distillation, spin and obfuscation. He was confronted with rational arguments and, as often as not, he did not even understand them.</p>

my hon. Friend the Member for North Essex was speaking&#151;and whether we could have done better. The judgment of most independents standing to a side would be to say that this Government did not do at all well.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o335"><a name="80115-0019.htm_para13"><a name="08011610000044">In the end, we have to stand before our electorate and justify what we are doing. The tranches of money involved are huge, and we are entering a period of great uncertainty in the international situation. All of us know and recognise that, and we tremble in many instances. This Government have committed the taxpayers&#151;the people whom we represent&#151;to laying out sums of money, and they then come to dance in front of the House hoping that their spin will get them out of the situation. That they promised something else is neither here nor there, because they try to rewrite the story of what was promised.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o336"><a name="80115-0019.htm_para14"><a name="08011610000045">That is the deceit that we have had this evening. The Financial Secretary can keep waving.

 Thank you, Mr. Speaker, for allowing me to introduce this important debate on the role of regional Ministers. When the announcement was made in summer last year, I was quite pleased with the concept of regional Ministers. Not everybody agreed with me, but I felt that it was a good idea, because inevitably one sometimes has to deal with issues that are not specific to one&#146;s own constituency, but involve many other parts of the region in which one&#146;s constituency is situated. In our case, one of those problems is, of course, flooding. Regrettably, Shrewsbury floods regularly, but it is not alone: many communities all along the River Severn are affected. I thought that having a regional Minister would give me the opportunity to work with other Members of Parliament and the Minister responsible as a team to lobby the Government more effectively on a cross-party basis.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o343"><a name="80115-0020.htm_para4"><a name="08011610000579">With that in mind, I immediately&#151;on 2 August last year&#151;sent a letter of congratulation to the hon. Member for Birmingham, Hodge Hill (Mr. Byrne) in which I invited him to Shrewsbury. I have sent repeated letters and e-mails and made telephone calls asking him please to fulfil his role as the Minister for the West Midlands and come to Shrewsbury.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o344"><a name="80115-0020.htm_para5"><a name="08011610000580">At this point, I have to say something nice about the Labour party: my experience of meeting Ministers has been very good. When I wanted to see the former Prime Minister, the opportunity arose straight away, and I could take constituents to see him. The same is true of the Foreign Secretary, the Home Secretary and the Secretary of State for Defence. Labour Ministers have been most accommodating about meeting me, so why has it been so difficult for me to meet the regional Minister&#151;the Minister responsible for the west midlands and, ultimately, for Shrewsbury?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o345"><a name="80115-0020.htm_para6"><a name="08011610000581">On 3 August, in <i> The Birmingham Post</i>, the Minister for the West Midlands was quoted saying that he wanted to</p>
<a name="80115-0020.htm_brev1"><a name="08011610000646"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;set about a 150-day consultation for an action plan&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o346"><a name="80115-0020.htm_para7"><a name="08011610000582">for the west midlands. That was a good idea. The hon. Gentleman has a business background, as do I, and I think that the first thing a Minister should do in such a role is set about producing an action plan, in order to lobby on the region&#146;s behalf. However, I have spoken to the chief executives and the leaders of Shropshire county council and Shrewsbury and Atcham borough council and been told that nobody in either council has had any interaction with the Minister for the West Midlands. I put it to the Under-Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, the hon. Member for Gloucester (Mr. Dhanda), how can one have a 150-day consultation to decide the priorities of the west midlands without any interaction with the chief executives and leaders of the councils of Shropshire, which is one of the most important counties&#151;my hon. Friend the Member for North Shropshire (Mr. Paterson) will agree with me that it is the most important county&#151;in the west midlands?</p>

Regrettably, on the one occasion that he did come to the county, he did not inform me of his visit. He came in the week we all expected a general election&#151;on 1 November&#151;and he was photographed in the <i> Shrewsbury Chronicle</i> with the Labour candidate and Labour councillors.</p>

 My hon. Friend is making an important and cogent speech. I wrote to the Minister for the West Midlands and for Borders and Immigration on 13 November, inviting him to Worcestershire to explore an issue relevant to both the hats he wears. I have had no reply to that letter. However, last Saturday he was in Worcester addressing a seminar of the Worcester Labour party. A pattern may be emerging.</p>

 I absolutely concur with my hon. Friend. I believe that the announcement of regional Ministers was yet more Labour spin. They are an opportunity for the Labour Government to have a regional Labour party co-ordinator or Labour party supremo, who will ensure that everything is done for the Labour constituencies and that as much publicity as possible is generated in Labour marginals in the west midlands and other regions. From now on, I shall be watching like a hawk and asking many questions about our regional Minister&#151;where he is going and who he is meeting&#151;so that the role of regional Minister does not become political but becomes what it is meant to be.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o348"><a name="80115-0020.htm_para9"><a name="08011610000586">I know that you, Mr. Speaker, and many others feel passionately about the scrutiny that takes place in the House. We Back Benchers have a responsibility to provide that scrutiny, and our constituents feel passionately that we must hold the Government to account. Regrettably, none of the procedures allowing us formally to scrutinise the regional Minister has been put in place. We were promised regional Select Committees and regional questions, but they have not been introduced. Seven or eight months down the line, there are no mechanisms in place for holding a regional Minister to account in the Chamber. How on earth can we hold Ministers to account if no safety mechanisms have been put in place, and if it is extremely difficult to get hold of the Ministers?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o349"><a name="80115-0020.htm_para10"><a name="08011610000587">We should have quarterly meetings with the regional Minister. We were not called to see him when he took up his position. When I was in business, when someone became a manager of a company, the first thing that they did was call in their sales force, set out objectives, and get to know the team on a professional and personal basis. None of us has had a team meeting. Many hon. Members present hold west midlands seats; we have not had a single meeting in the House of Commons with the regional Minister to discuss the priorities for the west midlands.</p>

 I am grateful to my hon. Friend for giving me the opportunity to mention Birmingham. Shropshire Members are concerned about the fact that Birmingham always gets priority in the west midlands.

 My hon. Friend makes an important point. He will have noticed that no fewer than 14 Conservative Members from the west midlands are attending this important debate. We in Birmingham cannot flush the regional Minister out, either. To try to find out what he was doing, I tabled a question asking </p>
<a name="80115-0020.htm_brev2"><a name="08011610000647"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;what proportion of his working week the Minister for the West Midlands spent carrying out his regional responsibilities in the latest period for which figures are available.&#148;</p>

 Regrettably, I concur with my hon. Friend. There was a great fanfare when the role was announced, but given the lack of scrutiny Committees and regional questions, I fear that the Government are not serious about introducing the role properly. I genuinely want us all to work on a cross-party basis. All the west midlands Members of Parliament and the Minister for the West Midlands should meet in the region, and hold public meetings from time to time, so that members of the public can see us working together on a cross-party basis, debating the priorities for the west midlands. I am sure that it would help us to engage more with members of the public, rather than deciding the priorities of the west midlands in secret meetings in the House or according to the Minister&#146;s own agenda.</p>

 I congratulate the hon. Member for Shrewsbury and Atcham (Daniel Kawczynski) on securing this debate. I have often taken part in Adjournment debates and usually there are only a couple of us here. It is terrific that at least a dozen of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s colleagues are here with him. I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for ringing me at my constituency office as well as at the Department on Friday. He said that he wanted this to be a moderate, measured and positive debate, with no knocking. I am delighted to hear of the new relationship that he has forged with his regional Minister in the past 24 hours. Long may that continue.</p>

 Part of the reason may be that although the focus of the points made by the hon.

That is why I am here&#151;to talk about the role across the board, and not just in respect of that specific regional Minister.</p>

elsewhere&#151;whether through our modernisation of local government so that it is better able to lead and provide key services for the communities that it serves, or through creating regional development agencies to improve regional economic performance and to ensure that every part of our country benefits from the sustained economic growth that we have seen in recent years. Regional Ministers are a further example of that commitment to devolution and decentralisation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o358"><a name="80115-0020.htm_para19"><a name="08011610000616">The plan to have a Minister for each of the nine English regions was announced last June. The remit for each of my nine colleagues is to be both an advocate for the region and a representative of central Government in the region. That is an important new development in the Government&#146;s empowerment of the English regions, and a further recognition that not every decision can or should be taken within a mile of Westminster. Having regional Ministers complements the Government&#146;s approach to local freedoms and flexibilities set out in last year&#146;s local government White Paper. It is also in accord with the recommendations of the review of sub-national economic development. That will improve the effectiveness of regional governance and regional economic performance in particular. The hon. Gentleman will want me to get on to the issue of governance and accountability, not least to answer some of the questions raised in interventions; I shall try to get to that bit as quickly as I can.</p>

In the west midlands, my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Hodge Hill (Mr. Byrne) is doing an excellent job representing the region in Government and Government in the region. He is working closely with local government and other civic leaders to ensure that people in the region have access to good-quality jobs and affordable homes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o360"><a name="80115-0020.htm_para21"><a name="08011610000618">I hear what the hon. Member for Shrewsbury and Atcham said about Shropshire. I am pleased to hear that my hon. Friend will be visiting, and that he met the hon. Gentleman for half an hour. I am sure that that will be the first of many meetings. My hon. Friend is providing leadership of the implementation of the sub-national review in the west midlands and has taken an active interest in the renewal of Birmingham New Street station&#151;a project of regional and national importance, and one that is important to all of us.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o361"><a name="80115-0020.htm_para22"><a name="08011610000619">Similarly, in my own region and constituency the support and influence of the Minister for the South West, my hon. Friend the Member for Exeter (Mr. Bradshaw) was a great help when we had flooding problems similar to those that the hon. Gentleman experienced. I am almost afraid to mention the word &#147;flooding&#148; tonight, because I fear that very many of my own constituents are concerned for their homes at the moment. The system has been a help around the country, where regional Ministers have been able to engage with such difficulties and to support local constituency Members of Parliament.</p>

 I am deeply grateful to my hon. Friend. I fully accept and support all his arguments; the hon. Member for Shrewsbury and Atcham (Daniel Kawczynski) has also made powerful arguments.

 I shall make only one intervention. I know that the Minister is coming to the important point raised by the right hon. Member for Rotherham (Mr. MacShane) about accountability in this House. But one day the Minister will find himself a Member of Parliament under a Conservative Administration, and when we are in office I am sure that he will want the same effective access to a regional Minister that he has at the moment under a Labour Government. Will he assure me that shire counties, particularly those with Conservative local authorities and Conservative MPs, will not face a second-class service from regional Ministers compared with that enjoyed by our Labour colleagues?</p>

effectively to their region. I know that all regional Ministers have had an extensive series of visits and meetings with key players in their region, and I hope that the hon. Gentleman&#146;s meeting yesterday will prove useful for him and for what happens in his county. My hon. Friend the Minister for the West Midlands has visited 14 constituencies since he was appointed. My right hon. Friend the Minister for the North East has visited 20 constituencies, and he finds time to be the deputy Chief Whip as well, so it important to mention him.

<p><a name="stpa_o366"><a name="80115-0021.htm_para4"><a name="08011610000640">Parliamentary accountability of regional Ministers has been the subject of some speculation. In &#147;The Governance of Britain&#148; we make clear the Government&#146;s view that regional Ministers should be accountable through parliamentary questions and scrutiny by parliamentary Committee. In common with last year&#146;s Communities and Local Government Committee report on regional government, the Government believe that one means of achieving such scrutiny could be the establishment of nine regional select committees. Furthermore, in the sub-national review, we also made clear our support for greater parliamentary scrutiny of regional institutions and regional economic policy. That process too could be Committee-based, on either the Select Committee or the Standing Committee model. I would be interested to hear the views of the hon.

I welcome the Modernisation Committee&#146;s announcement in October of its inquiry into regional accountability. The Government will be submitting their evidence in due course. I have no doubt that the Modernisation Committee will also consider whether there should be any changes to the current position on parliamentary questions put to regional Ministers, which are at present answered on their behalf by my right hon.
