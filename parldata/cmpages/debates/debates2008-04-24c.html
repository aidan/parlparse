 First, I do not accept the TUC&#146;s figures, which include reliefs from savings and enterprise and are based on a range of speculative assumptions. It is difficult to measure tax losses that arise from the use of avoidance devices. I hope that my hon. Friend accepts that all recent Budgets have included measures to close down avoidance schemes with a potential cost of between &#163;1 billion to &#163;1.5 billion a year. There have been notable successes, such as halving excise fraud. The measures have already reduced underpayments of tax by more than &#163;5 billion a year compared with five years ago. I therefore hope that he accepts that there is a concerted effort to do exactly as he suggests.</p>

 I wonder whether, in our modern and transparent taxation system, we can look at the bonuses that are paid to City workers.

Such pay increases not only distort housing prices in London and the south-east, but distort society.</p>

 The Warm Front scheme has been welcome in reducing fuel poverty, but what efforts is my right hon.

 I am grateful to my hon. Friend for his welcome of scheme in general. I think that about 7,000 households in his constituency have been affected by measures to help conserve energy through greater insulation. The point that he raises is a real concern, especially at a time when the industry is about to enter a major programme, through the carbon emissions reduction target, to insulate homes throughout the country. It would be a pity if contractors were to take advantage of that and charge more than ought to be charged. His other point was about ensuring adequate competition so that local contractors and others can get the work, which would also help drive down prices. He raises a real concern, which I want to look into, to make sure that all the work is not only done, but done as cheaply and efficiently as possible.</p>

 In the Chancellor&#146;s reply to me on Monday, he stressed that rating agencies should not be relied on as a definitive guide in judging the stability of energy companies and other utilities. Given the high levels of leverage in energy companies, will he discuss with the regulator, Ofgem, what measures can be taken to ensure long-term stability, so that crises will not precipitate a collapse of those companies, due to the levels of debt that they are currently incurring?</p>

 I will certainly raise the matter with Ofgem. As my hon. Friend said, he raised it with me on Monday. Whether we are talking about a utility company or a bank, I am clear that a credit rating agency should be relied upon to give advice that will help inform directors&#146; decisions, but it should not be taken as the last piece of advice. In other words, the decision should not be taken by the credit rating agency; it must be one for the directors to take.</p>

The Commission has taken some welcome steps, which Neelie Kroes initiated a year or so ago, but frankly the progress is far too slow. It is important that we do everything we can to ensure that the market is more open, because that will help British energy companies and therefore, importantly, consumers, whether businesses or individuals.</p>

 No, I do not accept that. What is clearly the case, especially over the past year or so, is that the prices being paid by businesses and consumers have gone up. A lot of that is to do with very high oil prices, which have remained far higher than people forecast even a year ago. Oil prices are significantly higher than they were then. We have a competitive market, but as the hon. Gentleman knows, Ofgem is looking into the situation. I raised it with Ofgem at the turn of the year, because I want to ensure that our market is competitive and that there are no anti-competitive practices.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o13"><a name="80424-0001.htm_para13"><a name="08042466000064">Since then, the Government have also engaged with energy companies to get them to increase the amount of money that they spend on customers with low incomes and, crucially, to do something about the unfair high payments that were imposed upon customers with pre-payment meters who, by definition, were on lower incomes than everybody else. Action is being taken, but rather like with the hon. Gentleman&#146;s fairy tale on Monday, he might want to look at all the facts and not just some of them.</p>

<p><a name="st_o14"><a name="08042466000065"><a name="80424-0001.htm_spnew12"><a name="08042466000801"><b>Mr. Andy Reed (Loughborough) (Lab/Co-op):</b>
 Although I welcome the interim and short-term measures that my right hon. Friend is taking, is he also considering alternative energies, such as those of the Energy Technologies Institute, which is based at Loughborough university, at the hub of a &#163;1 billion investment? Those are the things that will reduce our reliance on oil in the long term, especially at $120 a barrel, at which it could remain for the foreseeable future. Will he ensure increased investment in those alternatives, not only for the long-term security of the nation&#146;s energy, but for all of us suffering from the increased energy prices caused by changes currently taking place in the world?</p>

 I agree with my hon. Friend. Indeed, the thrust of the energy White Paper that I published last summer was, first, to reduce our demand for energy, through increased conservation and measures to ensure that businesses and we as individuals use less energy, which is critical. The second thing is that we need to reduce our dependence on carbon sources of energy. That is one of the reasons that the Government believe that we should rebuild nuclear capacity. However, my hon. Friend is quite right that renewable energy must play a crucial role. The renewables obligation helps the growth of renewable energy. Indeed, we have seen a huge increase over the past few years, although we have a long way to go.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o14"><a name="80424-0001.htm_para14"><a name="08042466000067">The problem with renewable energy that we also need to tackle is that sooner or later people must face up to the fact that if we want renewable energy, we have to give the go-ahead to wind farms onshore or offshore. The problem, certainly in this House, is that there are people who say, &#147;Yes, we want to be greener&#148;, but who then go on to say, &#147;But not anywhere near me.&#148; That is something that we as a country are going to have to resolve. I agree with my hon. Friend, however, that conserving energy and getting more renewable energy must be two of the centrepieces of any energy strategy if we are serious about tackling climate change and reducing bills for consumers, whether they are businesses or individuals.</p>

 I hope that I can do that in the reasonably near future, but I want to make sure that we have bottomed out exactly how these payments can be made and what mechanism will be used. It will almost certainly be done through the winter fuel payment mechanism, because it is already there and we would not need to legislate for anything different. The hon. Lady will recall that, in the Budget, I increased the amount of money going to people over the age of 60 by &#163;50 for this year, over and above the winter fuel payment.

 As I said earlier, the higher energy bills are affecting all parts of the UK, although I note what my hon. Friend has said about south Wales. They are also affecting every other country in the world. This is a matter of major concern, which is why we need to do three things. The first is to ensure that we have a genuinely competitive market. While we have made strides in this country&#151;far more than many other countries, particularly in the European Union&#151;we need to do far more to ensure that there is no anti-competitive behaviour. Secondly, we need to ensure that we take action to become more efficient with the amount of energy that we use. The third element, given that the root cause of the problem internationally is the continuing high price of oil, is that we need to take action to increase the production of crude oil, to increase our refining capacity, and to make those markets far more open than they are at present. All those things need to be done, because energy prices are crucial, particularly for heavy industry in south Wales as well as for consumers. I am very conscious of this issue, and we need to take action here as well as internationally.</p>

 Nissan produces a number of different models of Micra, which have a range of carbon dioxide emission outputs&#151;from 125 g to 175 g a kilometre. Using 2008-09 rates of vehicle excise duty, the percentage change for Micras varies between minus 25 and plus 25 in 2009-10, and between minus 21 per cent. and plus 24 per cent. in 2010-11, reflecting the fact that there are a range of emissions choices with this model of car, as there are with many others.</p>

 I was here for the whole of the previous exchange, which I noted. I noted in particular that three quarters of people who are entitled to working tax credit do not claim it. I also know that nearly 1 million people were not given the amount that they should have received. Given that there are two four-page forms and that, as the Minister says, the target audience is the people who are most likely not to get the forms right, what will she do, rather than merely saying she is committed, which I do not doubt, to ensure that the system delivers, if it is meant to be the answer to all the Government&#146;s new-found difficulties?</p>

 I can talk about Liverpool if the hon. Gentleman wants me to. HMRC has already conducted a campaign aimed specifically at one group: families without children who should potentially be receiving working tax credit. I hope that the hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey (Simon Hughes) will accept that this is a particularly hard group to reach and to encourage to claim. It is for precisely that reason that HMRC has focused its effort. It is working with three different groups in which it believes that we could improve take-up: new mums, some ethnic minority groups and the group that I just mentioned. HMRC realises that there is more work to be done.</p>

It is too early yet to see the outcome of that increased effort, but there is no doubt that the effort is being made not only through the leaflet campaign to which I referred, but through targeted radio promoting the use of tax credits to those groups. We believe that they listen to local radio programmes more than other perhaps more conventional methods of advertising.</p>

 It became clear from the correspondence that I received about the abolition of the 10p tax rate that there was still a large amount of ignorance about who could claim and who qualified for working tax credit. That might help to explain why take-up is so low. Another explanation is that people with disabilities find it difficult to get more than the number of hours that must be worked in order to qualify for tax credit, on top of the complication of filling out the form. Will my right hon. Friend reconsider the qualifications for working tax credit for those with disabilities, to make it easier for them to qualify without having to work the 30 hours, which they find a high hurdle to overcome? That would also help to address the group that is losing out as a result of the abolition of the 10p tax rate.</p>

 The most important reason why the Chancellor was able to come to his decision yesterday on the 10p tax band is that the economy is strong enough to pay out the money that people are going to get.

 As ever, my hon. Friend is quite right&#151; the British economy is very strong and stable. As I said in response to the first topical question, unemployment is at its lowest since the early 1970s and employment is at record levels. Those facts make a huge difference. The situation is quite different from the one that we faced when the housing market in particular got into trouble in the early 1990s, because at that time there were more than 3 million people out of work.

The Government have an ambitious target of 3 million extra homes by 2020, and an affordable housing target of approaching 100,000 homes a year by 2010-11. May we soon have a debate about achieving the objective of building the affordable homes that we need in London and across Britain? At the moment, the banks are less willing to lend, the housing associations therefore have less money to spend, and the risk is that the ambitious targets turn to nothing and people have additional housing problems in addition to all the other ones that we know about.</p>

 I will convey my hon. Friends&#146; requests to the Foreign Secretary because the position is about not only aid but political developments. It is important that some shift in the political situation occurs.

Member for Northampton, North (Ms Keeble). Although there may be a debate on Zimbabwe and sanctions in Westminster Hall, the whole House should have an opportunity&#151;as the Government have promised on so many occasions&#151;to debate the uniquely disastrous situation in Zimbabwe, where an election has been held but, three weeks later, no one knows the result. Surely we want to support the view of a growing number of African countries and hold a debate so that we can influence what happens.</p>

 Yesterday afternoon, in the Attlee suite in Portcullis House, the all-party group on sustainable aviation, of which I am an officer, was pleased to receive a report from Jeff Gazzard of the Aviation Environment Federation, which exposed the distortions, inaccuracies and heroic assumptions that underpin official policy on aviation and its impact on the environment and climate change. In the light of his startling figures and conclusions, may I make a submission to the Deputy Leader of the House for an urgent debate in the Chamber to examine that crucial matter, which affects so many people, especially those who live around the nation&#146;s regional airports, including East Midlands airport in north-west Leicestershire?</p>

 My hon. Friend is right. Aviation is one of the fastest growing sources of greenhouse gases. That is why a more sustainable aviation industry is important.

 May I tell the Deputy Leader of the House that on Monday No. 10 suggested that the Prime Minister would make an oral statement to the House on Wednesday about the outcome of the NATO summit? Clearly, he was blown off course by this week&#146;s events. It is still not too late for an oral statement on that important summit. It is unprecedented for a Prime Minister not to make a statement to the House after a Heads of Government meeting at NATO. The Government regularly acclaim NATO as the cornerstone of our defence. The Prime Minister&#146;s failure to make a statement on the summit&#146;s outcome sends the wrong signal about the importance that the Government attach to NATO.</p>

The right hon. Gentleman also said that the Chief Secretary had been ill briefed on &#147;Newsnight&#148; last night.

 With permission, Mr. Speaker, I should like to make a statement on the implications of the industrial action at the Grangemouth refinery, which, I regret to report, is scheduled to begin on Sunday and last for 48 hours. Throughout the past few days we have kept in close contact with Scottish Ministers, both parties to the dispute and the industry as a whole. I am particularly grateful to ACAS for its efforts to resolve matters between the parties.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o74"><a name="80424-0006.htm_para1"><a name="08042466000290">Our first priority now is to ensure the maintenance of sufficient fuel supplies during the period of industrial action. Over the past few days, significant additional supplies of imported fuel have been made available in Scotland. I have been advised by the industry that there is sufficient fuel to resupply forecourts and other users ahead of the planned industrial action. The industry has also advised us that, at present, fuel stocks at Grangemouth, together with planned imports of finished product through Grangemouth to replace lost production, should be sufficient to maintain supplies through the period of industrial action and the consequent restarting of the plant.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o75"><a name="80424-0006.htm_para2"><a name="08042466000291">We are already working under our established memorandum of understanding with industry to develop a jointly managed approach that allows fuel suppliers to work together to maximise available fuel. We also have available, if necessary, the national emergency plan for fuel, which can be used to ensure that fuel is available for priority groups such as the emergency services. Our best assessment is that there is at present no need for the Government to take action under their emergency powers. We are working closely with the Scottish Executive and the regional forums in Scotland to prepare for further action, should that become necessary. We will not hesitate to use the emergency powers if that becomes necessary.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o76"><a name="80424-0006.htm_para3"><a name="08042466000292">The oil companies have reported significant increases in fuel uptake this week in response to concerns about shortages of fuel. Although this response is perfectly understandable, I want to emphasise that industry has made it clear that there is sufficient fuel available via imports and that any localised shortages will be resupplied quickly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o77"><a name="80424-0006.htm_para4"><a name="08042466000293">It is also essential to prevent the industrial action at Grangemouth from disrupting the flow of North sea oil and gas associated with the Forties pipeline system and the Kinneil processing plant at Grangemouth. There can be no justification whatever for any action that adversely affects production of oil and gas from the North sea. Continuing production depends on power, steam and cooling water being delivered by or through the Grangemouth site. Discussions are continuing this morning on ensuring the continuance of these vital utilities, and of course it is essential that they be maintained.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o78"><a name="80424-0006.htm_para5"><a name="08042466000294">Finally, there is a need to protect critical equipment to allow a rapid return to normal operation following the period of industrial action. That will require the provision of safety cover for the INEOS refinery and petrochemical plants. It will also require maintaining  <br>

 I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for the manner of his response and for his comments. I agree that there is no need for panic buying in Scotland or anywhere else, and I hope that hon. Members from all corners of the House will reflect that message in their comments today. I can assure him that the objective of our discussions with the industry in Scotland is to maintain fuel supplies for all consumers in Scotland, wherever they are. That is important not just in the central belt, but in rural areas and the highlands as well. It is also important for industrial consumers, including the airlines operating in Scotland, which need jet fuel and kerosene. There is absolutely no justification for profiteering, given the adequacy of the levels of supply in Scotland, and I condemn absolutely anyone who seeks to take unfair and inappropriate advantage of the current situation.

 I thank the Secretary of State for coming to the House to make this statement. I know that my hon. Friend the Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Carmichael) has been trying to table an urgent question on this matter for some time, as it particularly affects people in Scotland.</p>

I welcome his assurance that adequacy of fuel supply is assured for Scotland, particularly in rural areas. It simply cannot be the case that a piece of brinkmanship and a petty dispute about pensions should hold the economy of Scotland to ransom. Does he recognise, however, that his statement follows a week of panic buying? Many Scottish colleagues are already reporting localised&#151;albeit, as he says, short-term&#151;shortages of fuel. Does he think that an earlier, public intervention by the Government could have prevented that? Having said that, I welcome his statement today. It was extremely helpful.</p>

He might be aware that there is a system in Western Australia called FuelWatch, which publishes tomorrow&#146;s fuel prices today. Does he think that such a public display of information could be helpful in the UK in counteracting that unacceptable practice? He said that contingency plans were in place in case of need. Will he tell the House how close he believes this two-week stoppage could bring Scottish oil supplies to that point of need? I appreciate his point about not wishing to discuss the details regarding Cobra, but he will also be aware that the public find it reassuring to understand the extent to which the Government have planned for that need.</p>

As the Conservative spokesperson has already mentioned, INEOS&#146;s own briefing states that its investment programme is contingent on a resolution of this dispute in its favour. Does the Secretary of State believe that that demonstrates the vulnerability of the UK&#146;s security of supply to unforeseen events?</p>

 I shall deal with some of the points that the hon. Lady has raised. We made our position clear on Tuesday in relation to this dispute and to the need for people to buy fuel normally during the run-up to any potential industrial action at Grangemouth. We felt that it was perfectly reasonable not to make a statement to the House of Commons at that time, given that discussions were continuing between ACAS, INEOS and the trade unions, and that there was a prospect that the dispute would be called off.

In fact, the company did not try to negotiate at all. Oddly enough, it said that it wanted to return to the position of three months ago, yet this dispute, as we know, started eight months ago when the company brought new workers on site with different terms and conditions of employment from those already there&#151;with no final salary pension scheme and contributions taken out of their salary, which was not the deal when BP sold the plant to INEOS.</p>

It simply cannot be in anyone&#146;s interest for any fundamental damage to be done to the long-term value of the infrastructure that links Grangemouth to the North sea.

Will he give an assurance that some thinking is being done about how priority can be given to the maintenance of supplies to vital public services&#151;fire, police and ambulance services, but also ferry and air services that provide lifeline routes to communities that are heavily reliant on them&#151;should that become necessary at some future date?</p>

Should the situation in Scotland change, we will not hesitate, as I have already made clear today, to use the powers that we have to prioritise the supply of essential fuel to vital emergency services. I also want to make it clear to the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Carmichael) and other hon.

Does he agree that we also need to look into the pensions issue, and that pensions should be treated as deferred pay and a pensions regime should exist so that people have security in their retirement?

 I agree with my hon. Friend about the importance of pensions to working people. Of course we recognise that, and we have a clear framework of law in the UK in respect of the protection and security of accrued rights in final salary schemes such as the one at Grangemouth&#151;and they cannot be interfered with. There is also a clear statutory procedure if any changes are proposed to future rights under those pension schemes. I believe that our employment law framework is robust and appropriate and that it guarantees essential rights to workers while also allowing companies to manage change when they need to do that. Rather than get embroiled in a blow-by-blow account of what has happened or a post-mortem, I would rather focus on the importance of ensuring and maintaining fuel supplies in Scotland&#151;they are secure and they can be maintained&#151;and on bringing this industrial action, which will ultimately benefit no one and may hurt a lot of people, to an end as soon as possible.</p>

Will the Government take up the suggestion of my colleague at Holyrood, Nicol Stephen, that in view of the anecdotal reports we have heard of prices being jacked up despite the reassurance and the fact that there are no immediate shortages, the Competition Commission may in due course wish to look at the activities of the oil companies over this period?</p>

 Let me deal with the last of the right hon. Gentleman&#146;s points first. It is the role of the UK competition authorities to keep a close eye on the way in which markets operate. If there is any evidence of anti-competitive behaviour, we would expect the Office of Fair Trading and the Competition Commission to get stuck into it. We must not allow consumers to be ripped off in those circumstances.</p>

Gentleman&#146;s main point, I agree about the importance of preserving fuel supplies across Scotland and to all parts of Scotland. That is absolutely what the industry, the Scottish Executive and ourselves are working to ensure. I take issue with the comments about causing chaos and confusion. There is no reason for chaos and there is absolutely no reason for confusion. The unions gave important undertakings yesterday and today about preserving the continuity of utilities operations on the Grangemouth site. Yes, we are in unchartered waters; this has not happened before.

<p><a name="stpa_o108"><a name="80424-0008.htm_para3"><a name="08042466000346">Today&#146;s debate provides us with an excellent opportunity to focus on the role of supermarkets, and to consider how their activities affect people, communities, the economy and the environment. Many of us have a peculiar love-hate relationship with our local superstore. We like the convenience of being able to obtain a wide range of goods in one place, at one time and at a reasonable price, but we want to ensure the hearts of villages and towns are not destroyed by out-of-town developments and our high streets are not cloned into homogeneous parades of shops selling the same products from the same stores in town after town. Many of us also care very much whether producers and farmers&#151;whether they farm in Britain or in developing countries&#151;get a fair price for the products they sell.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o109"><a name="80424-0008.htm_para4"><a name="08042466000347">Whatever anyone&#146;s stance on the issue, no one can deny that our supermarket chains have a unique place in this country. They exert an incredible influence over what we buy, how we buy, and where we buy. Their actions hold sway over many varied issues, and I am sure that a number of them will be raised today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o110"><a name="80424-0008.htm_para5"><a name="08042466000348">Although it is not in my brief, I am more than aware of Members&#146; concerns about the ability of supermarkets to expand their empires at the expense of local shops. Our &#147;town centre first&#148; policy has produced some real success. However, the Department for Communities and Local Government has now decided to conduct a review of planning policy statement 6, and to introduce a tougher impact test to give councils more capacity to refuse big developments that put small shops in town centres at risk.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o111"><a name="80424-0008.htm_para6"><a name="08042466000349">World food prices are the latest issue to top the supermarket agenda. On Tuesday, recognising that the poorest would be hit hardest, the Prime Minister hosted a summit with leading experts&#151;including the head of the World Food Programme&#151;to discuss ways of tackling the problem. My focus in this debate, however, will be on the supermarkets&#146; role in climate change and waste.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o112"><a name="80424-0008.htm_para7"><a name="08042466000350">Supermarkets have a key role to play on climate change. As large businesses, they need to reduce the carbon impacts of their operations. Many have secured real reductions through energy efficiencies and new technologies, but to drive down their emissions further we are introducing the carbon reduction commitment through the Climate Change Bill. That will create a domestic cap-and-trade emissions scheme covering all enterprises whose annual half-hourly metered electricity use is above 6,000 MW hours, which will include supermarkets.</p>

 I regret to have to say that I do not have that figure with me. We can endeavour to get hold of it, however, and I will write to the hon. Gentleman if I have it. As I think he will know, we in the UK are responsible&#151;in terms of our own productions here, as opposed to the goods we bring in&#151;for 2 per cent. of total global CO2 emissions, but we have to take on our responsibility, as does every section of society, and I know that the supermarkets understand that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o113"><a name="80424-0008.htm_para8"><a name="08042466000353">As consumer-facing organisations, supermarkets also wield huge influence over the purchasing habits and lifestyle choices of millions of individuals. As they have expanded beyond groceries, supermarkets have given us cheap clothes and electrical and electronic goods. Like all goods, they come with a carbon price, which Government can no longer ignore. Supermarkets&#146; voluntary phase-out of incandescent light bulbs is already helping consumers to save money and reduce carbon emissions. Many organisations are now interested in the carbon footprint of individual products, so the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, the Carbon Trust and the British Standards Institution are working with retailers to develop a methodology that could lead to carbon labelling, and which will certainly lead to retailers being able to reduce carbon footprints.</p>

 The last time I and the hon. Member for Shipley (Philip Davies) were in the Chamber addressing a related topic, I was critical of ASDA Wal-Mart, but on this occasion I wish to congratulate it. Does the Minister endorse the initiative that it and Leicestershire county council launched some time ago of a packaging amnesty that allowed consumers to return excessive packaging, and, as part of an overall campaign, of encouraging shoppers to be alert to excess packaging and to try to select products that minimise their carbon footprint?</p>

sale today. Packaging serves multiple purposes, of course. It is used to catch the eye of the customer. It can serve to keep a product fresh, or to protect it, or make it easier to store or move. People realise that they have to pay for packaging, however, and when the packaging is finished with, it occupies as much as a fifth of their household waste bin. As council tax payers, they then end up paying again to get rid of it. When it becomes waste, packaging also contributes to climate change.</p>

Courtauld is about reducing packaging and food waste, such as by keeping wrapping to a minimum and finding new means of &#147;lightweighting&#148; those containers with which we are all so familiar. The signatories to the agreement are responsible for about 40 per cent. of the packaging in this country. Their first target was to end the growth in packaging waste this year&#151;to de-link growth in packaging from growth in GDP. I believe they are on target, and look forward to the report that is to come.</p>

 It is an enormous pleasure that the Minister is present to debate this subject&#151;or any other. Will she at least accept, however, that the problems associated with the miles travelled by products, the products themselves and their packaging are not unique to supermarkets, but that they are more general problems across the retail sector? It is also of concern to me that the Government are addressing this issue from a very narrow perspective, when in fact supermarkets have a specific impact on suppliers, and their out-of-town activities siphon wealth out of town centres. It is an enormous disappointment that we are not able to address those issues as well in this debate.</p>

 I thank the hon. Gentleman for his contribution, but I must say to him that he is entirely entitled to make his own speech, and if he chooses to concentrate on the issues he mentions, I will most surely be willing to pass any points that are to do with other Departments to my colleagues. I alluded at the start of my speech to the fact that there are other such issues, so I feel that I have offered him that opportunity. In terms of what he said about goods, the miles they travel and embedded carbon, supermarkets are of course not unique; those issues affect the whole of the retail sector. When I refer to supermarkets and agreements, it must be remembered that other non-supermarket retailers are involved in those agreements, so we are trying not to single them out but to work effectively with them.</p>

 When we talk about miles travelled, especially in relation to fresh produce, we also need to have in mind the good that this does to developing countries that want to export to the United Kingdom. We can sometimes assist them by buying their produce. Trade is far better than aid in many cases.</p>

<p><a name="st_o197"><a name="08042466000367"><a name="80424-0008.htm_spnew14"><a name="08042466000999"><b>Joan Ruddock:</b>
 I very much agree. That is why we work on whole-life cycles. It is impossible to make a judgment about a carbon impact without a whole-life cycle, and goods brought from further abroad can be less carbon-intensive than goods produced using a lot of energy in Europe.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o120"><a name="80424-0008.htm_para15"><a name="08042466000368">I have talked about the Courtauld agreement and the fact that we are on target. Reducing packaging is the priority, but reusing and recycling it is also important. We have made real progress in that. Packaging recycling rates increased from 28 per cent. in 1997 to more than 59 per cent. last year. We expect to reach the packaging directive targets of 60 per cent. recovery, including 55 per cent. recycling, by the end of this year. However, that means that more than 5 million tonnes of packaging waste is still not being recycled, and much of it comes from supermarkets. I have therefore increased the packaging recovery targets for 2008 to 2010 and set new targets for 2011-12.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o121"><a name="80424-0008.htm_para16"><a name="08042466000369">The public have also made it clear to us that they want action on plastic bags, and we have taken it. We will require that supermarkets charge for single-use bags, whatever they are made from, unless the voluntary agreement achieves a much more substantial reduction in respect of the 13 billion bags that will be distributed free this year. The best way to tackle waste is not to generate it in the first place, and that is where the retail sector can have its greatest influence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o122"><a name="80424-0008.htm_para17"><a name="08042466000370">It is estimated that supermarkets waste about 1.6 million tonnes of food every year, but, astonishingly, we householders throw away even more&#151;more than 6 million tonnes. We bin one third of all the food we purchase, so we need to tackle the issue by starting with what we buy. We must know how much we need and, dare I say it, we must not be tempted by offers of buy one get one free, three for two or two for one. When it comes to cutting down on our food waste, such sales initiatives are deeply unhelpful. Let us help the poorer customer, but why not offer products at half price?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o123"><a name="80424-0008.htm_para18"><a name="08042466000371">Last year I helped launch WRAP&#146;s food waste campaign, &#147;Love Food, Hate Waste&#148;. Since then, as food prices have risen so fast, the campaign messages have become even more important. We should plan for, and buy, only what we need. We should also store our food wisely and cook only what we can eat. When some people in the world cannot afford to buy food to eat, it is a scandal that every year we waste &#163;10 billion-worth of food that could have been eaten.</p>

 Supermarkets dominate not only the retail sector, but the whole economy, and they colour and shape our daily lives. There are so many facets to the power and reach of supermarkets that it would be hard to debate them all in this short topical debate, so in the 10 minutes available to me I shall concern myself with the effect that supermarkets have on waste and packaging. That is the most topical point for me to address.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o125"><a name="80424-0008.htm_para20"><a name="08042466000375">I am sure that the Minister was as disappointed as I was that the much-touted green Budget never really materialised. Instead of any new radical measures to tackle dangerous climate change, the only supposedly green measure we were offered by the Chancellor was the veiled threat of a plastic bag charge. The Budget announced that a Government tax on single-use plastic bags may be introduced next year if retailers have not already started charging for them by that time. Even by the standards of this lethargic, weak and dithering Administration, that was an astonishingly weak gesture. It is hard to credit any initiative from this tired Government on waste, however worthy, when it is set against the huge cuts inflicted on the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and its agencies, which will directly undermine the Department&#146;s efforts to lead on waste reduction; 2008 will go down as the year Labour bottled on waste.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o126"><a name="80424-0008.htm_para21"><a name="08042466000376">The business resource efficiency and waste&#151;BREW&#151;programme, which was set up in 2005 to support resource efficiency and waste projects, looks likely to have its spending cut by more than half, from &#163;125 million in 2007 to &#163;60 million in 2008, despite the fact that the BREW programme has been responsible for more than 2 million tonnes of landfill diversion, 1.8 million tonnes of CO2 reduction and cost savings that were estimated at almost &#163;40 million last year. The Waste and Resources Action Programme&#151;WRAP&#151;which promotes recycling and measures to reduce the use of landfill, has confirmed that its funding is being cut by 25 per cent., and it has issued more than 30 compulsory redundancy notices in the past months. Can the Minister explain why her Government are undermining those effective and efficient emissions reduction programmes while putting nothing in their place? Where is the ambition? Where is the compelling strategy? Where is the on-the-ground implementation?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o127"><a name="80424-0008.htm_para22"><a name="08042466000377">This Government are getting things wrong across the waste agenda, and the results are plain to see: the number of recorded fly-tipping incidents in this country has increased by a staggering 290 per cent. over the past two years; the UK has one of the highest levels of landfill in the EU; and 22 per cent. of the country&#146;s emissions of methane&#151;a gas that has 23 times the greenhouse effect of CO2&#151;comes from decomposing landfill. We cannot simply blame the supermarkets for that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o128"><a name="80424-0008.htm_para23"><a name="08042466000378">As the waste agenda becomes wedded ever closer to the climate change agenda, and as legislation such as the Climate Change Bill, which is soon to arrive in  this House, and various international frameworks push us towards greater reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, the irresponsibility of this Government&#146;s record on waste becomes all the more glaring. It is simply not acceptable just to push the blame on to supermarkets.</p>

The current approach to waste policy is propping up our throwaway culture and putting an unacceptable stress on our environment. The focus  is on end-of-life management, while growing global consumption is having damaging ecological effects and contributing to climate change. Landfill accounts for about 3 per cent. of the UK&#146;s greenhouse gas emissions, many more emissions are created through unnecessary new products, and waste threatens our wildlife and biodiversity, so an ambitious waste policy is essential for a sustainable future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o130"><a name="80424-0009.htm_para1"><a name="08042466000380">A regulatory approach is not enough. The current approach to waste, which is built around EU directives and environmental regulation, has been bureaucratic and sluggish. The packaging and packaging waste directive, for example, ensures that producers examine the environmental impacts of products, but it has had limited success. Enforcement is difficult, and purely aiming to make packaging lighter can have the perverse effect of making it more difficult to recycle.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o131"><a name="80424-0009.htm_para2"><a name="08042466000381">The problem is much greater than merely dealing with packaging or supermarket packaging. The total number of specific product categories covered by EU directives establishes producer responsibility for only a small amount of waste, such as electrical and electronic equipment, vehicles and batteries. Furthermore, the drive to increase recycling is driven by the threat of hefty fines for failing to comply with the landfill directive, rather than by a fundamental rethink of how we look at waste. Instead of relying on penalties and bashing companies with further regulation, we need to use this opportunity to rethink our waste strategy and to find alternative solutions. Changing our approach to waste is vital to the health of our environment, to social well-being and to our economy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o132"><a name="80424-0009.htm_para3"><a name="08042466000382">It is always sad to see the Government veer off course when they are moving in the right direction&#151;we have seen that happen a lot recently. A year ago, WRAP put together the Courtauld commitment, an agreement with all the major supermarkets and grocery organisations that aimed to develop new packaging solutions and technologies so that less rubbish ends up in household bins. Some 31 major retailers, brands and suppliers have joined the Courtauld commitment since its launch in July 2005. Under the agreement, WRAP works in partnership with retailers, brand owners, manufacturers and packaging suppliers to develop solutions across the whole supply chain. Such solutions include: using innovative packaging formats; reducing the weight of packaging, cans and boxes; increasing the use of refill and self-dispensing systems; collaborating on packaging design guidance; and increasing the amount of recycled content packaging used.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o133"><a name="80424-0009.htm_para4"><a name="08042466000383">Retailers set themselves targets for 2010 and, reporting this year, have demonstrated impressive results. As a result of reward schemes, new equipment, technologies and supply-chain management, they are on track to hit their targets. The retailers know their businesses better than the Government and know how most effectively to make savings on emissions and waste.

<p><a name="stpa_o134"><a name="80424-0009.htm_para5"><a name="08042466000384">On 17 March, the Leader of the Opposition announced new responsibility deals, which examine the issue of producer waste. The responsibility deal is a voluntary arrangement among producers to cut back on the production of waste and to improve its disposal. Such deals represent an approach that is non-bureaucratic, consensus-based and self-regulating, and it will help us move towards the goal of a zero-waste society. That aim was explored in some depth in the Conservative party&#146;s quality of life report.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o135"><a name="80424-0009.htm_para6"><a name="08042466000385">Archie Norman, former shadow Environment Secretary and chief executive of Asda, will develop the first deals of an incoming Conservative Government. We will go well beyond the Courtauld commitment, which also covers a small proportion of waste, and will tackle the whole spectrum of our resource management in retailing. This will present a huge opportunity to extend sustainable manufacturing and disposal of goods to other centres. We aim to ensure that anyone involved in designing or manufacturing a product will have to work out what will happen to it at the end of its life.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o136"><a name="80424-0009.htm_para7"><a name="08042466000386">We have seen time and again that the solutions to climate change and sustainability are to be found in partnership with business, not by confronting business. It is only through engaging with UK plc to drive dynamic industrial change right across the economy that we can hope to be effective in finding solutions. So, why have the Government U-turned on the Courtauld commitment? The commitment had the whole-hearted support of the major retailers and industry groups, so that decision has left them angry and confused.</p>

 It is a shame that the chief executives of major retailers do not agree with the Minister. People are concerned about the fact that the Government overlooked the Courtauld agreement and went for a gimmick in the Budget&#151;a little bit of a greenwash&#151;in the form of the plastic bags policy, rather than looking at the totality of the waste stream involved in the Courtauld agreement.</p>

Government of jumping on bandwagons and forgetting the issues that need to be addressed. Those are not my words but those of the chief executive of Sainsbury&#146;s.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o138"><a name="80424-0009.htm_para9"><a name="08042466000392">Why has the Chancellor decided to meddle, hanging the threat of compulsory taxation over the consumer and greatly angering retailers&#151;as the Minister discovered in person when she met Justin King on &#147;Newsnight&#148; last week?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o139"><a name="80424-0009.htm_para10"><a name="08042466000393">Why are the Government being accused by the retail sector of chasing headlines and reneging on their agreements? Is it because the Chancellor squeezed a splash of greenwash into his flawed Budget? If it was, then it was pretty weak greenwash. His plan has been attacked by most non-governmental organisations, which have rejected a ban on plastic bags. The Green Alliance, a leading environmental NGO, pointed out that a ban would be likely not to reduce emissions and might in fact help to increase them. Or was the aim to satisfy the popular press? Perhaps.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o140"><a name="80424-0009.htm_para11"><a name="08042466000394">I wholeheartedly agree that the scourge of bags that litter our streets and countryside and pollute our seas must be tackled, but the reduction of packaging and supermarket waste will be most effectively achieved hand in hand with retailers&#151;through designing out waste and educating the consumer to recycle and dispose of their rubbish responsibly&#151;not through gesture politics and fumbled greenwash.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o141"><a name="80424-0009.htm_para12"><a name="08042466000395">Tackling our waste stream is an essential part of tackling climate change. Waste threatens our wildlife and biodiversity and an ambitious waste policy is essential for a sustainable future, but political gestures about plastic bags are a poor substitute for an ambitious and thought-through whole-life waste strategy. For that, we will have to wait for a change of Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o144"><a name="80424-0009.htm_para15"><a name="08042466000399">We will get the final report and, if it is published on time, I assume that from May to September the so-called remedy steering group will finalise its mechanism for the new supermarket code of practice. The code of practice will be new, because the one that we have is fairly toothless. The group will also finalise the idea of the ombudsman. Some of us have had things to say about that in the past. There will be consultation on the subject, and no doubt the Competition Commission will have to talk to various supermarkets and look at how they will or will not respond. Later this year and early next year, we will see whether we need to legislate on the subject and, if we do, we will look at how we should do so. That will enable us to consider whether we can effectively judge and measure what the supermarkets say that they will do as against what they do. That is not before time.</p>

It was an important bit of legislation and it took a lot of effort to get it through the House, but now it offers local communities a chance to fight back against ghost-town and clone-town Britain and to put in place the remedies that we want in our local communities. It was an important piece of legislation that we can use to good effect to consider how to get some balance back into our high streets, our smaller communities and, indeed, our larger cities so that we do not feel that we are being monopolised by supermarkets.</p>

We have a number of supermarkets&#151;not many compared with the big guys, but still some. We support those supermarkets and see the benefit of supermarket shopping some of the time. The reality is that many of our small shops have either gone already or are under serious attack. They are under serious attack because of the power of the supermarkets and the fact that no one is prepared to stand against them.</p>

 Does the hon. Gentleman not accept that supermarkets do not put small businesses out of business, but customers do? If a customer wants to keep shopping at their local shop, their local butcher or their local baker, that shop will not go out of business.

 I am certain that I do not need to come to my hon. Friend&#146;s aid. I agree entirely with what he is saying. The supermarkets have deliberately targeted high street shops by, for example, putting a Tesco Metro on the high street to compete with small shops. They have used pricing policies to undercut the small corner shops and try to force them out of business. That is why the consumer does not shop there&#151;because it is cheaper in the supermarket.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o147"><a name="80424-0009.htm_para18"><a name="08042466000407">The supermarkets are now targeting pubs, which is why alcohol can be bought in supermarkets for less than it costs the supermarkets to buy it. In a debate on Monday night I gave the example that on Budget day, when alcohol duties went up, the price of a pint of whisky in the supermarkets was reduced by &#163;5. That is a classic example.</p>

There is not, to use a horrible term, a level playing field. It is a very unlevel playing field. That is why, in connection with the Competition Commission survey, I conducted a survey of the top 100 suppliers to supermarkets. I wrote to each of them in confidence, asking them three simple questions: first, whether they would be giving evidence; secondly, if they were giving evidence, whether they would share with me the basis of the points that they would make; and thirdly, whether they had any particular views on how supermarkets operate.</p>

The one substantive reply explained why the supplier concerned would not be giving evidence to the Competition Commission inquiry, despite the fact that, as the hon. Member for St. Ives knows, they could have done so in confidence with no names and no pack-drill. They still would not do so, because suppliers are scared rigid. I am talking not about the small local farmer, who is unable to have any real traction over the process of the supply chain, but about the everyday producers and major wholesalers that we all know about. They are scared rigid by the supermarkets, although not necessarily in the way that we would think.</p>

marketplace. If the supplier has not played the game and done things as the supermarkets want, the supermarkets can exert pressure and make all sorts of threats that they will not put the supplier&#146;s products on their shelves. There is a degree of malevolence in the process that is never really exposed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o151"><a name="80424-0009.htm_para22"><a name="08042466000412">In the end, to my shame, I did not give evidence to the Competition Commission inquiry because, my survey being the basis of my evidence, I had no evidence to give. Although those that gave evidence included some of the bigger suppliers, the number of suppliers that did not give evidence was overwhelming. They chose not to break ranks and not to say what they thought&#151;the things that they say behind the scenes, and sometimes openly in meetings that the hon. Member for St. Ives and I have with them. They will not say it in any way that could change policy, which I find terribly depressing.</p>

We cannot have much influence over it, because the great influencer&#151;Parliament itself&#151;cannot bring forth evidence, as people will not put on record what is going on and suppliers do not do enough. I make a plea to the Competition Commission to do what we ask and set up a proper process so that we can monitor supermarkets&#146; performance. We understood at the outset that the commission would be examining land banking, and it is good that it has moved away from that to consider some of the structural deficiencies in the marketplace, but the question is how that will work.</p>

Friend the Minister said about the need for supermarkets to be more responsible in how they handle waste, packaging and so on. They also need to be more responsible in how they operate per se, and should perform as moral, corporately socially responsible organisations. If they are not able to do that even with their larger suppliers, one must ask where the customer and local communities come into it. We see the consequences too often, and Britain&#146;s retail choice has declined because supermarkets have controlled the agenda completely, utterly and ruthlessly.</p>

I also introduced a ten-minute Bill on the matter in the previous parliamentary Session.

Given the huge power that supermarkets have in our society, I believe that they have a huge responsibility. Whether it is related to the fair trade movement, the impact on the environment of how their staff travel to work, the recycling that they do or their energy use, they need to take that responsibility seriously. We have just heard about the contracts for suppliers, which are important, and I would add to that the importance of involvement in the community. Often supermarkets are involved in a community but do not take the same interest as other, more local retailers, whether through local festivals or other such initiatives. I was surprised to hear that a group of traders in Milngavie, in my constituency, who are interested in a business improvement district, which sounds like an excellent idea, have heard that Tesco does not generally like to get involved with such things. To me, that seems a sad state of affairs. Surely we should encourage all retailers to be involved in the communities in which they operate.</p>

Voluntary agreements are preferable to regulation when they can be proven to work, but I have asked a range of parliamentary questions about the Courtauld commitment and it still seems unclear where the benchmark is and how it will be measured. One answer that I received stated that each Courtauld signatory declares its total packaging use each year, but another stated:</p>

The ineffectiveness of the packaging regulations means that there have been very few prosecutions, and public awareness of them is low.

 Does my hon. Friend agree that supermarkets tend to insist on suppliers using packaging that is often much more expensive than could be achieved otherwise? The supermarkets are involved in driving up the costs of packaging and the extent to which it is used.</p>

about packaging. The effort may be visible, but it is not of the greatest importance in the overall campaign. The Minister knows that the evidence is mixed as to whether taxes reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and about whether there are negative effects of increased other bag use. I welcome the fact that the charge being considered will take into account what bags are made from. That is an important factor, as heavier bags lead to higher greenhouse gas emissions, but I still think that a voluntary approach is best.</p>

It is therefore a shame that we have only 90 minutes for this important debate, and that attendance in the Chamber is not better.</p>

I agree with the hon. Member for East Dunbartonshire that we must be careful not to react to public opinion by introducing measures that science tells us are wrong. For instance, incandescent light bulbs are to be banned in favour of so-called low-energy bulbs, but people need to understand what such a bulb&#146;s power factor means. I shall try to explain.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o168"><a name="80424-0010.htm_para10"><a name="08042466000436">A low-energy bulb with a power factor of 1 demands as much power from the generating station as does a conventional bulb. Technically, therefore, a light bulb is not low energy unless it has a power factor of 0.9 or less. Most low-energy light bulbs on sale in this country have a power factor of about 3, which means that they use three times as much power as an ordinary bulb. Consumers need to know that information if they are to make the right choice, but it is not widely available. That problem is one that the Institute of Lighting Engineers is trying to highlight, and we should bear it in mind.</p>

been well rehearsed. We all want to reduce the amount of packaging used, but no one can say how much is excessive. Some packaging is needed to present information about the product inside. For example, people with a peanut allergy can make use of the traffic light system to find out about ingredients, and consumers are now asking for packaging to contain information about the obesity risks of a product, or its salt or fat content.</p>

 I take the hon. Gentleman&#146;s agreement as confirmation that supermarkets are considering that approach. I should be happy to let consumers decide on all such matters, as long as they have all the information needed to make a proper judgment.

<p><a name="stpa_o170"><a name="80424-0010.htm_para12"><a name="08042466000442">Packaging is needed for reasons of hygiene. People ask why coconuts are wrapped in clingfilm, given that they have a hard shell. However, the shell is covered in fibres that can break off and get in other food products, with the result that people might choke. Some products need to wrapped for safety, others to facilitate their transport. For instance, why is a tube of toothpaste put in a cardboard box? The answer is simple: it is easier to stack the boxes than the tubes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o171"><a name="80424-0010.htm_para13"><a name="08042466000443">The main reason for the packing that we see in all our shops is that the consumer demands it because it is convenient.

That is why a lot of our packaging is the way that it is.</p>

When my young children have their toys, which I am obliged to buy for them very regularly, they come packaged in paper, metal, plastic, wood and every other kind of thing that one can imagine. When we bought toys or when they were bought for us as children, they came very simply packaged. I am not sure this is about information; it is about unnecessary packaging. One could use many other examples of the way that packaging is, frankly, out of control. Surely the hon. Gentleman would agree with that.</p>

 To a certain extent, I would, but I do not think for a minute that packaging is out of control. Packaging manufacturers do not make packaging for the fun of it. They do not spend money unnecessarily. They want to get away with the least amount of packaging around a product that they can, because obviously the more materials they use, the more money it costs them. They have a vested interest in reducing packaging as well.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o172"><a name="80424-0010.htm_para14"><a name="08042466000446">The hon. Gentleman gives a good example: toys.

The egg is about 4 in long and the packet is 2 ft wide.</p>

 No, I do not think so. I shall go back to the beginning and start with packaging, information, hygiene and so on. The hon. Members for Shipley and for East Dunbartonshire can speak about marketing far better than I can&#151;I have no experience in it. Some excess packaging is the result of marketing, but some packaging is essential. The glaring example is perfume. Quite often, more money is invested in the packaging and the bottle that the perfume comes in than in its contents. Another example is an alcoholic drink called Malibu&#151;not that I drink it, but I have seen the bottles made in my constituency. Anyone who has seen a bottle of Malibu knows that it is a glass bottle, which is painted white. Orange and brown are then painted on to the white paint by an electro-magnetic process&#151;positive and negative charges cause the paint to fly on to the bottle. Given the technology involved in making those bottles, they cost about 30p each. That is about twice as much as the value of the pint of alcoholic drink that goes into the bottle.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman is making an excellent speech and a lot of pertinent points that are often not made. He mentioned hygiene, but I am not sure whether he mentioned another factor: keeping products fresh. For example, packaged cucumbers keep fresh for longer. Does he agree that, given that we want to cut down on food waste as well, such packaging is a good thing, not a bad thing?</p>

 The hon. Gentleman makes an excellent point, which I did not mention. I am glad that he has raised it, because it is valid. A lot of consumers complain about seeing vegetables, particularly salad vegetables, wrapped in a thin layer of cling film and suggest that that is excessive packaging. Last year, there was a demonstration in the House by Marks and Spencer, which brought in two items of vegetables, both bought in the same shop on the same day. One of them was immediately wrapped in cling film; the other was not. They were brought into the House for a meeting, where hon. Members could see them, and it was obvious that the one without the cling film was deteriorating far more rapidly that the other one.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o173"><a name="80424-0010.htm_para15"><a name="08042466000451">As the hon. Gentleman points out, there is a need for packaging, and it comes down to convenience and freshness. People shop in supermarkets for convenience weekly or fortnightly, or whatever. They want that food to last longer, so that they do have to go to the shop, as people used to do, every day or every other day and so on. I am speaking in defence of the industry; I am chairman of the all-party packaging group, so I would, wouldn&#146;t I? I want to get across the point about balance. The industry is co-operating with the Government, through the Courtauld agreement and so on, to try to address these issues, and it wants to do so. However, the issue can become sensationalised.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o174"><a name="80424-0010.htm_para16"><a name="08042466000452">Last year, we saw the campaign in <i> The Independent</i><i> </i>newspaper that highlighted four issues over four days. The <i> Daily Mail</i> did the same thing. We experience the sensationalism of news reporters taking a shop load of stuff from a supermarket and depositing it on the counter to make a point. The danger is that the problem will be exaggerated out of all proportion. We need some balance and further debate to consider what is excess packaging and what we can reduce and lightweight.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o175"><a name="80424-0010.htm_para17"><a name="08042466000453">Lightweighting is an important point. My constituency contains one of the largest glass manufacturers in western Europe. It manufactures a very popular beer bottle, and it has just taken 1.5 g out of that third of a pint beer bottle. As a result, the cost saving to the industry is remarkable and the amount of glass used in that product is reduced. That is a huge success, but the number of bottles that are broken when they are transported from the factory to the brewery has increased dramatically because the structure of bottle is not as solid; it has been lightweighted. We must be careful that we do not damage products in seeking to lightweight them. The hon. Gentleman also made the point that food waste is the biggest problem that we face in waste disposal at the moment. As the Minister said, we waste a third of all our food. That is an absolute disgrace, and we should address it before we even think about looking at plastic bags, packing waste and so on.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o176"><a name="80424-0010.htm_para18"><a name="08042466000454">On food waste and recycling, the Minister pointed out that she has increased the target for the recycling of packing waste and other materials. Again, I make the plea that the quality of recycled material in this country is not good enough to be used in certain industries as recyclate. The glass industry is a classic example. The glass is mixed with other products&#151;often paper and other materials that can be recycled&#151;and is so badly contaminated that it is unusable. Local authorities have no real restrictions placed on them or proper targets for separating collected material and delivering it to recyclers in such a way that it can be reused. In fact, most local authorities have a different collection system from the collection authority next door. Some authorities collect some materials; others do not collect that material. We have got a mix and match, and local authorities are required to collect by weight. They simply have to collect and recycle a certain weight of material, not specifically separated materials.</p>

Different areas a few miles apart have completely different systems. In my area, we have waste separation at the kerbside, but constituents are concerned and say, &#147;But in Glasgow, it all just goes in one big bin. Why can&#146;t we have that?&#148; It is difficult to get such issues across. People assume that their recycling is being used again in this country. Perhaps having more guidance on the best schemes that local authorities could use would be help in getting a common scheme across more local authorities.</p>

 The hon. Lady is exactly right. I entirely agree with her. Some of the material collected does not get used in this country. Plastic bags are an example. We collect the plastic and ship it over to China, because it can use it and we cannot. We have nowhere that can recycle the plastic from plastic bags, so it goes abroad. Plastic bags make up about 0.05 per cent. of the landfill waste&#151;a miniscule amount. The plastic is recyclable, but we cannot recycle it, because no one in this country can do it.</p>

However, the amount of plastic being used has been reduced by 14 per cent. against that 25 per cent. target. We have to determine what the target is.

 We do, and I will come on to that, because it is an important point when we are talking about waste. I agree with the Minister that people have a love-hate relationship with supermarkets. Supermarkets get a lot of bad press and people get very angry about the subject. When we read about supermarkets, the context is usually that people want to put one on the edge of a town or city, and some local people are very angry about it, or that a local authority has turned down the application, or that the supermarket has won on appeal. Or the issue might be the plastic bags or packaging. Controversy is normally involved when we read about supermarkets.</p>

 Having said that&#151;I assure my hon. Friend that he will not enjoy all of my speech&#151;supermarkets are seen as posing a threat to the smaller trader; there is no doubt about it.

In some cases, I suspect that that is done to get around some of the Sunday trading legislation, but it is also done because there is a lot of demand for shopping on the high street in towns and villages. Increasingly, we see such stores as a threat to small shops in the independent sector.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o184"><a name="80424-0011.htm_para2"><a name="08042466000471">I agree that retailers have a responsibility, too. If consumers stopped going to the smaller supermarkets, turnover would decline, profit would disappear and the stores simply would not survive. I suppose that the next threat will increasingly be online shopping. It would be pointless for us to say, &#147;This is dreadful; small stores are being put out of business because people are shopping online.&#148; Consumers are busy people. They shop online not because it is more difficult, but because it is easier and they prefer that method. Give it another 10 years and we may see a huge change in the way in which people do their shopping. Some of the larger retail supermarkets may even go into decline as a result of people preferring to shop online.</p>

 Supermarkets seem to be in a no-win situation. If they open on an out-of-town site, people say, &#147;They&#146;re destroying the high street. It&#146;s outrageous; it&#146;s bad for the environment, because people are driving to these out-of-town stores.&#148; When supermarkets open a store on the high street, they are criticised for going into head-to-head competition with independent retailers. People have to decide at some point where they want supermarkets to go. The out-of-town supermarkets are often successful because they offer convenient locations and free parking. Perhaps local authorities could do more for smaller retailers by stopping excessive parking charges and restrictions, which prevent people from using smaller high-street retailers.</p>

 My hon. Friend makes an important point. In many towns and cities, there are high car parking charges, yet parking is free outside supermarkets. I do not believe that the answer is to start charging shoppers to park outside supermarkets; that is ludicrous. Shoppers would not be too happy, and, funnily enough, shoppers are voters. It would be a brave political party that put such a measure into a manifesto.</p>

 I am grateful to my hon. Friend for giving me the opportunity to be the voice of sanity against the defenders of Mammon. My hon. Friend the Member for Shipley (Philip Davies) seems to suggest that convenience should necessarily triumph over quality, and that ubiquity should replace service. As a small shopkeeper, my hon. Friend the Member for Ribble Valley (Mr. Evans) knows that small shops do much more than supermarkets to inform and characterise communities. We need diversity for the consumer. We also need to recognise the aesthetic of small shops and what they do for our communities, and the damaging aesthetic of supermarkets. They are brutal, ugly things, and that needs to be said in this place and elsewhere.</p>

 I feel a bit like an umpire now. I am glad that I am between my hon. Friend the Member for Shipley (Philip Davies) and my hon. Friend the Member for South Holland and The Deepings (Mr. Hayes), just in case they try to get at one another during my speech. There are elements of truth in what both my hon. Friends have to say about supermarkets, but only elements. We have to look at the issue seriously. If we want the small trader sector to survive, it will take a bit more than sitting back and saying, &#147;We&#146;ll just see what happens.&#148; I can tell hon. Members what will happen: give it another 10 years and small shops will carry on disappearing, and their numbers will decline. We have all seen specialist shops and stores such as mine being put under pressure in our constituencies.</p>

disappeared, and then, one by one, the shops on the square started to disappear or combine. We are down to about four shops now in our area. There is a lot of pressure on the smaller stores: costs are always increasing, for example as a result of rising staff costs and the minimum wage. I am not making a point about that&#151;I am just saying that that is the reality, and that there is a cost attached. Smaller stores have to pay bank charges, but they do not have clout with the banks. I am sure that supermarkets have a lot of clout in negotiations with the banks, but smaller stores do not, and bank charges are disproportionately high for the smaller trader. Insurance costs are high, and business rates can be extremely high. We have discussed packaging&#151;indeed, I thought that I was attending a debate on packaging at one stage, not on supermarkets&#151;and we should remember that all the goods that come into supermarkets are already packaged. There is a good reason why cigarettes, for instance, are packed in cardboard boxes: we want to protect the goods inside, although I accept that many of them are wrapped in cellophane, too. The worst thing for a retailer is to see the product smashed in at the corners during delivery, as it is very expensive for them if they cannot get their money back from the wholesaler or the manufacturer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o186"><a name="80424-0011.htm_para4"><a name="08042466000479">Rubbish costs for smaller stores are disproportionately high. Such costs used to be included in business rates but, all of a sudden, retailers were asked to pay a separate refuse charge on top of business rates that runs into several hundreds of pounds a year. If we want the smaller trader to survive we must look carefully at how we will achieve that, and it may require Government action. We have discussed a laissez-faire approach from Government to legislation on supermarkets, but if we want smaller traders to survive, Ministers must sit down, work out what the problems are for smaller traders and see what can be done to assist them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o187"><a name="80424-0011.htm_para5"><a name="08042466000480">I shall make just a couple more points, as I know that the hon. Member for St. Ives (Andrew George) wishes to make a speech. We should not go down the road of taxing plastic bags. I fully accept what the hon. Member for Barnsley, Central (Mr. Illsley) said about the Irish experience: we should learn from that experience, but we must be realistic. The same argument applies to low-energy light bulbs: if the hon. Gentleman is right, people are consuming more energy, or more energy is used by some low-energy light bulbs. That problem could arise in the manufacture of plastics, given the Irish experience. If we introduced a charge on plastic bags, I suspect that it would be regarded as just another stealth tax that had nothing to do with efforts to dissuade people from using plastic bags. Tesco encourages people not to use plastic bags by giving them green points on their club card if they use their own bag. We should use more carrots to encourage the reuse of plastic bags, but I accept that people use them for their rubbish. They are not always put in bin bags, and many of them are reused. We must, however, conduct proper research to make sure that biodegradable plastic bags are the norm: it should not take 1,000 years for them to disappear, but only a brief time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o188"><a name="80424-0011.htm_para6"><a name="08042466000481">Far more research is needed on that problem, and more must be done to encourage supermarkets to  <br>

source products locally. Booths in my region sources 75 per cent. of its fresh meat and 42 per cent. of its bread products from Cumbria, Lancashire, Cheshire and Yorkshire, which is where its stores are located. It does a fantastic amount of work with local producers and, indeed, it helped local milk producers to form a consortium and, as a result, now sells Bowland milk. That is a superb form of marketing that has worked. There are many farming families where I live, and they support such initiatives, because they know how important they are.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o189"><a name="80424-0011.htm_para7"><a name="08042466000482">I want to mention buy one, get one free, or BOGOF as it is known. The Minister talked about the need for less packaging, and she was right with regard to some products. However, we have heard the counter-argument that that may lead food to decay more quickly, and there are instances of that happening. For people buying single items of food, particularly fresh produce, that is an important consideration. Elderly people who live on their own, for example, do not want to buy large quantities of food, because it goes off before they can eat it, so it is wasted. The same argument applies to buy one, get one free. Some of those offers are fantastic, and I am as guilty as anyone else: I am happy to buy one and get the other one for free, but the second item goes off before I have a chance to eat it. I would much prefer to encourage manufacturers and supermarkets to get together and offer the stuff half-price: it would amount to the same thing, and there would be less waste. We do buy one, get one free in our store through our wholesaler&#151;we have to do so, because all the advertising blurb is about BOGOF&#151;but I would much prefer a move to half-price items if possible.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o190"><a name="80424-0011.htm_para8"><a name="08042466000483">Finally, we must look again at the power of supermarkets in relation to suppliers. There is an underlying belief that some supermarkets have such huge power&#151;this is based on what the hon. Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew) said, and his explanation of why he received so few submissions in his survey&#151;and have such a hold over people that they can dictate the price at which products come into the store. They then say how much the product will cost on the shelves, and manufacturers do not have much of a say: if they do not play ball, their goods will disappear from the shelves, and a competitor who does play ball will put their goods on the shelves. We have to be realistic about the power of the supermarkets, and see what we can do to ensure that the balance is made fairer. At the end of the day, we want consumers to be the real winners.</p>

Ribble Valley (Mr. Evans) made in his conclusion but, in passing, I will make a few other points, if I have time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o192"><a name="80424-0011.htm_para10"><a name="08042466000486">The hon. Member for Bexhill and Battle (Gregory Barker) prefaced each of his references to the Government with an acerbic adjective, and he clearly did not want to persuade the Minister to accept his point of view. My hon. Friend&#151;I think that that is probably the right expression&#151;the Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew) described me as witchfinder-general: the Vincent Price of the Chamber, the witchfinder-general of the anti-supermarket brigade. I do not want to give the impression that I am some kind of deranged evangelical zealot; I have always wanted to present a calm, objective analysis of the issue, with a dose of healthy scepticism.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o193"><a name="80424-0011.htm_para11"><a name="08042466000487">I want to address issues concerning suppliers and producers, and the impact of out-of-town supermarkets. I understand why the Government have effectively entered into a love affair with supermarkets. It seems as if the Prime Minister brought the supermarkets into his big tent, before the big tent was properly open. One can easily be seduced into believing that the supermarkets have helped to deliver the Government&#146;s policy of low inflation. The latest food crisis has demonstrated that the Government need to give equal attention to producers who, with suppliers, can also contribute to the achievement of low inflation. It is not simply the supermarkets that do so, and they have had suppliers under the cosh in recent years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o194"><a name="80424-0011.htm_para12"><a name="08042466000488">I am not arguing and I never have argued that supermarkets are evil or that their chief executives are the product of the loins of the devil. Their actions to press their suppliers until the pips squeak and to gobble up their smaller competitors are merely the rational product of the climate in which they operate. If they did not push their suppliers against the wall and squeeze every last ounce of benefit for themselves out of them, if they did not gobble up their smaller competitors, and if their competitors in the supermarket sector were doing that, they would clearly lose market share and their shareholders would not be happy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o195"><a name="80424-0011.htm_para13"><a name="08042466000489">It is not that those organisations are fundamentally bad; they are behaving rationally. The question that we need to ask ourselves and the one that I have been putting to the Competition Commission and the Office of Fair Trading for years is whether we have reached a point where the supermarkets have moved from successful and appropriate use of market muscle to inappropriate abuse of market muscle. That is the issue which, I believe, the Competition Commission has intended to address as part of its inquiry.</p>

three other inquiries into the power of the supermarkets. The latest one started in May 2006 and the report from the Competition Commission is due out on 8 May this year. I attended an evidence session on 13 March, at which I, on behalf of a number of other sector organisations, went through some of the evidence and the preliminary recommendations in the report.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o197"><a name="80424-0011.htm_para15"><a name="08042466000493">It is clear that the suppliers have not been satisfied. I made representations to the Competition Commission in an attempt to persuade it to extend the remit of its inquiry. A wide range of groups, including the Association of Convenience Stores, the NFU, Friends of the Earth and ActionAid, were represented on the Cross-Cutting group, which represented both brand names and other suppliers and those who were in competition with the supermarkets. We presented the Competition Commission last year with two submissions, one about an adjudicator, which it has called an ombudsman, and the other about planning issues. The findings so far are extremely encouraging. I do not have time today, but I would welcome an opportunity to debate the issues with Ministers in the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform when the report comes out.</p>

Important progress has been made by the Competition Commission, which should be congratulated. I hope the Minister will take these messages on board.</p>

 I shall respond briefly to the final points made in the debate, which echoed those made by my hon. Friend the Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew) and the hon. Member for Ribble Valley (Mr. Evans). A number of the points made by my hon. Friend the Member for Stroud were directed to the Competition Commission, and I am sure we will draw its attention to that. As I said earlier, I will take the other comments back to my colleagues and ensure that they are properly heard. Many important points, particularly about the responsibilities towards suppliers, were well made.</p>

In the few minutes remaining I cannot refer to all their speeches, but let me tackle a couple of issues, particularly the free use of give-away bags. At the start of the agreement, 13 billion such bags were in circulation. We understand that the reduction is 1 billion. It would take 12 more years to get rid of the remaining bags. We think that needs to be done. That is why we are addressing the issue. The public want it. It is a symbol of our wasteful society, and if we are trying to encourage behaviour change, as we are, we need to respond.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o200"><a name="80424-0011.htm_para18"><a name="08042466000497">In Ireland the issue was one of taxation, but that is not the case in the United Kingdom.

At the beginning of the year I said that this year would see the biggest changes that we have made to the immigration system and to our border security for 45 years. The House will know from the Prime Minister&#146;s statements on national security earlier in the year that the Government are radically changing the way that we police our borders, with the creation of the UK Border Agency, with fingerprint visas abroad, compulsory ID cards at home and new systems that will replace those that were phased out in 1994 to count people in and out of the country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o205"><a name="80424-0012.htm_para1"><a name="08042466000503">Alongside the new systems to police the way people move across our borders, the points system will help us to decide in the first place who should or should not have the right to come through those borders to work or to study. We have published proposals to change the way in which we judge not only who can come to the UK, but who can stay in the UK. Those proposals were set out in our Green Paper on earned citizenship.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o206"><a name="80424-0012.htm_para2"><a name="08042466000504">Amid all the changes coming into place this year, undoubtedly the points system is among the most important that we are making. I am grateful for the timing of today&#146;s debate. It is especially fortuitous because although we have introduced the points system for highly skilled migrants&#151;that started earlier this year&#151;it will be after purdah that we seek to publish important statements of intent for the next stages of the points system. Today&#146;s debate will allow me to reflect on contributions from right hon. and hon. Members before we finalise that policy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o208"><a name="80424-0012.htm_para4"><a name="08042466000506">The statements of intent will not, of course, be the final word.

However, the House will be pleased that I do not plan to make that detour this afternoon. I will, however, underline the economic benefits that I think and hope are recognised on both sides of the House. Earlier this year, the House of Lords produced a report about the economic benefits of migration. I thought that it made rather better reading than the press notices and some of the commentary on the day. I was especially grateful that the report confirmed my own judgment that gross domestic product per capita should be the principal judge of the contribution that migration makes to this country.</p>

They said that they wanted to grow dramatically the population of their city in the following 10 years and that, however hard they tried, they would not achieve that by encouraging their citizens to breed faster. They recognised that immigration would be an important part of their overall plans for regenerating and setting out a new future for their community.</p>

House of Lords Committee&#146;s consideration of GDP per capita. If he was, may I draw his attention to what is perhaps a rather nerdish or statistical point? That figure is derived from the division of one very large number by another, so it is really important when we use it as evidence that it should be set within a statistical context. I suspect that levels of migration would have to be hugely greater than at present for one to be able to say with any certainty whether migration was or was not statistically significantly affecting GDP per capita.</p>

 My hon. Friend has guessed the point that I was about to make. The House of Lords criticised the idea of using GDP per capita because it seemed to result in quite a small number. However, as my hon. Friend says, when one divides the GDP contribution of migrants by the total population of the UK, of course the number will be small because 87 per cent. of the work force is British. The one good report in this area, which was published by Dustmann et al in 2007, points to an economic contribution of GDP per capita through migration over the past decade of about half the total contribution to GDP per capita that has been made by upskilling the labour force. So yes, the number is small, but it is not insignificant.</p>

 I am sure the Minister knows that a great deal of the statistical basis that we use is based on sampling. However, under the electoral roll arrangements all local authorities are required to have available information on foreign nationals, with a penalty of &#163;1,000 for failure to supply it. What is astonishing, however, is that the figures are not then passed on to the Office for National Statistics. Does the Minister agree that it would be extremely useful to be able to correlate the information in the local authority archives, without disclosing names and addresses and so on, to enable us to get a much firmer statistical base than under the current sampling arrangements?</p>

 We need to take several measures in order to ensure that we have proper statistics. That was a valid part of the House of Lords&#146; criticism. First, we must arrange systems for counting people in and out of the country. Parties on both sides of the House bear some responsibility for the fact that we are unable to do that. Exit controls were phased out in 1994, and this Government finished the job in the late 1990s. I have consistently said that that was a mistake. Reintroducing systems to count people in and out of the country, as we will by Christmas, is a vital first step. However, we then have to deal with the resident population who are already here. The Office for National Statistics is doing several things through reform of the labour force survey and other household surveys. However, I have to say to the hon. Gentleman that over the long term ID cards for foreign nationals will make a more important contribution because they will be compulsory for all foreign nationals living in this country. Under the terms of the UK Borders Act 2007, foreign nationals will have to register their addresses, and over time that will give us the best possible measure of where people are living and how they are moving around.</p>

Since 1997, the number of NEETs&#151;young people not in education, employment or training&#151;has grown by about 15 per cent. Many of them are unskilled, and many of the migrants coming into Britain are doing unskilled jobs. Lord Leitch argues that the demand for unskilled labour will fall during the next 10 years or so.

during the past 10 years, the employment rate among British nationals has gone up, which has happened at the same time as average wages have gone up each year, and while productivity has gone up. A rather good article in <i> The Economist</i> a few weeks ago showed that GDP per capita had gone up by something like 2.4 per cent. in each year during the past decade.

 On the point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for South Holland and The Deepings (Mr. Hayes), the Minister will know from his statistics that there are two measures of the total amount of inward migration into the country&#151;not net migration, but total migration. The one to which he referred shows inward migration of 529,000 and the total international migration figure, which I think is the preferred statistic, is 591,000. When one subtracts the emigration figure from that, one is left with a very high figure for net migration of 190,000. Can the Minister tell us of any year in history when the total inward migration figure was higher than 591,000, according to the total international migration statistics or any others that he wants to produce?</p>

 I am not sure whether it ever has been higher, but I think that there is now a degree of consensus between us. I am doing this slightly from memory because although I am a keen student of the speeches and comments of the hon. Member for Ashford (Damian Green), I do not have a photographic memory. Many of us have come to recognise that it is the net balance that is important; we have to look at how many people are coming in versus how many are leaving. The net balance for the last year for which statistics are available was about 190,000, which is substantially down on previous years. In fact, it is about 23 or 24 per cent. lower than previous years. I see that the hon. Gentleman disagrees.</p>

 It is still a very high figure. The figure of 190,000, which is the long-term projection for net migration, is equivalent to a city the size of Milton Keynes, as the House of Lords pointed out in its report. The Government cannot control emigration&#151;although they may drive people to want to leave the country&#151;but they can control the total figure for inward migration through their policies. I put the question again to the Minister: bearing in mind the Government&#146;s policies of issuing work permits, the policies they adopted towards the EU accession 8 countries and all their other polices, can he name a time in history when there has been a higher figure than 591,000?</p>

As a Minister, one welcomes people taking an interest in one&#146;s work. However, he must accept that, around the world, people are on the move. Global migration has doubled since the 1960s. The net migration rate to the UK is pretty much the OECD average; there are several countries to which net migration is higher. There is a similar pattern of people on the move in industrialising countries. Indeed, in China last week I was told about the migration of people from western to eastern China&#151;some people believe that that is the largest movement of people in human history. People move around. Over the centuries, they have moved for three reasons: love, work and war. If anything, the patterns are changing faster, but that comes with industrialisation. If the hon. Gentleman looks back over a couple of hundred years of economic history&#151;the World Bank and others have produced good reports on that&#151;he will realise that great patterns of globalisation are normally accompanied by big movements of people.</p>

 The Minister has been generous in giving way. However, the problem with his argument is that, in 1997, as in 2007, many people wanted to move from countries where incomes were lower to this country, where incomes are higher. However, as soon as his Government came to power, they substantially increased the number of work permits&#151;the number issued in 1997 has trebled, as was said in the House of Lords.

year. I shall not dwell on policies on tier 1&#151;the programme for highly skilled migrants&#151;because it is now operational. However, tier 2, the system for work permits, and tier 5, the system for temporary workers, are still to come.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o215"><a name="80424-0013.htm_para1"><a name="08042466000541">I believe that tier 2 will be the most important. It will replace work permits and is aimed at enabling UK employers to recruit individuals from outside the European economic area to take a specific job that cannot be filled by a British or EEA worker. Employers in that category can sponsor migrant workers for a visa application only if they have a licence that shows that we have checked them and confirmed that they are genuine organisations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o216"><a name="80424-0013.htm_para2"><a name="08042466000542">Tier 2 will operate according to five principles. First, migrants will be required to show some command of the English language. I will listen hard to the debate about the standard that we should seek. Secondly, all jobs that are not in shortage occupations or intra-company transfers will be required to fulfil a resident labour market test before a migrant can be recruited. If migrants wish to change employers once in the UK under the scheme, the job to which they want to switch will also have to fulfil a resident labour market test. Thirdly, migrants who are not filling jobs on the shortage occupation list will be required to earn points through their qualifications and prospective earnings. Fourthly, low skilled or no skilled migration from outside the EU will be ended. Fifthly, there will be a maintenance requirement to show that migrants have the ability to support themselves for the first month that they are here. Within the framework of those five principles there is of course an enormous amount of detail, on which I look forward to hearing the House&#146;s views.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o217"><a name="80424-0013.htm_para3"><a name="08042466000544">The shortage occupation list is so important that it is worth a few more words. The idea behind the shortage occupation list is that if particular jobs are extremely difficult to fill in the UK, we should make it easier for employers to fill them, with there being some kind of trump. A place on the shortage occupation list is therefore something of a prize. I am absolutely convinced that decisions about jobs that go on the shortage occupation list should not be made in a dark room in the Home Office, but debated in public and made on the basis of evidence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o218"><a name="80424-0013.htm_para4"><a name="08042466000545">Independent advice on such decisions is helpful, which is why the Migration Advisory Committee has started on the job. It has been asked to study three questions: what is a skilled job; what is a shortage; and what skilled labour shortages does it makes sense to fill through migration rather than domestic labour? The committee&#146;s call for evidence has already been published. I would urge anyone who is interested to get hold of a copy of the questionnaire and send it back to the chair.

 Absolutely. I congratulate my hon. Friend on his work not only on understanding the detail of the problem, but on bringing together the Chinese community in London and nationally to meet me and put across the arguments. He rightly draws attention to the problem in getting the policy right, which is that the evidence available to the Government from taking a top-down view will go down to only a certain level. However, shortages will quite often emerge in occupations that do not happen to have a Government statistic for them. Therefore, as David Metcalf, the chair of the Migration Advisory Committee, has understood and accepted, we need to solicit bottom-up information, too.</p>

 Before I give way, let me make one point about the three questions that the committee has to consider. When we study those, we have to look at what is happening in our labour market, too. We would all acknowledge, for instance, that unemployment in the Bangladeshi community is 9 per cent., which is almost twice the national average. In the Chinese community, the figure is 5 per cent., which is a little above the UK national average. If we look at a specific region such as my own in the west midlands, we find that the employment rate in the Bangladeshi community is 40.6 per cent. That is nearly half the national average employment rate.</p>

 I want to return to the point that my hon. Friend just raised about his officials not suggesting that Latvians or Poles should be employed as chefs in restaurants serving Chinese or other cuisines. If we say that low-skilled jobs must be filled only from within the EU&#151;that often means eastern European migrant labour&#151;the implication is that, although it might not affect the first or second tier of chefs, migrant labour from eastern Europe could be used to fill the jobs below that level, within the kitchen. That is the message that my hon. Friend&#146;s Department has communicated, and it is the one that troubles people the most.</p>

 That would be a troubling implication, which is why I am deliberately drawing attention to the fact that, in some communities and cities in this country, levels of unemployment are remaining high, despite the progress that has been made over the past decade. That is why we have to look long and hard to find the right balance between bringing in skills from overseas and providing investment in training for those in our resident labour force, especially those who are out of work.</p>

 The Minister makes an eminently reasonable point, but if the House&#151;and, I suspect, many of his Back Benchers&#151;are to be persuaded that this is a serious point, perhaps he needs to tell us what discussions he has had with other Departments about the training that might bring unemployed people in the Bangladeshi community, for example, into these kind of roles.

 The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right. The work that we have to do in this area through our migration policy is inseparable from the work that has to be conducted in other parts of the Government on investment in skills and investment in getting people back to work. That is why immigration reform and the points system have to be seen in the context of a skills budget that will rise from &#163;500 million in 2007-08 to more than &#163;1 billion in 2010-11. The doubling of that figure will provide the investment that will take us from the position in 1994 when only 40 per cent. of people had level 2 qualifications towards our goal of ensuring that 80 per cent. of adults are qualified to level 2 by 2011. The hon. Gentleman is right to say that the questions are inseparably linked.</p>

allowed to reach the market clearing level, the supply will, by definition, equal the demand. If demand changes, employers have to start paying more, but they might be reluctant to do so. They might prefer to employ cheap labour from abroad. In that sense, a shortage could persist only if a Government did not allow wages to rise to the market clearing level. When we kept nurses&#146; pay below the market clearing level, we had a shortage of nurses and had to import them from abroad. When we raised their pay&#151;as I had long urged&#151;we found that we had a surplus of domestic nurses.</p>

 The right hon. Gentleman is right in much of what he says, having studied the question in some depth. I have studied his recently published Centre for Policy Studies pamphlet and he is right to say that our view of this question is affected by the time frame that we are studying. It is also right, as our noble Friends pointed out in the other place, that any immigration reform has to go alongside much tougher enforcement around the low-wage economy. It was absolutely right for the House of Lords to point out that low wages legislation needs to be enforced much more robustly, particularly for those wages below the national minimum wage. That is partly why we have increased the number of working operations regarded as illegal by 40 per cent. over the last year. Where there is abuse at the lower end of the wage market, it is important to try to drive it out.</p>

 I absolutely agree with that point, which is not unrelated to that raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Hendon. Relying on existing published Government statistics in this area is very difficult because those statistics do not go down to the level of specialism where shortages can emerge. We also need to acknowledge a geographical dimension to the question, as the availability of labour may be fairly sticky in some parts of the country. That is why the Migration Advisory Committee was asked to draw up a shortage occupation list for Scotland. There are two related problems: one is defining an occupation at a sufficiently detailed level in and of itself to understand whether it is skilled; but we also need to look, secondly, at bottom-up evidence for whether there is a particular shortage in a specific occupation. The chairman of the Migration Advisory Committee will thus need to look into movement in wage rates, as that might indicate a particular shortage in this area. The job cannot be done from a desk in the London School of Economics, where Mr. Metcalf is based. It is necessary to get out   <br>

 Returning to the subject of ethnic restaurants, the Minister said that second-generation south Asian young people could be trained to do catering and cooking, but I have to say, with respect, that that is a real McKinsey consultant&#146;s point of view. The point is that second-generation Bangladeshi young people do not want to be restaurateurs in the same way that second-generation Jamaican girls, of whom I am one, did not want to be nurses and second and third-generation Irish young people did not want to be labourers. Communities move on, which still leaves our ethnic restaurants requiring skilled labour to meet the demand for the delicious food we all enjoy so much.</p>

We set up the Migration Advisory Committee because we recognised the problems caused by the Government&#146;s plucking shortages out of the air. We wanted an independent study.

 I shall certainly try my utmost, although I may not get it right on every occasion. In creating the points system, we are trying to remove a degree of  the instability which has bedevilled changes in the immigration rules over the past 40 or 50 years. We want a system that is more open, transparent, predictable and stable, and an end to policy changes that are not anticipated and are often retrospective.</p>

the world, and it is an important part of our economy, worth some &#163;8.5 billion. Another 74,000 of the people who came in were dependants&#151;and there is now a degree of consensus that we should not reintroduce the primary purpose rule, which this Government abolished in 1997. That leaves the number of non-EU citizens coming to this country to work, which the Office for National Statistics says is about 101,000. If we were to add in a reasonable share of their dependants, that would mean that about 140,000 people will be affected by the proposed cap. That is, of course, only about 30 per cent. of the non-British people who came in. In effect, therefore, the proposed cap is not really a cap at all; it is more of a colander.</p>

The unfortunate reality is that we cannot truly know about anything because the cap is a secret&#151;we do not know how big, or small, it is.

 It is always enlightening to hear the Minister describe and defend the Government&#146;s immigration policies; as ever, the imperturbable was defending the indefensible. Before I go on to investigate the gaping chasm between the world and the immigration system described by the Minister and the world in which the people of this country live, I should express some sympathy for him, because he has an impossible job. I say that not because it is impossible to run an efficient immigration system in this country, although  I do not underestimate the challenge, but because he must claim, as he did at the start of his speech, that everything that the Government are doing on immigration, such as the introduction of the points-based system, is a radical, once-in-a-generation change. He must do that without admitting that the need for the change is the failure of his Government&#146;s immigration policies over the past 10 years.</p>

face in immigration, strains on our public services and, worse still, community cohesion in this country, have their root in the faulty analysis that the Government adopted in their early years in power. The House of Lords report to which the Minister kindly referred pointed that out as well as anyone has done. It is worth this House remembering that the report was produced by a cross-party House of Lords Committee containing Labour ex-Ministers, distinguished economists, such as Professor Richard Layard, and, indeed, Adair Turner, whom the Prime Minister employed as his adviser on pensions.</p>

He said that he thought that the analysis was good, but he took objection to some of the press coverage. I would be happy to ignore completely what the press made of the report, because the report itself was excoriating about the analysis that the Government apply to immigration and, in particular, about the policies that they have adopted. Indeed, rather gratifyingly, the distinguished cross-party Committee said that we needed precisely the cap for which I have been arguing, and against which the Minister has been arguing for the past 10 minutes.</p>

 That is completely right. I am glad that the hon. Lady thought of another point to make. It seems a slightly strange basis for an entire Government policy to have no evidence that that policy will be beneficial. The hon.

The Government have proceeded on that assumption for 10 years and so has the Minister, for all his statements that he prefers GDP per capita. Just as he is a student of my speeches and press releases, I am probably the world&#146;s greatest student of his. In all conscience, no one would believe that he did not regard the expansion of GDP by &#163;6 billion&#151;a figure he cited again today&#151;as extremely important evidence in favour of the economic benefits of immigration. If he is now claiming that GDP per capita is a better measure, that is a welcome advance on everything that he has said over the past few years.</p>

contributes to GDP per capita. When we look at wage rates, for example, we can see that on average foreign-born people earned &#163;424 a week in 2006 compared with the UK-born, who earned &#163;395 a week. There is clear evidence, both in theory and in practice, of a positive contribution towards GDP per capita. As my hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, South-West (Dr. Starkey) said, of course that contribution will be relatively small when the sums are done, because 87 per cent. of the labour force is UK-born.</p>

 All the evidence that I have seen&#151;I am sure that the Minister has seen it too&#151;suggests that, as one would expect, there is an enormous spread in the wages of those who come to this country to work. There are many at the very top end and many at the bottom end.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o234"><a name="80424-0014.htm_para9"><a name="08042466000608">Oddly enough, that is one of the points of consensus between us. We do not reject the points-based system altogether. We think that it should be used as a base for the cap that we propose and the Minister rejects. It would be a useful tool within our overall, very different policy. One thing that we can do, and indeed that the Minister is trying to do, is ensure that people with the appropriate skills come into this country. By and large, one imagines that in most areas those appropriate skills will be at the high end. The truth about the level of wages is rather more subtle than the point that he tried to make.</p>

 The Minister has been making that point repeatedly, and it took particular chutzpah for him to do so again today in the same speech that he refused to commit himself about whether he would let in any restaurant chefs&#151;or, if so, what number. He must take that decision in the next few months after proper analysis, yet he and the right hon. Gentleman are asking me to say what our cap would be in, I assume, 2010. Of course, we will need to do the analysis before then. It would be ridiculous to give a figure now.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o249"><a name="80424-0015.htm_para1"><a name="08042469000010">The number will be substantially lower than the net figure of about 200,000, which has subsisted for the past five years. Since the Minister will not give us a figure for a small sector of the economy, about which he must decide in the next two months, he in particular has no right to ask questions about a number that will be two years out of date. That is the equivalent of asking people to give Budget figures two years beforehand.</p>

 I do not want to weary the House by saying this, but we will give the answer at the appropriate time, when we have to take the decision. The right hon. Gentleman, who is the Chairman of the Home Affairs Committee, knows perfectly well that it is at least possible and, in fact, quite likely that circumstances may change between now and 2010. Can he tell me how many of those who have come from the A8 countries over the past three or four years will go home between now and 2010, when a Conservative Government will be elected to take the decision?

The last time he put out a press release on the subject, the figure was 20 per cent., so I find his figures particularly flexible on this issue.

<p><a name="stpa_o250"><a name="80424-0015.htm_para2"><a name="08042469000023">The Minister has been more candid about the challenges than his predecessors were. In March, he gave an interview to <i> The Daily Telegraph</i>, saying:</p>
<a name="80424-0015.htm_brev1"><a name="08042469000024"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Immigration is a vortex issue, it sucks in other things&#151;such as schools, hospitals or housing...In the past, people didn&#146;t think Labour took immigration seriously. My job is to say, &#145;the Government has got the message&#146;&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o251"><a name="80424-0015.htm_para3"><a name="08042469000025">I thought that that was a significant Freudian slip; his job is not necessarily to get the message or to do anything about it, but to say that the Government have got the message. That is the essence of the current Administration&#146;s approach to all politics.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o252"><a name="80424-0015.htm_para4"><a name="08042469000026">As we all know, there is a serious undertone to the issue of the success or failure of immigration policy. That seriousness was amply illustrated earlier this week in a poll that the BBC commissioned, which showed that 33 per cent. of the population strongly agree, and 26 per cent. tend to agree, with the statement that there are too many immigrants in Britain. I am sure that the Minister and everyone else in the House thinks that it is deeply worrying if the British people think like that. We have to ask whether the points-based system will make enough of an impact to turn those feelings around. It seems unarguably to be the case that the answer to that is no. We have discussed the cap, which is one of the things that we need to introduce, but within that we need to ensure that people who come to this country are economically beneficial. In that respect, we agree with the principles behind the points-based system, whatever the stresses and strains in it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o253"><a name="80424-0015.htm_para5"><a name="08042469000027">As I have said, the problem is whether the system is designed to reduce the overall numbers; the Minister has not answered that. I was glad that despite the chutzpah that he displayed in his speech, he did not repeat a point that he often makes, namely that the points-based system is like the Australian system. Of course it is not like the Australian system; that system starts with a limit, which Labour Members do not want, and then selects people within that total. That  is a point for the hon. Member for Hendon (Mr. Dismore) to note. Everyone accepts that the Australians appear to be doing well and running a dynamic economy with an immigration system on which a British Conservative Government would closely base their own. Indeed, the Australian system is so successful that the Government like to claim that the points-based system is like the Australian system, but it simply is not.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o254"><a name="80424-0015.htm_para6"><a name="08042469000028">One of the reasons why the points-based system is not enough was brought up by my hon. Friend the Member for South Holland and The Deepings (Mr. Hayes), who mentioned people who are not in education, employment or training. The Minister rightly pointed out the existence of the lump of labour fallacy; like him, I have been a consultant, and I have done enough economics to know that that is a fair point. Of course, if somebody comes to this country to do a job, it does not necessarily mean that someone else loses their job. However, the Minister is in a slightly confused position if, while saying that the lump of labour fallacy means that we should not worry about unskilled migrants coming here, he is specifically stopping any unskilled migration from the rest of the world outside the EU. By doing that, he is implicitly accepting that there must be some short and medium-term effect on the British labour market, and in  <br>

particular on the unskilled and probably least well educated members of our labour force. That is clearly something that we need to address. He is right that the issue of training and skilling is important, but it is not enough to say that there is no impact as a result of immigration, and he must address that confusion.</p>

Member for Leicester, East, who chairs the Home Affairs Committee, told me that on Sunday he addressed 15,000 restaurateurs and restaurant workers about the problems experienced by the restaurant industry, so I shall pass over them, as I am sure that the Minister has been made well aware of them by many Labour Members, and is about to be made even more aware of them if the right hon. Gentleman catches your eye, Mr. Deputy Speaker.</p>

The Government have changed the rules retrospectively and, as some of us have for a long time warned would happen, the Minister has ended up in court, and recently lost a High Court case. The judge judged the changes &#147;unfair&#148;, and said that there was</p>
<a name="80424-0015.htm_brev2"><a name="08042469000238"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;no good reason why those already on the scheme should not enjoy the benefits of it as originally offered to them.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o257"><a name="80424-0015.htm_para9"><a name="08042469000031">I have written to the Minister about that problem, as it was absurd to close the holes in the system by applying that level of effective retrospection to highly skilled migrants&#151;precisely the sort of migrants, everyone in the House agrees, whom we want in the UK, and a very peculiar group to pick on when applying draconian policies.</p>

The exchange between the Earl of Onslow and the Minister about whether the changes entail breaking a contract is not only illuminating but entertaining. I have to tell the Minister with all good will that the Earl of Onslow got the better of him but, to be serious, we have broken a contract with people whom we brought into this country. We have changed the rules half way through their time in the UK by introducing the points-based system, so the Minister should take the opportunity to ponder on the problems that he has caused.</p>

happened for years illegal or impractical. The root of the problem is the Minister&#146;s recognition that the immigration system has been out of control for a long time, causing terrible problems for this country and, more particularly, for the Government. He is trying to be tough absolutely everywhere, but there are times when he should exercise his judgment more, and say, &#147;In this area, we should not try to cut the numbers as much as possible.

<p><a name="stpa_o259"><a name="80424-0015.htm_para11"><a name="08042469000035">On that issue, I should like to draw the Minister&#146;s attention to the position of working holidaymakers. Given the nature of my postbag, I am sure that his postbag is full of letters from people who have come to the UK, often doing responsible and highly skilled jobs as working holidaymakers. They have all been told that if they wish to reapply for their jobs they have to go back home, often to countries such as New Zealand.</p>

By any standards, that is nonsense. By definition, working holidaymakers are coming to Britain to work&#151;to do something productive&#151;and the Government are sending them all home and saying to them, &#147;We can&#146;t tell you whether or when you can come back to carry on doing the job that you have been doing for some time.&#148; <i> [Interruption.]</i> The hon.

 I am slightly confused. My understanding of working holidaymakers is that they are in the UK to have a holiday and have a good time, and they happen to be doing jobs to fund that. Is the hon.

 I am not saying that such people should be given precedence, but those who are in the country and working, who are in the middle of a programme and have lots of time left on the programme, are being told, &#147;We want you to carry on doing your job, but to do so you have to travel back half way across the world and apply for it again, and we are not going to tell you whether you can come back or not.&#148; That seems to be administrative nonsense.</p>

It is not one of the issues, such as the economy or the health service, that is for ever at the top of people&#146;s political anxieties, but it is at present, because it has been out of control for so long. It is possible to run an immigration system that is firm and fair, which allows into Britain those who will benefit our economy, without allowing our public services to be put under intolerable pressure by unplanned numbers of new arrivals, and which lets in the right people and the right number of people. That is what a Conservative immigration policy will look like.</p>

I am thinking of the arrival of the central and eastern Europeans in the United Kingdom. That happened under our treaty obligations, into which we entered in good faith. We originally signed up to those obligations when we accepted the principle of freedom of movement, which happened when the right hon. Member for St. Albans was in the Cabinet. The Maastricht treaty and subsequent treaties all enabled this country to honour those commitments.</p>

 I should say that I am the right hon. Member not for St. Albans, but for Hitchin and Harpenden. When we signed the accession treaty relating to the eight accession countries of eastern Europe, we were not required to grant unlimited and immediate access rights; we had the right to restrain those for eight years. The Government chose not to operate that right. The right hon.

 I was not misleading the House in any way, even inadvertently. The process began when we joined the European Union. The basis of our membership of the EU was the freedom of movement, although of course there can be transitional arrangements. Last year, the Select Committee considered the issue in respect of Romania and Bulgaria and the Government took a different view, feeling that the restrictions should remain. That has not stopped people from those countries coming to this country on work permits or as self-employed people and contributing to our economy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o268"><a name="80424-0015.htm_para20"><a name="08042469000051">The hon. Member for Ashford was right: I will concentrate on the shortage of skilled chefs from south Asia. That is not because that is the only issue as far as the points-based system is concerned, but because it is current and relevant.

It is important that we should express to the Minister our constituents&#146; concerns and those of the catering industry as a whole about the real problems in that industry.</p>

Member for Ashford said, in the past week I was in Trafalgar square, where 15,000 members of the south Asian community&#151;not only the Bangladeshi community, but people of Indian, Pakistani, Turkish and Chinese origin&#151;took part in one of the largest demonstrations, if not the largest, of the south Asian community that I have seen in my 21 years in this House. About 8,000 people signed a petition, which was handed in at 10 Downing street. Meetings to discuss the issue have been held all over the country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o270"><a name="80424-0016.htm_para0"><a name="08042469000053">I want to pay tribute to the Minister. I know that he sometimes feels that the Home Affairs Committee and others in the House are a little harsh on this issue. He has listened to the community and been around the country to hear its concerns. I welcome what he has done: he has been to Tower Hamlets and to the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Hendon (Mr. Dismore); he was due to go to Keighley and Manchester only yesterday, but was prevented from doing so by the votes in the House. That kind of first-hand experience is extremely important as the Government decide how to fashion their view.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o271"><a name="80424-0016.htm_para1"><a name="08042469000054">I am pleased to tell the House that the Home Affairs Committee has decided to hold a detailed inquiry into the points-based system. It will begin in June, and we shall launch it in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Regent's Park and Kensington, North (Ms Buck), who is a member of the Committee. We will travel to India and Bangladesh and take evidence from those who have been and will be affected. At a time when we have a global economy, with a company such as Tata&#151;an Indian company&#151;buying Jaguar, the need for the interchange of technology has never been greater. It is therefore important that we consider how the system operates. The Government are right to take it in stages&#151;not to announce everything immediately but to consider the impact on each of the tiers. I welcome the fact that the Minister has done that. This is the largest shake-up of immigration policy, and we should be very grateful for his enthusiasm and willingness to consult.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o272"><a name="80424-0016.htm_para2"><a name="08042469000055">The Minister should note, though, the comments of stakeholders&#151;groups such as the Immigration Law Practitioners Association, which has already said clearly to him and to others that it is concerned about the changes to the right of appeal. He will know that in all the speeches on immigration that I ever make, I say that when the Government make a decision through administrative means there should always be the right of appeal. It is absolutely vital that the right of appeal is retained, whether for visitor visas, of which 50 per cent. of appeals are overturned, or for work permits and on issues surrounding the points-based system. I know that the Minister will bear that in mind as he goes through the system and analyses whether it is effective.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o273"><a name="80424-0016.htm_para3"><a name="08042469000056">The Minister also needs to consider how information is made available to employers. I fear that despite his ambitions in this area and the good work that he is suggesting should be done, many employers are unaware of what is happening. He chooses to advertise in mainstream newspapers, but I hope that he will look at the flourishing ethnic minority media and the regional press. He represents a seat in Birmingham. It is important that the Home Office take out its advertisements in newspapers such as <i> The Birmingham Post</i> and the newspapers of the Asian, South Asian, Chinese, Bangladeshi, Indian and Pakistani communities, so that it makes employers aware of precisely what it proposes as regards these fundamental issues.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o274"><a name="80424-0016.htm_para4"><a name="08042469000057">Last week there was a lot of talk&#151;the Minister mentioned Trevor Phillips and others&#151;about the fact that it is 40 years since the speech made by Enoch  <br>

Powell in which he predicted for our country rivers of blood. Birmingham, Leicester, Manchester, Leeds, Bradford&#151;none of those great cities conformed to the prophecy that he described. That is a tribute to the people of our country&#151;a wonderful, tolerant country that has absorbed a lot of people with different cultures and identities and worked with them in partnership. That is what makes our country so special.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o275"><a name="80424-0016.htm_para5"><a name="08042469000058">The hon. Member for Ashford is right to say that we should be concerned about the BBC poll and the disappointing statistic that two thirds of the people interviewed thought that there were too many immigrants. Those issues should not be ignored. It is important that we should feel free, not only in this place but outside, to talk about immigration openly and transparently without letting anyone feel that they are being prevented from having those discussions, which are happening in every household in every community in the country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o276"><a name="80424-0016.htm_para6"><a name="08042469000059">The real problem is not about legal immigration or people trying to stop chefs coming into this country, but about dealing with illegal immigration. I know that the Government have made efforts on illegal immigration, but I am afraid that they have to do better. The hon. Member for Hertsmere (Mr. Clappison) and I recently met the head of the Border and Immigration Agency because I was concerned, as Chairman of the Home Affairs Committee, that we were not getting the information that was required to make us better informed before we made decisions in the course of our inquiries. I would imagine that every week, on a Monday morning, the Minister would get a report on the numbers of people who have come in and gone out, who have been deported, and who are illegal immigrants who have been arrested and are subject to due process. Yesterday, however, there were newspaper reports claiming that one in three police forces tells its officers not to arrest illegal immigrants but instead to give them directions to an immigration office.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o277"><a name="80424-0016.htm_para7"><a name="08042469000060">We need to look at enforcement, which is really what concerns the people of this country. There are those who come here illegally and remain illegally, those who do not contribute to the economy, those who do not pay taxes and those who stay for many years because the administrative system allows cases to go on for ever. In an answer at Home Office questions this week, the Minister said that 90 per cent. of cases were dealt with in three months. I do not know where he got that statistic from, but&#151;apart from the Minister, of course&#151;my hon. Friend the Member for Brent, North and I probably have two of the biggest such case loads, and I am sorry to say that I do not think that 90 per cent. of the Minister&#146;s cases on applications for indefinite leave are dealt with in three months. I do not find that, and I write at least 50 letters to the BIA every week. I always get the same reply: &#147;We are considering this. It has been allocated to a case worker. They have to wait because there is no timetable.&#148; That is not acceptable, and frankly, it causes resentment.</p>

In Britain, 2.4 per cent. of all employment is in restaurants and other catering establishments. The amount spent on the industry is estimated to be &#163;37.6 billion. In 2006, the Guild of Bangladeshi Restaurateurs estimated that about 9,500 Indian and Bangladeshi restaurants and  <br>

takeaways in the United Kingdom employ 72,000 people, with an annual turnover of about &#163;3.2 billion. Although those figures are estimates, they show the enormous benefit of this industry to our economy. The industry says that it is facing an unprecedented crisis that, if unresolved, will decimate it. Unfortunately, the crisis has been created by the Government through the points-based system. Each year, the restaurant sector has to recruit several thousand new staff to work in its kitchens. Once they were able to turn to the subcontinent to find talented chefs, brought up with the spices and cooking methods that made a great curry, but now, sadly, they have to fill the vacancies from the EU. As my hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington (Ms Abbott) pointed out, those skills are simply not available in  the EU.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o279"><a name="80424-0016.htm_para9"><a name="08042469000062">As I have said before, we welcome the enlargement of the EU; I was the Minister for Europe when those discussions originally took place and I am delighted by their success, but to be perfectly frank, the skills needed are not here. They are in the subcontinent. There is no great demand for second-generation immigrants, whether they are Irish, Indian or whatever, to go into the profession unless there is a family necessity for them to do so. When I was younger, I was given the choice of becoming a doctor or a doctor, which is why I became a lawyer. The expectations and the aspirations of the immigrant community change.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o280"><a name="80424-0016.htm_para10"><a name="08042469000063">We want to ensure that the restaurant industry is maintained in this country, especially in our major cities. There are some terrifically great restaurants, such as Amaya, The Red Fort and Madhu&#146;s Brilliant in Southall, which are some of my favourites. When I last visited one of them, I was told that under the new rules they would lose about 90 per cent. of their chefs. That cannot be what the Home Office intended. The Bangladesh Catering Association estimates that there are now 27,500 vacancies in Bangladeshi-run restaurants. Whenever I hear from them, I find that they are even more concerned about what is proposed. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o281"><a name="80424-0016.htm_para11"><a name="08042469000064">I should declare an interest, not as a lover of curry because I think that applies to everybody, but as the co-chairman of the Tiffin Cup, which encourages right hon. and hon. Members to nominate their favourite south Asian restaurant. We have a launch soon, and I hope that the Minister will come along to meet some of the chefs in person. It is not just the big restaurants in London that will be affected, but those on every single high street. If the Minister goes back to his constituency, as he does every Friday, and visits any of the south Asian restaurants in Hodge Hill, of which I am sure there are many, he will find that there is a shortage of chefs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o282"><a name="80424-0016.htm_para12"><a name="08042469000065">The number of immigration raids on south Asian restaurants worries me, and I have raised the matter with the Minister previously. Let us imagine a Friday night in Brick lane, with the diners sitting in the restaurants, when, suddenly, a whole lot of immigration officers and police officers come through the door. They raid the restaurants in the middle of their busiest period to find illegal immigrants. They go into the kitchen, and ask people to produce their passports and papers, as if everybody goes to work on  <br>

<p><a name="stpa_o283"><a name="80424-0016.htm_para13"><a name="08042469000066">I have tabled a series of parliamentary questions to the Minister asking him, as a result of the raids that he has authorised&#151;they are authorised by Ministers&#151;how many people have been caught in any of the restaurants. I also asked whether, as well as Brick lane, he chooses to raid some of the bigger establishments, such as the Dorchester. I was at the Dorchester&#151;I am telling hon. Members all my eating habits&#151;last night at a charity awards event. There were at least 50 to 60 waiters there. Let us imagine that the Minister authorised the immigration services to raid the kitchens, and the ensuing disruption. I ask him to think again.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o284"><a name="80424-0016.htm_para14"><a name="08042469000067">The Minister talks about the language of the kitchen and the necessity for English. The language of the kitchen in some of those restaurants is not English, but excellence, because people go to restaurants for excellent food. If the Minister does not believe me about the language of the kitchen and the fact that some of those great restaurants will lose their chefs, I issue him a challenge. He is good at accepting my challenges&#151;indeed, so far, he has always done so. I challenge him to spend a day at one of the restaurants and experience the language of the kitchen.</p>

 I am pleased to hear that. Whatever the kitchen, we do not have a problem. I invite the Minister to come to hear the language of the kitchen, whether Chinese, Indian, Pakistani, Bangladeshi, Arab, Lebanese&#151;I cannot go through the whole list.

I do not say that simply because it was made by a distinguished High Court judge, Sir George Newman. I agree with the hon. Member for Ashford that retrospective law is not good law. I do not know whether the Government will appeal against the decision, but I have many constituents, as do several other hon. Members&#151;I note that the hon. Member for New Forest, East (Dr. Lewis), who intervened earlier, had a similar problem with a constituent&#151;who are affected.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o286"><a name="80424-0016.htm_para16"><a name="08042469000073">The Minister conducted a meeting with me last year at which he heard concerns about the 49,000 people who came here on the highly skilled migrant programme. We understand why the Government have to intervene in immigration law&#151;we live on a small island and we cannot have unlimited immigration&#151;but such intervention should always be fair and just, and not retrospective. I have been a Member of Parliament for 21 years. Every year, there has been an immigration Bill and new immigration rules. I know that the Minister grasps the issues&#151;more than others do, to be frank. The key is not to keep changing the law and creating uncertainty. Let us consider the consequences.</p>

We now have a chance to re-examine the process. I hope very much that the Minister will use this debate in his deliberations. I recognise his sincerity and the integrity with which he has held office.

 I am pleased to follow the right hon. Member for Leicester, East (Keith Vaz). He made a number of good points and reminded the House, for the first time in this debate, of the rather shameful anniversary of Enoch Powell&#146;s &#147;rivers of blood&#148; speech and of how, because of the tolerance in this country, he was comprehensively wrong about the results of the policy about which he was complaining. He was also right on enforcement and absolutely right to remind the Minister of the importance of rights of appeal and due process, which we on the Liberal Democrat Benches thoroughly support.</p>

We also hope&#151;although we do not yet trust&#151;that the system will dramatically improve what can only be described as the chaos of the current arrangements. The increased public concern over immigration reflects a lack of confidence that the Government know what they want, understand what they are doing or are delivering what people in this country need.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o289"><a name="80424-0016.htm_para19"><a name="08042466000705">The most damning example of that chaos was the decision, made also by Ireland and Sweden, to allow immigration from the new member states of the European Union after 2004. The Liberal Democrats supported that decision on the basis of the Government&#146;s projections that immigration would be 13,000 people a year. In other words, on the Government&#146;s projections, immigration from the eight accession states would total some 52,000 to the end of last year.

which I shall describe later, is so wrong, the House and the Government have to take that into account.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o290"><a name="80424-0016.htm_para20"><a name="08042466000708">Frankly, the scale of the error is breathtaking. Actual immigration was 1,373 per cent. higher than the forecast. In years of scrutinising Government projections, which I have to own up to as a former economist&#151;I am sorry that the hon. Member for Milton Keynes, South-West (Dr. Starkey) is not here, as she is a great expert in the effect that differences between large numbers can have&#151;I cannot remember another projection, even for difficult objectives such as borrowing, that was wrong by such an order of magnitude. As we know, Christopher Columbus thought that he had discovered India, when in fact he was in America. By comparison with the Home Office, he was a practitioner of pinpoint navigation.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman makes a powerful point. Is not one of the problems with the points-based system that it applies only to non-EEA countries and that huge influxes from the European Union therefore distort everything that we are trying to achieve?</p>

 The chances of our having a huge influx from the European Union in normal years are minimal. However, I shall come to that point later, when the hon. Gentleman will perhaps want to intervene on me if he disagrees.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o291"><a name="80424-0016.htm_para21"><a name="08042466000711">It is bizarre that even when it became clear that the estimates for EU immigration were wildly wrong, the Government did not take rapid countervailing measures. Clearly they could not do much to affect the flow from the accession states; nor would it have been right to do so. We in this country benefit enormously from the free movement of people in the European Union. Indeed, more British people live in other member states than other member states&#146; nationals live here. That might have something to do with the sunshine or with other factors. Whatever the reason, pulling up the drawbridge on other EU nationals could cause a wholesale repatriation of British pensioners from Spain and Portugal, for example, which would be disastrous for our own public services and would deprive many of our citizens of an option that they clearly prefer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o292"><a name="80424-0016.htm_para22"><a name="08042466000712">However, it would be wise to use immigration flows from non-EU countries, over which we have some control, as a balancing factor. The Government have not done that. Therefore, net immigration&#151;immigration minus emigration from the UK&#151;of non-British people trebled from fewer than 100,000 a year in the early 1990s to more than 300,000 in 2006. That is a large, completely unplanned and unforeseen increase.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o293"><a name="80424-0016.htm_para23"><a name="08042466000713">As I have said, the British people are a tolerant lot. We have been open to waves of immigration on a greater scale throughout our history than almost any other European country, and we have benefited enormously from that. Far from being an island fastness, our easy access to the sea means that we have always been more open than many other countries. However, one thing that the British people will rightly not tolerate is incompetence from their Government, but that is what we have seen in the mismanagement of immigration over the past 10 years.</p>

Perhaps they thought that we did not need to worry about anyone leaving. However, their action ignored the disastrous consequence that we were no longer able to check whether non-EU visitors had overstayed their visas. An essential element of control was lost, and that is why the Liberal Democrats have argued that the Government must get a grip on the management of immigration through a national border force&#151;an idea that has now been taken up elsewhere in the House&#151;and the reintroduction of exit controls.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o295"><a name="80424-0016.htm_para25"><a name="08042466000715">The results of the recent mismanagement were detailed by the hon. Member for Ashford (Damian Green). They include local authorities not having the resources to tackle the needs of new communities, health authorities being unable to plan for the needs of their populations, and police services being stretched because population projections have been so far out. There have also been parts of the country in which particular trades have been hard hit. It is not easy for a trained brickie to find that their skills now earn only a fraction of what they got a couple of years ago. If the points-based system gives us a better grip on these random impacts of immigration, that will be all to the good, and a balancing factor between EU and non-EU immigration seems to be an essential part of that, alongside a greater effort to predict and respond to local impacts and to ensure that local authorities have the means to make the necessary adjustments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o296"><a name="80424-0016.htm_para26"><a name="08042466000716">The official Opposition have called for a national cap on immigration, which suggests that they have forgotten their other commitment, to the market economy. The needs of market economies are not always easy to forecast, and they are certainly impossible to plan. There has to be a flexibility, which a rigid cap would belie. With great respect to the right hon. Member for Hitchin and Harpenden (Mr. Lilley), who intervened to give us instruction on what it means to respect market economics and the price level, I have to tell him that when I was employing people in the City, there were occasions on which I needed to hire someone with particularly unusual skills that I could find only in New York or elsewhere. The idea that there was going to be a sudden market clearing because the price would go up was absolute nonsense, because it takes a number of years to train someone and to equip them with an economics PhD, let alone some of the other qualifications required. If the official Opposition&#146;s policy had been operating at that time, the impact on my business could have been devastating. We must not use excessively blunt policy instruments to score cheap hits in the tabloid headlines.</p>

For example, there is a strong desire north of the border for Scotland&#146;s population to stop falling and, if anything, to rise. Scotland has more than one third of the UK&#146;s land area, but less than 10 per cent. of our population.

We have had recent examples of the impact of drought in the south-east, and the UK as a whole&#151;though primarily the south of England&#151;has less available water per person than most other European countries.

Member for Ashford to answer that point. In turn, that must have some consequences for how the Government adjust the tap of non-EU immigration. I accept that the logic of ensuring that immigration is appropriate in different parts of the country may be to adjust the points system to take account of the area in which the proposed immigrant wants to settle, perhaps making visas conditional on particular travel-to-work areas in the first instance. One may not want to apply conditions subsequently, but it is a policy option that we should put on the table and discuss since the points-based system would allow for some variation in the points awarded according to the proposed area of work within the UK&#151;<i> [Interruption.] </i>Does the hon.

 The hon. Gentleman is putting forward a ridiculous policy. People cannot be admitted to this country on the basis of a restriction on where they move within it. As he well knows, EU law as well as English law&#151;certainly in the long term&#151;would prevent that.</p>

 I may be able to help the hon. Gentleman a little.

I firmly believe that proper management and control of immigration is in the interests of all UK residents, and perhaps particularly of those who have arrived most recently. As some of the economic evidence suggests, new entrants compete most vigorously with those who have most recently arrived.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o301"><a name="80424-0017.htm_para4"><a name="08042466000725">Clearly, however, some recent immigrant communities want others to join them, and it is important to the objective of successfully integrating our existing immigrant communities that the Border and Immigration Agency is sensitive in the exercise of its powers. I am not convinced that going guns blazing into Chinese or Bangladeshi restaurants at the peak hours on Friday or Saturday nights when they are busiest in serving their customers qualifies as sensitivity. Immigrant communities run businesses across this country, not least in the catering trade, which make an enormous contribution to our national life. I understand that the most popular dish in this country is chicken tikka masala, which I had not discovered during any of my visits to India, so it is very much an English innovation. Although enforcement of the immigration rules is crucial and does involve inspections, I plead with Ministers to ensure that people are treated with respect and consideration for their businesses and their reputations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o302"><a name="80424-0017.htm_para5"><a name="08042466000726">It would be remiss of me not to mention the frankly appalling behaviour of the Government with regard to the highly skilled migrant programme. Whatever the need to change the rules, there is absolutely no excuse for retrospection. There is no excuse for moving the goalposts in the middle of the game. If families have come here, uprooting themselves in the expectation of a set of rules that will allow them eventually to become British citizens, it is deplorable for Ministers suddenly to decide that those promises no longer need to be honoured. We abhor retrospective legislation. The Government must honour their obligations to the 49,000 people who have come here under the scheme. Some may have to leave under the new points-based system giving preference to younger people, although they have been the subject of a favourable court judgment.</p>

We must continue to be an open and tolerant society that looks out at the world with confidence, and not turn in on ourselves, fearing the phantoms of xenophobia. But if we are to sustain that vision, which has been so much a part of our own history and success, it must be on the basis of two strong conditions. The first is the integration of immigrant communities in our society on the basis of our common language and shared values, and the second is management of the system that controls our borders in the interests of all of us. On both those objectives, the Government have fallen down lamentably. The Liberal Democrats merely hope that the points-based immigration system will be a step towards the remedying of past failure.</p>

I believe the evidence shows that it is not only Britons who are increasingly unwilling to do those low-skilled jobs in this economy. The tremendously hard-working groups of Polish and other eastern European communities who came here in 2004, and whom the Government expected to fill those vacancies, are also increasingly competing for higher-paid employment.</p>

Either the number is determined by the UK economy&#146;s needs&#151;in which case it is not an absolute figure, as those needs themselves are dynamic and will change&#151;or it is absolute and fixed, in which case it is simply political posturing and dogma, which will act against the best interests of the British people and the British economy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o307"><a name="80424-0017.htm_para10"><a name="08042466000732">The fact is that the hon.

<p><a name="stpa_o308"><a name="80424-0017.htm_para11"><a name="08042466000733">I listened carefully to my hon.

 Does the hon.

Therefore, I have some concerns about what the hon.

 The hon. Lady makes a fair point; in fact, she makes the Minister&#146;s point&#151;I am glad that a Liberal Democrat Member is agreeing with Labour. It is, of course, desirable for people to have a level of English that enables them to integrate into our society and to avoid being exploited. However, I ask the Minister to look very carefully at the needs of the industry, and to set that level of English taking into account the context that there is a community that can support people as they come in and that those people will be able to pick up and learn the language as they progress. Many Members&#151;highly educated though we may be&#151;might find it very difficult if there were a requirement that, before we emigrated to China, in order to fulfil our job requirements we had to know Mandarin or Cantonese. We might find it a good deal easier if we were allowed to go to that country and pick up the language by ear. The Minister and his officials should reflect on that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o310"><a name="80424-0017.htm_para13"><a name="08042466000737">I turn to the subject of low-skilled workers, and our discussion of that with the Minister during his opening remarks. The Department seems to believe that cleaning jobs, sous-chef posts and more menial jobs than first or second chef can be filled by low-skilled labour and that that low-skilled labour must be supplied within the EU context, by eastern European citizens. In practice, an eastern European operating in a south-Asian or Chinese kitchen would need a working knowledge of one of the south-Asian or Chinese languages. That would imply that, far from being low-skilled, such a person would need to have a very high skill level; they would need the linguistic skill to operate in that environment. That is one of the reasons why the requirements of the tier need revisiting.</p>

Friend the Member for Leicester, East about the raids on Bangladeshi and Chinese restaurants, most notably last October&#146;s raid in Chinatown, and about the press involvement in, and high public profile of, the raids. The Home Office is responsible not only for immigration control, but for race relations in this country&#151;indeed, it has passed laws against incitement to racial hatred. I hope that it is conscious that the publicity generated by those raids has resulted in many cases of racial abuse against the communities involved, and that it will be mindful of the need to ensure racial harmony in any further attempts to secure, quite properly, immigration controls in this country through reasonable checks on the credentials of people who are working here.</p>

India&#146;s IT exports have been one of the startling success stories of India&#146;s economic performance in the past two decades. India&#146;s software and business processing exports are valued at about $40 billion a year, and the UK&#146;s imports of computer and information services were worth about &#163;2.7 billion in 2006, the last full year for which figures are available.

<p><a name="stpa_o327"><a name="80424-0018.htm_para2"><a name="08042469000083">First and foremost, does the Minister expect the points-based system to bring about a reduction in inward migration, at least in the category of migration that is subject to it? We need an answer to that. Does he expect inward migration to be higher or lower? To put the matter in a wider context, is he content&#151;some elements of his speech indicated that he might be&#151;with the Government&#146;s official projection of net migration for the years to come, running at a level of 190,000 a year? That is the official projection of the Office for National Statistics, based on the work of the Government Actuary&#146;s Department. As the House of Lords pointed out, that number is equivalent to a city the size of Milton Keynes arriving in the UK every year. The vast majority come to England, and, as I think the hon. Member for Eastleigh (Chris Huhne) well knows, the vast majority, or at least a majority, go to the south of England.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o328"><a name="80424-0018.htm_para3"><a name="08042469000084">Is the Minister content with the Government&#146;s projection that the population of the UK will grow from 60 million today to 71 million in 2031, with most of that growth taking place in England and the population of England growing from 51 million now to just over 60 million in 2031? Is he satisfied with that level of population growth and the implications that it has for the quality of life in this country? We need an answer&#151;is he satisfied with that prospect? That would be equivalent to putting the existing populations of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland into England by 2031.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o329"><a name="80424-0018.htm_para4"><a name="08042469000085">The Office for National Statistics has said that 69 per cent. of that population growth can be attributed, directly or indirectly, to net migration. Will the Minister say whether the points-based system will alter those projections, or will changing the way that people are selected mean that the projections will stay the same?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o330"><a name="80424-0018.htm_para5"><a name="08042469000086">Ministers claim that the points-based system will be more selective, but the more important question is how many migrants are admitted. Migrant workers might hold national vocational qualifications, bachelors or masters degrees, or doctorates&#151;or, for the benefit of the hon. Member for Eastleigh, they might even be bankers. Regardless of the qualifications that they hold, however, they still need a roof over their heads, and that has implications for the numbers of households formed every year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o331"><a name="80424-0018.htm_para6"><a name="08042469000087">It is frankly amazing that the Government have drawn no connection at all between migration policy, which is controlled by the Home Office, the population projections derived from that policy, and the housing policy that is implemented by another Department and which requires counties in the English regions to accommodate very substantial extra households. My county of Hertfordshire has been told to find room for about 80,000 more houses in the years leading up to 2021. In the same period, the borough of Hertsmere alone must find room for 5,000 new houses. I understand that that will be very difficult to accomplish without losing at least some of the green belt in the area.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o332"><a name="80424-0018.htm_para7"><a name="08042469000088">A significant proportion of the projected housing demand will arise from net migration, some of it covered by the points-based system. The Government have had to raise their estimate of that demand three times already since they came to office. The most recent estimate is that one third of household demand will come from migration, but that is based on an old figure and may have to be revised upwards in light of more recent population predictions. The House of Lords Select Committee was told in evidence that more than 200 new households per day will be generated by net migration in years, and one estimate is that more than 260 houses will have to be built every day. Is the Minister satisfied with that prospect? Does he plan to change anything to deal with it? Will the points-based system make any difference?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o333"><a name="80424-0018.htm_para8"><a name="08042469000089">In his opening remarks, the Minister referred briefly to the resident labour market test. In their written evidence to the House of Lords Committee, the Government said:</p>
<a name="80424-0018.htm_brev1"><a name="08042469000243"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Under the new Points-Based System, Resident Labour Market Test will only apply to jobs below a certain salary, since it is here that there is most public concern about the impacts of migrant labour on the domestic labour market&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o334"><a name="80424-0018.htm_para9"><a name="08042469000090">That evidence was submitted in the autumn of last year. When he winds up the debate, will the Minister say whether it is still the Government&#146;s intention to remove the requirement for a resident labour market test above a certain level of income? If so, at what level of income will the test be removed? How does the policy sit with the Prime Minister&#146;s talk of British jobs for British workers?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o335"><a name="80424-0018.htm_para10"><a name="08042469000091">For its part, the House of Lords concluded that the resident labour market test was important for the employment opportunities of resident workers. It suggested that such a test should be properly enforced under the points-based system. I do not have as much confidence as I should like that the Government will be willing&#151;or able&#151;to implement that recommendation, especially given that we are still waiting to hear from them on the question of illegal workers. A year ago, Ministers discovered that workers were being employed  <br>

illegally in the security industry, some of them guarding sensitive Government establishments. We have still to hear whether the Government have issued those workers with national insurance numbers. If the Minister knows that today, I ask him to give us an answer. One year on from first discovering that, how many of those workers were given national insurance numbers? Were any of them given numbers? Does the Minister know?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o336"><a name="80424-0018.htm_para11"><a name="08042469000092">A number of detailed questions arise from the Government&#146;s proposals, but the most important question is simply the effect that they will have on the Government&#146;s projections for population. Will more or fewer people be admitted to this country? The Government have presided over an unparalleled period in our history of population growth and, particularly, inward migration. The hon. Member for Eastleigh mentioned migration history. There has never been a period in history of such sustained and concentrated inward migration as that under the 10 years of this Government. Never before has inward migration reached the level that it has reached under this Government today. Well over 500,000 people are inwardly migrating every year. There is no time in history when that has been the case. If the Minister is aware of such a time, perhaps he will tell us. <i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> If the hon. Member for Eastleigh knows, I would welcome hearing from him. I believe that the evidence from the Office for National Statistics shows that there has been no such time in the past 30 years. I do not think that there has been any such time in history.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman may well be right about the past few decades, but he might be disregarding previous episodes in our history. Certainly, the Huguenot immigration to this country was proportionately far greater than anything that we have seen since. That is quite astonishing, given that the Huguenots were French speakers.</p>

<p><a name="st_o376"><a name="08042469000094"><a name="80424-0018.htm_spnew1"><a name="08042469000302"><b>Mr. Clappison:</b>
 I think that the hon. Gentleman would find, if he did some research, that certainly the Huguenots came to this country, fleeing persecution, and made a distinctive contribution, but it was not on the scale of the migration that we have seen in recent times. None of the previous migrations&#151;whether Jewish, Huguenot or any other group&#151;caused migration at the level of the past 10 years. I believe that the Government have a commitment to migration. They believe that migration is good; they are ideologically committed to high migration; they believe that there is an economic case for it. That case has been demolished, but the Government continue with migration nevertheless. That has been reflected in the migration that they brought about as soon as they took office, with the increase in the number of work permits that were issued to workers from outside the European Union. Since then, they have continued with high migration, sometimes through policy errors, as in the case of the accession eight countries, but more through the issuing of work permits and other means.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o337"><a name="80424-0018.htm_para12"><a name="08042469000095">The interesting point about work permits&#151;I would appreciate the Minister&#146;s answer on this&#151;is that, even when it became apparent that Ministers had got their predictions completely wrong in 2004 and that far  <br>

 I will reflect in my concluding remarks on the points that the hon. Gentleman makes, but I intervened because I was intellectually curious as much as anything else.

 I have no problem with immigration, still less with immigrants, and I respect the hard work and the contribution that they make. When I refer to immigration, I am referring to the unprecedented, exceptionally high levels that the Government have caused or permitted to take place into the country over the past 10 years. I believe that the Government have a bias in favour of high migration. It will be for historians to determine the real policy reasons behind that. As I say, the economic rationale for the Government&#146;s case has been demolished in the debate. The Government have failed to take into account the housing and all the other implications. That view is held by not just myself; my hon. Friend the Member for Ashford was quite right to say that there is widespread public concern, which Ministers from time to time acknowledge and try to address. How has that concern come about? It is because the public can see what the Government are doing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o338"><a name="80424-0018.htm_para13"><a name="08042469000100">I shall draw my remarks to a close by saying that Ministers can pay lip service to those public concerns as much as they like, they can use whatever rhetoric they want, and they can pretend that a big shake-up is taking place in the migration system and that they will address those concerns, but the real concern of people is that the Government are not listening to their legitimate concern about the very high immigration, and that concern will not be allayed until proper and effective measures are taken to control that high immigration. I commend the measures that my hon. Friend has proposed in the debate.</p>

trade. Traditionally, 51 per cent. of the Chinese work force have been employed in that line of work. From the very constructive meetings that we have had with the Minister, I think he is aware of the strength of feeling on the subject. However, businesses face considerable unease and fear for the future, which I hope that he can allay.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o339"><a name="80424-0018.htm_para14"><a name="08042469000104">I can tell my hon. Friend that, as of yesterday, 600 submissions had been sent to the migration advisory committee from people in the industry. The submissions contained a large number of very moving stories, although obviously there is not time to refer to them now. I hope that he will be able to reschedule his revisit to Chinatown, which was due to take place last night, so that he can see for himself what I am talking about, and particularly the impact of tiers 2 and 3 on businesses. The fear is that businesses will not be able to recruit the staff from China and Hong Kong required to keep themselves going.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o340"><a name="80424-0018.htm_para15"><a name="08042469000105">Of course, the issue is not just the points-based system; there are already recruitment problems, and it is feared that they will get worse. The Chinese community is high achieving, both academically and professionally, and those who are second or third generation do not want to work in the business. They are happy to be customers, but not employees. I can sympathise with that, having grown up in the hospitality industry. I was the third generation in that trade, and I was very happy to be able to go to university and qualify as a lawyer, rather than work in the kitchens and bars.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o341"><a name="80424-0018.htm_para16"><a name="08042469000106">The problems are evidenced by the fact that the cost of staffing has increased. I am told that in the past six months alone wages have gone up by between 30 and 35 per cent. Head-hunting and poaching are becoming real problems as people try to find staff from an ever-diminishing work force. Families are being called in to help. Children&#146;s education is being affected, as they are called in to help in the takeaways. Parents and grandparents are enlisted. In Doncaster, I heard at the Emperor restaurant, owned by Mr. Yip, that his 80-year-old grandfather is now doing the cooking. In Chinatown, Mrs. Lee, whom my hon. Friend the Minister knows, says that her 75-year-old uncle is now the wok chef in the Golden Dragon.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o342"><a name="80424-0018.htm_para17"><a name="08042469000107">People are working increased hours, and that inevitably affects the quality and range of dishes available. Businesses have closed, including the Furama restaurant in Chinatown and Dragon Springs in Doncaster. We are not talking just about catering establishments; the Loon Fung supermarket in Gerrard street closed because it could not find staff. A 10-year-old business in Doncaster, a noodle factory owned by Mr. Chan, has also had to close down. That is partly owing to the pressure on irregular workers, and the raids that have already been referred to. The real concern is the complete lack of respect for the businesses, the customers and others involved. I will not discuss the issue in detail, because it has already been referred to, but what has not been mentioned is that on 18 October&#151;the week after the big raid in Chinatown&#151;the whole of Chinatown closed down for three hours as a protest at the way in which people had been treated during those raids. Unfortunately, such  <br>

raids continue; there have been six such raids elsewhere in the past two months. That has a significant impact on businesses.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o343"><a name="80424-0018.htm_para18"><a name="08042469000108">Relations with the Border and Immigration Agency have improved; there is better co-operation, and there is education and training for employers, but I am told that employers can never get through on the helpline number that they were told to use. There is no answer. They have been told that that is the way to get advice, but it simply does not work. I hope that my hon. Friend will be able to resolve that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o344"><a name="80424-0018.htm_para19"><a name="08042469000109">One of the key issues is that of irregular workers. Frankly, they will not be sent home; they will never be caught, and the sensible thing to do is to find a way of regularising them under tier 2, otherwise they will remain in limbo. Occupation 5434, cooks and chefs, is a very broad category, and as I said to my hon. Friend earlier, it has to be broken down much further, particularly given the needs of ethnic restaurants, because there are significant differences between the western catering trade and Chinese and south Asian restaurants. That is why workers from China and Hong Kong are needed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o345"><a name="80424-0018.htm_para20"><a name="08042469000110">There is not a single catering college in the United Kingdom that offers formal courses for Chinese chefs. There are eight main styles of cooking&#151;each requires separate skills and specialised knowledge of ingredients, cooking methods and presentation&#151;including Cantonese, Peking, Szechuan and dim sum. We have all tried them, and they all require special marinades and sauces&#151;even the vegetable preparation involves specialist training.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o346"><a name="80424-0018.htm_para21"><a name="08042469000111">The Chinese community resents the fact that takeaways are regarded as on a par with burger joints and fish and ship shops under the system. Takeaways, too, require highly trained chefs, and provide dozens of dishes. There is rather more to Chinese takeaway cooking than flipping burgers or deep-frying chips. The language barrier is an important consideration. Cantonese is the language of the kitchen, and the  lack of experience, skill and cultural awareness of indigenous and EU workers is a barrier to their employment. They do not have the knowledge of the utensils and ingredients, let alone the knowledge of what to do with them and which cooking methods to use. I saw for myself the special high-heat naked flame cookers specially imported from Hong Kong&#151;they are like volcanoes. The kitchens have tried to use indigenous and EU staff, but that has simply not worked out: the work is unpopular, and the staff cannot stick it. The language barrier imposes physical demands in a pressurised environment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o347"><a name="80424-0018.htm_para22"><a name="08042469000112">Formal qualifications are not required to become a Chinese chef, but we should remember that in the indigenous population, only 26 per cent. of cooks and chefs have level 3 NVQ or above. The apprenticeship for Chinese cooking is long, and begins at the age of 15 or 16. The best guide to skills is references, experience and ability in practice, and that must be reflected in the system. Recruits from Hong Kong and China do not speak English. I have heard an apocryphal story that there are more people in China who speak English than in England, but the fact that Chinese chefs cannot speak English. However, they must be able to speak Chinese in the restaurants for health and safety and efficiency reasons. Indeed, most indigenous chefs do  <br>

not have grade C GCSE English, so I am pleased that my hon. Friend the Minister is looking at that in more detail. There must be a relaxation of the rules on language. The best answer is to allow people to learn English when they are here, through the total immersion system of language learning, and test them when they try to renew their permit; otherwise the requirement will impose an insurmountable obstacle to recruitment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o348"><a name="80424-0018.htm_para23"><a name="08042469000113">Last night, I visited Chinatown, not just to have a meal, although I was pleased to do so, but to meet chefs and talk to staff. I visited the Golden Dragon in Gerrard street&#151;an excellent restaurant; I will give it a plug&#151;to see the differences between Chinese and western restaurants. I very much appreciate those differences, given my background in the trade, and I was surprised by how different that restaurant was. I met Mr. Wong, the manager, who said the restaurant serves 500 covers a day, although I think that that is probably an underestimate. Some 50 per cent. of the restaurant&#146;s customers are Chinese, and it employs 15 waiters, two supervisors and two managers front of house. They all have to speak Cantonese, Mandarin and English. Mr. Wong is originally from Hong Kong, and has worked in the restaurant business in the UK for 30 years, 10 of them as manager of the Golden Dragon. He was worried about the impact of the new rules and their enforcement, as were many other restaurateurs whom I met last night.</p>

Wong&#151;no relation&#151;who has no English to speak of, so I had to speak to him through an interpreter. He has 40 years&#146; experience in catering, and his apprenticeship in Hong Kong lasted five years. He had to do a further five years&#146; on-the-job training before he could be considered for the position of head chef, and he told me that he was still learning. He was hired from Hong Kong seven years ago, and he has worked in China and the Philippines. He had no problem obtaining a work permit, and has permanent residency status. However, as things are currently configured, the chances are that he would not qualify to come here under the points-based system. He is an expert in Cantonese cooking, but he said that he can only do &#147;a little bit&#148; of Szechuan cooking, which makes the point about the differences in cuisine. Indeed, the restaurant employs a different chef to make dim sum. There are 100 dishes on the menu that Mr. Wong has to be able to make, and he mixes marinades and sauces from his own ingredients, making them from scratch. He is in charge of a staff of 20 in the kitchen. He said he is four or five short&#151;he cannot find the right number of people&#151;so the staff have to work harder and longer hours.</p>

There was no shouting in the kitchen, and everyone was quietly getting on with their work&#151;the only noise was the cooking sounds in the incredible heat. There was an incredible degree of organisation under Mr. Wong&#146;s control, and it was very different from trying to cook a Chinese meal at home or the pastiches one sometimes find in western restaurants. Mr. Wong insists that his staff speak Cantonese, which is the language of the Chinese kitchen. He said that it would create confusion and be very dangerous from a health and safety point of view if people did not speak Chinese. His staff are mainly from Hong Kong&#151;some  <br>

He says that without basic communication in Chinese, it would be difficult to create a 10-course banquet, which is a team effort and requires maximum co-ordination. The orders from the restaurant are written in Chinese. The suppliers from whom he buys his ingredients use Cantonese as their language. He is a hard-working member of our community but would probably not qualify under the present system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o351"><a name="80424-0019.htm_para1"><a name="08042469000116">The customers expect authenticity. They expect to see Chinese staff in a Chinese restaurant. They want the quality, variety and distinctive Chinese character of the cuisine, which would be significantly under threat without migrant chefs, and the quality would suffer. The techniques and ingredients are important, but the range and methods of cooking distinguish one chef from another. The erosion of that distinctive character would inevitably result in a reduction in quality and impact on the business.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o352"><a name="80424-0019.htm_para2"><a name="08042469000117">There must be a common-sense approach. We must recognise the serious problem of recruitment and regularise existing staff. The points-based system must allow some flexibility with respect to experience, qualifications and the language requirement, otherwise we will see our popular Chinese takeaways and restaurants across the country closing down. When people cannot get their favourite meal, or they see the range and quality in decline, my hon. Friend will get the blame. Irrespective of what people say about immigration numbers, if one asks them whether they want their local takeaway or restaurant to close down as a consequence of clamping down on immigration, they would probably all say no.</p>

I can see that that may not be welcomed by the employers, but I am rather surprised that on the Labour Back Benches it is considered deplorable that people in Chinese restaurants are seeing their pay go up to a level better reflecting that of the rest of the economy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o356"><a name="80424-0019.htm_para6"><a name="08042469000122">One distinctive feature of policy under the Government is that it is usually designed to create an impression, which is often very different from the effect that it is supposed to have on the reality. Nothing could better reflect that than the points-based system&#151;the Australian-like points-based system to which the Government often refer&#151;which is presented as though it will severely restrict immigration into this country. If that is its intention, could the Minister tell us his broad estimate of the effect that it will have on the level of net immigration into this country? Is that the Government&#146;s intention? Is the policy in line with the arguments that they use to justify the large-scale immigration that we have had since 1997?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o357"><a name="80424-0019.htm_para7"><a name="08042469000123">The Government use two kinds of arguments to justify that mass immigration. The first set of arguments imply that the economic benefits resulting from immigration are proportionate to the number of people coming into the country to work. Their argument, for example, that it contributes to the gross domestic product implies that the more people who come, the more the contribution to the GDP. The argument that there is a net contribution to the budget of the country implies that the more people coming in, the greater the net benefit for the rest of us. The argument that immigrants will be paying for our pensions implies that the more who come, the higher our pensions will be. Clearly, the implication is that we should not restrict immigration and that we should, in the words of a Home Office document, encourage, sustain and increase the level of lawful immigration into this country. The implication is that there should be no case for using a points-based system, or any other, to reduce immigration. I shall come back shortly to those specific arguments and how they have been demolished by the House of Lords report.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o358"><a name="80424-0019.htm_para8"><a name="08042469000124">Another set of arguments implies that there is a finite need for immigration. I am thinking particularly of the argument that there are shortages of certain categories of employee. That is relevant and could, at least in theory, justify the Government&#146;s proposals.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o359"><a name="80424-0019.htm_para9"><a name="08042469000125">However, initially I want to discuss the first set of arguments&#151;that net immigration adds &#163;6 billion to the gross domestic product every year. The way in which the Government normally present the issue is to say that immigrants contribute &#163;6 billion to the economy every year. The implication is that, generously, immigrants are giving us &#163;6 billion, from which the rest of us benefit. That is a very false impression, because the Government are giving the gross figure. They do not say to us that immigrants, as well as producing added value worth &#163;6 billion, expect&#151;quite reasonably, in my view&#151;to be paid for their work. They are paid a value that in the national income statistics shows up as exactly equal, at &#163;6 billion.</p>

net contribution to the economy is zero. Just like all of us, they put in what they get out. None of us gives things to other people for free; we expect to be paid for them. We do not make other people better off by making the economy a bit bigger by being here. Unless and until the Government are prepared to recognise that people are consumers as well as producers, they will not make much sense.</p>

It implies that we want a fixed number of people, should work out who they are and let them in, and that will be fine. Several years ago, Tony Blair, while Prime Minister, said that there were 600,000 vacancies in this country and that we needed net immigration to fill them. Since then, we have had several million people come into this country, and we still have 600,000 vacancies. Why? Because immigrants are not just producers but consumers&#151;they consume as much as they produce. The essence of the fallacy on which the Government rely is exactly the same as the &#147;lump of labour&#148; fallacy that the British National party relies on when it says that immigrants take British jobs, implying that there is a fixed amount of work to be done and a fixed number of jobs, and that immigrants take them and therefore render the domestic population unemployed. That is a fallacy, and the Government recognise that. However, by the same token it is a fallacy to assume that when  <br>

<p><a name="stpa_o363"><a name="80424-0019.htm_para13"><a name="08042469000137">Another fallacy behind the &#147;shortage&#148; argument to which I drew the Minister&#146;s attention&#151;in his agreeable way, he simply accepted it even though it entirely demolished his own argument&#151;is that in a free and flexible market, where the value of each skill is allowed to reach its market-clearing level, there will not be a shortage, because the market-clearing level is by definition the level of pay, salary or remuneration that equates demand and supply with that level of skill. For a while, we held down the value of nurses&#146; pay below the market-clearing level, and we had to fill the resulting shortage from abroad. When we started paying nurses a more realistic amount&#151;as I had long urged that we should&#151;we found that we did not have any intrinsic shortage, and indeed had a surplus. However, that has not stopped us in the meantime importing 60,000 nurses from sub-Saharan Africa at a time when the Government&#146;s official policy was not to recruit any nurses from Africa at all. If we maintain pay below the market-clearing level, we have to rely on sources of supply from outside on an ongoing basis, and at the same time we fail to give employers or employees the incentive to acquire those skills domestically.

The Government present it as a system of control, so how will they actually use it? We already know that, because they have introduced a points-based system&#151;the highly skilled migrant programme. That was an innovation, because up until that point someone could come to this country with a work permit only if they had an offer of a job. In 2002, the Government set the level of points that were required for someone to come to this country under that programme looking for a job. It so happened that they initially set the level of qualifications required to get sufficient points to be allowed in at a level that led to very few people applying. Did they say, &#147;Oh, that&#146;s fine&#151;there aren&#146;t many people with the qualifications that we think are necessary, so we&#146;ll just accept that that is the small number who are going to come here?&#148; No; in June 2004, they promptly reduced the number of points required and reduced the skill level needed&#151;still calling it the highly skilled migrant programme&#151;and a year later they had been totally swamped by the numbers coming in under that programme. We must therefore have no expectation that in practice the Government will use this as a method of control.</p>

No; there are certain categories of skill which by definition we do not have in this country and cannot simply acquire by offering a certain sum of money or making a certain training programme available. Above all, they are job-specific and firm-specific skills. A company such as IBM may have a specific accounting procedure, and when it is setting up a process here it will want to bring in its accountancy staff to set it up and train people to run it. After five or 10 years, they will probably go home again. Another firm, such as Nissan,  <br>

might be setting up a factory and has its own way of running it. Initially its people will be brought in to set it up, train the indigenous people, transfer those skills, and then return home. That was the primary source of work permits until 1997. They were issued to those with firm, specific skills to bring to this country. We will always need that flow, and it is usually a two-way one in the long run. The suggestion, however, that skills that British people have, could acquire more of and should be trained to acquire more of should be provided by importing cheap labour from abroad is a fallacy that underlies the Government&#146;s programme, meaning that it will not be used to control immigration but to maintain an unacceptably and unnecessarily high level of mass immigration into this country.</p>

Member for Hendon, but I would just like to quickly skim through some of them. They said that they are already having to close restaurants because of staff shortages, and several people there were former restaurant owners who said that because they could not get the staff they had had to go out of business.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o369"><a name="80424-0019.htm_para19"><a name="08042469000144">They expressed concern about immigration raids at peak times. Although they accept that the Borders and Immigration Agency has a right to find out whether illegal working going on, they thought that it could be done more sensitively, perhaps at the close or start of business. Concern was also expressed that when illegal workers were detected in the restaurants, there was no follow-up, such as deportation or any action against the restaurant owners. Obviously, they were not advocating that action be taken against them, but what is the purpose of those raids if no action is taken afterwards?</p>

The point has been made that people from the Bangladeshi community, in particular, do not want to follow in their parents&#146; footsteps by going into the restaurant trade, but not everyone from those communities can become doctors. Not everyone has the academic ability or skills required to become a doctor, lawyer or engineer. Some people will have to go into non-professional jobs, and there is an issue about raising the status of working in the restaurant sector. We have heard that there are no Chinese catering courses at UK colleges. If such catering was more professionalised and attracted proper qualifications, people might be persuaded to go in for it. We should also consider how well people are paid. However, that is for the longer term.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o380"><a name="80424-0020.htm_para6"><a name="08042469000157">It is clear that we need different, Scottish solutions for distinct Scottish problems. The first thing that we need to do is acknowledge that Scotland is different. If the Minister could just nod his head to indicate that he is aware that Scotland&#146;s population and immigration issues are quite different, that would be a start. Once we have acknowledged that, let us try to find the solutions. My solution is clear and elegant: Scotland should have the powers to determine its own immigration requirements. Scotland should be the same as every other normal nation in the world. We could determine the solutions that are in the interests of the Scottish people and the strategies and approaches that would address our particular population and immigration problems.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o381"><a name="80424-0020.htm_para7"><a name="08042469000158">I know that the Minister will not agree with that proposal, so I will park it to one side for now. Can the points-based system help Scotland address its distinct population and immigration requirements? I will encourage the Minister by agreeing that it can. We have adopted the Australian system in practically every respect other than one: the ability to allow inter-state development, under which the individual states of Australia can determine their immigration requirements. That is a central feature of the useful Australian model, which is called the state-specific migration mechanism. That mechanism is designed exclusively for use by areas of Australia that are suffering from population decline, which is very much the challenge that we in Scotland face. The state-specific migration mechanism operates by allowing state governments to assess applications on their own and to allow them to live and work in distinct Australian states. Even though applicants might not meet the general Australian criteria, they may meet the state criteria. That is how the points-based system could be changed to accommodate Scotland&#146;s distinct requirements.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o382"><a name="80424-0020.htm_para8"><a name="08042469000159">If the Government are not prepared to do that, perhaps they will listen to Sir Trevor Phillips, who recently came to Scotland to speak about the points-based system. He talked about tilting the entire arrangement to favour Scotland, so that any prospective applicant appearing before a board to assess whether they should become a citizen of the UK who was prepared to live and work in Scotland would be topped up with extra points. We need some 25,000 immigrants a year just to stand still in Scotland. If we do not get them, we will start to suffer from depopulation again, which will have an incredible impact on our economy and our nation&#146;s demography, and leave Scotland behind. We need a distinct and different approach. If the Government are not prepared to consider how the points-based system could be applied differently across the constituent parts of the nation, for goodness&#146; sake allow the Scottish Parliament the powers and the opportunities to do so. That is the sensible solution.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o383"><a name="80424-0020.htm_para9"><a name="08042469000160">I have one more quick point. I am concerned about the fresh talent scheme, which was the one thing that gave us a competitive advantage in the United Kingdom. The scheme allowed talented graduates to remain in Scotland for a number of years once they  <br>

had finished their course. It was a fantastically successful policy, which was outlined by the previous so-called Labour-Liberal Executive, with 8,000 people going through its doors, benefiting the Scottish economy and enhancing their careers. That programme is now to be deleted, according to the guidelines from the Home Office, and subsumed into the tier 1 arrangements. Scotland will therefore lose its competitive advantage in recruiting those talents.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o384"><a name="80424-0020.htm_para10"><a name="08042469000161">My very last, quick point is a plea to the Minister, to whom I know many representations have been made, about my other great interest, arts and culture. The Edinburgh fringe festival could suffer serious restrictions from the suggested ending of the free permit arrangements, which allow people to come to events such as the fringe without the need of a work permit. The introduction of sponsorship will affect some 3,000 people, and real solutions are required if non-EU performers are still to be able to come into the UK to work at the festival. If those solutions are not found, Edinburgh could lose its dominant position as the greatest, biggest and best international arts festival in the world. We have serious concerns about this matter, and I hope that the Minister will have something encouraging to say.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o385"><a name="80424-0020.htm_para11"><a name="08042469000162">We have no problem with the principle of the points-based system, and there are solutions that the Minister could use if he had the political will to help us to deal with our specific requirements and needs. I hope that he will tell us that he acknowledges that and that he is prepared to look at these issues.</p>

 I welcome the fact that we have been able to have this debate. I said at the outset that I thought I would learn a great deal this afternoon, and I have not been disappointed. I have learned a great deal. I am glad that almost all the speakers started by recognising the extraordinary social and cultural contribution that newcomers to this country have made. I am glad that the House has put that issue beyond question. We have also had a helpful debate about the economics of the subject. I hope that we shall have a further opportunity to deconstruct the House of Lords report in more depth. The Government will have to publish their response to it quite soon; perhaps that will be our next big opportunity.</p>

He has done a great deal to try to moderate the immigration policy that he inherited from the 2005 manifesto, but he is none the less a member of the party that he represents. However, he did a good job&#151;if a little churlishly at the edges&#151;of accepting that there are economic benefits to migration, although that was disputed a bit by some of his colleagues. He and I traded quotations and statistics, and I cannot resist the temptation to pop in just one more quotation. Somebody once said that</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o388"><a name="80424-0020.htm_para14"><a name="08042469000166">The hon. Member for Ashford accused me of a lack of radicalism before refusing to lay out his own policy in detail. I accept that the questions will come to him, rather than to me, about precisely where the beef is in his policy, and that is a subject that he will have to contend with. None the less, he also said something extremely significant that I have not heard him say before. Indeed, I have not heard it said on his side of the House in the past couple of years. He said that he welcomed the points system and called it a step forward. That was a delayed confession, but a welcome one none the less, and it was echoed by the hon. Member for Eastleigh (Chris Huhne) as well as by my right hon. Friend the Member for Leicester, East (Keith Vaz), which I appreciate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o389"><a name="80424-0020.htm_para15"><a name="08042469000167">My right hon. Friend&#146;s words were echoed, to some extent, by my hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, East (Kerry McCarthy). They have both been extraordinary champions for the arguments that they put across this afternoon. I say to my right hon. Friend that I note the comments that have been made by the Immigration Law Practitioners Association and by the Bangladeshi Catering Association. I, too, have heard the estimates that they have made of the importance of the industries that they represent in this country. Those figures really are a testament to the hard work, entrepreneurialism and flair of the migrant communities in this country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o390"><a name="80424-0020.htm_para16"><a name="08042469000168">I listened especially carefully to my right hon. Friend&#146;s arguments about the need to retain rights of appeal. He will know that that is a subject on which we have a couple of consultations running at the moment and, before we conclude our responses to those consultations, I will reflect carefully on the remarks that he has made this afternoon. I hope that he will also be happy to hear that I have ordered a review of the way in which we use and work with ethnic minority media to get across the messages about some of our reforms.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o391"><a name="80424-0020.htm_para17"><a name="08042469000169">I have also listened carefully to what hon. Members have said about the manner and conduct of enforcement operations. I very much welcome what they had to say about the need for enforcement operations. It is an area on which I think there is a degree of consensus throughout the House. Alongside a policy of stronger border protection, it is vital to have a policy for preventing illegal immigration. That means preventing illegal working, because it is illegal jobs which cause illegal journeys. That is why we have doubled the budget for enforcement and why we have stepped up operations to deal with illegal working by 40 per cent. over the last year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o392"><a name="80424-0020.htm_para18"><a name="08042469000170">My right hon. Friend may not know this, but raids are not authorised by Ministers; they are conducted on the basis of independent operational judgments and based on available intelligence. I listened carefully to what he said, some of which was echoed by my hon. Friends the Members for Hendon (Mr. Dismore) and for Brent, North (Barry Gardiner), particularly the need to be sensitive in the way in which we conduct those operations. I will ensure that that message is conveyed to the regional directors responsible for overseeing them.</p>

argument is made, that although the Home Office may have written the cheque for the report&#151;enabling the House to question the value for money that the Home Office achieved&#151;it was a university of London report. Indeed, when the Immigration Minister at the time&#151;my right hon. Friend who is now the Secretary of State for Defence&#151;was questioned in the House about estimates for the future, he assiduously refused, on the record, to make any projections of his own.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o394"><a name="80424-0020.htm_para20"><a name="08042469000172">I welcome some of the other remarks of the hon. Member for Eastleigh. I welcome his welcome for the points system and I am glad that he said that enforcement operations were important&#151;I think he said that they were vital. The vote against the rises in visa fees that will help us double our enforcement work over the years to come was made before he became the Liberal Democrat spokesman. I hope that he will feel able to change that policy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o395"><a name="80424-0020.htm_para21"><a name="08042469000173">I want to pick up particularly on one point that the hon. Member for Eastleigh made. It is about the need for English as a foundation for integration. I absolutely concur with that analysis. When I spent three months going around the UK, talking to people all over the country about the values that they thought we needed to put at the heart of the immigration system, the need for everyone to be able to speak English was absolutely the first value that they thought was important.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o396"><a name="80424-0020.htm_para22"><a name="08042469000174">I say to my hon. Friend the Member for Brent, North that I do not think that officially we have stated the standard of English that we believe will be important in tier 2. All I would say to the House this afternoon is that I do not think that we should see command of English as an issue simply in the context of the workplace. People come to this country and do not just work. While they are here, they are also members of British society. It is therefore important if we believe in an inclusive society that people are able to function as members of it. I think that some command of English would help, so we see the policy as important not just in the context of the points system but to those who want to make the UK their long-term home.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o397"><a name="80424-0020.htm_para23"><a name="08042469000175">The second set of points that my hon. Friend the Member for Brent, North made concerned the definition of skilled work. That was also very much the substance of the remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for Hendon, who is a powerful voice for the Chinese community in this House. He will be pleased to know that I discussed with the Chinese Government in Beijing last week the subject that he raised this afternoon. I have discussed it too with the Chinese ambassador in London. I am very much looking forward to our field trip to Chinatown, which I hope can be reorganised quite soon.</p>

The House will not know this, but my cooking is terrible and my grip on English is shaky enough, never mind my grasp of foreign languages, but  <br>

if I had the ability to speak another language and to cook well, some in the House might accuse me of having some kind of skill. The question is how we recognise that skill in the points system. We cannot do it on the basis of some macroeconomic analysis; we need a more granular picture, which I hope the migration advisory committee will give us.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o399"><a name="80424-0020.htm_para25"><a name="08042469000177">The hon. Member for Hertsmere (Mr. Clappison) made some points about numbers, and the hon. Member for Perth and North Perthshire (Pete Wishart) injected a bit of nuance into the issue. We must take a national approach to the question of numbers.

 I welcome the opportunity to raise the issue of Basildon golf course. As Members may know, the Friends of Basildon Golf Course has secured the right to a judicial review of the council&#146;s decision to grant planning permission. I appreciate that that places a constraint on what I can say, and will also constrain the Minister&#146;s reply. I assure the House that I will not trespass on the areas covered by the judicial review, and that all the information that I shall give is already in the public domain.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o405"><a name="80424-0021.htm_para0"><a name="08042469000185">I thank the Friends of Basildon Golf Course for the tenacity it has shown in its campaign, and for the forensic and professional way in which it has conducted itself&#151;particularly Mick and Janet Toomer and John Toplis, although I do not mean to overlook the contributions of many others. I am also indebted to the well-known local naturalist Rod Cole for information that he has supplied. The nearest that I have got to playing golf is crazy golf on holiday, and friends who have seen me putt on a crazy golf site might well be amused by my choice of debate this evening; but I intend to illustrate why the development or, more accurately, the destruction of Basildon golf course as we know it has incensed more people than just those who play golf.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o406"><a name="80424-0021.htm_para1"><a name="08042469000186">Basildon golf course has been a municipal course since 1967, and before that had been cultivated land for hundreds of years. When Basildon development corporation created Basildon new town, it respected this valuable asset and planned its long-term protection by creating a golf course on the site, and placing covenants on the land so that it could only be used as a golf course or for farming or recreational purposes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o407"><a name="80424-0021.htm_para2"><a name="08042469000187">Much of the 164-acre site is located within a mile of Basildon town centre. It really is a green lung. It is popular with golfers, walkers and dog walkers, as well as those who just enjoy it and value its biodiversity. It would be possible to make an entire speech about that aspect alone, but I want to single out a few valuable nuggets of helpful information.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o408"><a name="80424-0021.htm_para3"><a name="08042469000188">This is one of the few places in the new town where birds of prey are regularly seen. It is widely used by wild birds, including some rarities. We see badgers, weasels, foxes and grey squirrels, and even adders and lizards are known to inhabit the site. There are three scarce species of bumble bee&#151;which is remarkable in south Essex&#151;two of which are UK biodiversity action plan species, and no fewer than 28 species of butterfly are known to be on the site or immediately adjacent to it. However, even for those who do not share this enthusiasm for nature, it has to be said that it is a beautiful site and it has retained its beauty as the town has developed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o409"><a name="80424-0021.htm_para4"><a name="08042469000189">Basildon district council decided that the course should be leased for 99 years to a new company that is part of the Jack Barker golf group. There was real public concern about that, but the council is certainly within its rights to do that if it believes that it would be in the interests of Basildon residents. That decision on  <br>

its own, although not universally welcomed, is not the reason why there has been such a huge public outcry. Personally, I would have preferred to have seen greater efforts made to keep this facility public and in the control of the council, and accountable to residents.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o410"><a name="80424-0021.htm_para5"><a name="08042469000190">The origins of the decision to lease the course appear to be financial, as income from the course was not meeting council targets. Following a competitive bidding process, the Jack Barker golf group was awarded the lease, and I am told that at no stage in the process did the company mention the importation of landfill, let alone in the quantities that have since been agreed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o411"><a name="80424-0021.htm_para6"><a name="08042469000191">In September 2007, planning permission was given for 120,000 cu m of landfill to&#151;it was claimed&#151;&#147;improve&#148; the site. I have to admit that I am not an expert on golf courses, and I have no doubt that it is perfectly possible that the course could benefit from improvements. I would have no objection to some landfill being used for those improvements and for re-profiling, but not 120,000 cu m. Depending on the size of the lorries carrying the waste, there would be between 8,000 and 12,000 lorry loads of waste over a six-month period. I should add that this is only phase one of the development, and that the total plans are for 321,000 cu m of waste.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o412"><a name="80424-0021.htm_para7"><a name="08042469000192">Aside from the huge amounts of traffic thundering through Basildon streets, we must wonder what the implications of this will be. I have tried to visualise what 120,000 cu m of waste actually looks like. If we think about a wall being built that is 1 m high and 1 m wide, we could rebuild Hadrian&#146;s wall, or there could be a wall from Basildon to Westminster and back again with some left over. That is the scale of the dumping there will be on this site.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o413"><a name="80424-0021.htm_para8"><a name="08042469000193">Local residents and the wider community are understandably concerned about the impact of the proposed development on local traffic congestion, particularly outside Basildon university hospital, which treats 77,000 people a year and has one of the busiest accident and emergency units in the country. They are also concerned about the noise, dust and finer particulates that will be generated. Fine particulates are potentially carcinogenic and can be hazardous to those with respiratory problems. Older residents also fear a recurrence of the flooding that occurred in the 1960s, when homes were flooded by water running off the golf course after a storm. These fears may be unfounded, but what concerns residents is that there does not appear to have been a full assessment of all the possible implications, so residents have been unable to obtain the reassurances they need. For a number of homes overlooking the golf course, the view of trees and open space will be lost forever. Let us imagine what it will be like to see, instead of those trees and that green space, a 24 ft high wall of inert waste. It is no wonder people that are distressed. Basildon university hospital is located on a very busy roundabout close to the golf course, alongside St. Luke&#146;s hospice and Thurrock and Basildon college.</p>

unanimous decision. The only two opposition committee members&#151;Labour councillors Lynda Gordon and Danny Nandandwar&#151;were unconvinced by the arguments and felt that not all their concerns had been addressed. They voted against planning permission. One councillor, Frank Tomlin, after voting in favour of the plans had a letter published in the local paper, the <i> Echo</i>. Somewhat surprisingly, he stated:</p>

It is highly likely Jack Barker will make money from the development. If we could and did refuse planning permission because an applicant would gain financially, nothing would ever be built. The law does not allow us that option&#148;.</p>
</ul>

In fairness, I think that if councillors had seen some of the information that I have now seen, there would have been more questions asked and greater examination of the detail, and permission might well have been refused.</p>

Based on the information provided, Natural England has no objection to the proposed development on the basis of impacts on Basildon Meadows SSSI, subject to the proposal being carried out in strict accordance with the details of the application. The reason for this view is that we consider that this proposal in isolation will not have a significant effect on the interest features of Basildon Meadows SSSI. However, we are aware that this application is linked to the developer&#146;s aspiration to develop a much larger area of the golf course. The impact of this larger scale of development, including the proposals within the current application, would be likely to result in significant adverse impacts upon Basildon Meadows SSSI. These impacts would include significant hydrological change as a result of landscaping and air pollution impacts caused by increased road traffic, therefore, based on the currently available information, Natural England would object to such proposals&#148;.</p>

It was not endorsing the detailed design, the precise location, the importation of landfill, the cutting down of trees or any other aspect of the environmental impact. Importantly, it was also not endorsing changes to the design of the course. Again, it would have been helpful if councillors had been given that information.</p>

The rules calling on councillors to resist the building of large-scale clubhouses and to scrutinise closely the installation of driving ranges in the district have been jettisoned in the latest local plan. The council&#146;s cabinet member for regeneration, Stephen Horgan, freely admitted that councillors had had Basildon golf course in mind when deciding to scrap the guidelines. He said:</p>

responses from the public and those affected by this proposal was 18 April. That is almost a full month before things were submitted to the council. So those people whose homes look out on to trees and a green area&#151;they will now be faced by a 24 ft bank that holds a driving range with associated lights and so on&#151;were not given any opportunity to object to the proposed height of the driving range.</p>

It was finally decided that a no licence was required because the waste would not be stored but would be dumped where it would be used, so no landfill tax applied.</p>

I asked him to delay progress so that the issues could be further examined and fully investigated.

It should be a proactive examination of all the issues involved. Will she ask the Environment Agency to visit those areas that have already seen such works, such as Risebridge in Romford, and Nottingham, to get a fuller picture of what such dumping really means?</p>

adhered to? It appears that some local authorities merely give the DEFRA hotline number. Surely the local authority has some responsibility, too. How many licences or paragraph 19 exemptions have been withdrawn either temporarily or permanently? If a developer is granted a licence or an exemption for one purpose, can they change the reason once it has been issued?</p>

She has obviously given great support  to the Friends of Basildon Golf Course in their campaign. I fear, however, that she will find my speech rather less spirited than her own.

However, I understand that Essex county council has expressed disappointment that it was not fully consulted on whether the development should be considered as a county matter.</p>

Friend the Member for Hartlepool (Mr. Wright), who has responsibility for housing and planning.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o442"><a name="80424-0022.htm_para2"><a name="08042469000223">Waste recovery and disposal activities are governed by a system of permits designed to protect the environment and human health. European legislation provides member states with the discretion to provide for exemptions from the need to have a permit for recovery operations. My hon. Friend the Member for Basildon asked how much landfill tax could be raised if a quarter of the waste that is currently exempted from the tax were not exempt, but we aim to reduce the amount of waste going to landfill and encourage the bona fide reuse, recycling and recovery of waste wherever it is legitimately possible.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o443"><a name="80424-0022.htm_para3"><a name="08042469000224">To that end, the Government make extensive use of exemptions in order to apply a light regulatory touch and to encourage low-risk recycling and recovery operations. When the deposit of waste constitutes recovery, golf courses and other landscaping developments can benefit from one of the exemptions currently provided for, which my hon. Friend now knows are called paragraph 19 exemptions, after the relevant part of the regulations from which they derive.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o444"><a name="80424-0022.htm_para4"><a name="08042469000225">The exemptions are valid only if the works in question are carried out in accordance with planning legislation, and it is limited to the types and origin of wastes detailed in the regulations. It is required that the operation be registered with the Environment Agency. Registration of an exemption is a much simpler system than permitting and does not in itself require consultation. A notification of an exempt activity at the site in question was received by the Environment Agency on 19 December last year. From the information supplied, the Environment Agency is satisfied that the proposal meets the terms of the exemption.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o445"><a name="80424-0022.htm_para5"><a name="08042469000226">My hon. Friend asked how many such exemptions there are. There are currently more than 2,700 paragraph 19 exemptions registered with the Environment Agency. An exemption allows waste to be used for a range of purposes, not just the landscaping of golf courses. They include noise screens for major roads, foundations for new housing developments and the repair of roads and tracks using waste. I think that she might have wondered how many of the exemptions are for golf courses, but I am afraid that I am unable to tell her.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o447"><a name="80424-0022.htm_para7"><a name="08042469000228">My hon. Friend asked about paragraph 19 exemptions that have ceased to apply, and I can tell her that just three have been deregistered in the past year. She asked about developments at other golf courses, such as the one at Risebridge park. As a result of concerns raised by the hon. Member for Romford (Andrew Rosindell), I have asked the Environment Agency to look into the activities at that site. I have also been advised that Environment Agency staff in the Thames, north-east area are in the process of setting up workshops with the relevant local authorities to discuss how they can work in partnership with regard to golf course developments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o448"><a name="80424-0022.htm_para8"><a name="08042469000229">I believe that work has not yet started at Basildon golf course, but I want to give my hon. Friend an undertaking that, should the project proceed, I will ask the Environment Agency to monitor the site closely and report its findings to me. If the activities are not being carried out in accordance with the exemption criteria, or if pollution of the environment or any risk of harm to human health occurs, the Environment Agency will remove the exemption registration and require the developer to stop the activity or obtain an environmental permit. I am confident that the Environment Agency has sufficient powers and that it will use them to take appropriate enforcement action against any unlawful operators, or against those causing harm or pollution.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o449"><a name="80424-0022.htm_para9"><a name="08042469000230">This important debate and other communications from hon. Members have highlighted widespread concerns about the sometimes inappropriate use of the paragraph 19 exemption for &#147;sham&#148; recovery to avoid the costs of landfilling. As a result of that and other issues connected with waste exemptions, a review of the exemptions regime is already well under way&#151;something that my hon. Friend suggested should happen.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o450"><a name="80424-0022.htm_para10"><a name="08042469000231">The minimisation of abuses of the system is a key priority for that review, as is the need to encourage genuinely low-risk and small-scale recycling and recovery operations. A consultation is due to be launched this summer, with a new scheme of exemptions being delivered in October next year. My hon. Friend may want to make some representations to that review.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o451"><a name="80424-0022.htm_para11"><a name="08042469000232">As part of the review, we have drawn on evidence from the Environment Agency, and on its experience of regulating exemptions in England and Wales. We have also made an assessment of the risks that those activities pose. As a result, our proposals will set out that the paragraph 19 exemption for the use of waste for construction purposes must be tightened significantly. There is currently no quantity limit on the amount of waste that can be used under the exemption&#151;and it is clear that quantity is one of my hon. Friend&#146;s major concerns&#151;but the proposals include the implementation of a very low quantity threshold for the exemption. Projects that are above the threshold&#151;that group would clearly include the sort of operation that she described&#151;will be required to operate under an environmental permit, with the additional regulatory controls that come with it.</p>
