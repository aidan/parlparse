 At September 2004, nearly 14,000 radiographers were working in the NHS in England, an increase of more than 2,000 or 18 per cent. since 1997.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o1"><a name="60131-01_spnew0"><b> Mr. Jones: </b> 
 The Secretary of State will be aware that an article in the <i>British Medical Journal</i> of 14 January reported that many radiotherapy departments are overstretched and understaffed, which was having a substantial effect on patients&#039; survival. The article reported that

 Order. Will the hon. Gentleman resume his seat? Supplementary questions should be brief. Yesterday, there were several points of order from Back Benchers complaining that they were not called, so a supplementary question must be brief. We will leave the hon.

<br>&nbsp;<br>radiography has fallen. It was just below 3.5 per cent. in 2005, and although it is higher for therapeutic radiography, that, too, has fallen significantly in recent years. That, in part, is because we have doubled the number of students entering radiography courses, as well as increasing the number of radiographers in employment.

 My hon. Friend would, if he wanted an MRI scan, because urgent MRI scans are completed within two weeks and non-urgent ones within 12 weeks. That has been achieved by a flexible working pattern&#151;a six-day working pattern, with a 12-hour day. Is that not the future for the NHS?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o7"><a name="60131-01_spnew6"><b> Ms Hewitt: </b> 
 I entirely agree with my hon. Friend and I am delighted to have the opportunity to congratulate staff at Medway Maritime hospital, who have slashed the waiting time for urgent and for routine MRI scans. They have taken advantage of the work force reforms that we introduced with &quot;Agenda for Change&quot; and the new roles, particularly for assistant radiographers and advanced practitioners. Unlike the Opposition, we do not simply talk about waiting times&#151;we take action to cut them.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o8"><a name="60131-01_spnew7"><b> Mr. John Baron  (Billericay)</b> 
 (Con): The figures quoted by the Secretary of State sound good, but the real issue is the skills shortage among senior radiographers, partly because targets have hindered specialist training, and, according to the Royal College of Radiologists, the significantly longer waiting times since 1998 that cancer patients have had to endure. We have raised the issue in the past. The Government said they would look into the problem, but little has been done. In order to move the discussion on, will the Secretary of State tell us how the Government can provide the right solution to this growing problem if they cannot quantify the problem, because they continually refuse to measure radiotherapy waiting times?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o9"><a name="60131-01_spnew8"><b> Ms Hewitt: </b> 
 As part of our commitment to reduce to a maximum of 18 weeks the total wait from GP referral right through to treatment, we will start this year to measure the hitherto hidden waiting times, including those for MRI and other scans. Far from refusing to accept that there is a problem, we have been taking action to deal with it. We have set earlier targets to speed up treatment as well as diagnosis for cancer patients, so we are already seeing the waiting times for cancer patients falling dramatically. I hope the hon. Gentleman welcomes that.

<b>31 Jan 2006 : Column 149</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>considerably given the skills that they are now expected to exercise. Is my right hon. Friend sure that we have enough training places? When I took this up with the Government four years ago, we clearly did not.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o11"><a name="60131-01_spnew10"><b> Ms Hewitt: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is right to refer to the situation that pertained four years ago. We have doubled&#151;in the case of diagnostic radiographers, more than doubled&#151;the number of students taking training. Three new radiology academies were opened in 2005. We are increasing training capacity without affecting patient care.

 (Con): How many cases of HIV/AIDS there were in England and Wales in the latest period for which figures are available. [46701]
</p>


<p><a name="st_o12"><a name="60131-01_spmin1"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health  (Caroline Flint): </b> 
 There were 5,171 new diagnoses of HIV in England and Wales for 2005 reported by the end of December 2005.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o13"><a name="60131-01_spnew11"><b> Mr. Evans: </b> 
 Those are disturbing figures. In 1987, as the Minister will know, there were 2,500 cases; now, she has given a figure of 5,500, and it will probably be nearer to 7,000 by the time the statistics come in. Almost 500 people died of AIDS last year. The Secretary of State said that she believes in action, so let us have some action. When are we going to see the advertising campaign that was promised last year? Will the Minister guarantee that we will focus on ensuring that young people learn about how HIV is transmitted and how they can protect themselves against it?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o14"><a name="60131-01_spnew12"><b> Caroline Flint: </b> 
 One of the reasons the results are as I explained is that we have better reporting mechanisms for HIV. Having said that, we should not be complacent about the figures. We fund organisations such as the Terrence Higgins Trust to target, in particular, the gay community and the African community, where the prevalence of HIV is due partly to HIV acquired overseas. That is why the work that we do through the Department for International Development is so important. I am delighted that last week it was announced that sexual health is now one of six service priorities for the NHS, with a 48-hour target for access to genito-urinary medicine clinics. That goes alongside the &#163;300 million of investment that we have put into this area. There is an important need to deliver, based on the White Paper&#151;

</p>





<p><a name="st_o17"><a name="60131-01_spnew15"><b> Caroline Flint: </b> 
 My hon. Friend raises an interesting point. I am happy to discuss those issues with my colleagues in the Home Office. In relation to prison health, the changed arrangements mean that the services 

<br>&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>provided to those in custody as regards transmitted infections and drug use should improve over the next few years.

<p><a name="st_o18"><a name="60131-01_spnew16"><b> Anne Main  (St. Albans)</b> 
 (Con): In my constituency and across Hertfordshire and Bedfordshire, HIV and the diagnosis of AIDS has gone up by 1,500 per cent., yet there is now only one county sexual health promotion adviser, and his job is on the line. Our GUM clinic has had cuts. How can the Government say that sexual health is a priority when we are seeing massive increases in HIV and AIDS among the heterosexual population and massive cuts in GUM clinics and sexual health promotion?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o19"><a name="60131-01_spnew17"><b> Caroline Flint: </b> 
 I did not hear the period to which the hon. Lady was referring in relation to the increases that she mentioned. Part of our task is to facilitate the ability of people who may have acquired a sexually-transmitted infection, and within that, HIV, to come forward. That is partly why we introduced testing among pregnant women. Some 92 per cent. of HIV-infected women are diagnosed before delivery. In the past year, take-up of voluntary confidential testing has gone up from 54 per cent. to 75 per cent. We have to do more. However, I welcome the importance given to this within the NHS priorities. We must, on the basis of the White Paper, consider how better we can deliver sexual health services. Part of my job is to see how we can redesign services that are fit for purpose in dealing with this important area.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o20"><a name="60131-01_spnew18"><b> Dr. Phyllis Starkey  (Milton Keynes, South-West)</b> 
 (Lab): The Minister will be aware that individuals who are already suffering from another sexually transmitted disease are more susceptible to HIV infection if they are exposed to the virus. How soon does she think that all primary care trusts will be able to deliver the target of people having access to a GUM clinic within 48 hours?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o21"><a name="60131-01_spnew19"><b> Caroline Flint: </b> 
 The target is set for 2008 and we are heading for that. I am pleased to say that some primary care trusts are already making huge progress. Part of our job in the next couple of years is to identify best practice to ensure that it can be spread more quickly.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-01_para1">
<a name="stpa_o1">It is important that those issues are addressed for many reasons. For example, we shall roll out a national screening programme for chlamydia, and that is especially important not only in tackling a sexually transmitted infection but in halting the number of women who find that they have infertility problems 10 years down the road.

What will she do about it?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o23"><a name="60131-01_spnew21"><b> Caroline Flint: </b> 
 It is important to recognise that the national health service is for those who are eligible for it. It would send the wrong message if we said that people who were not entitled to that service should take

<br>&nbsp;<br>advantage of it. Having said that, there are several categories, including asylum seekers, for whom access to HIV treatment and services is and will continue to be available. The problems do not apply only to HIV treatment but to other matters, which we must tackle sensitively but appropriately given NHS resources.

<p><a name="st_o25"><a name="60131-02_spnew0"><b> Mr. Borrow: </b> 
 I share with my hon. Friend the Member for West Lancashire (Rosie Cooper) genuine concern about Cheshire and Merseyside strategic health authority&#039;s proposals to merge Southport and Ormskirk Hospital NHS Trust with other hospital trusts in Liverpool. Our fear is that the plans will lead to specialist services moving from Southport, thus undermining 24-hour accident and emergency services at the hospital. Will my right hon. Friend reassure my constituents that such changes will not be allowed to happen and that they have no reason to fear any running down of accident and emergency services at Southport?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o26"><a name="60131-02_spnew1"><b> Ms Hewitt: </b> 
 As my hon. Friend knows, Cheshire and Merseyside strategic health authority has recently helped us pilot a new programme to improve financial management in the NHS and to ascertain whether potential applicants are ready to apply for foundation hospital status. In that context, the health authority has been examining structures throughout the local health community. I am assured that there are no firm proposals to merge any NHS trusts in that SHA. I am sure that the authority will listen carefully to my hon. Friend&#039;s comments on the subject. If&#151;if&#151;any merger between different hospitals were proposed, it would not only be subject to full local consultation but require ministerial approval. There are currently no such firm proposals.

 (LD): Southport and Ormskirk Hospital NHS Trust has a deficit of &#163;15 million.

Why should services in my constituency suffer because we are blessed with new buildings? Will the Secretary of State examine the matter further and explain how hospitals such as Southport and Ormskirk can thrive under a system of payment by results?

Friends would join me in urging clinicians and other front-line staff and management to work closely together to tackle any waste and inefficiency and ensure that that hospital, like the majority of others in the NHS, not only continues to deliver better services for patients but does that within its substantially increased budget.

 My hon. Friend is right to praise the work of dental access centres, which have considerably improved access for patients, particularly those requiring emergency treatment. The point about the changes we are making in NHS dentistry is that the money that was previously handled nationally will remain at local level, particularly if NHS dentists choose to leave the NHS. It

 (Con): Does the Minister agree that the central purpose for which the NHS was established was to secure equitable access for those who need health care? Measured against that text, is it not true in Leicestershire, as it is all over the rest of the country, that access to NHS dentistry has gone backwards over the last eight years? The words she uses are familiar to me; I read them out from that Dispatch Box 10 years ago. When will the Government do something about improving access to NHS dentistry, rather than allow the position to continue to go backwards?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o47"><a name="60131-03_spnew5"><b> Ms Winterton: </b> 
 I am surprised that the right hon. Gentleman was reading out exactly the same words from the Dispatch Box, considering that he closed two dental schools and last week we announced that we are opening them. We are training another 170 dentists and investing more in NHS dentistry. I am not denying that there have been and continue to be problems. In his area, however, one of the PCTs has seen registrations increase by 13 per cent. over the past year, and there has been nearly &#163;500,000 of additional investment in personal dental services. We are reforming radically the way in which NHS dentistry is delivered in this country. Under his Administration, if a dentist left the NHS, the money reverted to central Government. Under our system, the money stays at local level so that PCTs can increase access, making sure that those who want to work in the NHS do so and are properly rewarded.

<p><a name="st_o48"><a name="60131-03_spnew6"><b> Mr. Andy Reed  (Loughborough)</b> 
 (Lab/Co-op): My hon. Friend knows that I have raised concerns in relation to Charnwood and North West Leicestershire PCT in the past. Is she aware, however, of a campaign that seems to be scaring many of my constituents? On Friday, I received a letter from the PCT, which it has had to write to me and other Members of Parliament for the area, in which it claims that such campaigns are causing unjustifiable alarm to many patients and should not be allowed. Does she agree that although there are problems, it is much better to have a rational debate than to make wild claims on both sides? The real problems need to be addressed to make sure that PCTs are in a position to provide services if dentists remove themselves from the NHS.

<p><a name="st_o49"><a name="60131-03_spnew7"><b> Ms Winterton: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is absolutely right. The chief executives of virtually all PCTs in the area wrote to the local dental committee pointing out that the posters being displayed in surgeries could result in patients unnecessarily taking up offers of private dentistry. They have requested that the local dental committee does not encourage dental practices to display those posters, and have been very clear that the offer made to dentists is reasonable. If dentists do not want to take it up, however, they will commission services either from other NHS dentists in the area or from about 1,000 new dentists coming through not only our international recruitment exercise but qualifying examinations taken via the international route.

</p>





<p><a name="st_o52"><a name="60131-03_spnew10"><b> Ms Winterton: </b> 
 Let us be clear. The reason we have made this change is that many Members complained that dentists were saying, &quot;We will take your children if you register privately.&quot; That was wrong and disgraceful, and that is what we have changed. That does not prevent PCTs saying to individual dental practices that if they want to take children only on the NHS, if the PCT agrees, they can do so. That was the difficulty that we were facing. Practices will still be allowed to take children only on the NHS if the PCT agrees.

<p><a name="st_o54"><a name="60131-03_spnew12"><b> Ms Winterton: </b> 
 We are always keen to ensure that our international recruitment programmes have the agreement of other Governments. When I visited Poland, where we have recruited some 250 dentists, I met representatives of the Polish Government and dental executive groups. They agreed that there was no problem with dentists coming to this country, and that it was not causing a shortage in their country. The same applies to the international qualifying examinations. As I have said, about 1,000 dentists will qualify over the next few months.

She will know that local dental committees believe queues will lengthen as a result of the new contract, that units of dental activity underpinning it have been miscalculated, and that her failure to pilot courts disaster. Is it not the case that, tragically, the <i>Leicester Mercury</i> photographer will need an even wider-angled lens for his next picture of queues in Leicestershire than the one he employed in the summer?

<p><a name="st_o56"><a name="60131-03_spnew14"><b> Ms Winterton: </b> 
 In fact, we have spent about five years piloting the new ways of working. That is why we know that dentists like it. It would be interesting to hear which parts of the policy the hon. Gentleman would change. Would he change an offer to dentists of approximately &#163;80,000 a year plus &#163;80,000 towards their business expenses? Would he ask us not to guarantee it for three years? Would he say that we do not need 5 per cent. less activity for that purpose? Would he not have opened a new dental surgery&#151;

 I do not accept that the proposals in the White Paper are a threat to A and E departments. We have made enormous improvements to the performance of A and E departments. I remember, as I am sure the hon. Gentleman does, that not so long ago patients spent hours on end on trolleys in the corridors of A and E departments. That was absolutely unacceptable. We introduced the four-hour target. A lot of A and E consultants said that that could not be achieved, but now admit that it has been. It has been helped by the fact that 25 per cent. of all A and E patients are now seen in a walk-in centre or minor injuries unit, which is better not only for them but for the blue light cases who need to attend a major A and E department.

 I simply do not recognise any evidence for the allegations that the hon. Gentleman is making. There was indeed a reorganisation in 2003 at Ashford A and E, when blue light services were moved to St. Peter&#039;s and, from tomorrow, Ashford emergency department will become a walk-in centre. There will be a substantial increase in day case surgery at Ashford hospital. By separating day case surgery from emergency surgery, much better services will be provided for patients who need elective care because their operations will no longer be cancelled. Blue light services and A and E services will be concentrated at St. Peter&#039;s. Across the country we have seen a major improvement in the performance of A and E departments, helped by the creation and expansion of minor injury units and walk-in centres.

In 1997, 63 per cent. of people with suspected cancer were seen by a specialist within two weeks of urgent referral by their GP. Today the figure is more than 99 per cent. As at September 2005, 94.4 per cent. of patients were treated within one month of being diagnosed and 80.5 per cent. of patients were treated within 62 days of urgent referral by their GP.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o92"><a name="60131-05_spnew8"><b> Mrs. Hodgson: </b> 
 I agree that that is good news, but will my hon. Friend study early-day motion 1518 on the plight of two of my constituents, Mr. Fergus and Mr. Wilson, who are suffering financial and physical hardship due to the unfairness of the current system of withholding licensed cancer drugs pending NICE approval? Will my hon. Friend assure me that the postcode lottery in prescribing that denies them and many others equity will be addressed?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o93"><a name="60131-05_spnew9"><b> Ms Winterton: </b> 
 I shall certainly look at the early-day motion to which my hon. Friend referred. NICE has a clear role in appraising drugs, pulling together all the evidence to consider their cost-effectiveness and whether they will be effective in treatment. On 3 November, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State announced a single technology appraisal process so that NICE can produce guidance on important drugs to a faster timetable. I assure my hon. Friend that we have made it clear to the NHS that it should not refuse to fund specific drugs or treatment simply because they have not yet been appraised by NICE. We shall update that guidance shortly.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o94"><a name="60131-05_spnew10"><b> Susan Kramer  (Richmond Park)</b> 
 (LD): I hope that the Minister is aware that a number of people who turn out to have cancer or severe heart disease have to go privately to get a diagnostic scan; not to jump queues, but because many GPs have set the medical indicators so high that they do not catch early-stage cancer. Is the Minister willing to try to identify the number of people who have to take the private route to get life-saving treatment?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o95"><a name="60131-05_spnew11"><b> Ms Winterton: </b> 
 The hon. Lady is right to say that there is certainly more that we need to do to ensure that GPs can detect cancer in the early stages and we are doing further work to make sure that the situation improves, as well of course as looking into how we can improve the position with regard to scans, for example. There has been considerable investment, but we accept that there is more to do and we are doing it.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o96"><a name="60131-05_spnew12"><b> Mr. Andrew Lansley  (South Cambridgeshire)</b> 
 (Con): The Minister must know that the specialist cancer services at the Barts hospital site in the Barts and the London NHS trust underpin cancer services across the east of London. The independent report on the Barts hospital redevelopment, published today, states:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_o2">&quot;The planned capacity is in line with anticipated future demand and expert assessment of future models of care and provider efficiencies.&quot;</p>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-05_para0">
<a name="stpa_o5">In the light of that, will the Minister say, contrary to the Secretary of State&#039;s assertions on the &quot;Today&quot; programme last week, that the Department of Health has no reservations on the clinical case for the Barts and the London redevelopment?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o97"><a name="60131-05_spnew13"><b> Ms Winterton: </b> 
 We have now received the report from the strategic health authority and Ministers will consider the full findings of the review, but I can assure the hon. Gentleman that we are committed to delivering improvements to NHS services in that part of London and that as soon as Ministers have considered the full findings of the review, we will work quickly with the local NHS to finalise consideration of the business case for the Barts and the Royal London private finance initiative scheme.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o98"><a name="60131-05_spnew14"><b> Mr. Lansley: </b> 
 In responses to my questions, Ministers have told me that there have been 14 meetings since 22 September between the Department and the Barts and the London NHS trust. They must arrive at the point, today, where they make a decision, otherwise there will be rising penalties; &#163;17.5 million a month will be added to the cost of the redevelopment as a result of the delays. We are more than a month beyond when a decision should have been taken. Will the Minister accept that the House will not stand by while Ministers delay a project and make it less affordable and less value for money due to their delays rather than its inherent costs?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o99"><a name="60131-05_spnew15"><b> Ms Winterton: </b> 
 May I just make it absolutely clear that we are now looking at the ninth draft of the final business case? It is essential that we have the right balance of services in north-east and wider London before, quite frankly, we make a commitment that will last for 42 years for cancer and cardiac services. It is right that we look carefully at the reports that we have before us and make a decision with all the evidence that is available to us.
</p>

 (Lab/Co-op): My colleagues in east London completely agree that we should get good value for money and good provision of services in east London. In that respect, the Government are right to look at this issue, but why has the review taken place now at the twelfth hour?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o101"><a name="60131-05_spnew17"><b> Ms Winterton: </b> 
 Obviously, we must be absolutely certain before we commit what are, quite frankly, very large amounts of money to a scheme that it is properly thought out and will deliver the benefits to patients that we wish to see. I am sure that my hon.

<a name="time_0">
<a name="60131-06_time0"><h5>3.32 pm</h5>


<p><a name="st_0"><a name="60131-06_spmin1"><b>The Minister for Europe  (Mr. Douglas Alexander): </b> 
 With permission, Mr. Speaker, I should like to make a statement on the European Union. Earlier today, my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary published a White Paper on prospects for the European Union. Copies are available in the Vote Office. He has asked me to pass on his apologies to the House for the fact that he is not present in the Chamber, as he is attending the conference on Afghanistan this afternoon.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-06_para0">
<a name="stpa_0">In April 2004, the Government decided to publish the first in a series of reports intended to stimulate the closer and deeper involvement of Members of both Houses in EU affairs. Today&#039;s White Paper is the fifth such report. It looks at future challenges and provides a detailed report on our presidency, set against the objectives that we set ourselves in the White Paper, published on 30 June 2005 and relayed in a statement to the House on the same day by my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-06_para1">
<a name="stpa_1">Notwithstanding the EU&#039;s historical achievements, it has faced the pressing challenge in recent years of adapting to an increasingly globalised political and economic environment and of reconnecting as an institution to its citizens. That need was highlighted graphically last spring, when two member states rejected the constitutional treaty and the European Council failed to agree a deal for the next financial perspective&#151;the European budget.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-06_para2">
<a name="stpa_2">So when the United Kingdom took over the reins of the presidency in July, we were faced with three tasks. The first task was to follow through on Europe&#039;s promise to open accession negotiations with Turkey, against a backdrop of growing uncertainty in some parts of the EU about that aspect of future enlargement. The second task was to agree a deal for the coming financial perspective, and the third task was to begin the process of better preparing the EU for the globalised world.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-06_para3">
<a name="stpa_3">First, I turn to enlargement. On 3 October, we opened accession talks with Turkey&#151;that decision was welcomed on, and supported by, both sides of the House. That has the potential to bring huge economic and political benefits to Turkey, Britain and the European Union, not least through the Union&#039;s relationship with the wider Islamic world. At the same time, and in a welcome sign of how far the western Balkans has come in recent years, we opened accession negotiations with Croatia, began stabilisation and association agreement negotiations with Bosnia and Serbia and Montenegro, and granted candidate status to Macedonia.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-06_para4">
<a name="stpa_4">On the budget, we brokered a deal that will shift spending towards the economic development of the newer, poorer member states and also mean that similar sized economies such as France and Italy will finally be making payments roughly on a par with the United Kingdom. The Council also agreed a full, wide-ranging review covering all aspects of EU spending, including the common agricultural policy, to report in 2008&#150;09.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-06_para5">
<a name="stpa_5">Finally, we took practical steps to strengthen economic reform within the European Union. Along with the European Commission, we agreed better ways 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>31 Jan 2006 : Column 168</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>of assessing the effects of proposed regulation on business. We also reached agreement on the capital requirements directive, which will help the European banking sector to remain competitive, and agreed the registration, evaluation and authorisation of chemicals&#151;REACH&#151;regulation. In two other areas directly related to the competitiveness agenda&#151;the services directive and the working time directive&#151;we made some progress during our presidency, and we will work to ensure that that is built on over the coming months.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-06_para6">
<a name="stpa_6">Alongside those practical measures, we also began a broader debate on the future of Europe. The special summit of European leaders here in the United Kingdom at Hampton Court in October has already led to detailed work on areas such as improving European universities, increasing support for research and development and establishing a common European energy policy.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-06_para7">
<a name="stpa_7">The issues of Turkish accession and the European budget and the debate on the future direction of Europe set the context of our Presidency, but so, too, did other international challenges. As the White Paper reflects, development was a key priority for both the EU and the G8. The European Union agreed, for the first time, a common vision and set out common objectives and principles for development work, as well as a comprehensive strategy on Africa. That will be backed up by the more and better development aid agreed by European member states last year, with aid doubled to $80 billion a year by 2010 and commitments on achieving the UN 0.7 per cent. gross national income target by 2015. The international finance facility for immunisation that we launched in September has the potential to prevent 5 million children from dying over the next 10 years. The deal on sugar reform will reduce trade distortion and, at the same time, save European Union consumers between $3.5 billion and $4 billion a year from 2010.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-06_para8">
<a name="stpa_8">Another key area of work was the increasing role of the European Union outside its direct borders. During our presidency, we oversaw the launch of European security and defence policy missions, notably to monitor the Rafah border crossing and the peace agreement in Aceh in Indonesia. The EU worked closely with partners to support Israeli disengagement from Gaza and provided policing and electoral support in Iraq. The E3 continued to lead the ongoing and complex negotiations on Iran&#039;s nuclear ambitions.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-06_para9">
<a name="stpa_9">During our presidency, the EU also engaged in dialogue with Russia, Ukraine, China and India and agreed a comprehensive work programme for economic co-operation with the United States of America. At the UN climate change negotiations in Montreal, against expectations, it was agreed, with European support, to begin UN talks on long-term action to address climate change and launch a process for agreeing targets beyond 2012.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-06_para10">
<a name="stpa_10">We had always planned to ensure that counter-terrorism efforts would be a feature of our presidency. Those efforts inevitably gained far wider currency after the tragic events of 7 July here in London. During our presidency, the EU endorsed a new counter-terrorism strategy, agreed that phone and internet data from 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>31 Jan 2006 : Column 169</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>across Europe will be stored for use in criminal and terrorist investigations and set out an action plan to tackle radicalisation and the recruitment of terrorists.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-06_para11">
<a name="stpa_11">We thus handed over to the Austrians a European Union that was stronger and more confident in the future than the one that we inherited back in July. Just as we inherited an agenda from the Luxembourg presidency, there are a number of areas of work that the Austrians are charged with taking forward. Over the coming year, enlargement will continue to be high on the European agenda. We are confident that Bulgaria and Romania will be ready to join in 2007, but only if they take urgent and vigorous action to address the main areas of concern recently identified by the European Commission. We will continue to provide significant bilateral assistance to help them to achieve that goal.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-06_para12">
<a name="stpa_12">We expect both Turkey and Croatia to be ready to open accession negotiations on some individual chapters early in 2006. During his visit to Turkey and Cyprus last week, my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary reiterated the need for Turkey to ratify and implement the protocol to the Ankara agreement. We are committed, too, to ending the isolation of the Turkish Cypriot community and finding a way in which it can trade with European Union member states. I am sure that all members of the House would agree on the importance of achieving a successful and ambitious outcome to the Doha development round of world trade talks. We want to build on the frankly disappointing outcome of the Hong Kong ministerial meeting in December, and we will continue to do all that we can to enable the round to be concluded this year.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-06_para13">
<a name="stpa_13">That means committing to significantly increased market access for developing countries, particularly in agriculture; substantial reductions in all trade-distorting subsidies, including the elimination of export subsidies, as agreed at Hong Kong; and effective special and differential treatment for developing countries. In the first half of this year, the European Union will take stock of the &quot;period of reflection&quot; agreed by the European Council last June. Among other things, that means evaluating the status of the constitutional treaty. The United Kingdom has always made it very clear that the priority in this period of reflection and, indeed, for the European Union more generally is economic reform and a determined effort to advance work that actually makes a difference to the lives of Europeans.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-06_para14">
<a name="stpa_14">That view was endorsed only this month by the President of the Commission, Jos&#233; Manuel Barroso, who said that we should
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0">&quot;avoid a new division in Europe about institutions. The most important concern now of EU citizens is not institutional problems, but jobs and growth.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-06_para15">
<a name="stpa_15">The focus of the spring European Council will therefore be economic. An important part of that agenda will be the work that the European Union will take forward on the six priority areas agreed at Hampton Court in October: research and development, universities, energy, demographics, security and immigration, and the common foreign and security policy. Finally, the future financial arrangements for the Union, agreed at December&#039;s Council, now have to be agreed with the European Parliament through a new inter-institutional 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>31 Jan 2006 : Column 170</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>agreement on budgetary discipline, which will provide the necessary formal basis for EU spending for the period 2007&#150;13.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-06_para16">
<a name="stpa_16">I have set out for the House the key features of the United Kingdom presidency as well as priority areas of work for the European Union over the coming six months. The fuller details in the White Paper published this morning give some sense of the depth of the business done and that which is left to do. As the White Paper makes clear, the Government are convinced that Britain&#039;s national interest is best served as a strong, active and influential member of the European Union, and I commend it to the House.

 May I begin by sending on behalf of the official Opposition our deep condolences to the families and friends of the two British soldiers who were sadly killed in Iraq, the second one being the 100th British soldier killed there? We send our best wishes to the soldiers who were injured.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-07_para0">
<a name="stpa_17">I thank the Minister for giving me advance sight of the statement, and for informing the House about the Government White Paper. Having read and heard the statement, however, many of us regard it as a non-event, to say the least. It is a curious time and place to make a statement but, nevertheless, it raises a number of interesting questions, not least because more than two thirds of the statement was retrospective and did not look at prospects for the EU in 2006.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-07_para1">
<a name="stpa_18">The coming year may not be as dramatic as the last for the European Union, but we should be in no doubt of its importance for the EU&#039;s future. It will be the time for the   EU to reflect on the constitution&#039;s rejection and the    long-term strategic issues that it faces on competitiveness, security and its own future as an institution in the 21st century. The Minister stated the Government&#039;s position with his usual confidence, but does he remember that when the Foreign Secretary introduced a similar statement last year, he went into detail about the Government&#039;s position on the EU budget? He told the House that the Government were working
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1">&quot;to ensure that future EU budgets are limited to 1 per cent. of Europe&#039;s economic output and that that money is spent where it most adds value.&quot;&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 3 February 2005; Vol. 430, c. 994.]</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-07_para2">
<a name="stpa_19">However, the Government ended up agreeing a rise in the EU budget to 1.045 per cent., which is an increase of &#163;25 billion, but they obtained no guarantee of further common agricultural policy reform. The Foreign Secretary assured the House that Britain&#039;s rebate &quot;remains fully justified&quot; and reminded hon. Members that Britain had a veto. We all know what happened next&#151;the rebate was cut by &#163;7 billion for the budget period. Does the Minister understand that hon. Members are suspicious whether what the Government say will match what the Government actually achieve?
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-07_para3">
<a name="stpa_20">The White Paper rightly underlines the need for economic reform. Does the Minister agree that the services directive is essential in achieving a more competitive Europe? The European Parliament will vote on the directive in a fortnight. Does the Minister agree that the main aim for member states is to reach a political agreement in the Council by the March economic summit? Does he agree that there has already 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>31 Jan 2006 : Column 171</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>been extensive consultation with social partners? It would be unacceptable if further consultation became an excuse for yet more delay. Does he agree that the European Parliament&#039;s internal market and consumer protection committee has produced a balanced text to ensure the freedom to provide services, and that it should be our common goal to maintain it, particularly with regard to article 16?
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-07_para4">
<a name="stpa_21">Turning to trade, many hon. Members on both sides of the House were disturbed to hear Commissioner Mandelson say two or three weeks ago that the Chancellor of the Exchequer had not spoken to him recently&#151;it appears that the Chancellor of the Exchequer has been ignoring him&#151;which is causing much upset on the Government Benches. I understand that the Minister is a prot&#233;g&#233; of both Commissioner Mandelson and the Chancellor of the Exchequer, which means that he is caught between a rock and a hard place. Nevertheless, will he use his good offices to get them talking? It is good to talk, but on such a crucial issue, it is vital.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-07_para5">
<a name="stpa_22">Does the Minister agree that Britain&#039;s opt-out from the working time directive is vital to our competitiveness in a globalised marketplace? Will the Government ensure that our opt-out is maintained in its entirety and that it will not be negotiated away in any form?
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-07_para6">
<a name="stpa_23">Paragraph 143 of the White Paper rightly emphasises the importance of energy security. Does the Minister agree that recent events in Ukraine and Georgia prove the need for secure and diverse supplies? Will the Minister outline in more concrete terms how the Government plan to achieve that?
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-07_para7">
<a name="stpa_24">All hon. Members agree that Europe&#039;s greatest achievement over the past two decades has been the spread of democracy throughout the continent. In March, a presidential election will be held in Europe&#039;s last remaining authoritarian state, Belarus. Why does the White Paper not mention that election? What steps will the Government and our European partners take to ensure that that election is free and fair?
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-07_para8">
<a name="stpa_25">The middle east is a vital area for our security and for the cause of peace in the world, so Hamas&#039;s election victory must be a matter of the deepest concern. Will the Minister tell the House the criteria by which the continued funding of the Palestinian Authority by the EU will be judged? Is it not essential that Europe and America hold a united position in dealing with Hamas? Does he agree that if a Hamas-led Palestinian Authority remains wedded to terror, it should not receive EU funding?
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-07_para9">
<a name="stpa_26">One of the most important questions for the European Union concerns how it can modernise itself to meet the demands of the 21st century. The constitution&#039;s defeat in last year&#039;s referendums proves that the old model of integration is failing Europe and alienating its people. Does the Minister agree that a British vision of an open, flexible Europe has never been more relevant? Is not that the issue for British leadership? Will the Minister explain why no British Minister attended last week&#039;s important sound of Europe conference in Salzburg? How do the Government expect to influence the debate, if they do not participate?

<a name="stpa_29">Britain&#039;s last presidency was marked by the contrast between the hype in the last paper presented to Parliament, and a failure to deliver fully in many areas.

But it is now time for the Government to outline a British vision of Europe that can meet those challenges, rather than merely parroting what the EU requires.

<p><a name="st_2"><a name="60131-07_spnew1"><b> Mr. Alexander: </b> 
 I will endeavour to answer the many questions put to me by the hon. Gentleman, who began his contribution rather uncharitably by describing the White Paper as a non-event. I shall resist making the same observation about his response to my statement and instead address his specific questions.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-07_para13">
<a name="stpa_30">I shall happily send to the hon. Gentleman the detailed figures on the proportion of European gross national income accounted for in the agreement reached at the December European Council, but my recollection is that by the end of the financial period, the percentage of GNI taken in the European Union&#039;s budget will be as low as that achieved in any one of the past 20 years. That is a clear victory for those of us who have argued in recent years for greater EU budgetary discipline. Indeed, comparing the agreement reached at the December European Council with the figures proposed six months earlier by the Luxembourg presidency, or with those previously proposed by the Commission, shows how effectively we argued for taking a lower percentage of European GNI within the EU&#039;s budget.

<a name="stpa_31">The hon. Gentleman asked about the services directive, and we continue to regard it as important. An unfortunate delay on First Reading prohibited us from reaching a conclusion to our discussions during our presidency, but we want progress to be made during the Austrian presidency. It might assist the House if I make clear the issues that we came close to resolving, but which are still on the table: the directive&#039;s scope; whether it should apply to labour law, given that that was never the intention, even according to the original wording of the Bolkestein directive; and the country-of-origin principle. Discussions will continue on each of those issues, but I share the ambition of reaching a conclusion that will result in an effective services directive that can guarantee a much more open market in services. Such a market will directly benefit not just the European Union but, I am convinced, many British companies.

Gentleman asks about the Chancellor from a sedentary position. There is little doubt that the Chancellor has made clear his position concerning an ambitious and balanced outcome for Hong Kong, be it in speeches to the Labour party conference, in recent radio interviews, or in countless speeches made in the cause of achieving greater debt relief, aid assistance and trade justice in the years to come.

<a name="60131-07_para17">
<a name="stpa_34">The hon. Gentleman also asked about energy supplies in the light of developments in Ukraine and Russia. Such developments partly explain why we had what was widely judged to be an effective and helpful meeting with the Russians&#151;an EU-Russia summit&#151;during our presidency; why one feature of that summit was discussing the need for a structured dialogue on energy; and why at Hampton Court, the Prime Minister showed real prescience in identifying the need for a common approach to energy issues, ahead of the difficult negotiations that took place between Russia and Ukraine at the turn of the year. Taking forward that work on energy policy, we are examining ways of making sure that there is a genuinely open market within the European Union. Issues relating to energy security have been on many people&#039;s minds in recent weeks and months, and there is also the pressing matter of diversity of supply. I can assure the hon.

There is little that I can usefully add to the contribution to the debate that has been made by our Foreign Secretary and by others in recent days, since the Palestinian Authority elections. Suffice to say that the policy remains as stated. In relation to specific British aid, I recollect that approximately half of that aid is in direct budgetary support, although that is suspended at present&#151;indeed, it was suspended prior to the elections&#151;because of our concerns about corruption in the Authority. The overwhelming additional resource is provided through the auspices of the United Nations. This is a subject to which I am sure

The conference did not invite all 25 members of the European Union to address the conference. Rather, there was a round-table series of discussions involving academics and members of think tanks. There were contributions from some politicians, and of course British delegates were present at that conference. I can assure the hon.

Since the outset of that process, we have enjoyed and benefited from the support of the United States. I am glad to say that only last night here in London a meeting of the P5 was convened&#151;the five permanent members of the Security Council, with the Germans also in attendance.

<a name="stpa_40">I am grateful to the Minister for giving us advance notice and sight of his statement. There is much in the statement and in the White Paper with which we do not disagree. Some of the achievements of the UK presidency are rightly underlined as important achievements, notably the very significant agreement to launch accession negotiations for Turkey&#039;s eventual membership of the European Union&#151;a decision of enormous long-term significance for the future evolution of the EU.
</p>

<a name="stpa_41">The White Paper and the statement are characterised by the now time-honoured hyperbole that occurs at the end of presidencies. It is a familiar routine that whoever has occupied the presidency for six months then hypes up its achievements, almost suggesting that any presidency that preceded it or might succeed it could never reach such heights of achievement. Hyperbole aside, much in the White Paper recommends itself. I should like to ask the Minister some questions that might help us to understand whether the decisions taken in the six months of the UK presidency will stand the test of time and be durable decisions that make the difference that is claimed.

Will that review be conducted by the European Commission? If so, what pressure, if any, will be brought to bear on member states to adhere to any of its recommendations? There is a legitimate concern that a review by the Commission, even were it to advocate the kind of agricultural reform that many people in this House wish for, could summarily be ignored if it was not placed on a more forceful footing. Will the review include proposals for co-financing, which Members on both sides of the House have raised as a possible future solution to the financing of the common agricultural policy?

It appeared then, and still appears, to have been a catch-all list of policy areas, ranging from foreign policy through to research and development, which might not contain the substance that he implied in his statement.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-08_para4">
<a name="stpa_44">The Minister said that the priority for this period of reflection about the fate of the constitutional treaty, and indeed the European Union more generally, must be on economic reform. That is a sentiment that many Liberal Democrat Members share. But does he think that there is no merit in any debate about the constitutional and institutional future of the European Union? Surely it is impossible to deny that in an enlarged European Union the arrangements that were in place for a much smaller club need some re-examination. Some highly positive reforms are suggested in the constitution, including greater Council openness, rearrangements of the way in which the European Union organises its common foreign and security policy, and the involvement of this House and other national Parliaments in examining EU

<a name="stpa_48">Another point merits the House&#039;s consideration. The notion of the Hampton Court priorities is already entering the lexicon of European policy making. I have been encouraged by the Austrian presidency&#039;s willingness to commit time and resources to taking forward the work that we initiated in Hampton Court. If I were to identify one matter that takes special precedence, it would be the recognition in October of the importance of finding a way forward on energy security and supply and a genuinely more open energy market.

However, it is right to reiterate that we perceive the key priorities for the coming months to be, as Jos&#233; Manuel Barroso said, jobs and growth in the European Union and the economic reform that that requires.

 May I follow on from the point raised by my right   hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, East (Dr. Strang) about Iran? Does the Minister agree that the E3 grouping is crucial in this regard because of the limitations of the United Nations, not in coming to a policy position but in acting on that position and trying to broker a settlement? Does he agree that this is a key role for the European Union, and that the E3 would have no credibility without its role in the European Union? Does he also agree that the European Union needs to promote its role in dealing with such issues? Will he ask the Austrian presidency for some initiatives on this matter?

<p><a name="st_14"><a name="60131-09_spnew4"><b> Mr. Alexander: </b> 
 I will certainly take note of my hon. Friend&#039;s final point. The significance of the E3 process speaks to the effective joint working between ourselves, the French and the Germans. It is no secret that there have been disagreements in the past between ourselves and one if not both of those countries on specific issues of concern in the European Union. Notwithstanding whatever challenges we may have faced bilaterally, however, I am heartened by the effective way in which we have worked directly with Berlin and Paris on this issue.

<a name="60131-09_para2">
<a name="stpa_55">My hon. Friend&#039;s question also raises the broader issue of the effectiveness of the United Nations. We have Kofi Annan, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, here with us in London today.

I had the opportunity to represent the British Government the following week at the United Nations General Assembly and to take part in meetings on behalf of the European Union during the course of that week. It was made very clear to me by the permanent representative of this Government that, had it not been for the significant steps taken by European nations in particular, prior to that summit, we would not have been able to secure the commitments either on development or on United Nations reform that many of us welcomed at the conclusion of the summit.

 To return to the services directive, I urge my right hon. Friend not to listen to the Opposition&#039;s seemingly uncritical view of the directive, but to stick with what he told the House 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>31 Jan 2006 : Column 181</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>some moments ago. If not properly constructed, the directive will cause real concern, not simply to employees but to employers, particularly in terms of the country of origin issue. Were the directive to be passed in its present form, it could seriously jeopardise the ability of many companies in this country to operate without seeing terms and conditions&#151;not simply labour rates but other important contractual terms&#151;set at nought. It is really important that we get this right, and I hope that the Government will stick to their position and get a proper deal.

<p><a name="st_27"><a name="60131-10_spnew3"><b> Mr. Alexander: </b> 
 I think that a balance needs to be struck. On the one hand, there is no doubt that the terms of the original Bolkestein directive did not find favour with many European partners. In that sense, I would fully expect changes to the terms of the original directive. On the other hand, the Government continue to believe as a matter of principle, and on the basis of the evidence available to us, that there is much for the European Union to gain by having an effective services directive. If one considers, for example, the progress made in prosperity and growth as a consequence of the original establishment of the single market, it ill behoves others to criticise the prospect of a genuinely single market in services. It is right, however, to have due consideration for the concerns raised, for example, in relation to labour law, as it was never the intention of those who designed the services directive to change the position fundamentally on labour law. That is why we welcome the ongoing discussions, but we would be keen to see a resolution so that we can secure the very jobs and growth about which Jos&#233; Manuel Barroso spoke only a few weeks ago.

 The Minister talked about enlargement and, clearly, one of the key benefits of enlargement is the strengthening of democracy. With an increasingly belligerent Russian Government behaving in damaging ways towards their near neighbours, will he confirm that small countries such as Moldova, which are not yet engaged in accession negotiations, can retain some hope of eventual EU membership? That hope is a real factor in strengthening democratic institutions in that sort of country.
</p>





<p><a name="st_29"><a name="60131-10_spnew5"><b> Mr. Alexander: </b> 
 I am fully aware of the importance of the prospect of European Union membership in securing the transition towards effective democracy. I had the privilege of travelling to the western Balkans in September during the British presidency, and saw for myself the tangible evidence that the prospect of European Union membership is perhaps the strongest single motor driving those countries out of a history of ethnic cleansing and civil unrest. The prospects for future enlargement of the European Union are best described on the basis of the existing treaties. In that sense, the basis for an application to be received by the European Commission in relation to further candidates in future is a matter of record.

We have already worked closely with the Austrians to ensure that the focus of the spring Council meeting will be on exactly the subject of economic reform.

 May I introduce a dissenting note on Turkey? I am aware that there is consensus between the three Front Benches on Turkish accession, but does it really make sense for us to talk in terms of a state joining the European Union when that state does not recognise an existing member state and prosecutes people for writing books on Turkish or Armenian history?
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-10_para0">
<a name="stpa_59">Is there not a real danger in holding out the hope of Turkish accession? It is very likely to be vetoed through either parliamentary vote or referendum by one of the existing member states in some years&#039; time, and that would create a major long-term crisis in our relations with Turkey. Would it not be better to talk in terms of a special relationship that does not involve full accession?
</p>





<p><a name="st_33"><a name="60131-10_spnew9"><b> Mr. Alexander: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman can always be relied on to ensure that consensus does not break out absolutely in the House. I pay tribute to his long-standing interest in these issues. As for the idea of some kind of privileged partnership, Turkey has had that with the European Union for a number of years. A customs union&#151;the Ankara protocol, which I have mentioned&#151;applies to the original EU Fifteen, and the prospect of EU membership has been held out to Turkey for 42 years.The debate has been well rehearsed, especially the hon. Gentleman&#039;s argument about the non-recognition of an EU member state. Such issues can, of course, be addressed during the accession talks.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-10_para1">
<a name="stpa_60">I find common ground with the hon. Gentleman, however, on the need for fundamental reform in the Turkish economy and, indeed, in Turkish society more generally. Labour Members are convinced that those of us who share an interest in a more democratic and effective Turkey would best serve the interests of that goal by seeing Turkey join the EU, if it adheres to the rigorous thresholds of accessibility that are set out for all candidate countries.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-10_para2">
<a name="stpa_61">I genuinely believe, in relation to, for instance, the case of Orhan Pamuk&#151;who, incidentally, said that he did not wish his trial to be seen as a bar to EU membership for Turkey&#151;that those of us who continue to be concerned about human rights have a great deal to gain from the high level of scrutiny that will take place on civil and human rights issues relating to Turkey,

I understood from them that the matter was raised by the European Parliament rather than the Commission. The suggestion in many British newspapers that there is a devilish plot by the European Commission against the great British pint is simply untrue. There is no recommendation that we should see the end of, for example, the pint of beer or the pint of milk. On the other hand, the Commission is responsible for ensuring that there can be common measures across the EU&#151;[Hon. Members: &quot;Ah!&quot;] Let me answer the question. Those common measures are to guarantee the degree of transparency that is necessary to ensure that suppliers of products are not able to hoodwink consumers. If my hon.

 I think that this was a batsqueak of a statement with very little substance behind it, and a reflection of the vanity of those who govern us at present. Matters of great substance have not been addressed, such as international competitiveness for the British economy and how we can recapture or retain our ability to make judgments on regulations&#151;a point raised by the hon. Member for Vauxhall (Kate Hoey).
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-11_para0">
<a name="stpa_64">I am struck by the sheer emptiness of the Government&#039;s strutting over the past six months. They gave away a huge negotiating hand in terms of the budget. Where is the reform of the common agricultural policy, which is so detrimental to the third world and those who are poor? This was a nothing statement, and an ecological waste of all the paper produced to send more words into the air.
</p>





<p><a name="st_38"><a name="60131-11_spnew1"><b> Mr. Alexander: </b> 
 With the greatest respect, I disagree. On the issue of economic reform, not only was there progress on the better regulation agenda, but we set down a course that will, I believe, yield results. Better regulation, whether in Whitehall or Brussels, involves not just process changes&#151;for example, regulatory impact assessments&#151;but cultural change. I was heartened in particular by the comment of

<a name="stpa_65">On the hon. Gentleman&#039;s point about the common agricultural policy, we continue to argue for fundamental reform. We set out our position in the Government paper that was published in December. We have secured the 2008&#150;09 review, of which I spoke in my statement and which was mentioned in the White Paper.

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3">That leave be given to bring in a Bill to end the trade in endangered animals on the internet; and for connected purposes.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-11_para4">
<a name="stpa_68">The trade of endangered animals on the internet is a    growing and serious problem. Independent commentators estimate that the trade is worth up to &#163;25 billion globally and up to &#163;3 billion involving UK websites and consumers. Those large figures include both live and dead animals and animal products. Today, I would like to disaggregate those figures and focus on the millions of pounds being spent in the sale of live endangered animals on the internet, driving some of those species near to extinction.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-11_para5">
<a name="stpa_69">It may come as a shock to some hon. Members to discover that this morning, in my office at the House of Commons, I logged on to the internet and could have purchased a leopard, a zebra, sea turtles, chimpanzees, an American bald eagle, an alligator, a dromedary, a mountain lion and a Lear&#039;s macaw. Sadly, the list goes on and on. I was very interested to hear from the hon. Member for Thurrock (Andrew Mackinlay) about the elephant in the room at the Foreign Office. That escaped my research, but I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will pass on the details to me.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-11_para6">
<a name="stpa_70">In August 2005, the International Fund for Animal Welfare found that 9,000 endangered live animals were offered for sale online in one week. That search was limited to five categories of animal, but I am sure that the House will be interested to know that animals of all categories are sold every minute of every day, year after year. That same research found that 146 primates were available for sale in the UK. All of the sales were illegal: all the animals were endangered, and all were being traded through UK-registered websites. We do not know where the animals involved in such sales come from, how they are transported, or the conditions in which they are kept.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-11_para7">
<a name="stpa_71">The Government rightly recognise the need to protect the environment, but what about the natural environment? Given the obvious scale of the problem, is not it incumbent on the Government, industry and us all to do far more to tackle this serious problem? The Under-Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, the hon. Member for South Dorset (Jim Knight), is attending the debate, and I know that he is a good-natured man who takes animal welfare very seriously. I hope that he will consider the suggestions that I have to make, especially given that the Animal Welfare Bill is currently before the House.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-11_para8">
<a name="stpa_72">What could the Government do? First, I encourage them to work in collaboration with internet service providers and auction houses to launch a public awareness campaign on this matter. That campaign should be targeted at both consumers and traders and should inform them about what is lawful and what is not. Secondly, I encourage the Government to establish a hotline&#151;for telephones and/or emails&#151;so that illegal activity can be reported to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. That information should then be shared with wildlife crime officers and the police.

<p>
<a name="60131-11_para9">
<a name="stpa_73">Thirdly, a legal help desk should be set up so that people who are not sure about the law can contact someone to obtain clarification. Very often, the terms and conditions of websites involved in this trade are hidden somewhere in the back of beyond in the ISP&#039;s terms and conditions. We need to expose what is lawful and what is not. Finally, as I said earlier, the Government should liaise more closely with crime enforcement agencies.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-11_para10">
<a name="stpa_74">Earlier, I saw the Home Secretary appear briefly in the Chamber before dashing out. I wish that he had stayed, because I know that the Government are keen on targets. I hope that the Minister will speak gentle words of encouragement in the right hon. Gentleman&#039;s ear about the adoption of a new Home Office target to ensure that police forces around the country bring successful prosecutions of those involved in this illegal trade, leading to their conviction. The House will be astounded to hear that only two successful prosecutions were brought last year for trade involving endangered animals. In both cases, the animals were dead and stuffed, but we know that there is a trade in live animals. With the greatest respect, I believe that the fact that there has not been a single prosecution in respect of the trade in live animals is an indictment of the Government.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-11_para11">
<a name="stpa_75">The Government and the Minister could take the lead in this matter, both in this country and in Europe. Under the convention on international trade in endangered species, they could use our EU block vote to lead the way internationally. There is a CITES conference in June next year: I hope that the Minister will go there and declare that the UK is leading the way on animal welfare and that it has forged agreement in Europe about a new way forward on the matter.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-11_para12">
<a name="stpa_76">Possibly the best and most immediate way to deal with the illegal trade in endangered animals is to establish a code of conduct for all ISPs and those involved in the internet market place to ensure that they do not facilitate the sale of endangered animals, directly or indirectly, through their products and services. As a Conservative, I hope that that could be achieved through a voluntary code, not a statutory one. We will have to wait and see whether the ISPs are prepared to go along with that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-11_para13">
<a name="stpa_77">What can ISPs do? We know that web content can be curbed because we have seen the excellent work of the Internet Watch Foundation, which works to prevent access to child pornography. ISPs should work in partnership, perhaps with the Government, to extend their remit to involve animal watch internet work. If they are not prepared, or are unable, to do that, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs needs to work with them to set up a dedicated animal watch foundation to ensure that that evil trade stops.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-11_para14">
<a name="stpa_78">It is no longer good enough for ISPs or the Government to argue that such a task is too great, too complex or the amount of data too overwhelming. We know that when ISPs have a will, they can find a way. For example, they can monitor, block and stop links from sites that promote political thought or messages. We have seen that with Google in China in the past week. If Google and other ISPs can regulate free speech in China, the least they can do is regulate the sale of endangered animals on the internet in the UK.

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-11_para15">
<a name="stpa_79">ISPs should also co-operate with Government and each other in agreeing a code of conduct. They should make it easier to report illegal activity, because current abuse processes are not user friendly, and provide better training for staff. ISPs should not see this Bill as a threat to their business, but as an opportunity to differentiate their products so that discerning and promiscuous&#151;in the marketing sense&#151;consumers can say, &quot;I do not want to give my money to this ISP if it is not animal welfare friendly.&quot; Consumers should make the choice. They should email their ISP and threaten to take their business elsewhere unless this issue is taken seriously. I hope that the Government will take the lead on that. ISPs could gain a competitive advantage by taking this matter seriously.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-11_para16">
<a name="stpa_80">If ISPs do not take action, consumers will, and the courts might. There is a case before the courts at present, but I shall not go into detail. However, we know that the courts may take action if the Government do not. This is a serious and growing problem and I hope that the Government will take it more seriously.

 This promises to be yet another interesting and wide-ranging debate on an important issue. In moving the motions in the name of my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary let me make it clear to the House that the Government support Lords amendments Nos. 1 and 3, but not Lords amendments Nos. 2 and 4.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-12_para5">
<a name="stpa_87">The Bill was last debated in the House on 11 July 2005, on Report and Third Reading. A number of hon. Members expressed concerns, not so much about the Government&#039;s policy aims, but about what they feared would be unintended consequences in relation to the freedom of expression. The Bill passed with a substantial majority, but further debate and Divisions in the other place resulted in substantial changes being made.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-12_para6">
<a name="stpa_88">The Lords amendments make four significant alterations. They separate the religious hatred offences from the racial hatred offences. They remove what was known as the &quot;likely limb&quot;, so that only intentional behaviour will be caught. They insert a wide-ranging freedom of expression provision and remove the words &quot;abusive and insulting&quot; from the offence, so that only threatening speech and behaviour will be caught. Those 

<br>&nbsp;<br>

<p><a name="st_61"><a name="60131-12_spnew4"><b> Paul Goggins: </b> 
 It is important that we adopt a measured and constructive tone in the debate. That is certainly what I intend to do and I hope that the right hon. Gentleman and hon. Members on both sides of the House will realise by the end of my introductory remarks that the Government are firmly committed to the freedom of expression and that we will fulfil the promise that we made in earlier debates that, if it was possible to find words that would include a commitment to freedom of expression in the Bill, we would do so, and I will come to that in a few moments.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-12_para7">
<a name="stpa_89">Although the Government were clearly disappointed that their lordships decided to take such an approach, one thing at least is now clear: there is now a consensus that an offence of incitement to religious hatred should be placed on the statute book. The Government have listened, as we said we would, to the widely and deeply held concerns that have been expressed. I fully accept that those views are sincerely and very strongly held both by hon. Members and people outside the House.

<a name="stpa_90">In the search for common ground, we have given careful thought to the way that the Bill is framed and taken into consideration a wide range of opinion.

 The hon. Lady asks a serious question about a serious subject and my answer to her is absolutely not. That would not be covered by the offence.

 This is an important issue because there was a recent case involving a minister of religion.

A police officer said to him, &quot;You must stop reading this because it has been objected to,&quot; and told the people standing round that they had to move on.

<b>31 Jan 2006 : Column 192</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>would now like to go through the four areas that are fundamental to my argument. I will of course take interventions at appropriate moments, but if I do not start to make those points now, I will not have even started my speech before the interventions end.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-13_para1">
<a name="stpa_93">First, I make it clear to the House that we now accept that the religious hatred offences should be separate from the existing racial offences in line with the framework agreed in the other place. The amendments mean that the offences will now form a new part 3A of the Public Order Act 1986, rather than being simply an extension of the racial offences in part 3 of the Act to cover religious hatred. The Government have had to think long and hard about that because we always argued for parity between the racial and religious offences. However, we have come to the view that as long as we can achieve a viable offence of incitement to religious hatred within that format, we should agree to the new framework.
</p>





<p><a name="st_74"><a name="60131-13_spnew8"><b> Mr. Alistair Carmichael  (Orkney and Shetland) (LD):</b> 
 Does the Minister accept that separation is meaningful only if there is a difference? As I read the proposals, there is no difference. What does he see as the difference?
</p>





<p><a name="st_75"><a name="60131-13_spnew9"><b> Paul Goggins: </b> 
 There are differences because incitement to racial hatred will still have a likely limb, whereas incitement to religious hatred will have a recklessness limb. This is a serious business. As the Minister in charge of the Bill, I have considered it my responsibility to engage in constructive discussions to determine whether we can achieve the objective of attaining a measure that was a commitment in the Labour party&#039;s manifesto at the last election in a way that will calm people&#039;s fears and represent a practical way forward. There are differences, but we will achieve our objective of introducing a Bill that tackles incitement to religious hatred and which means something in practice.

<p><a name="st_76"><a name="60131-13_spnew10"><b> Mr. Dominic Grieve  (Beaconsfield) (Con):</b> 
 I accept that genuine efforts have been made to try to reach consensus, although they have plainly failed. The Minister has decided to stop trying to find absolute parity with racial hatred provisions. In the circumstances, that is a major concession, because the Government placed a huge emphasis on that parity and, indeed, sold it to a large number of communities as such. Having made that concession, why do they not accept the logic of the Lords amendments that the offence of incitement to religious hatred should have a much narrower focus? The amendments that the Government are seeking to overturn would largely turn the Bill back into its original form.
</p>





<p><a name="st_77"><a name="60131-13_spnew11"><b> Paul Goggins: </b> 
 What I said was that we were not seeking absolute parity, because I wanted to make a point about complete intransigence and the failure to engage in dialogue people who hold a different view. There is not absolute parity, but we do not want the offences to be so far apart that the difference between the two is very great indeed, because we would not achieve our objective.

<p><a name="st_88"><a name="60131-14_spnew1"><b> Paul Goggins: </b> 
 I am grateful to my hon. Friend for raising that point and shall provide him with an example that I used earlier today and on other occasions. The example involves a poster that depicts women, some of whom are white British and some of whom are not, wearing the burqa and that includes quotes from the Koran. The poster states that such women cannot be trusted, because they are recruited in various parts of the world as suicide bombers, and asks what they are hiding under their ugly clothes. That could be the kind of material that would be relevant under the Bill.

<a name="stpa_97">It is difficult to provide precise examples, which may or may not be relevant. We are seeking to close a loophole in the law.

</p>





<p><a name="st_91"><a name="60131-14_spnew4"><b> Mr. Grieve: </b> 
 On the Minister&#039;s example, is it not the case that such a poster would be caught by the existing provisions of the Public Order Act 1986? He need only read the case of Norwood to see that the existing provisions of the 1986 Act would catch such behaviour. Does that not highlight the lack of need for the provision? If the provision is to mean anything, it must go much further than the Minister&#039;s illustration, and I must say that it has that capacity.
</p>





<p><a name="st_92"><a name="60131-14_spnew5"><b> Paul Goggins: </b> 
 I provided that example because the poster incites hatred rather than a criminal act. The offence is not racial, because the poster depicts white British people in addition to Asian people. It is not covered by existing provisions on religiously aggravated offences and it does not involve damage. The hon. Gentleman is correct to say that the Public Order Act 1986 might cover the matter, but only if someone were distressed or harassed by seeing the poster. Even so, the maximum penalty for such an offence is only up to six months in prison, while the penalty under the Bill is more severe, which is appropriate. He must acknowledge that there are many circumstances in which the Public Order Act 1986 would not be sufficient.

<a name="stpa_98">The second effect of the amendments agreed by their Lordships is the removal of what was known as the &quot;likely limb&quot;, leaving only intent as the threshold for prosecutions under the offence. It remains our clear view that intent by itself is not enough, but rather than seeking to reinstate the likely limb, we have decided to introduce an additional test of subjective recklessness, so for a prosecution to succeed, it would be necessary to prove either that someone intended to stir up hatred, or that they were aware that their actions or words would stir up religious hatred, yet they continued. No one could be caught out inadvertently, as some have feared.

 It will come as no surprise to the Minister to learn that if the choice is between a subjective recklessness test and the &quot;likely limb&quot;, I prefer the former, because the latter is even worse than the former. But as he knows from our discussions, such a test would be appropriate only where the offence is confined to threatening behaviour; even then, that in itself would be a contentious matter. Once the Government reintroduce the notion that the offence can be committed through abusive or insulting language or behaviour, any form of      recklessness&#151;whether subjective or objective&#151;becomes completely inappropriate.

 My hon. Friend brings us back to the very important issue of the Attorney-General&#039;s role. Of course, if there is a complaint the police must investigate it, and if there is evidence, they share it with the Crown Prosecution Service. It is at that stage that the Attorney-General has personally to sanction any prosecution. That is a further hurdle in respect of this offence that ought to give people additional confidence.

 The question of recklessness is, in truth, the most important part of this debate. It is also one reason why our discussion of proposed new section 29K and the &quot;unless&quot; clause was interrupted so often. The &quot;unless&quot; clause introduces the question of recklessness and with great respect to the Minister, recklessness is not knowing that one&#039;s actions would stir up religious hatred; it is knowing that one&#039;s actions are likely to stir up religious hatred. There is a considerable difference between the two, and on that basis I bring the Minister back to an earlier, helpful intervention. The example was given of the following statement: &quot;Mohammed&#039;s marriage to a six-year-old was immoral, and a call for the right to marry children is to be condemned as immoral.&quot; How could such a statement not be caught by the recklessness test, given that the person saying it must perceive that their comments are at least likely to stir up religious hatred?

 I make the point to my hon. and learned Friend that the precise context in which those words are uttered is the key determinant of whether or not an offence would be committed.

We will have to rely on the judgment of the court and the common sense of the jury in listening to the evidence and reaching a conclusion.

Race is immutable in its characteristics. Religion, however, is a matter of belief in exactly the same way as politics and political views.

Would we not have secured a much more straightforward position by abolishing the blasphemy law, and avoided many of the difficult issues that we are discussing now?

 The law of blasphemy is entirely obsolete. I voted for its removal when the opportunity presented itself to the House.

 I think that the problem with the Bill is that it will give a weapon to every malevolent who wishes to browbeat other groups that might criticise him. Many people would disagree with the remarks made by Sir Iqbal Sacranie, but they were clearly honestly made and part of his belief. His fate in the past few weeks&#151;the fact that he was left in a position of uncertainty for several days while police investigated his remarks&#151;is, I am afraid, something of which we shall see a great deal when the Bill is on the statute book. The Bill will be a weapon in the hands of every extremist group, whether religious or secular, with which to browbeat its opponents. I must tell the Minister that I do not believe that any amount of guidance will cure that problem.

<p><a name="st_171"><a name="60131-18_spnew6"><b> Mr. Leigh </b> 
: One of the reasons why Iqbal Sacranie is so much in favour of the Bill is, no doubt, the letter that the Home Secretary sent to mosques at the time of the general election.

 My hon. Friend is right. I fear that many were misled about the impact of the Bill. I have received no representations from the Bill&#039;s supporters asking us to adopt a particular position. As the debate has progressed, an increasing awareness may have crept in that the Bill does not deliver what people expected, even those who supported it, and that, on top of that, as Sir Iqbal Sacranie has found in recent weeks, it has unintended consequences that may be rather unpleasant for those who hold religious beliefs.

 One of the problems that I have discovered during my time in the House is that the moment one orthodoxy disappears, a new orthodoxy starts to rear its head. I have no doubt from incidents that I have seen in my own constituency, that I have heard about and that I have been written to about, that there is a danger of a new orthodoxy creeping in that prevents people from freely expressing their beliefs because the public good in some way requires it. Just as 150 years ago it was impossible to express one&#039;s beliefs on certain matters&#151;certainly before the Catholic emancipation&#151;so we are suddenly moving, after what may turn out, if we are not careful, to be a very brief window of true freedom, into a new orthodoxy.

 I suspect that Sir Iqbal was trying to be helpful in view of the fact that some people were calling for the death of Salman Rushdie, but it highlights the need for the House to send the clearest possible message that freedom of speech must be tolerated, that everyone in this country must accept that they may be insulted about their own beliefs, and that that is something we must put up with. The criminal law should prevent people from carrying out and inciting criminal acts, but it should not start to fetter the way in which people express their beliefs. That is the view that I take.

 Many people are worried, and the Bill&#039;s opaque nature is one of the things that worry them most. I will come on to that in a moment, but the fact that the Minister has to say that he will issue guidance highlights the fact that this is catch-all legislation. He is saying, &quot;You need not worry too much about that because the Attorney-General and the prosecutors will ensure that only those cases that need prosecuting are prosecuted.&quot; However, that leads to a terrible chilling factor among those who wish to express their opinions, whether it be comedians who do not know the limit to which they can go, or those who wish to preach their own beliefs and at the same time, inevitably, to criticise the beliefs of others. They do not know at what point their actions can translate into the reckless insult of another, at which point they will be prosecuted and condemned. That is the nub of the matter.

 I have no doubt that there will be absurd consequences.

It will cause exactly the same damage but they will be able to say, &quot;I am completely in the clear.&quot; Therefore, the mischief cuts in every direction. Far from bringing about the quietening of discourse, which is what I think the Minister intends, that will be exploited in every possible way.

A comedian is unlikely to attack a religion by pure reference to religious practices or beliefs: he is going to attack it by reference to the people who believe or follow those practices. All jokes and drama have to characterise a situation in human form.

To those who believe that the Government&#039;s proposals will constitute a safeguard in that respect, I say simply that they really are not worth the paper that they are written on.

 The hon. Gentleman is right. I hope that I made it clear earlier that this is not just about protecting people with religious beliefs but people with all beliefs. They are entitled to their say. Those of us who have beliefs&#151;like the hon. Member for Ogmore (Huw Irranca-Davies), I am a Christian and a practising member of the Church of England&#151;just have to lump it when people say things that we find offensive. We have grown used to doing so in the period of greater tolerance that developed in the last century, and it worries me that the Government are asking us to take a step backwards on the issue, instead of saying, &quot;Those are our values, and people who live in this country have jolly well got to subscribe to them.&quot; Without that, we will move towards the dominance of whichever group makes the loudest noise, is the most insistent and threatens other people&#151;in subtle ways&#151;the most.

<a name="stpa_126">My next issue is what constitutes &quot;abusive and insulting&quot;. We have touched on the issue already, so I may not need to say too much about it. The fact is that abusive and insulting words and behaviour are different from threatening words and behaviour. If the word &quot;insulting&quot; is put back in the Bill, even remarks that to an ordinary person might appear innocuous but are deeply wounding to a person with a particular religion or belief would be caught. A person could engage in a moderate discourse that nevertheless caused great insult&#151;the examples given earlier included calling into question the divinity of Christ or calling into question whether the Prophet Mohammed&#039;s revelations were divinely inspired. Another example is the play &quot;Beshti&quot;, 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>31 Jan 2006 : Column 213</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>which was profoundly insulting to Sikhs. It was insulting in its concepts and its implications about the behaviour of priests and elders in gurdwaras, and it is that sort of play that would, logically, be caught by this legislation, even if the Minister thinks that any guidelines that might be enacted would provide protection. &quot;Beshti&quot; is a classic example and that is why the House should not allow the words &quot;abusive and insulting&quot; back into the Bill. By keeping the word &quot;threatening&quot;, we latch on to the very things that were identified by the Minister, such as the Norwood case and the poster with the twin towers that said &quot;Muslims out of Britain&quot;. That is threatening. The examples that the Minister gave of people attacking women wearing the hijab or calling for people to be thrown out are threatening and would not require the words &quot;abusive and insulting&quot; to be added.

 The hon. Gentleman suggests that &quot;Beshti&quot; is a classic example of the sort of play that would be caught under the legislation. However, the existing law against incitement to racial hatred applies to the Sikh faith, so why were the producers of the play not prosecuted? Does not that provide the reassurance that future plays about the Islamic faith would also not be caught under the Bill?

<p><a name="st_204"><a name="60131-20_spnew3"><b> Mr. Grieve: </b> 
 I disagree with the hon. Gentleman&#039;s analysis. The racial hatred laws do not exist to protect the beliefs, but to protect the racial and ethnic identity of the believer. Hypothetically, &quot;Beshti&quot; could have come under the existing racial hatred laws, but in practical terms it would never have done so. Once we introduce religion into the matter, it is entirely possible that it would do so.

It is&#151;and I can put it no other way&#151;a growing fad. Therefore, it is all the more desirable that the House should restate clearly that that is not the way that we believe society should be conducted. If we made special concessions to various groups, it would not facilitate the exchange of ideas that underpins a multi-faith and multicultural society, but would reinforce difference and create the ghettos of the mind that are so inimical to our making sensible progress.

The Government had a &quot;likely limb&quot; that went much too far, and they have made a concession by withdrawing it. However, while there might be some shred of justification in putting in a test of subjective recklessness if the Bill were confined to threatening behaviour, it would be utterly pernicious if the Government managed to add &quot;insulting and abusive&quot; behaviour. There is no way in which a person who seeks to criticise a faith can be sure that in the process he will not be held to have been reckless as to whether he was invoking hatred for the adherents of that faith. That is one of the fundamental flaws of the Bill and the only way to cure it is to take out recklessness. That leaves an offence of specific intent, which will be amply sufficient in most cases, and I hope that the Government and Members will see clearly that if the offence can be caused by recklessness the climate of uncertainty that will be created will be extremely damaging.

 Before the hon. Gentleman leaves the question of recklessness, will he consider this point? Recklessness is in truth the curse of this legislation and if it were removed most Members would be able to accept the measure. The problem is not that the legislation is unclear, but that it is too blisteringly clear, in that the examples that have been given recently&#151;the cartoons of the Prophet&#151;would undoubtedly be caught under the recklessness provisions. It could not possibly be argued that those who produced them were not reckless as to the fact that some people were likely to have religious hatred stirred within them. Does not that underline the fact that whereas we have always inhibited our freedom of speech to deal with race and racial matters, for 300 years we have turned our face against protecting faith by legislation because we cannot protect faith without protecting bigotry?

<a name="stpa_140">The question of recklessness lies at the heart of our debate today. In our submission, it represents a significant lowering of the threshold of what constitutes an offence under the Bill. Of course, recklessness is a well-known legal concept, but it is normally applied to crimes against property or the person, and it is normally quite easy to establish and apply without difficultly because there is usually an element of physical damage or injury. Expanding that concept to a speech offence, such as the one that we are debating, is dangerous in the extreme. To my mind, that gives rise to a number of      questions about the proportionality of the Government&#039;s proposals.

Those Labour Members who engaged in that debate and had that concern should carefully consider whether it is appropriate to extend the application of recklessness to an offence whose importance must come somewhere further down the hierarchy. If the Government have their way, a citizen can fall foul of the law by being reckless about the consequence of using insulting language, and that is going too far for the Liberal Democrats.

On other occasions, my hon. Friend the Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon (Dr. Harris) has used the example of the producer of a play who is warned by the police that if he proceeds in putting on the production, it is likely that he will incite racial hatred because the language or behaviour used will be insulting or abusive.

The law is being criticised in England because of its &#039;chilling&#039; effect on religious debate and because it will inevitably lead to &#039;self censorship&#039; and caution.

Much as I respect him and have no doubt that he is a man who honours his word, I do not find that reassuring in any way. He offered the House his personal assurance. That is worth something, but I remind him that there is a reshuffle coming. If he were to be moved as part of that reshuffle, his successor need not feel bound by his personal, rather than official, assurance. In any event, Ministers who hold his post in the future might well feel differently about the matter due to different circumstances and a different climate.

At the same time, we know that the Bill will have a chilling effect on people&#039;s ability to criticise religions, not least because of the recklessness provisions.

 There is perhaps some merit in the hon. Gentleman&#039;s suggestion, although I would hesitate to use the term &quot;electoral bribe&quot; because I fear that it might be unparliamentary.

She said that a group in her constituency had been accused of using sex to recruit members and that someone had attacked it on that basis. She told me that the group would have been protected by the Bill. However, surely one should be allowed to attack groups&#151;they are often such things as cults&#151;that use sex to recruit members.

<p><a name="st_243"><a name="60131-23_spnew4"><b> Mr. Winnick: </b> 
 I will certainly be brief. On Report on 11 July 2005, I said that I supported what the Government intended to do, but had certain reservations. To some extent, my reservations were being echoed by Rowan Atkinson and others who were saying that if the Bill were passed, it would be difficult to criticise religion. I believe that the Government should take that matter very seriously. I have no religion myself&#151;I am virtually a lifelong non-believer&#151;but it goes without saying that I believe in people&#039;s right to practise, or not to practise, a religion. I certainly take the view that religion should be the subject of criticism. That applies to any religion, although it is mainly the Christian religion that is the subject of satire. There is no reason, as I said on 11 July, why Islam, or the Jewish, Hindu or Sikh religions should not face the same ridicule and criticism that the Christian religion has faced over the past 25 years or so. I am pleased with the Government&#039;s supplementary provisions&#151;I know that they will not satisfy the critics because, frankly, nothing will, given that they are largely opposed to the measure&#151;which make it perfectly clear that someone is not guilty of an offence unless they are

<a name="stpa_153">To a large extent, the Government have tried to meet the criticism of those of us who were concerned that Rowan Atkinson had a valid point.

</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-23_para3">
<a name="stpa_154">In our debate, as on previous occasions, the Government have repeatedly been asked to give examples. My hon. Friend the Member for Cannock Chase (Dr. Wright), for instance, wanted them to give examples of offences that are not covered by existing law and the Minister tried to explain the position.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-23_para4">
<a name="stpa_155">To return to the core issue, why are the Government introducing the legislation? The cynical, simplistic view, certainly of the Opposition, is that it is a tactic to attract Muslim votes. That may be a crude way of putting it, but I do not believe that is the case. Neither do I believe that Muslims will vote Labour simply because of the measure. There is no evidence in the past 40 years that people of Jewish origin or people who practise the Jewish religion said that they would vote Labour because of legislation on incitement to race hatred. Indeed, if we look at the Jewish vote, we can see that it turned to Labour when the lower-middle class and the middle class proper started to vote Labour in 1997. I simply do not believe that the Muslim population will say, &quot;Ah, the Government have passed a measure on the religious hatred. That&#039;s a good reason to vote Labour.&quot;
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-23_para5">
<a name="stpa_156">The Government are genuinely concerned, as has been pointed out by my hon. Friends today and on previous occasions, about people who are being victimised, spat on, looked on with contempt and spoken of in a certain way simply because they belong to the Muslim faith. That is the reason why they have acted, just as, more than 40 years ago, previous Labour Governments&#151;not Conservative Governments&#151;introduced the measures to which I referred and which were the subject of intense criticism and

If political correctness means in effect that people are protected in law against religious or racial abuse and so on, I am very much in favour of it. Whatever it has brought about&#151;there are some distortions and exaggerations&#151;it is better than the situation that existed before those laws were passed.

<p><a name="st_244"><a name="60131-23_spnew5"><b> Mr. Jim McGovern  (Dundee, West) (Lab):</b> 
 On examples, in a previous debate in the House on the subject, my hon. Friend the Member for Tooting (Mr.   Khan) gave the example of the British National party, which advised its members to put posters in their windows. It knew that it could not get away with saying, &quot;Jews out&quot; or &quot;Sikhs out&quot;, but it knew that it could say, &quot;Muslims out&quot;. That is a good example. If the BNP is exploiting such a loophole, Members on both sides of the House should take every opportunity to close it.

<p><a name="st_245"><a name="60131-23_spnew6"><b> Mr. Winnick: </b> 
 I fully endorse that. Some Opposition Members&#151;I except Opposition spokesmen, who do not deny that there is a problem but believe that it can be resolved by existing laws, so clearly we disagree&#151;simply do not accept what my hon. Friend said. They do not accept that Muslims are demonised and subject to unacceptable abuse.
</p>





<p><a name="st_246"><a name="60131-23_spnew7"><b> Dr. Evan Harris: </b> 
 People who aspire to the hon. Gentleman&#039;s track record on anti-racism oppose the measure because they recognise that religion and race are different. The hon. Member for Dundee, West (Mr. McGovern) is wrong because, the Norwood case, which has already been cited, shows that such acts are public order offences under section 5 of the Public Order Act 1986. Someone who put up a poster saying, &quot;Muslims out of Britain&quot;, with a picture of the twin towers, was prosecuted under that legislation. Sub judice rules do not apply when we are making law, so I can say that Nick Griffin has been prosecuted for his disguised racism using religious words, which is evidence that the existing law bites. I urge the hon. Member for Walsall, North (Mr. Winnick) to reconsider his criticism in this area.
</p>





<p><a name="st_247"><a name="60131-23_spnew8"><b> Mr. Winnick: </b> 
 I do not question, any more than he does mine, the hon. Gentleman&#039;s total commitment to anti-racism. That goes without saying, but the Government disagree with him, as I do, because there are certain forms of abuse and so on that are not covered by existing law. The argument that there is a difference between race and religion is true to some extent. Someone cannot change their race. I have previously given the example of Disraeli, who may have been a Christian many times over but in many people&#039;s eyes remained a Jew because he was born a Jew. However, we should accept that, although we can change our religion, for many people, especially among ethnic minorities, religion is something that they hold dear. We cannot simply say that someone can choose their religion, as we must recognise that the religion they follow is fundamental to their personality and their way of life.

The absence of purposeful passion&#151;the ugly nihilism that leads men to murder carelessly or to abuse without conscience&#151;is not merely the absence of goodness but its antithesis.

All Muslim organisations in this country, other than the Muslim Council of Britain, recognise that this legislation is deeply flawed, and almost all Muslims in this country understand that they will be as much the victims of it as anybody else. There will be a rash of mischievous and extremist accusations, attempted prosecutions and reports to the police. We will have a level playing field, but it will be one of misery.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-24_para13">
<a name="stpa_174">This legislation does not protect Muslims, who will be as vulnerable as anybody else. It is deeply confused and wholly unnecessary in this form, and I fear that it will be very counter-productive.

 This is one of those Bills whose face is liberalism, but whose heart is oppression. The society in which we now live is unrecognisable from the freedom that we knew only a few years ago. We are not in danger of being shanghaied off to the Lubyanka, but we are in danger of the police knocking on the door or ringing us up and starting an investigation against us not on the basis of what we have allegedly done, or of threats that we have allegedly uttered, but merely on the basis of a view that we have expressed.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-24_para14">
<a name="stpa_175">There have been some ludicrous examples and some dangerous examples. I do not often stand up for the Prime Minister and I shall not make a habit of it, but perhaps the most ludicrous occurred when the Prime Minister made a rather disobliging comment about the Welsh to his own television set. It was deemed to be worthy of investigation by the North Wales constabulary. You could not make it up, Madam Deputy Speaker, but it actually happened. Then, there was the much more serious example involving Lynette Burrowes, who is a respected children&#039;s writer. She expressed the view that she had reservations about the adoption of children by same-sex couples. That same view was freely expressed by Members in this House, and without any danger of police proceedings, when we debated the law in question. <i>[Interruption.]</i> My colleagues are right to say that we are okay&#151;that we are protected. However, Lynette Burrowes had the police on the phone to her.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-24_para15">
<a name="stpa_176">There is an even worse example. A couple living in Lancashire asked their local council if they could display Christian literature&#151;they did not say anything in public&#151;alongside material from the council promoting civil partnerships. If the council had simply said no, that would have been one thing. Did it? No, it called in the police. The couple were interviewed in their own home by the police for an hour and 20 minutes. That should frighten any Member who is seriously concerned for the liberties of this nation. There is the further example, often quoted tonight, of Sir Iqbal Sacranie. He did nothing more than elucidate Muslim teaching, yet he was immediately investigated by the police because somebody made a complaint.

<a name="stpa_177">All those examples have one thing in common. Someone somewhere decided to take offence at what had been said. That person made a complaint to the police, who believe&#151;erroneously, in my view&#151;that it is sufficient for a complaint to be made for it to have to be investigated. If they apply this Bill&#039;s provisions in that way, there will be an immensely oppressive impact not only on Christians and Muslims, but on anybody who says anything that somebody else decides is worthy of police investigation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-24_para17">
<a name="stpa_178">I would go along with such a provision if we narrowed it to intent, because nobody is going to say that one should &quot;intend&quot; to stir up religious hatred. But this is not about intent; it is about subjective judgments such as abuse and insults. As I have said before, the right hon. Member for North Antrim (Rev. Ian Paisley) should be allowed to say, if he wants to&#151;he has mellowed a bit recently, so he might not want to&#151;that I have signed up with the Antichrist. He should be allowed to say, if he wants to, that when I go into a church in which there are statues, I am practising idolatry. He should be allowed to say, if he wants to, that when I take part in the sacrifice of the mass, I am committing blasphemy. He can say all those things, and yes, I will find them insulting, but I am 58 and I have often been insulted in my life. I have no doubt whatever that I will be insulted again, but I shall not think that the remedy for feeling insulted is to go off whingeing to a policeman.

 As my hon. Friend the Minister knows, I have genuinely worked hard in trying to support the Bill, even up until yesterday evening.

<a name="stpa_181">A central issue that I and others have wrestled with has run through the entire debate surrounding the Bill from the very outset: is it possible to give additional protection to believers for the reasons that have been adduced, while at the same time avoiding giving unwarranted protection to beliefs?

<a name="stpa_182">I started off by thinking that it would be almost impossible to do that. I wanted the ability to say that I hate religious bigots. I do hate religious bigots. Hatred means intense loathing. I have intense loathing of religious bigots. In fact, I want to go around urging other people to hate religious bigots. The world would be a better place if we all hated religious bigots, and I am instinctively anxious about a piece of legislation that makes it in some respects harder, and in other respects illegal, to go around saying that I hate religious bigots.

<a name="stpa_183">However, I was prepared to examine the case to see whether we could achieve a balance. When I asked the Minister about these things before, he assured me, and he has done his best to redeem the pledge, that he would try to find the correct balance and to insert a savings clause in the Bill guaranteeing the free speech that we were worried about. In the immensely difficult task of squaring the circle, he was helped hugely by what the other place has done.

I regret the fact that the Government have not felt it possible to accept what the other place has done. They have put into the Bill a savings clause, but they have done that in a way that cuts it away again. That is the difficulty.

Whichever view people take on what we are doing, we are crossing a boundary tonight as we move from believers to beliefs. I do not feel comfortable crossing that boundary. I do not feel comfortable giving protections to belief systems, which is essentially what we are doing. In doing that, we are cutting against what we think is the tradition of an open society.

<a name="stpa_187">It is independence of mind that is under assault in the Bill before the House this evening. If the Government get their way and their amendments are carried, we will see not only a significant curtailment of freedom of speech in this country, but perhaps the most significant undermining of religious liberty since 1688. I mention the 17th century advisedly, because that was the last time in this country when questions of political and 

<br>&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>religious strife put lives at risk on the mainland of the United Kingdom. During that period of the 17th century, one of our greatest writers, Milton, even at that time of strife, made a heartfelt plea for liberty in his work, &quot;Areopagitica&quot;. Milton pointed out that truth did not need the law to suppress falsehood in order to prevail. In open debate, those who are confident of their beliefs will not want the state to intervene on their side, because the confidence in their beliefs will be enough to sustain them.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-25_para8">
<a name="stpa_188">It is significant that almost all the religious groups in this country which are organised and respectable are opposed to the Bill. They have sufficient confidence in the strength of their own beliefs not to pray the state in aid. It is striking that there are only one or two significant exceptions to that rule. One of them has been the Muslim Council of Britain. Its head, Sir Iqbal Sacranie, has throughout his career been a doughty fighter against prejudice against those whom he represents.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-25_para9">
<a name="stpa_189">I would happily acknowledge that there is much that can be done by Government and by all politicians to fight prejudice and racism against Muslims and other minorities, but I suspect that in the past few weeks Sir Iqbal and others have begun to realise how dangerous it is to criminalise free speech in this country. As my right hon. Friend the Member for Maidstone and The Weald pointed out, Sir Iqbal himself was on the receiving end of the attentions of the police for words that he uttered on Radio 4&#151;words that I find offensive, but which I believe that he has every right to utter on whatever platform is given to him. Because of that intervention in Sir Iqbal&#039;s right to speak freely, we can all see the dangers of criminalising speech.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-25_para10">
<a name="stpa_190">Sir Iqbal was referred to earlier by the hon. Member for Pendle (Mr. Prentice) in the context of the debate about &quot;The Satanic Verses&quot;. It is appropriate that we consider for a moment the controversy that surrounded the publication of Salman Rushdie&#039;s novel. If we imagine that the law that the Government intend to pass today were in place then, I submit that &quot;The Satanic Verses&quot; would never have been published by Penguin.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-25_para11">
<a name="stpa_191">Let us look at proposed new section 29K and the references to abusive and insulting behaviour and to recklessness, and ask ourselves this question: if we had been executives at Penguin and had read that text and calculated the effect that it was likely to have on the Muslim community in this Britain, would we have calculated that it would abuse the Muslim faith? We would certainly have made that calculation. Would we have known that individual Muslims would be insulted? Of course we would have recognised that. Would we have known that, by publishing, we could have been accused of recklessness? We would have been aware that that accusation would be flung at us.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-25_para12">
<a name="stpa_192">Would we therefore have taken the risk of publishing? I suspect that we would not, and that, to me, would have been not just a loss for freedom of speech, but an attack on the creative spirit and a loss of what makes us a distinctive and cherishably free country. That chill factor, which would have applied to &quot;The Satanic Verses&quot; if the legislation had been in place, has been mentioned by several hon. Members. It is a worrying curtailment of liberty and an ominous extension of state power.

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-25_para13">
<a name="stpa_193">There are two other areas that I shall cite briefly where the state extends its power in an ominous way in the Bill. First, there is an unwarranted and ominous extension of Executive power in the reliance that the Minister places on guidance to the prosecuting authorities and to the police. As nearly every hon. Member who has referred to the guidance has pointed out, we all have complete faith in the Minister to frame guidance that would be sensible and proportionate, but whatever our beliefs about the immortality of the Minister&#039;s soul, we know that he will not be permanently in office. We cannot trust future Ministers and future Governments necessarily to frame guidance that will be proportionate and correct. It is quite wrong for us to trust the Executive to decide what prosecutions could and should be brought in the future. We should decide now and write that into the Bill as we discuss it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-25_para14">
<a name="stpa_194">There is one final area where the state arrogates to itself unwarranted power in the Bill&#151;that is, in the very definition of what constitutes religion. It is wrong that the state should be able to extend to any group of believers a privileged status by saying that they constitute a fit and proper religion. If we consider recent reports about what happened in the Navy when an individual officer claimed for himself, on the basis that he was a Satanist, a safe religious space in which to enact his rituals, we can see that the present Government and future Governments may extend to all sorts of cults and other unsavoury groups the protection that is in the Bill.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-25_para15">
<a name="stpa_195">I have no hesitation in saying, safeguarded by privilege as I am, that I regard Scientology as an evil cult founded by an individual purely in the interests of enriching himself and sustained by those who are either wicked or wayward. But if the Bill were to pass and I were to repeat those comments outside this House as an ordinary civilian, I would lay myself open to prosecution simply for having sought to point out the dangers of a fraudulent organisation masquerading as a religion.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-25_para16">
<a name="stpa_196">I have pointed to three dangers&#151;three extensions of state power&#151;which are three very good reasons why I believe that the Government should withdraw their amendments and we should accept the wisdom of the other place.

 I have my name on a bewilderingly large number of amendments that would have the effect of putting the Lords amendments back into force. I say straight away that I put my name to those amendments somewhat unwillingly. It is an awesome and awful thing to put one&#039;s name to an amendment that is critical of one&#039;s own Government. That is the first matter that I take on board.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-26_para0">
<a name="stpa_197">The second is that at the outset, when the Bill began its passage through this House on Second Reading, I was one of those who believed that it was ill-conceived and should fall. I have changed my mind on that, which is why I have signed the amendments as they stand.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-26_para1">
<a name="stpa_198">It is relevant to consider why I took that view. I am one of those who believes that there is a profound division between race and religion and that the sentry posts that man that division are the moral imperatives of &quot;ought&quot; and &quot;should&quot;. Nobody can say to me that I ought to be black, white, Chinese or Russian, but there 

<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-26_para2">
<a name="stpa_199">For 300 years, we have from time to time issued edicts to protect minorities on the ground of race&#151;the Race Relations Act 1976 was not the first example of that. I tried to discover one that is a particular favourite of mine in the statute book, but I was unable to do so. I know that it exists, so Members will have to take it from me. It is the enactment in the vagabond legislation that a man should not be taken to be a vagabond simply because he is Scottish.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-26_para3">
<a name="stpa_200">However, we have always set our face against the protection of faith by statute. The reason for that is very simple. Because of 200 years of religious intolerance, which led to nothing but bigotry and death, we have always understood that one cannot protect the faith without protecting the fundamentalist and the bigot who lie within it. Indeed, the legislation that we pass has precisely the reverse effect because the people whom we protect most are those who come close to committing the offences that we are attempting to place on the statute book. We end up with a gloomy vortex whereby I loathe bigotry and those who preach against any faith, and then those people say that my loathing them makes me liable under the very legislation that we have passed. We will create not a tolerant society but a legislative and cultural bear pit.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-26_para4">
<a name="stpa_201">The thing is made infinitely worse by importing the concept of recklessness. Recklessness is the bastard part of intention. It has caused more trouble in the English criminal law than any other single concept. It is so wide as to be practically devoid of definition. If I may bore the House for a moment, there are two classic cases. The first is the so-called firebreak case, whereby a man who perceives that there may be a small danger sets up a firebreak that destroys the forest, city, town or whatever he perceived to be in danger. His motives were good, but he was undoubtedly reckless. The second concerns the bus driver who loses his way in a double-decker bus, approaches a low bridge, and says, &quot;I don&#039;t know whether I can get this bus under there; I might not be able to but let&#039;s have a go anyway.&quot; He does not intend to kill all the passengers on the top deck, but he is undoubtedly reckless.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-26_para5">
<a name="stpa_202">I say that in order to demonstrate just how wide this test is. We have heard excellent examples today concerning the cartoons about the Prophet. Those would undoubtedly be caught by the Bill&#151;it would not be a question of how one construes the law or of worrying about the courts, judges or juries bringing in perverse verdicts.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-26_para6">
<a name="stpa_203">If we pass this Bill in its present form, we will regret it for many years to come. I urge the Government now, before it is too late, to remove the concept of recklessness. Ultimately, we will all agree that an avowed or explicit intention to cause or stir up religious hatred is something that may justifiably be impugned. Anything else will be an incursion on our freedom of speech of historic proportions that will be regretted for generations to come.

<br>&nbsp;<br>actions or words it is unlikely that there would be any requirement for a Division. But, again in common with many Members, I think that the scope of recklessness and the subjectivity of abuse and insulting behaviour mean that almost anyone could be charged with this offence. We have heard several examples&#151;there will be many more&#151;that could fall foul of this. Hon. Members have made the case that it is likely to lead to a large number of spurious cases being brought on the basis of a handful of complainants in any given circumstance.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-26_para7">
<a name="stpa_204">I am concerned about the impact that the Bill will have on Scotland. As the Minister said, it extends only to England and Wales. New paragraph 29H(2) in the Lords amendments would allow for a sheriff to have a warrant to search a premises in Scotland, presumably after a suspect had been charged on a warrant for his or her arrest issued in England. The Government amendment removes the possibility of such a search warrant being applied for. That may leave us in the ludicrous situation whereby a warrant is issued in England for the arrest of somebody in Scotland, the warrant is exercised and the person is arrested and charged, but no search can be performed on his premises to produce evidence in court.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-26_para8">
<a name="stpa_205">That is a contradiction, irrespective of whether one supports the Bill. We know that it will be possible for an English warrant to be exercised for someone furth of England for a crime committed in England. The excellent counsel&#039;s opinion cited by the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Carmichael) makes it clear that the cases of the Crown <i>v.</i> Harden in 1963 and the Crown <i>v.</i> Manning in 1998 will allow that to happen. We could end up with a situation in which someone who is subject to an arrest warrant issued in England is living in Scotland, having committed a crime in England but not in Scotland.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-26_para9">
<a name="stpa_206">That is deeply troubling. In the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act 2003, Scotland has already passed legislation to tackle religious hatred based on a joint cross-party report on such matters and after public consultation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-26_para10">
<a name="stpa_207">The relevant section states that an offence is aggravated by religious prejudice if immediately before, during or after the offence the offender evinces malice and ill will based on the victim&#039;s membership or presumed membership of a religious group or of a social or cultural group with a perceived religious affiliation. Equally, an offence is aggravated by religious prejudice if it is motivated wholly or partly by malice towards the same group. In such circumstances, the court must take action on the aggravation and the sentence must be different from the sentence that would have been passed if no religious aggravation had occurred.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-26_para11">
<a name="stpa_208">It is therefore peculiar that someone acting wholly innocently in Scotland could be the subject of an arrest warrant in England for a crime that exists here but would not be deemed a crime under similar legislation in Scotland. The cases that legal counsel cited as especially worrying relate to broadcasting, journalism and so on.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-26_para12">
<a name="stpa_209">According to legal counsel, newspapers would have to obey both current Scottish law and the English religious hatred law for any editions that were sold in England and Wales. For example, <i>The Scotsman</i> could publish a 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>31 Jan 2006 : Column 234</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>report that was legal in Scotland but could be censored in England. An English distributor could also be found guilty under the Bill while a distributor in Scotland would not be prosecuted.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-26_para13">
<a name="stpa_210">The same logic would apply to a Scottish publisher selling books to bookshops in England or to English customers ordering books via mail order or the internet. Once publication or distribution occurred, people could be arrested and prosecuted under the Bill. There are several similar examples and concerns are widespread. Broadcasting, publishing, entertainment and so on that is perfectly innocent and legitimate under Scottish legislation could be prosecuted under English law.

<a name="stpa_212">All the examples that have been given, from the mild-mannered Christians, to whom a spokesman on the Tory Benches referred, to Polly Toynbee in <i>The Guardian</i> today, suggest that the Bill goes too far and satisfies almost no one.

 I shall speak briefly from the perspective of three passionately held beliefs. First, I believe in the Labour party. As a Labour loyalist, I carry a pocket edition of the manifesto. However, it is the responsibility of all Labour Members to deliver the manifesto. We said that we would legislate to outlaw religious hatred but we also said that we would balance protection with tolerance and free speech. I suspect that the vote will be close and I plead with my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary to accept, even at this late stage, the House of Lords position, which delivers our manifesto pledge.

<a name="stpa_213">I speak secondly as a practising Catholic and, thirdly, as a strong believer in free speech. For me, the debate turned on my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary&#039;s interview on &quot;Today&quot; this morning. He said that there was a small problem with existing legislation and a gap to fill. Not unreasonably, he was asked to give one example from the past four years of a case in which existing law was deficient or that the Lords amendments would not cover. He attempted to give an example and I have been asking people about it all day. He cited a horrendous poster about the Muslim religion.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-26_para17">
<a name="stpa_214">There have been plenty of lawyers around the place to consult today. They include lawyers from the National Secular Society and the Christian Alliance, and those representing actors. I have even rung several friends who are lawyers but belong to none of those groups. All agreed that the example that the Under-Secretary cited was exactly analogous to the 2003 Norwood case, in which a similarly offensive poster featured. Prosecution occurred because a policeman saw it, a public order offence was brought and a conviction was secured.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-26_para18">
<a name="stpa_215">If we are to endure the deleterious consequences of the Bill, it is not too much to ask for examples. My hon. Friend the Member for Walsall, North (Mr. Winnick) was not his normal confident self today. He said that we may live to regret the Bill. He also said that he did not believe that we would, but when such a defender of free speech says, even when backing the Government, that we may live to regret something, it gives me cause for concern.

<a name="stpa_216">As a Catholic, I simply say that free speech is the best defence of any religion. My religion has been persecuted and has also persecuted people. Free speech is the best defence. Given the freedom of speech defences that the Government have included in the Bill, it is regrettable that they are stymied and reduced basically to saying, &quot;This is not an offence if it is not an offence.&quot; Such tautology is not good enough. I plead with my hon. Friends on the Front Bench to withdraw their objections to the Lords amendments, which satisfactorily fulfil the manifesto on which we stood for office.

<p><a name="st_260"><a name="60131-27_spnew0"><b> Rev. Ian Paisley  (North Antrim) (DUP):</b> 
 I should like to say a few words with reference to what has been said by the right hon. Member for Maidstone and The Weald (Miss Widdecombe). I am glad to be able to say to her that, when we come into this House every day, we have prayers and that the &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot; is opened, and that everything that I believe is in that book, although I am a Presbyterian. The right hon. Lady can work that out in her own way.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-27_para0">
<a name="stpa_217">I believe in the integrity of the Ministers on the Front Bench, and I believe that they would like us to put our faith in them. But when this matter comes before the courts, they will not be there. It will not matter what they have said; we could bring 10 pages of <i>Hansard</i> and read them out in court, but they would not be accepted. We are making the law in the House tonight. I must say honestly that, when I listened to the Minister arguing, I realised that he was arguing in a circle and that he could not get out of that circle. That is the crux of the matter. If we want to unite our nation, we should go for free speech. We should say, &quot;Look, we are all different, but we must be allowed to express our differences, not to stir up strife but to maintain the principle of freedom.&quot; I say to the House tonight that that freedom was bought at a terrible price; please do not sell it, or we shall all regret it.

 On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. In the light of the House&#039;s decisions this evening, I think it appropriate to inform the House&#151;if that is acceptable to you&#151;of how we see the position at the moment. <i>[Interruption.]</i> The Bill will now proceed to Royal Assent as it stands. That means that the debate between the House of Commons and the House of Lords will be about threatening behaviour, but will not include insulting and abusive behaviour; it will concern intent only, not recklessness; and it will deal with a wide-ranging freedom of expression clause.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-29_para0">
<a name="stpa_230">Despite this evening&#039;s defeat for the Government, I am delighted that we are introducing legislation to deal with the issues that we must address. There have been substantial arguments in both the House of Commons and the other place&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i>

 Order. The Home Secretary is trying to address the House and the Chair on a point of order, which I must hear fully. I do not think that this barracking helps.
</p>





<p><a name="st_267"><a name="60131-29_spnew1"><b> Mr. Clarke: </b> 
 Is it in order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, to say clearly that the Government accept the House&#039;s decision this evening, that we are delighted that the Bill is proceeding to its Royal Assent, and that we are delighted to have a Bill that deals with incitement to religious hatred? We regret that the agreements and discussions in the other place did not happen, but I hope, Mr. Deputy Speaker, that you will accept our determination to carry the Bill through.

<a name="60131-29_para1">
<a name="stpa_231">The publication of the second report of the Pensions Commission in November marked the beginning of a major new phase in the ongoing national debate about the long-term future of our pensions system. I believe that its analysis is comprehensive and thorough, and that its recommendations are radical and far-reaching. That is why I believe that its proposals have given us an opportunity to build a consensus on the long-term direction that we should take.

 Does the Secretary of State not agree&#151;at least in retrospect, following the drama of the earlier part of the evening&#151;that it would be wrong to suggest that the Turner report, given its potentially momentous conclusions for the whole population, can be dealt with adequately by Parliament in the hour and a half between now and 10 pm? Will he have a word with his right hon. Friend the Leader of the House to find out whether we can have a second session?
</p>





<p><a name="st_273"><a name="60131-29_spnew3"><b> Mr. Hutton: </b> 
 We have three hours for the debate, not an hour and a half. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman will make his own speech during that time. However&#151;I mean no disrespect to Opposition Members or, indeed, my hon. Friends&#151;I do not intend to accept many interventions. I hoped that the hon. Gentleman was going to make a point about pensions, but, sadly, he did not.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-29_para2">
<a name="stpa_232">Given the importance of the issues, I think it is absolutely right for Members to have an opportunity to participate in, and lead, the debate. In all parts of the House, there is a depth of knowledge and expertise that may be enormously helpful as we prepare our response to Lord Turner&#039;s proposals. We are therefore keen to hear the views of every Member. In response to what was said by the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford (Mr. Davies), let me express the hope that we shall have another opportunity to debate the issues before we produce our White Paper in the spring.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-29_para3">
<a name="stpa_233">I am glad that the Pensions Commission acknowledged the progress that we have made in reducing pensioner poverty since 1997. It was our first priority when we came to office, and rightly so. By targeting resources through the minimum income guarantee and then through pension credit we have ensured that there is help for the poorest pensioners, tackling the shameful legacy of pensioner poverty that we inherited in 1997. We now spend nearly &#163;11 billion extra each year on pensioners, and almost half that 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>31 Jan 2006 : Column 246</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>additional spending goes to the poorest third. We have succeeded in helping nearly 2 million pensioners to escape from the poverty line. As is shown by figures from the Institute for Fiscal Studies, we are now in an almost unprecedented position in which pensioners are no more likely to be poor than any other group in society.
</p>





<p><a name="st_274"><a name="60131-29_spnew4"><b> Mr. Peter Bone  (Wellingborough) (Con):</b> 
 I am not going to sit here and listen to that. The Government have been in power for 10 years. To try to say that the pensions crisis is to do with the previous Tory Government is ridiculous.
</p>





<p><a name="st_275"><a name="60131-29_spnew5"><b> Mr. Hutton: </b> 
 No one is keeping the hon. Gentleman here. He does not have to stay to listen to anything that he does not find comfortable or worth listening to, but I point out the reality of pensioner poverty that we inherited in 1997. He can go on disputing that. He just needs to check the historical record.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-29_para4">
<a name="stpa_234">We have taken measures in the Pensions Act 2004 to tackle the loss of confidence in the private pensions market, including addressing the pensions mis-selling scandal, and the impact of a falling stock market and rising longevity on occupational pension schemes. The introduction of the Sandler suite and stakeholder pensions have been important steps in facilitating low-cost private savings.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-29_para5">
<a name="stpa_235">All those were critical and necessary measures, dealing with the most immediate and serious challenges that we faced when we came into office, but now we must go further to build a system that will enable us to meet two significant challenges. The first is the unprecedented demographic changes that are taking place in our society. Soon, for the first time in our country&#039;s history, there will be more people over the age of 80 than under the age of five. The second challenge is the extent of under-saving, which the Pensions Commission calculated as leaving nearly 10 million people not saving enough for their own retirement.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-29_para6">
<a name="stpa_236">It was to meet those challenges that we established the commission. We must now build on the progress that we have made in tackling poverty and in promoting equality and security, reduce the complexity of the current system and ensure that people can plan and save with confidence. We are looking for the widest possible cross-party consensus on those reforms.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-29_para7">
<a name="stpa_237">In my statement to the House on the publication of Lord Turner&#039;s report, I said that our response would be based on five key tests. The first is personal responsibility. As my predecessors have made clear, the primary responsibility for security in old age must rest with the individual and their family. An active welfare state must provide a floor below which no one should be allowed to fall, but its primary role must be to enable people to provide for themselves, giving everyone the opportunity to build a decent retirement income that will meet their personal needs and expectations.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-29_para8">
<a name="stpa_238">Of course, to achieve that, we need to achieve two of Lord Turner&#039;s central objectives: first, strongly to encourage individuals and their employers to provide for a pension that will deliver at least a minimum base load of earnings replacement; and secondly, to enable all people to have the opportunity to save for a decent pension at the lowest possible cost.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>31 Jan 2006 : Column 247</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-29_para9">
<a name="stpa_239">Lord Turner saw a major expansion of workplace savings as being fundamental to achieving both those objectives, recommending that all employees should be automatically enrolled into either a high-quality employer pension scheme or a newly created national pensions savings scheme. The principle of personal accounts has been widely welcomed, rightly, because I believe that that is the right way forward. Not unreasonably, the pensions industry is keen to explore alternative ways of achieving Lord Turner&#039;s objectives. That is why my hon. Friend the Minister for Pensions Reform has invited all those in the industry who believe that they can produce a better model for personal accounts to work up the details of their alternative approach.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-29_para10">
<a name="stpa_240">There are three priorities for all of us here. First, any model must be able to achieve a radical extension of pension coverage, including lower and moderate earners, the self-employed and those working for small employers. Secondly, it must achieve a radical reduction in cost in terms of both low management charges and reduced administration costs for business, boosting in the process the value of any pension that will be paid out. Finally, it must be portable and reliable, adaptable to lifestyle choices and tailored to the personal needs of consumers.

 In looking at groups that are not taking up pension entitlements as all of us would wish, may I urge the Secretary of State to focus on married women who stay at home to bring up their children? <i>[Interruption.]</i>
</p>





<p><a name="st_277"><a name="60131-30_spmin0"><b>Mr. Deputy Speaker  (Sir Alan Haselhurst): </b>

 Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker. That may have been a married woman listening to the debate and wanting to urge me to make this point.

</p>





<p><a name="st_279"><a name="60131-30_spnew2"><b> Mr. Hutton: </b> 
 I broadly agree with the hon. Gentleman. I shall say something about the position of women under the current system, and how they fare quite badly, in a few moments.
</p>





<p><a name="st_280"><a name="60131-30_spnew3"><b> David Taylor  (North-West Leicestershire) (Lab/Co-op):</b> 
 A moment ago, the Secretary of State said that it was important that people take responsibility for their pensions, and the public increasingly accept that. However, does he agree that contributions to the state system should be made on a fair and progressive basis? The cap means that a person earning just over the average income of &#163;30,000 pays 9.2 per cent. in national insurance, whereas someone earning &#163;100,000 pays 3.7 per cent. and someone earning &#163;1 million pays 1.3 per cent. That cannot be fair. Surely there must be some scope to make the contribution system fairer?
</p>





<p><a name="st_281"><a name="60131-30_spnew4"><b> Mr. Hutton: </b> 
 Matters to do with national insurance are, of course, for my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer.

<b>31 Jan 2006 : Column 248</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-30_para0">
<a name="stpa_241">Finding the right approach to achieve the objective of a personalised, flexible tool that can enable people to save at low cost is a key part of any long-term pension reform. We start with a clear view about our objectives, but we have an open mind about how they can best be achieved.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-30_para1">
<a name="stpa_242">However, one thing is clear, and it is that employers have an important responsibility to fulfil. Many employers already contribute much more than the 3 per cent. proposed by the Pensions Commission. For those who do not, the question is whether some form of compulsion is necessary and appropriate.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-30_para2">
<a name="stpa_243">In 2004, nearly 80 per cent. of funded pension contributions came from employers. An employer contribution adds value to the pensions saving of an individual, as the figures make clear, and it can also act as an important catalyst for employee participation in the first place. However, the Government must be aware of the economic burden that adding costs to employers through any form of compulsion would impose.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-30_para3">
<a name="stpa_244">That is especially true for smaller businesses. Clearly, a compulsion on small employers to contribute to pension schemes could have a disproportionate impact. We must be mindful of all such considerations before we proceed along this path.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-30_para4">
<a name="stpa_245">The second test is that any proposals for reform must be fair, as the hon. Member for Kettering (Mr.   Hollobone) said. Any reform package must continue to protect the poorest people, so that the poverty that blighted the lives of millions of pensioners at the end of the last century will never recur. The package must be fair to those who have saved, reward those who have contributed and incentivise those who can save to do so. Crucially, it must be fair to women and carers, correcting past inequalities and reflecting those people&#039;s changing role in today&#039;s society.
</p>





<p><a name="st_282"><a name="60131-30_spnew5"><b> Mr. Andrew Love  (Edmonton) (Lab/Co-op):</b> 
 May I press my right hon. Friend on the issue of fairness? The Turner commission had very little to say about the massive inequality that exists between those who receive very significant tax relief on pension pots of up to &#163;1.5 million and those at the bottom of the income scale who receive very little in the way of support. Will he put that disparity at the centre of his considerations of fairness when he comes to decide the shape of any future system?
</p>





<p><a name="st_283"><a name="60131-30_spnew6"><b> Mr. Hutton: </b> 
 Obviously, we will look at all such matters in our White Paper proposals. It is not true that Lord Turner was not concerned about correcting inequalities in the pension system, especially as they affect women. He proposed a number of solutions, to which I shall come in a moment. Moreover, the tax simplifications introduced by my right hon. Friend the Chancellor will come into effect this April. They will offer significant improvements and advances in the current tax arrangements. We are making progress, and my hon. Friend may have an opportunity to explore his own proposals later in the debate.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-30_para5">
<a name="stpa_246">We have already introduced a range of measures to improve the position of women pensioners in particular, both in the labour market and in terms of income in retirement. The minimum wage and the pension credit regime have been especially beneficial to women. Two

<br>&nbsp;<br>thirds of the pensioners lifted out of absolute poverty since 1997 are women. The introduction of the state second pension means that the proportion of women now accruing significant state pension rights is similar to that of men, while almost all of the 1.9 million carers, and two thirds of the 5.8 million low earners, who have been helped have been women.
</p>





<p><a name="st_284"><a name="60131-30_spnew7"><b> Vera Baird  (Redcar) (Lab):</b> 
 My right hon. Friend makes a powerful point, as there is no doubt that this Government have helped women pensioners hugely, especially through the pension credit. However, if a women does not have a full basic state pension she will not, by virtue of the state second pension, come out of the pension credit limit. Is not the real difficulty, therefore, the fact that only 17 per cent. of women have a full basic state pension when they retire?
</p>





<p><a name="st_285"><a name="60131-30_spnew8"><b> Mr. Hutton: </b> 
 Yes, those figures are broadly right. It is worth bearing in mind that we estimate that over the next 20 years men and women will accrue an equal entitlement to state pensions. That is progress, and it is progress that some people thought would not happen. I agree with my hon. and learned Friend that the current system does not treat women fairly, and we will address those issues in the White Paper to be published in the spring. I wish to pay tribute, quickly but sincerely, to my hon. and learned Friend for the work that she has done, together with colleagues from both sides of the House, in campaigning for more equitable treatment for women.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-30_para6">
<a name="stpa_247">My argument today is that we can and must do more. Doing so will, however, require making some difficult choices. One approach favoured by Lord Turner is the introduction of a new universal basic state pension for those aged over 75. Another would be to remain true to the contributory principle, but to make adjustments to the number of qualifying years&#151;for example, removing the 25 per cent. de minimis limit and turning home responsibilities protection into a system of national insurance credits. In every case, there is more than one way to achieve the objectives that Lord Turner set out. Lord Turner himself judged, for example, that an evolutionary approach to state pension reform was preferable to adopting a more immediate citizen&#039;s pension. The citizen&#039;s pension would involve spending large amounts of extra money on helping better off pensioners rather than poorer pensioners, so while it offers greater simplicity more quickly&#151;and a route to greater equality for women&#151;it does so at the cost of helping better off pensioners. It also destroys completely the contributory principle and carries significant implications for the crucial third test of affordability.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-30_para7">
<a name="stpa_248">Clearly any system needs to be affordable for taxpayers and the economy as a whole. We have an obligation, especially on the Government side of the House, to continue to manage public expenditure prudently and responsibly. Several of the commission&#039;s proposals raised the prospect of significant additional Government spending&#151;in particular, the proposed re-linking of the basic state pension to earnings, which was    of course scrapped by the last Conservative Government. Ministers have made it clear that there will be no relaxation in our fiscal discipline and we will not

<b>31 Jan 2006 : Column 250</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>put the public finances at risk. So the affordability test is central. If we are to fund a more generous state pension, such as the one Lord Turner has proposed, the critical question will be how we pay for it.
</p>





<p><a name="st_286"><a name="60131-30_spnew9"><b> Mr. David Laws  (Yeovil) (LD):</b> 
 The Secretary of State says that he is concerned about affordability in relation to the basic state pension, but is he also concerned about the affordability of public sector pensions? As a share of the national economy, the cost of public sector pensions is going up by 50 per cent. at a time when the basic state pension is static.
</p>





<p><a name="st_287"><a name="60131-30_spnew10"><b> Mr. Hutton: </b> 
 We have entered into arrangements that are sustainable. The new arrangements for public sector pensions that we have reached with the trade unions open up the prospect of significant savings for the taxpayer in the next few years. It is not clear to me that the hon. Gentleman is proposing what he suggests he is proposing in relation to public sector pensions. I suspect that we will hear more from him in due course, as we will from the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond). If I may get my defence in before the attack has been delivered, I would point out that we have spent the past few weeks looking at what the hon. Gentleman and his colleagues said about public sector pensions during the election campaign. I tentatively suggest to the hon. Gentleman that he treads warily down the path of suggesting that the deal is not a good one for the taxpayer, because&#151;as he will know&#151; he made no proposals during the election campaign to make any changes to public sector pensions.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-30_para8">
<a name="stpa_249">Lord Turner has suggested that the state pension age should rise broadly in proportion to the increase in life expectancy. While that raises questions under the fairness test, it is not possible to have the debate about affordability without seriously considering an increase in the state pension age. My view is that some increase from 2020 is inevitable, but we should consider very carefully all the options for how that can best be delivered.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-30_para9">
<a name="stpa_250">The fourth test is simplicity. Any credible package of reform must represent a clear deal between citizens and the state, so that people know what the Government will do for them and what is expected of them in return. The state must be clear about its priorities: a decent pension for both men and women, which can act as a platform on which individuals can be encouraged to save even more themselves, with continued extra help for the poorest pensioners.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-30_para10">
<a name="stpa_251">Simplicity also means clarity for individuals about the value of their savings pot. It means clear, credible financial education and advice and an important role for pension information and pension forecasts to show people how much they need to save to achieve the income they want in retirement. Of course, it means people understanding the nature of the risks entailed in any type of savings product. Pensions are never a risk-free business and they should never be presented as such.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-30_para11">
<a name="stpa_252">Finally, simplicity means having a system that allows people to plan and which is sustainable for future generations and that is my fifth and final test. If we are to lay the foundations for a lasting pension settlement, it is crucial that any reform package must be underpinned by an enduring national consensus&#151;a system that will stand the test of time and not be pulled apart by successive Governments.

The British people will expect us to lift the debate out of the party political arena and genuinely attempt to build a consensus that gives them the security to plan for the long term, knowing that the settlement we eventually reach will not be unravelled by a spin of the wheel of political fortune.

I want to consider some of the preliminary issues that we feel need to be addressed to allow us to hold a serious and open debate in the attempt to reach consensus about the long-term future of our pension system. My main focus will be Turner.

<a name="stpa_256">Turner said that there is no immediate crisis. Although there may be no immediate crisis in relation to the state pension or the public sector&#039;s ever-mounting liability in respect of its pensions, many people coming up to retirement, who are stakeholders in private pension schemes, are experiencing something that feels remarkably like a crisis. I want to deal with that issue, as I am sure that many Members will want to raise it.

<br>&nbsp;<br>shorter term. It is the extent to which the regulatory regime under the Pensions Act 2004, which is supposed to encourage and protect private pensions, is encouraging a retreat from higher risk, higher return assets in favour of liability-driven investment in gilts, with a series of self-reinforcing and rather negative outcomes that we are seeing at the moment. That has driven up demand for long-dated gilts, thus driving down yields. Pension fund liabilities are calculated by reference to the yield on the long-dated gilt, which in turn has increased the deficits of those pensions and fuelled the next round of liability-driven gilt buying. Meanwhile, the funds have missed out on a recovery in the equity markets and perhaps an opportunity to repair the damage that previous stock market downturns have done to their balance sheets.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-31_para5">
<a name="stpa_259">I certainly subscribe to the view that politicians, especially Opposition politicians, should not lecture the Debt Management Office on how it manages the public sector debt, so I shall not offer the Minister any recommendation about how the Government should fund their debt, and I urge my colleagues to follow that lead. However, the Minister could look at the demand side of the problem. He could consider the regulatory environment that is driving the flight from risk to gilts. He could also consider the extent to which the regulatory regime and the risk-based pension protection fund levy, which is now anticipated, are reinforcing patterns of investment behaviour that are making it more and more difficult for companies to plug the holes in their pension funds. I should be grateful if the Minister would say something about that very immediate problem tonight.

<p>

<a name="stpa_260">While the Minister is responding, he might just take a quick look at the financial assistance scheme, which was set up with a great fanfare nearly two years ago to provide a solution for the estimated 85,000 people who have been left high and dry by the collapse of pension funds. The financial assistance scheme has so far paid out to just 15 people, and that figure represents an advance. The latest published Government figure shows that 13 people have benefited, but we are grateful to the Minister for yesterday updating that figure to 15 people.

<a name="stpa_263">On security, people must be given a clear understanding of what the state will and will not do. That security must be based on a consensus that gives people the confidence to plan ahead and make their own arrangements, with an understanding that the settlement that is reached will endure for many years. On sustainability, the settlement must be durable in the long term. It must provide a solution for today&#039;s pensioners, as well as people in work and those who are not yet of working age. Of course, the settlement must be affordable, both now and in the future, against an objective baseline of the likely future cost of the present system, if it remains unaltered.

<a name="60131-31_para10">
<a name="stpa_264">As we analyse and consult on the Turner proposals, which the Government are also doing, the big questions are becoming clear. Is the trade-off of a higher state pension age for higher state pensions the right one? Is it affordable and can it be made sufficiently flexible to be fair to those whose life expectancy will be different from the rising average? What degree of compulsion should be employed when encouraging people to save for a second pension? Should employers be required to contribute and, if so, how much? Should there be special arrangements&#151;either subsidies or exemptions&#151;for small and medium-sized enterprises? How should such a second savings scheme be managed and how will it impact on the existing pensions industry? As the Secretary of State said, the Government are actively pursuing answers to those questions and a lively debate has already begun. Is the balance between public and private provision that Turner proposes the right one for Britain in the 21st century?
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-31_para11">
<a name="stpa_265">The process is not competitive because we are not trying to get better answers than the Secretary of State. I genuinely hope that by separately pursuing the answers to those questions, we will find not that we get precisely the same answers&#151;that would be too much to expect&#151;but that our answers are sufficiently close to make it possible to build a genuine consensus across the political divide. If we are to have a genuine debate and a real consensus is to be formed, the Government must come to the debate with an open mind. They must be ready to engage in some give and take, because without that we cannot build a consensus.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-31_para12">
<a name="stpa_266">The political reality is that if all bar one member of the population reaches a consensus and the one is the Chancellor of the Exchequer, we will not have a way forward. It was thus disappointing to those of us who want a consensus that the Chancellor tried to shut down the debate before it got started. He positioned himself from the outset as the road block to pension reform. If we are to have a proper debate, we need transparency, flexibility and impartiality. Nothing must be ruled out and nothing must be off limits in advance of the debate. I have to say that the Government&#039;s track record on that is not good, although that is no reflection on the Secretary of State or the Minister for Pensions Reform,

<a name="60131-31_para13">
<a name="stpa_267">Although private sector pension stakeholders are facing tough choices and often negotiating against the constraint of the viability of their employers in the face of burgeoning pension deficits, public sector unions face no such constraints. Whether funded or unfunded, any gap in public sector pension provision must be met by the taxpayer. The Secretary of State&#039;s party fatally undermined any claim it could make to be addressing the matter impartially when it caved in to the public sector unions on retirement at 60 before the general election, and caved in again in October last year. If we are to have a serious debate and face up to the tough decisions that must be made, the burden of adjustment must be shared equitably. There can be no exclusions or favours for specific groups. We must all be in this together.

 I do not think we can honestly conduct a debate on the basis that we are trying to build a consensus if we rule anything out before the debate begins. We must consider every aspect, as it would be unreasonable not to do so. People outside the House would not understand what we were trying to do if we were not prepared to look at every aspect of the way in which our pension system works. On the table is a set of proposals from Lord Turner. No one will agree with all of them, but it is a serious piece of work, and it should be the starting point for our debate. I hope that the Minister for Pensions Reform can make it clear that while public sector workers, like their private sector counterparts, are entitled to expect fairness and proper recognition of the accrued pension rights that they have acquired during their period of employment, they, too, are part of the real world and cannot be insulated from the reality of rising life expectancy, which is the key factor underlying our debate.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-32_para1">
<a name="stpa_269">Affordability is another critical issue. We cannot have a serious debate unless we are transparent about the financing assumptions underlying the proposals. The Chancellor has already dismissed Turner as unaffordable. A serious debate needs a clear baseline, and Lord Turner sets out his baseline on page 13 of his report. The Government should come clean. We need to know whether we are costing Turner&#039;s proposals against a baseline of a minimum income guarantee rising in line with incomes, or against one that rises in line with prices. If the Chancellor wishes to make his baseline assumption an end to the income link in 2008, let him do so and defend the decision publicly. He should not use de-indexing as a stick with which to beat Turner, or as a tool to undermine Turner&#039;s proposal, without being prepared to announce and defend that policy.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-32_para2">
<a name="stpa_270">The Government must come clean, too, about the savings from the equalisation of women&#039;s pension age&#151;a net &#163;10.1 billion a year by 2020. Turner assumes that that money is available, but will the Minister confirm in his winding-up speech that the Government&#039;s position is that it is not available, because it has been spent on something else? Alone among Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries, the UK will see the percentage of gross domestic product spent on state-funded pensions and state-funded pensioner benefits declining between 2010 and 2020. If that is the Chancellor&#039;s response to the pensions crisis, he should say so. If not, he should have the courage to acknowledge that Turner&#039;s assumptions are no more than realistic politics.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-32_para3">
<a name="stpa_271">At a time when the private sector has been forced to acknowledge and confront its pension deficits through the Pension Protection Fund levy, FRS 17 and the explicit statement of pension fund liabilities on companies&#039; balance sheets, we can no longer accept the Government shrouding the public sector pension liability in a smokescreen. We need an objective, independent, regularly updated assessment of public sector liabilities as an integral part of the public accounts. Perhaps the Secretary of State will have a word with the Chancellor to see whether the Chancellor 

<br>&nbsp;<br>

<a name="stpa_272">Finally, a small but important request to the Minister&#151;if we and others are going to engage in this debate at a serious level, we need the tools to do it. The Turner report contains a wealth of detail, but not the disaggregated data required seriously to examine the options. I have written to the Secretary of State requesting that the Opposition have access to the Department&#039;s software model, PenSim2, which was made available to Turner and other outside bodies, because only by using PenSim2 can modelling outputs be directly and robustly compared with Turner&#039;s conclusions. Surely the Department is currently examining a range of options, and even if it is not I assure the Minister that the Treasury is. Will the Minister take the opportunity in his winding-up speech to underline the consensual approach by sending a real message to people outside this House that this is not politics as usual and that we are trying to build something together by announcing that he will allow appropriately qualified researchers from the official Opposition and, indeed, any other parties that want to avail themselves of the opportunity, access to the PenSim2 model?

 This debate is narrowly focused on the Pensions Commission report, which is not fit for purpose in three significant ways. Any one of the issues that I hope to raise this evening suggests that we should not go down the path advocated by Turner.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-32_para7">
<a name="stpa_275">First, the Pensions Commission report ignores the golden opportunity created by the Chancellor for serious, long-term pension reform. Secondly, it does not examine the dangers to long-term security for pensioners posed by the proposed measures. Thirdly, the proposals simply will not last politically.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>31 Jan 2006 : Column 257</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-32_para8">
<a name="stpa_276">I turn first to the golden opportunity that the Chancellor has created for us. Every major pension reform put before this House in the past 30 or more years, by Governments of both persuasions, has been bedevilled by the fact that, while trying to think about long-term reform, the Government of the day had to deal with how long-term reform might help to deal with the immediate problem of rising pensioner poverty. Through the pension credit, the Chancellor has not merely redistributed more funds to the poorest pensioners than any other Chancellor since 1948&#151;I say merely, but that is immensely important to our constituents&#151;but opened the door for Governments to think carefully about the long term. They no longer need be tripped up by thinking that they should modify the proposals because of the mega-issue of desperate and rising pensioner poverty.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-32_para9">
<a name="stpa_277">My disappointment with the Pensions Commission report is that it fiddles around with the furniture, which the Chancellor said he was not happy to do. Such fiddling is also against the report&#039;s original terms of reference and distracts our attention from the opportunity for long-term reform. Serious as that is, the report does not stop there: it also presents particular dangers for pension provision. Tucked away in an appendix is the devastating fact that five sixths of the final salary schemes that have closed have done so since 2000; in other words, they have closed under our watch. My worry is that the commission&#039;s soft option of trying to entice employers who are not currently contributing directly to their employees&#039; pensions will result in many more employers thinking, &quot;Thank God! We can get off this longer-term liability that our predecessors committed us to.&quot; Far from extending funded pension coverage, the commission&#039;s proposals, if implemented as drafted in the report, could mean the end not merely of final salary schemes, but of defined contribution schemes. Many employers will think that the way for them to remain competitive is to opt into the new national pension saving scheme.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-32_para10">
<a name="stpa_278">There is another danger that Turner holds: mis-selling. In his charming and non-controversial way, the Secretary of State warmly shook the neck of the Opposition and reminded them of their responsibilities in respect of previous mis-selling. What will be the charge against any Government who introduce the national pension saving scheme? It is being set up with Government approval, the contributory agency may well make the collections and presumably, the Government will make some warm noises about its being an ideal way to save. They are having difficulties with the ombudsman&#039;s report, for which we are waiting, because they produced merely a leaflet telling people that occupational pensions are a good thing, so imagine the rumpus that will occur if one of the proposed schemes does not perform as well as the other savings products to be provided under this particular pension hat. That is not an avenue to go down.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-32_para11">
<a name="stpa_279">In my efforts to build a consensus with the Liberal Democrats&#151;I have not yet done so with the Tories&#151;I, along with Matthew Owen, a Liberal Democrat, proposed a national pension savings plan back in 1993. We looked at the real strength of the national savings movement in this country. If the Government wanted 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>31 Jan 2006 : Column 258</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>additional savings, why not capitalise on that route and set up a national pension savings plan? There would be one product and it would be clear what that was. There would be minimal charges because it would be index-linked&#151;a tracker fund&#151;with trustees elected by the members to make sure the Government did not get their sticky fingers on those funds, and it would not leave the Government open to mis-selling charges.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-32_para12">
<a name="stpa_280">The third disadvantage of the provision that the Pensions Commission proposes is that it ignores the huge risk to individuals when they save through individual pots of savings in the private market. I thought that the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond) would continue his analysis of the dangers that companies were facing. We all know what those dangers are, but private individual savers are facing even more horrendous problems than are companies. To say that a well-managed private pension scheme will advise people to move at the right stage from equities into bonds ignores the fact that that advice might be given just when the equity market has collapsed, so the money being moved into bonds which will buy the annuity has been devalued. For all those reasons, there are huge dangers in going down the Pensions Commission route.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-32_para13">
<a name="stpa_281">Finally, I do not think it will last. A serious reform that tries to raise the basic pension significantly for all our citizens and which is on a pay-as-you-go basis will not last the course. We tried that model before. A previous Secretary of State asked me why we opted for SERPS to be pay as you go and not funded. I said, &quot;Secretary of State, we were against capitalism then.&quot; &quot;Ah,&quot; he said. &quot;That explains why we went down the pay-as-you-go route.&quot;
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-32_para14">
<a name="stpa_282">For all the faults inherent in a funded scheme, it gives us property rights in the capital of the country, but we need to share the risks attached to property owning as a means of providing pensions. When the Government Actuary has costed the proposals with which I am associated&#151;the pension reform group proposals&#151;I hope we will have an alternative that takes as a starting point the chance of a huge breakthrough in this debate, by uncoupling the question of how we deal with today&#039;s poor pensioners from the question of long-term reform. To a huge extent, pension credit has done that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-32_para15">
<a name="stpa_283">We can therefore think genuinely about the long-term, which must be a funded provision. That, combined with the state pension, offers us a minimum pension that does not merely take means-testing for old people down to 30 per cent., but abolishes it for practically all. We ought to grasp that opportunity. We ought not to be concerned with moving the furniture about in a way that does not deliver that important objective. I ask other speakers in the debate to say, if they have time in their 10 minutes, to what extent their proposals aim for a future that ensures that all those who are part of any new reform will draw a minimum pension free of means-testing.

In particular, they have confused the issues of affordability, which any Treasury will be concerned about, and sustainability, which those who design the state pension system must be concerned about. At the moment, we have an affordable system that is not sustainable. Unless the Chancellor can hold both those concepts in his mind at the same time, we will have a problem. It is significant that, after Lord Turner&#039;s report was published, he had to publish a document rebutting Treasury allegations about his figures entitled, &quot;Sanity in Figures&quot;.

There is a big debate to be held about its nature, how women are dealt with, whether it is a citizens pension and whether the contributory principle will be respected. However, the basic principle is a much simpler state pension that everybody can understand and that lifts people out of poverty. The Government&#039;s

 I am pleased that the hon. Gentleman says that lifting people out of poverty should be our goal. Given the generosity of pension credit, there is a huge hurdle to surmount if one is considering only a tax-financed retirement pension. Is he committing the Liberal Democrats to only a tax-financed basic state pension or is he considering both tax and funded provision?
</p>





<p><a name="st_301"><a name="60131-33_spnew2"><b> Mr. Laws: </b> 
 I am talking about a tax-financed basic state pension. The right hon. Gentleman is experienced enough in the subject to know that there are several different methods of delivering that. Some try to tackle the issues that the Secretary of State mentioned earlier, including fairness, given the limited resources.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-33_para15">
<a name="stpa_299">A better funded basic state pension or citizens pension requires better methods of funding it. We must not only consider the transition from our current position to where we want to be but seek savings elsewhere in our pension system and in public expenditure. That is why the amount of money that goes into public sector pensions is so crucial. The Government imply that we cannot possibly put more money into the current basic state pension architecture because that is unaffordable. Yet the cost of public sector pensions has increased and is projected to rise by 50 per cent. as a share of GDP in the next few decades.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-33_para16">
<a name="stpa_300">If it is impossible to find the money for the basic state pension architecture, it is odd that the Government are allowing the cost of public sector pensions to increase so rapidly. As the right hon. Member for Birkenhead knows, the controversial proposals that have recently been agreed between the public sector unions and the Government make a small contribution to reducing the cost in the next few decades. We believe that any Government will eventually need a version of the Turner report that must tackle public sector pension reform. We appreciate that that is controversial but fundamental reform is unthinkable without objective analysis.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-33_para17">
<a name="stpa_301">As Lord Turner hinted heavily in his report, although he was not allowed to examine the issue in detail, the current level of pension right accrual is deficient in total and increasingly unequal. His main target was clear.

 Does the hon.

That does not seem entirely fair and I am surprised that more Labour Members have not picked that up.

<br>&nbsp;<br>some public sector schemes&#151;not all, in fairness; the local government scheme is clearly not comparable with some of the others&#151;the effective contribution rates, which after all involve the taxpayer, are many multiples of what we see in defined contribution schemes, and even double some of the defined benefit schemes in the private sector. I would have thought that many people, even in the public sector, understood that unfairness. Of course they want to see decent pensions in the public sector, but they understand that we cannot rely solely on the taxpayer to pick up the bill. People in the public sector, including Members of Parliament, might have to decide whether they want to receive a less generous pension or to make larger contributions to their pension to ensure that it can be delivered.

 Does the hon. Gentleman agree that pensions, particularly occupational pensions, are in effect deferred wages, and that any proposed changes to pension schemes should be introduced only after negotiation with the appropriate trade unions and with the full agreement of the scheme&#039;s members?
</p>





<p><a name="st_305"><a name="60131-34_spnew2"><b> Mr. Laws: </b> 
 I agree with the hon. Gentleman that there are major issues involved and that remuneration needs to be looked at as a passage. Often, however, the better pension benefits in the public sector do not look as though they are simply compensating for lower pay, although that seems to be what most economic evidence suggests today. Of course the hon. Gentleman is right to say that there should be negotiation on these matters.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-34_para0">
<a name="stpa_302">Whenever I have discussed these issues with people in my constituency who work in the public sector, I have found that they are far more grown up than we assume. They understand that there are no blank cheques to be signed in this regard. Many of them, including people in the local government scheme, have suggested that they should be paying higher employee contributions. They ask why employee contributions have not risen over time, even though people are living longer. One of the mistakes that we make in politics is to treat people as though they are children who cannot understand these basic issues, but most people understand that there is no such thing as a free lunch, and that Governments of all parties have to grapple with these difficult issues.

<p>
<a name="60131-34_para1">
<a name="stpa_303">Another issue that needs to be looked at if we are to afford a better basic state pension architecture is the state pension age. The Government appear to have made a significant change in their policy in this area; I think I heard the Secretary of State say today that he thought an increase in the state pension age was inevitable. That is quite a striking change in Government policy from that of the Secretary of State&#039;s predecessor but one, the right hon. Member for Oxford, East (Mr. Smith)&#151;

<br>&nbsp;<br>the concerns about that came from the Treasury. I do not know whether, when the Secretary of State spoke today about the increase in the state pension age being inevitable, he was speaking on behalf of the Government with the support of the Treasury, or whether he was simply speaking on his own behalf.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-34_para3">
<a name="stpa_305">The right hon. Member for Birkenhead spent some time talking about the difficult issue of what any additional pension should be, if one were available in addition to the basic state pension or citizens pension. It is clear that no one would want simply to rely on a basic state pension in future, even if it were considerably higher and better than the state pension that people rely on today. We are still talking about a pension that would seek to protect people from poverty rather than to give them a life of luxury in retirement. We want most people not only to have access to the state pension but to have a second pension into which they put savings and to which their employer contributes. It would be right, particularly if we are to address the unfairnesses of the public sector scheme, to ensure that employees, employers and the state contribute to those second-tier pensions, although clearly that highlights particular issues for small businesses and others to which the Government will have to be sensitive. A partnership between those three seems to me to be sensible and the only way to get enough money in the pension pots of workers on low incomes to make a real difference.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-34_para4">
<a name="stpa_306">There are some massive issues here, which the right hon. Member for Birkenhead highlighted very clearly. He was concerned about the impact on defined benefit schemes. Frankly, my view is that defined benefit schemes, in the private sector at least, seem to be on the way out anyway because of the economics of such schemes. How will we manage the risk transfers involved? We are talking, potentially, about an enormous transfer of risk from the Government&#151;as we have seen many times, there is a risk in relying on them&#151;and from employers, who have not been able to handle this risk recently, towards individuals, many of whom are completely unprepared to handle risk of this type. Indeed, I dare say that most people are completely unprepared to handle it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-34_para5">
<a name="stpa_307">I do not see many alternatives to transferring those risks to individuals and I think we will end up going in that direction whoever is in government, but I am under no illusion about people&#039;s preparedness to take on that responsibility. An enormous extension of financial literacy, starting from school, and of financial advice to people on low incomes is required. As the right hon. Gentleman correctly said, careful thought from the Government on maximising choice for those who want to be able to choose their second pension and structure it in a way that they, rather than the Government, think desirable is also required.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-34_para6">
<a name="stpa_308">Careful consideration is required to deal with the issue that the right hon. Gentleman raised about risk and not ending up with people thinking that they have two Government-guaranteed pensions. The ingenious scheme proposed by Lord Turner must not be considered a Government-guaranteed second pension, because it is not that. No future Government could provide such a guarantee.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-34_para7">
<a name="stpa_309">Those are the major challenges that the Government have to address on pensions policy. I genuinely hope that we can find a consensus across parties that lasts 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>31 Jan 2006 : Column 264</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>rather longer than consensuses have in the past. The experience of the 1970s is not encouraging in looking at the period for which a consensus can be held together. This is a big challenge for the Government, as is seeking consensus internally first. I look forward to the time&#151;in the promised couple of months I hope, although such periods tend to expand, as we see with the Child Support Agency&#151;when we have the opportunity to hear the Government&#039;s proposals and to know that they are agreed across the Government. Then we can engage in a serious debate, knowing that something will come out of it.

I want to give a word of warning to any Members who intend to invite Lord Turner to a meeting: they will find a man who is sincere, passionate and knowledgeable&#151;he can recite reams of his report without notes&#151;but extremely loquacious. If the meeting is for one hour, allow two.

I do not think I am breaking any secrets when I say that I chaired a parliamentary Labour party meeting about a month ago where 31 people were present and 28 different solutions were on offer. That is the situation we are going to be in.

<a name="stpa_311">There is such a wide range of ways out in terms of how Turner analyses things and I am intrigued, but also concerned, by the use of the word &quot;consensus&quot;. Who are we aiming to get consensus with and between? Is it with and between men and women, because that has never been there before? Is it between young and old? Is it between contributors and beneficiaries? Is it between the public and private sectors? Is it between professionals and manual workers? Let us not forget that if we move at some time to a retirement age of 69, a less than academically gifted child who leaves school at 16 will have to work for 53 years. A professional person, however, will have a working life of around 40 years. That is a huge difference in terms of retirement age.

<a name="stpa_312">Consensus between the various parties in the House is the most dangerous consensus of all. In 1975, we had that consensus across all parties in the House including the Scottish National party, and it lasted five years. With the best will in the world towards Opposition Members, it is an absolute betrayal to pretend that they agree with something and will stand by it should there be a change of Government. That is a pretence and a sham. The consensus needs to be among the public, consumers and those most affected by the issue, not between the Government and Opposition Benches.

 That is not a point of order. We well know the rules of the House, but the main thing is that the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford (Mr. Davies) has a right to refuse to give way. That is his privilege.

 As you know, Mr. Speaker, I like to give way when I can but the answer to questions on a complicated matter such as pensions can take longer than the extra time that is available.

<a name="60131-36_para0">
<a name="stpa_331">Means-testing must be reduced and indexation must be reversed. It is both perverse economically and insulting to those who save to say that a less favourable regime will be applied to savings when one is working and contributing to a pension than when one has a means-tested, non-contributory pension. In my view, one cannot do anything about a second pension going above the basic state retirement pension until the contributory pension, if one is entitled to the maximum pension, is higher than the means-tested tax credit, pension credit or whatever one wants to call it. Only from that point on would it not be mis-selling to force people into a second-tier pension.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-36_para1">
<a name="stpa_332">Thirdly, on that basis, we should go for compulsion. It is reasonable to do so. It is actually essential because there are enormous external costs in not having universal saving; people tend to fall back on the state unduly. That must be covered. There are also enormous 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>31 Jan 2006 : Column 269</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>internal costs in any pension scheme if it has to be distributed and sold. If we have compulsion, we will get rid of the major cost element in the pension industry: the cost of marketing, distribution and administration, which is very great if there is a voluntary system. I do not believe that the funds should be in the hands of the state. I believe that they should be in the private sector.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-36_para2">
<a name="stpa_333">The best model that I have come across is the Australian superannuation scheme. That scheme introduced compulsory contributions by both employers and employees very gradually, and we should adopt the same approach. The process in Australia took about 15 years, and no single increase in contribution amounted to more than 1 or 2 per cent. of salary, for either the employer or the employee.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-36_para3">
<a name="stpa_334">If employers are told that they have to set aside 1 per cent. of their wage bill for contributions in one year, with the same amount to be so allocated in the following year or the year after, they can often take that amount out of the increases in wages or salaries that they would grant in that period. In that way, compulsory contributions can be phased in without creating problems.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-36_para4">
<a name="stpa_335">The Government and the Turner commission are alive to the fact that problems must not be created for employers, especially for those with small businesses. Such problems can drive people out of business or so raise the cost of labour that demand for it is reduced and unnecessary unemployment is created. The Australians have shown how that circle can be squared to a remarkable degree. Turner has in mind a scheme that would yield about 15 per cent. of beneficiaries&#039; salaries by way of a second pension, but I think that we should be much more ambitious.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-36_para5">
<a name="stpa_336">I have set out my four basic approaches, but there are more than 600 Members of this House and I accept that there will be at least 500 pet schemes to solve the problem. That is why I reiterate my earlier appeal for another opportunity to debate this matter. Moreover, the subject of pensions deserves a full-day debate. We should not require it to be shared with another big issue of the day, even one as dramatic and exciting as the one on which we spent so much time this afternoon.

 I was interested to hear the previous speaker, the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford (Mr. Davies), say that he wanted to break the consensus evident in the Chamber in this debate. That was in direct conflict with the comments of the Opposition spokesman, the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond).
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-36_para6">
<a name="stpa_337">One of the problems with Turner is the way in which pension schemes will be funded. If compulsion is chosen, what happens if someone loses their job? We have been here before. The Crossman proposals of 1969 or 1970 introduced expanded social services in this country, and proposed the introduction of SERPS. Conservative Governments since then have always wanted to move away from the SERPS system.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-36_para7">
<a name="stpa_338">As I have told the House before, I used to work at Rolls-Royce. The previous Conservative Government encouraged people to opt out of SERPS and go into

<br>&nbsp;<br>private pension schemes. That caused all sorts of problems. People would have what used to be called &quot;pension holidays&quot;, when money that should have gone into their pension scheme did not do so. Moreover, it is important to remember that many occupational pension schemes formed part of the wage deals agreed by millions of people, some of whom have retired and some of whom are still in employment.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-36_para8">
<a name="stpa_339">For example, people might have put in for a wage increase of 5 per cent. and settled for 3 per cent. The difference of 2 per cent. was either put into the pension or took the form of additional holidays. Many people enjoyed the benefit of that, but sadly the practice has disappeared over the past 20 years or so, mainly due to the activities of the previous Conservative Government.
</p>





<p><a name="st_334"><a name="60131-36_spnew10"><b> David Taylor: </b> 
 My hon. Friend makes it clear that pensions are often part of an overall wage deal. Does he agree that that is especially true in the public sector? A substantial number of people with public sector pensions earn wages that are significantly below average, in the expectation that they will be compensated by a reasonable pension at the end of their working lives. Does my hon. Friend know why the Opposition attack that approach?
</p>





<p><a name="st_335"><a name="60131-36_spnew11"><b> Mr. Cunningham: </b> 
 I was about to elaborate on that very point. The public sector includes the civil service, and the Government have been attacked for the deal that they made in that regard. However, we do not know how local government pension schemes will be funded, and that is a major problem.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-36_para9">
<a name="stpa_340">I am conscious of the terms of reference for this debate, and do not want to digress too far, but in Coventry the problem of equal status has been around for seven or eight years and still has not been settled. Local authorities will be confronted by both issues&#151;pensions and equal status&#151;but they will receive no assistance to deal with them.

<p>
<a name="60131-36_para10">
<a name="stpa_341">Only 17 per cent. of women have an occupational pension or a SERPS pension. Many of them have brought up a family and found, for a variety of reasons&#151;in some cases, their husband has died&#151;that they are not entitled to a pension. That is one of the reasons for pensioner poverty and why I welcome the fact that one of the first things that this Government did was to tackle that. It would have been criminal to leave those 3 million pensioners in the state that they were left in by the previous Government.

<p><a name="st_337"><a name="60131-36_spnew13"><b> Mr. Cunningham: </b> 
 That occurred to me, too. Some people have been unpaid carers for people with disabilities or serious illness, and they lose out on pension rights. We also have the scandal of Federal-Mogul. Many people in Coventry&#151;and some in Derbyshire&#151;worked for that company but they cannot

If there is an economic downturn, as there is in the rest of the world, pension schemes will suffer. We have to be careful that we are not in a Catch-22 situation.

We will see whether the Chancellor is right&#151;it has not yet been proved that he put the blockers on Turner. A wise man would advise waiting until we decide which of Turner&#039;s recommendations we will pick. It is natural for the Chancellor to say that we will make an announcement on how we will implement the scheme at the appropriate time. The Opposition speculate about what he will say, but they do not know. As I said earlier, their attacks on the Chancellor are purely political in an attempt to discredit him. We have all read the insulting remarks that the Opposition have made about the Chancellor. However, if they want any consensus on the issue, they will have to bite the bullet as much as anybody else.

<a name="stpa_346">There are many issues involved in pensions, including how to fund care for people as they get older. Some pensioners have to delve into their savings to pay for that.

 Like my hon. Friend the Member for Grantham and Stamford (Mr. Davies), I did not approach the debate in a particularly consensual mood. I have a declared interest in relation to the pensions industry. Although the pension fund of which I am chairman is well funded and robust, it brings me into contact with a wide range of people in the pensions field, so I know of the distress and difficulty caused to them and to the employees of their companies by the difficulty in which the industry has been put.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>31 Jan 2006 : Column 272</b>

</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-37_para0">
<a name="stpa_347">Currently, a large number of people can live with some dignity in retirement&#151;the high proportion of people who retired on final salary pensions. However, I do not share the sturdy optimism that seems to permeate the Turner report and I fear for the future pensions of people in their 30s and 40s. The situation will deteriorate, and badly.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-37_para1">
<a name="stpa_348">Why? I have heard some people simplistically blame the Chancellor of the Exchequer for the impost of &#163;5 billion a year on the pensions industry in 1997, but that does not put things into the correct context. The causes of this massive crisis&#151;the shortfall of funding in the pensions industry&#151;are more varied. The Association of Consulting Actuaries has estimated the deficit at &#163;130 billion. That is a massive deficit and it is difficult to see how it can be overcome. Its first cause is longevity.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-37_para2">
<a name="stpa_349">For continuous mortality investigation&#151;CMI&#151;actuaries normally use the mortality tables of the 92 series, which means that they are basing mortality estimates on the period from 1991 to 1994. They will not be using the 00 series, which covers 1999 to 2002, until much later; indeed, that series will not even be published until the late spring of 2006. The difference in projecting tables forward is dramatic. Forward projections using the 92 tables, making the assumptions on which the 00 tables are based&#151;even those are not fully up to date&#151;would be that a 60-year-old man in 2006 would live to between 85 and three quarters and 92 and three quarters, with a central assumption of 88 and three quarter years. That is one and a quarter to eight and a quarter years more than the previous central assumption of four and three quarter years. In case anyone writes to me after the debate saying that the sums do not add up, I point out that they are actuarial figures not arithmetical ones. The numbers are dramatic and they throw out of gear most of the previous calculations.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-37_para3">
<a name="stpa_350">The second cause of the shortfall was stock exchange weakness, which has led to a rush into gilts. The gilts yield has gone down, thereby increasing the problem of covering projected pension costs, because of asset liability modelling.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-37_para4">
<a name="stpa_351">Thirdly, FRS 17 accounting standards have caused companies to include pensions in their general accounts. Fourthly, the ACA says that the increasing regulation and cost of pension fund administration causes a considerable burden. Fifthly, there is the unreality of      final salary schemes&#151;defined benefits&#151;and unsustainable benefits. To a certain extent, we all lived in a fool&#039;s paradise in the 1980s and 1990s, failing to realise that the aspirations of those who were due to retire could not be sustained.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-37_para5">
<a name="stpa_352">Finally, there is the Chancellor of the Exchequer, who in 1997 failed to see the weakness of the pensions industry and kicked the patient downstairs. A range of measures were taken in the 1997, of which the then Financial Secretary said,
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_35">&quot;this should benefit all investors&#151;including pension funds&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 7 November 2002; Vol. 392, c. 766W.]</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-37_para6">
<a name="stpa_353">In fact, the Chancellor of the Exchequer imposed a &#163;3 billion charge on pension funds and actuaries took account of that; they factored it in and adjusted their figures accordingly, so &#163;3 billion a year has been taken out of the pensions industry since 1997, which has caused this massive crisis.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>31 Jan 2006 : Column 273</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-37_para7">
<a name="stpa_354">What are the problems to be faced? First, my hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond), who spoke from the Front Bench, made the fair point that the Chancellor of the Exchequer must accept that the solution to the pensions crisis will cost public funds a great deal of money. When I first became involved in the pensions industry, I used to take a factor of 18 to multiply the amount that would be needed to generate a pension&#151;so to generate a pension of &#163;10,000 a year, for instance, one would need a fund of &#163;180,000. Now I take a factor of 24 to 26. It would take &#163;240,000 to &#163;260,000 to generate a pension of &#163;10,000 a year. There is no such thing as a cheap pension.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-37_para8">
<a name="stpa_355">Secondly, I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Grantham and Stamford (Mr. Davies) in saying that, having considered the matter carefully, there is no alternative to compulsion. I cannot understand how we can succeed in persuading enough people to go in for the amount of pension that is needed without compulsion. That leads me to the third point: incentives or means-testing.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-37_para9">
<a name="stpa_356">A couple of days ago, we who serve on the Treasury Committee had before us witnesses who gave evidence about the corrosive effect of means-testing. We were told that means-testing does not really have much effect on savings, because the people involved in means-testing would not bother to save anyway. In fact, means-testing has a corrosive effect, and we cannot continue with the present rate of means-testing. The percentage of pensioners on means-testing is now rising well above 50 per cent. and approaching 60 per cent. That is totally unsustainable. We must therefore have incentives.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-37_para10">
<a name="stpa_357">The next point is defined benefits, and I accept with reluctance that defined benefits are now dated. It is most unusual for someone to start with a firm and stay with that employer&#151;unless it is the public sector&#151;for two or three decades. I therefore accept that defined contributions are the logical way ahead, but it is also a fact that employers have tended to put 12 to 15 per cent. of employees&#039; wages into defined benefit schemes, whereas the amount going into defined contributions schemes will be much lower&#151;6 to 7 per cent. or thereabouts and sometimes as low as 4 per cent.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-37_para11">
<a name="stpa_358">The fifth point that we must face is the private-public gap. It is natural for those in the public sector to wish to hold on to their pension advantages and their great advantage of having the benefit of early retirement. Ministers have made much of the fact that the public sector will save &#163;13 billion from adjustments to the age of retirement; but, in fact, that is a &#163;13 billion adjustment between people who are fortunate enough to be on the escalator of earlier retirement and those who are unfortunate enough to come in later. That is most unfair.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-37_para12">
<a name="stpa_359">My sixth point is the Pension Protection Fund. I recently attended a meeting with the regulator, David Norgrove, who was very charming, competent and capable&#151;I wish him well&#151;but the massive burden that the PPF will impose on business has been widely misunderstood and underestimated. It will be a major problem, and the classification of companies, which will cause some to pay many times more than others, will cause immense disadvantages and difficulties. It will 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>31 Jan 2006 : Column 274</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>drag down bad companies and, finally, it will drag down good companies. I fear that, in the medium term, the PPF will impose a burden on private sector companies that is simply not understood at the moment.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-37_para13">
<a name="stpa_360">In summary, I accept the main thrust of the Turner commission. First, I agree that there should be a new earnings-related provision&#151;it should be private&#151;and I would not rule out the national pensions savings system. I suspect that such a system might well change its spots and evolve into something very different with time, so it deserves study. Secondly, the state pension must be reformed, with a consequent reduction in means-testing. Thirdly, everyone, including the Chancellor of the Exchequer, must accept that public expenditure on pensions will need to rise. Fourthly, the pension age must be addressed and, I think, raised. We need to face up to our problems. We need to be frank and open about the numbers and the problems, and I submit that Ministers have not always done so. We must encourage informed debate. That is the democratic way.

 The Government have recognised, in a way that the previous Government simply did not, that women suffer from serious pension inequality. I fear that nothing has changed because the   hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond), who opened the debate for the official Opposition, made not one single proposal for the 51 per cent. of pensioners who are women. Indeed, the only time the word &quot;woman&quot; crossed his lips was when he suggested that we should all profit from the fact that from 2020 women will work until they are 65. Women will not have missed the significance of that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-37_para14">
<a name="stpa_361">Much praise has been lavished on Lord Turner, which I share, but I want to mention another member of the commission, Jeannie Drake. She played a key role in ensuring that women&#039;s difficulties with pensions were analysed with the intellectual rigour for which she is well known.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-37_para15">
<a name="stpa_362">Only 17 per cent. of women pensioners receive the full basic state pension of &#163;84. The average woman receives &#163;50, but that statistic hides the many women who have given a lifetime of service, such as Jennifer, who is my worker in Redcar. Jennifer was in full-time nursing and then cared full-time for two children, who are now highly productive citizens who have been nurtured exactly as we would want. She was then in part-time nursing and now she works part-time for me. For her lifetime of service, she has a basic state pension forecast of 28p a week&#151;index link that. No wonder the previous Secretary of State but one&#151;I hope that I have got the numbers right&#151;called the situation a national disgrace.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-37_para16">
<a name="stpa_363">If the basic state pension is a platform on which to build with one&#039;s savings, a lot of women are starting with something that is better characterised as a dark hole. That happens because the Beveridge system, which is in its dotage, or at least in serious need of multiple limb replacement, gives credit only for full-time paid work. Attempts to help women and carers have worked in only a half-baked way. Home responsibilities protection gives a sort of credit for every year that a mother is out of work and child rearing, but if she works for one week and earns more than the lower earnings limits so that she pays one national insurance 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>31 Jan 2006 : Column 275</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>contribution, she loses the whole credit and thus gets one contribution instead of the 52 that would be received under HRP. Two part-time job wages cannot be added up to bring a woman into the lower earnings limit so that she can make a contribution. If one wage is below the LEL, she can receive no credit. Many women in my constituency work as dinner ladies at lunchtimes and in convenience stores at night. Although they might work for 40 hours or more a week and look after kids as well, they get not a single credit towards their pensions.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-37_para17">
<a name="stpa_364">Carers who look after people who are ill or old get a credit towards their pensions only if they serve someone who is getting disability living allowance for 35 hours or more a week. If they care part-time for up to 34 hours a week, they get no credit at all, irrespective of the damage that that does to their ability to work. Those situations show why the position of many women is so poor.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-37_para18">
<a name="stpa_365">Women represent most pensioners, so let us face it for once that we must look at women first as a priority because if we get the situation right for them, we can get it right for everyone else. Labour market changes mean that 85 per cent. of women are likely to qualify for a full basic state pension by 2030. That figure is insufficient in itself and it hides many people such as Jennifer who do not want to work full-time because they want to concentrate on their children. Those people will never be ersatz Beveridge males in the form of modern females, so changes to the labour market will not put the problem right.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-37_para19">
<a name="stpa_366">There is no doubt whatsoever that Opposition Members criticise means tests because they fundamentally do not know about poverty. They do not understand how many people in my constituency are now living an acceptable life, but did not do so in their pensionable years before the pension credit came into play. Of course the basic state pension is the important platform and it must be elevated, but I am worried that although the Conservatives say that they would make the basic state pension better by index linking it, they would do so by uncoupling the pension credit from index linking. That would lead to women watching a basic state pension that they did not receive going up while the pension credit on which they were dependent was going down because it would be linked only to prices. They would thus go back into poverty.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-37_para20">
<a name="stpa_367">The Government now appreciate these problems and I am pretty satisfied that they are working hard to try to reconfigure the partial credits and the pension system so that more women and carers can be brought on to the basic state pension. That would mean that their caring was put on a par with working, which would be the right modern model. By making those adjustments, the Government will probably bring 95 per cent. of people into the basic state pension. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State raised the question of affordability. The remaining 5 per cent. who will fall through the cracks of the improved credits will probably be poor, and will have be supported by the pension credit in any event. Does it make sense to undertake an elaborate reconfiguration of complex credits, or is it better to bring everyone into the basic state pension on the basis of residence? We would not sacrifice the contributory principle, as the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford (Mr. Davies) suggested. I agree that people should get something for something&#151;and not something for nothing&#151;even if that is a matter of

<br>&nbsp;<br>perception rather than reality. The contributory principle can continue in connection with the second tier of the basic state pension&#151;the S2P. However it is configured, it can play a part in such an arrangement.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-37_para21">
<a name="stpa_368">Turner&#039;s realisation that the pension should be paid to individual men and women is overdue. I want the rewards of my caring, my working or my residency to be paid to me. I do not want one pension to be paid to my husband, along with a 60 per cent. pension that is my entitlement as a dependant. That is an outdated model of womanhood that no one wants and which works only for the diminishing numbers of married people. As a woman, I pay a full national insurance credit, and I receive a full basic state pension. A married man pays national insurance credit, just like me, but he receives 1.6 pensions, which is a double inequity for women. In addition, increasing numbers of unmarried women receive only the poor basic state pensions that I have set out.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-37_para22">
<a name="stpa_369">I applaud Turner&#039;s attempt to bridge the gap and help the poor make up for past poverty with his suggestion that we institute a universal basic state pension for everyone over 75. That excellent proposal will make up for past failures to some extent, but women will still suffer. If the Turner model is introduced in the two ways that I have set out, women who are halfway through their career would not receive credits for their past caring and part-time work. In future, they would be credited on residential grounds, but they would receive only half a pension because they would not be credited for their caring under the current rules. If those parts of the Turner report are implemented, it will be necessary to attend to those middle-aged women or a large number of female votes will be lost.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-37_para23">
<a name="stpa_370">This is a short debate, and mine is a small contribution. If there were more time I would talk about the need for an enhanced state contribution to the excellent and redistributive S2P. If we get basic state pension credits right, and if the criteria become residential, women who are carers will, almost by definition, be low-paid and less able to save, whatever improvements we make. They need more help from the tax system if they are to be able to save on top of their basic state pension. They need the help from the tax system which top earners receive but simply do not need. That, however, is a debate for another day. Women&#039;s state pension position is the last bastion of institutionalised sex discrimination in this country, and I hope that the White Paper will announce that it will change very soon.

A major cause of the crisis is the Government&#039;s decision in 1997 to remove the right of pension funds to reclaim dividend tax on the equities that they owned. That decision has created a loss of &#163;5 billion, discouraged the country&#039;s savings culture and increased the spread of means testing.

<a name="60131-38_para1">
<a name="stpa_372">The Pensions Commission&#039;s first report in 2004 exposed a large hole in the country&#039;s private pension provision and funds. The Commission found that
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_37">&quot;in 2002&#150;03, 11.3 million people in work were not making contributions to any private pension scheme&quot;.</p>

</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-38_para2">
<a name="stpa_373">To compound the problem, in recent years, many final salary company pension schemes have been wound up, as has been said. The Pension Protection Fund and the financial assistance scheme were introduced to address the problems relating to the winding-up of pension schemes. However, the Government&#039;s response to the crisis has been inadequate. The financial assistance scheme, which involves the payment of &#163;400 million of public money over 20 years, is welcome, but with only &#163;20 million a year, it cannot live up to the billing that the Government gave it, hence the narrow criteria for entitlement to assistance. The Government presented the FAS as an answer to many of the problems of pension scheme wind-ups. In raising expectations so high, it is inevitable that many people will be disappointed when they face the reality of the FAS.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-38_para3">
<a name="stpa_374">The Government also appear to be badly informed about the scale of the problem. In a written answer, they revealed that they do not know how many occupational pension schemes started winding-up in each year since 1997:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_38">&quot;Figures on schemes starting to wind up between 1997 and 2000 are not available as the register does not contain information on whether the schemes that started to wind up before 2000 started before or after 1997.&quot;&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 20 July 2005; Vol. 436, c. 1821W.]</p>

<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-38_para4">
<a name="stpa_375">In a further written answer, the Government revealed that they do not know how many occupational pension scheme members face losses to their pension savings due to their schemes being wound up by their employers:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_39">&quot;We have not made any estimate of the total number of occupational pension scheme members who are facing losses to their pension savings due to their schemes being wound up by their employers.&quot;&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 21 July 2005; Vol. 436, c. 2023W.]</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-38_para5">
<a name="stpa_376">In recent years, we have also seen plenty of debate, but little action, on the reform of the local government pension scheme. Much of the contention has been focused on the 85-year rule. The system allows anyone whose age, added to their number of years of service, comes to 85 or more to retire on an unreduced pension, even if they have not yet reached the age of 65. Last year, the Government attempted to standardise the pension age by removing the rule. However, on 18 March 2005, faced with an imminent strike, the Deputy Prime Minister announced that he would revoke the regulations with retrospective effect.

<a name="60131-38_para6">
<a name="stpa_377">Local authority employers estimate that that U-turn cost councils an extra &#163;450 million a year, and private businesses have complained about it bitterly. Private businesses are outraged by the high cost of protecting public sector pensions, while private sector pensions face increasing pressure. David Frost, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, has highlighted the disparity:

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_40">      &quot;On the one hand, we have the private sector workforce being told it must work longer and put more money into their own pension pot, but here we have the public sector workforce who can still retire at 60&quot;.</p>

<a name="stpa_381">I welcome the debate and the Turner commission&#039;s contribution to it. The lack of attention to the pensions crisis, which has been growing over the past eight years, is one of the major failings of this Government.

</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-38_para11">
<a name="stpa_382">I agree that there is a dire need to address the lack of savings in this country. The savings ratio has more than halved under this Government, from 9.3 per cent. in 1997 to 4.25 per cent. in 2004, according to the pre-Budget report. The UK has a substantially lower savings rate than our main European competitors&#151;France, Germany and Italy&#151;all of whom have a rate in the range of 10 to 11 per cent. The Secretary of State referred to the level of under-saving; indeed, some 10 million people in this country are not saving. It is clear that this group in particular need to increase their level of saving in order to make some contribution to providing for their old age.

<p>

<a name="stpa_383">My contention is that accelerating the means-testing of pension credit has significantly accelerated the disincentive to save that we have witnessed under this Government.

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_43">&quot;There is very little evidence that means-testing, under the previous Government or this Government, has reduced saving on the part of pensioners, but since 1997 there has been much greater confidence in the economy . . .

<a name="60131-38_para14">
<a name="stpa_385">In looking at Lord Turner&#039;s proposals, it is important that the Government are a bit more ambitious than Lord Turner has been in reducing the proportion of pensioners covered by the pension credit, given its means-testing nature. Currently, some 40 per cent. are on pension credit. That figure is supposed to come down by a mere 7 per cent., to 33 per cent., through the report&#039;s recommendations. I regard that reduction as insufficient if we are to change this country&#039;s savings culture.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-38_para15">
<a name="stpa_386">I invite the Government, in considering the report&#039;s recommendations, to address the issue of consumer protection, which was touched on by the right hon. Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field). The Secretary of State mentioned in his opening remarks the difficulties that the pension mis-selling problems of the past pose for the culture of saving and for the credibility of the pensions regime. I agree that they undoubtedly contributed to a lack of public confidence in pensions and in saving for retirement. I also agree with Lord Turner that introducing greater simplicity into the pensions industry is a desirable objective, but simplicity does not equal suitability. Means-testing, by definition, gives rise to the need for a suitability test. As we have heard, individuals will need to be willing and able to save a substantial amount of money to be confident of an adequate return in their retirement&#151;one that will exceed funds available from the state under the proposed arrangements.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-38_para16">
<a name="stpa_387">I raised this issue with Lord Turner when he appeared before the Select Committee last month. I asked him whether he had consulted the Financial Services Authority regarding the mis-selling risks associated with his proposed national pension saving scheme. He said:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_45">&quot;We have not directly consulted the FSA on this.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-38_para17">
<a name="stpa_388">I found that a very surprising response, given the diligence that he had shown in producing such a comprehensive report.

<p>
<a name="60131-38_para18">
<a name="stpa_389">Consumer protection is, I assume, of considerable concern to all hon. Members. I therefore urge the Government to address the issue when they consider Lord Turner&#039;s proposals. We all know of people across all income groups, particularly the lower paid, who, at various stages of their lives, have other commitments and are not in a position to set aside money to save. For those people, some element of consumer protection and advice should be available.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-38_para19">
<a name="stpa_390">Another problematic aspect of the national pension savings scheme is asset allocation. Who is to decide whether it is appropriate for some individuals to have their assets invested in predominantly fixed income returns, compared with equities? Other hon. Members referred to that earlier. It is difficult to produce a one-size-fits-all investment policy for the entire population. That is why I agree with other hon. Members who recommended a mixed approach. There may need to be some form of state-sponsored provider, but there must a role for private providers to come up with alternative schemes to allow choice. That again raises the question of suitability and advice. If suitability and consumer protection can be ignored, as Lord Turner suggests, is that appropriate Government policy? Does it not leave the Government exposed to the risk of mis-selling? It is a risk that the Government must consider carefully.

<a name="60131-38_para20">
<a name="stpa_391">In the remaining few minutes, I shall highlight specific issues relating to the NPSS. In the absence of compulsion, the combination of auto-enrolment and a very low cost offering will replace existing pension schemes. That is not just my view; it is the view of leading consultants in this area, Cazalet Consulting, who were quoted in the <i>Financial Times</i> earlier this week. I shall read one conclusion from their report on pensions profitability, which states that
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_46">&quot;the Turner NPSS system, if implemented, would be likely to cause a surge in life company pension plan lapses as consumers move to take advantage of the very low proposed pricing levels. We doubt whether the NPSS could ever work as planned, however, as the best case persistency assumptions used in that report anticipate a dramatic improvement in persistency, which is at odds with the current reality of steadily deteriorating lapse rates.&quot;</p>

<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-38_para21">
<a name="stpa_392">To put that in layman&#039;s language, the current average lapse rate of pension schemes&#151;both individual and group corporate schemes&#151;is about 18 per cent. a year. In other words, 18 per cent. of people contributing cease contributing. In the Turner report that rate is estimated to be 10 per cent. a year, and the heroic assumption is made for the NPSS that the lapse rate will fall to 2.5 per cent. a year. That seems an ambitious assumption, to say the least. It raises the question whether employers will put pressure on employees to encourage opt-outs from a voluntary system, and whether it is feasible to achieve adequate investment management skills to manage funds on such a low commission basis. With a 30 basis-point charge, at least 22 per cent. would go in administration costs, which leave only eight basis points&#151;

<a name="60131-39_para2">
<a name="stpa_395">Let me start with last Saturday&#039;s surgery, when three firemen came to see me about public sector pensions, particularly their own pensions. Ultimately, their point was that there is not much joined-up government on that issue. The police, for example, have their pension scheme protected by the Government. As a member of the Select Committee on Trade and Industry, I remember that when we looked into the Post Office, which has a &#163;4 billion deficit on its pension scheme, its response was, &quot;Don&#039;t worry&#151;we&#039;re a monopoly, so we can put the price of stamps up to recover it.&quot; There was no suggestion of altering its pension scheme in any way. However, the Government have changed the scheme for firemen so that certain firemen will have to work for an extra five years before they get their pension. The firemen who came to see me were not saying that there should be no change, but that the Government&#039;s approach is not even-handed.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-39_para3">
<a name="stpa_396">One of those gentlemen is caught in a trap. His pension retirement date is just a few days after what the Government have deemed to be the date of the change, so he will have to work for virtually five years longer than he had expected before he gets his pension. He has been paying 11.75 per cent. of his salary into pension contributions, which he regarded as a binding contract and part of his emoluments. He feels let down by the Government. He believes that they are being rather mean and that it is possibly to do with their trying to get back at the firemen for going on strike a few years ago. Can the Minister refute that by confirming that there is a joined-up approach to the way in which public sector pensions as a whole are being dealt with? People in the public sector would not mind if the approach was even-handed. They realise that there have to be changes to their pensions because people in the private sector are suffering a great deal.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-39_para4">
<a name="stpa_397">A few years ago, I was visited by a Mr. Martin Sterrow&#151;a pensioner in Wellingborough who had never before been involved in politics. He was outraged that his state pension was going up so little in comparison with his council tax. Hon. Members must be aware that Wellingborough has experienced the biggest increase in council tax since it was introduced. However, Mr. Sterrow could show that the increase in his council tax was more than that in his state pension. That cannot be right.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-39_para5">
<a name="stpa_398">I said that if there was a genuine problem perhaps we should hold a public meeting. We therefore arranged it, and I expected 10 or perhaps 20 people to attend&#151;I know how difficult it is to get people to public meetings. However, 100 people attended and they were outraged that their pension had not increased enough even to pay their council tax. That is not a criticism, but a fact that we must tackle.

<a name="60131-39_para6">
<a name="stpa_399">Mr. Sterrow organised petitions, a shadow Cabinet member came to the constituency and the shadow Cabinet received feedback.

<a name="60131-39_para7">
<a name="stpa_400">That group of pensioners had never previously been involved in a political campaign. They were not Conservative or Labour but genuine constituents who were worried about the state of affairs. Of course, they did not want their council tax to increase by 20 per cent. or 25 per cent. year after year. However, the most striking point was that they wanted a decent basic state pension. They did not want freebies&#151;they did not necessarily want a winter fuel allowance&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i> I repeat that they wanted a decent state pension so that they could decide how to spend their money. They did not want freebies and the Government telling them how to spend their money. I do not know what the answer is, but that was what they wanted.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-39_para8">
<a name="stpa_401">They were sure that they did not want means-testing, which they hate. Those people have paid all their lives through taxes and insurance premiums, yet when they collect their pension, which they perceive as a right not a benefit, they are asked to fill in forms and declare all their personal income so that they can have a bit more. They hate that and many pensioners will not take up the money because they do not want the indignity of means-testing. The previous Member of Parliament for Wellingborough said that one problem was millions of pounds in unclaimed pension credit. Why cannot that money simply be added to the basic state pension? That would be a start.

 Does the hon. Gentleman realise that my constituents have similar feelings about means-testing? The Turner report states that if we continue with the current system, by 2050, 80 per cent. of pensioners will be subjected to means-testing in some form for their state benefits.

<p><a name="st_345"><a name="60131-39_spnew2"><b> Mr. Bone: </b> 
 I am grateful for that intervention. I thought that the figure was 75 per cent., but whether it is 75 per cent. or 80 per cent. it is ridiculous. The Minister for Pensions Reform and the Government probably agree that that is not acceptable.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-39_para9">
<a name="stpa_402">The pensioners of Wellingborough want a decent pension without means-testing. I appreciate that the Minister might say that the matter comes down to cost. The pensioners had a few ideas about that. Since the Government have been in power for&#151;in my opinion&#151;10 years, we have paid &#163;100 billion through our taxes to the European Union. Some pensioners suggested to me that it might have helped if we had been a little less worried about French farmers and a little more concerned about pensioners. That is a huge amount of money. However, I know that the Minister will say that we cannot do anything about the EU.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-39_para10">
<a name="stpa_403">Let us therefore consider domestic savings. The TaxPayers Alliance says that &#163;80 billion could be saved each year on Government waste. It gave a few interesting examples. The Government spent &#163;225,000 on informing people not to wear ill-fitting slippers. They spent &#163;40,000 on a 46-word definition of patients&#039; experience in the NHS. That is nearly &#163;1,000 a word. The best one is the &#163;10,000 that the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister wasted on whether fire engines should be red. What a waste of money. Yet &#163;80 billion is wasted in such ways. Let us have a decent pension for our pensioners instead.

Friend the Member for Ludlow (Mr. Dunne) made a thoughtful speech in which he examined issues relating to the proposed national pensions savings scheme, such as consumer protection and the regulatory framework. He rightly drew our attention to the thought-provoking comments in the Cazalet report, which was published only in the past couple of days.

<a name="stpa_408">The Government have presided over the pensions crisis for something like nine years. In that time, they have taxed pensions, undermined savings by increasing means-testing and heaped ever more red tape, cost and bureaucracy on to companies with pension schemes. They came to office with the avowed policy of, rightly, changing the balance between public and private pensions from 60:40 to 40:60. They have failed signally in that ambition. The first pension reform Minister, the right hon. Member for Birkenhead, was appointed to think the unthinkable, then promptly sacked for his trouble.

<a name="stpa_409">Two million pensioners are still living in poverty and figures released only today show that the take-up of pension credit is still extremely disappointing. In the last six months of 2003&#150;04, it was in the range of 58 to 66 per cent. by caseload. That means that a very large number of people, many of whom I presume are women, are failing to claim their entitlement. In spite of more than eight years in power, the Government have done absolutely nothing about the scandal of women&#039;s pension entitlement, except&#151;I nearly forgot&#151;to publish an annual report to tell us how bad the problem is.

<p>
<a name="60131-39_para17">
<a name="stpa_410">The Government&#039;s flagship Pensions Bill, now the Pensions Act 2004, was introduced with great claims about how it would safeguard and encourage final salary schemes. The opposite has been the case. Final salary schemes are dead or dying. Most are already closed to new entrants; more and more are closing even to existing members. Recent examples include Rentokil and the Co-op. Experts such as the National Association of Pension Funds say that this is just the beginning.

<a name="stpa_412">The clearest and most pressing injustice is to those who lost all or most of their pension when their company schemes wound up with insufficient assets. We are talking about up to 85,000 people. Despite being unveiled as long ago as May 2004, the financial assistance scheme has only just started to make payments to people in trouble, as we heard from my hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond). Yesterday, the Minister was good enough to confirm that, so far, a grand total of 15 individuals in only one scheme have received payment. It is a scandal that it is taking so long. That is just adding insult to injury.
</p>

<a name="60131-39_para20">
<a name="stpa_413">Everyone except the Government recognised long ago that the sums devoted to the FAS are hopelessly inadequate. Even if the money holds out for the time being, the FAS is paying significantly lower benefits than the Pension Protection Fund. Those honest and decent people, some of them facing penury, are being treated as second-class citizens. As if the Government have not troubles enough, they are on the receiving end of a case in the European Court of Justice and an ombudsman&#039;s investigation.

<p>
<a name="60131-39_para21">
<a name="stpa_414">As the House has heard, we have fairness as one of our guiding principles in pensions reform, as do the Government, but if that is so, how can they possibly begin to justify the sweetheart deal they recently struck with the union bosses? Surely a key aspect of fairness is that the public and private sectors should be treated similarly, yet private sector workers would be lucky to find a final salary scheme to join. Not so public sector workers. That is not only patently unfair, and seen to be so by a lot of people out there, but it has seriously undermined attempts by responsible private sector employers to maintain their pension schemes. Attempts by such employers to agree changes to entitlements with their workers, which would make the schemes more

<a name="stpa_417">It has even been suggested that the Chancellor has already decided to snaffle the &#163;10 billion a year saving on equalising women&#039;s pension age for other purposes. Surely&#151;this, perhaps for the first time in our political relationship, is something that the hon. and learned Member for Redcar and I can wholeheartedly agree on&#151;that money should, in all fairness, be earmarked for improving pensions, particularly if, over a relatively short period, we are to ask women to move from a state pension age of 60 to one of 67, 68 or even higher.

<a name="60131-39_para25">
<a name="stpa_418">Finally, as is so often the case, our underlying principles on pension reform are not very different from the Government&#039;s stated objectives. It would be unthinkable, as the Secretary of State has acknowledged, to implement reform based on Turner without a broad measure of social and political consensus. I am delighted that the Secretary of State has made it clear today that he is looking for such consensus. We call on the Government to involve us closely in the process. We have much to contribute. By the time the effects of any reforms, or indeed of a failure to act, are felt, several different Governments will have come and gone, and many different Ministers. As we saw earlier this evening, Governments can lose votes. Governments can lose elections. We are every bit as keen as they are to see a lasting and durable solution to the pensions crisis that will deliver fairness as well as dignity and security in old age for all our citizens.

In producing a unanimous well-thought-through report, addressing all the issues that people have been raising, they have done us an enormous service. We should put on record our thanks to them.

</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-40_para1">
<a name="stpa_420">At the start of the debate, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions set out the priorities for pension policy that we identified in 1997. We have dramatically reduced the extent of pensioner poverty, particularly through the introduction of pension credit in 2003, with especially large gains among older women&#151;perhaps one of the most important of all the big social improvements that we have seen since 1997. He was right to make the point that that has made a big change to the landscape, which opens up new possibilities for pensions reform. We have taken steps to bolster confidence in occupational pensions through the Pension Protection Fund and the financial assistance scheme.
</p>





<p><a name="st_348"><a name="60131-40_spnew0"><b> Mr. Quentin Davies: </b> 
 It is a pleasure to debate pensions with the Minister again after all these years. When he says that the pension credit has taken a lot of older people out of poverty, he is absolutely right, but does he see it as a one-off achievement, as I do? Do we not now need to return to a rational system in which the means-tested pension does not rise at a faster rate than the contributory pension? Or does he consider that this means-testing must go on&#151;
</p>

<p><a name="st_350"><a name="60131-40_spnew1"><b> Mr. Timms: </b> 
 I certainly do not agree that we should return to the arrangement whereby large numbers of single pensioners were living on &#163;69 a week. Were we to go back, that would be the position. At the moment, every single pensioner is entitled to an income of at least &#163;109.45 per week, and the Turner report proposes that auto-enrolling people into the national pension savings scheme will enable them to build up savings and a pension, which, over time, would reduce the extent of means-testing. We certainly must not, as the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford (Mr. Davies) was calling for, go back to the time when large numbers of people were on extremely low incomes. I, too, am delighted to be debating these matters with him again. His earlier contribution took me back to 1999.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-40_para2">
<a name="stpa_421">We have introduced the state second pension, greatly boosting the savings of those on low incomes and carers. We have also introduced stakeholder pensions, which the hon.

</p>

<a name="60131-40_para3">
<a name="stpa_422">We now have a foundation that opens up the chance of an enduring pensions settlement for the UK. I hope that the optimism expressed across the Chamber today will be fulfilled over the next few weeks as we move towards proposals for reform and a consensus about what we should do.

<a name="stpa_423">The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond) was right to draw attention to Lord Turner&#039;s statement that there was no immediate crisis for pensioner incomes. I think he was trying to make out that there was a crisis, but I believe that Lord Turner was right.

That is an important point, although given that many employers currently make significant contributions to defined-benefit and defined-contribution pension schemes, I do not see why, if we made 3 per cent. the minimum, employers would necessarily think it appropriate to reduce their contributions.

He tried to welcome the report and say that he agreed with Lord Turner, while still presumably supporting the policy that he announced two weeks before the report&#039;s publication.

He spoke for many in expressing concern about Turner and Newall. If Turner and Newall does become insolvent at some point in the next year or so, it will enter an assessment period for the purposes of the Pension Protection Fund. I know that that will reassure many people who are in the position that my hon. Friend described.

<a name="stpa_430">The hon. Member for Gosport spoke with authority on a number of matters. He suggested that the impact of the tax change in 1997 was &#163;3 billion rather than &#163;5 billion, and that is probably a more accurate figure. Like the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford, he argued for compulsion, in contrast with the view that his party has advanced. I do not share his pessimism about the Pension Protection Fund. It is important that we keep an eye on the level of the levy that the fund will impose, but the levy will be capped at 0.5 per cent. of scheme assets. That step has reassured many funds.

Her point that a week&#039;s work entails losing a year&#039;s HRP is not correct, but the way HRP works has all sorts of strange effects. I am certain that, not least because of her efforts and those of our hon.

At the moment in the UK, it is about the same as it was in the 1960s and it is twice as much as it is in the US. The question of what the savings ratio should be is quite a difficult one. I agree that we want more people to save for a pension, but do not believe that having an element of means-testing makes that impossible. Indeed, we have had means-testing of pensioner incomes in the UK since 1908, and it has not been incompatible with adequate pension saving in the past.

I am very optimistic about what we can achieve over the next few months, but no Government can solve the pensions challenge on their own. Broad agreement will be key to securing the confidence that we need. I am grateful for the evidence in the debate that, across the House, hon. Members are willing to contribute to that goal.

 I have secured the debate to allow the House to consider mobile phone technology and how best we can deal with the problems, particularly bullying, presented by that developing industry. In addition, I want to go further and to present a solution that can enhance education as well as minimising bullying. Mobile phone technology in our schools is both a challenge and an opportunity.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-41_para1">
<a name="stpa_435">There are an estimated 61 million mobile phone connections in the United Kingdom. It is estimated that 95 per cent. of young people between the ages of 11 and 21 have access to a mobile phone. Furthermore, it is estimated that there are 2.5 million mobile phone users aged between 10 and 16. The market is worth something like &#163;500 million per annum to the airtime providers.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-41_para2">
<a name="stpa_436">Young people are fascinated by the technology, and mobile phones constitute one of their most treasured possessions, but there is a dark side to the fascination. For children who wish to bully others, the technology provides a new dimension to their capacity for intimidation. Along with text bullying, the bizarre and inappropriately named practice of &quot;happy slapping&quot; has provided new technological refinements for the age-old playground bully.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-41_para3">
<a name="stpa_437">The time is now right for the House to consider how to deal with the problem. In his recent report on school behaviour and discipline, Sir Alan Steer said that
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_52">&quot;mobile phones are now part of daily life and have changed the way in which individuals and organisations communicate. We are deeply concerned at some of the negative impacts which mobile phones including camera phones are having on school discipline and pupil safety. This is not simply a case of ring tones disrupting lessons. Mobile phones are sometimes used to convey inappropriate text messages as a form of bullying and harassment. Some pupils have used mobile phones to invite aggressive parents to schools so the parent can challenge teachers&#039; rights to punish misbehaviour. Pupils with mobile phones may also find themselves bullied or have their phones stolen with a particular risk within some communities of mugging on the way to school. We believe pupils should be discouraged from bringing mobile phones to school. It is obviously unacceptable for pupils to have phones switched on in a lesson. We support head teachers who, having considered the community in which their school is situated and consulted parents, decide to ban mobile phones.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-41_para4">
<a name="stpa_438">The report clearly states that schools cannot ignore the choices presented by this new and developing technology. We must strive to prevent the abuse of the technology and look at how pupils can engage with it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-41_para5">
<a name="stpa_439">Many schools just ban mobile phones, but I know of none that have been able to enforce that. Anecdotally, I believe that some schools in the US use cell blockers to stop the signal within the confines of the school. That is an effective but somewhat draconian solution that is not popular with either parents or teachers.

It is easy to let the publicity surrounding some of those horrific acts obscure the very real benefits that could accrue from mobile phone use in schools. There are numerous benefits that could be achieved from mobile phone technology if utilised effectively. Representatives from the industry have informed me that there is a model to deal with some of the problems.

<a name="60131-41_para14">
<a name="stpa_448">Technologically, it is feasible to have a registration system where the pupil and school are identified and a profile is downloaded to phones that effectively blocks calls from unwanted sources, and restricts the use of cameras and the times when the phone can be used. All of the controls provided by those combined profiles can be imposed by a central provider-based application on the subscriber&#039;s telephone. That enables changes to be made to any profile to take immediate effect. It also enables phones to be used for positive educational purposes.

<a name="60131-41_para15">
<a name="stpa_449">Mobile phones could help to raise standards in schools. For example, on a geography field trip, students could make use of mobile phones to take pictures of a feature or of a plant which could be added to their work. Furthermore, as technology develops, we will see further advances in internet use for our handsets which would allow us to develop and maintain other educational benefits. We could look into ways of forming interactive lessons, enabling students to access lesson plans and extra studies. We could develop software to offer interactive school quizzes. It would even be possible to build into the profile rewards of free texts for those responding in a certain way or finding certain things out through use of their mobile phones.

 I congratulate the hon. Gentleman on securing the debate and on his excellent speech, to which I have listened intently. Does he agree that it would be in the industry&#039;s interest to address the problem urgently? It need not cost the Government anything and the cost to the industry would be minimal, but the gains&#151;in improving the acceptability of mobile phone use in and around schools&#151;would be immense.

<a name="stpa_452">I fear that at some point there will be an event that will generate public demand for regulation. Already at least one speech has been made in the EU pressing for a directive on the issue. Regulation need not take place if the industry and the Government get together to experiment with a pilot project. It may be possible to develop a model that could be used by schools to achieve the twin objectives of curbing bullying and enhancing education.
</p>

<a name="60131-42_para2">
<a name="stpa_453">Figures demonstrate that a pilot scheme for a year in a controlled area, with six secondary schools and their feeder primary schools, would cost about &#163;1.5 million. I realise that that would be too much money for a local education authority, and I am sure that the Government have not factored it into their education budget, but for the industry as a whole it would be peanuts, and much less than future regulation might cost.

If a model could be developed for use in schools, with interactive lessons and a range of activities involving the use of mobile phones, it is likely that overall income would increase. Such a model pioneered and developed in this country could be exportable and commercially successful. The airtime providers need to think outside their current commercial box and work with the Government to develop such a scheme. Will the Government talk to the providers and others in the field of child protection about developing a model that could be piloted as a matter of urgency?

<p><a name="st_360"><a name="60131-42_spmin0"><b>The Minister for Schools  (Jacqui Smith): </b> 
 I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for West Bromwich, West (Mr. Bailey) on securing the debate and thank him for raising an issue of such importance to children and young people and for the management of our schools. Even before this debate, he showed a keen interest in the issue. He has tabled parliamentary questions and last summer held a meeting with me.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-42_para5">
<a name="stpa_456">We should be in no doubt that bullying has no place at all in our schools. It is an extremely hurtful and frightening experience for children and young people, making them feel trapped and scared to speak out. The lasting negative impact on their self-esteem, education and development must not be underestimated, as we know to tragic effect; on occasions, it has even been a factor in young people taking their own lives.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-42_para6">
<a name="stpa_457">Bullying can take many forms, from ridicule to physical attacks, threats and social exclusion, but consistently at its core is the abuse of power to frighten and intimidate. Bullying limits a child&#039;s potential and prevents us from delivering our objective that every child matters. We need to ensure that our broader education systems deliver the outcomes of staying safe, enjoying and achieving.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-42_para7">
<a name="stpa_458">Bullying should never be tolerated in our schools, no matter what its motivation, no matter how it occurs. Children have to know what is right and wrong, and must understand that there are consequences for crossing the line. That is why we have been clear, especially since 1997, in our approach to bullying. We have made it compulsory for schools to have policies to prevent and tackle bullying. Schools should be prepared to punish bullying, and need to have in place a range of sanctions to tackle all forms of poor behaviour, alongside strategies to help children understand the harm they have caused and to change their behaviour.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-42_para8">
<a name="stpa_459">We have given an unprecedented profile to anti-bullying work in schools. We have stepped up our campaign to get every school in the country to consider how they respond to bullying and to sign up to our anti-bullying charter for action, thus reinforcing our expectation in the White Paper that every school in England will adopt it. We reissued the charter to all schools during last year&#039;s anti-bullying week, and if schools do not sign up, Ministers&#151;and I suspect, even more importantly, parents and pupils&#151;will want to

 I congratulate the hon. Member for West Bromwich, West (Mr. Bailey) on raising what is a very important issue. I am becoming increasingly concerned about bullying in Wellingborough, but does the Minister agree that the schools are doing very well&#151;I congratulate the Government on what they are doing&#151;but that a lot of bullying goes on outside the school gates?
</p>





<p><a name="st_362"><a name="60131-42_spnew3"><b> Jacqui Smith: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman is right. Of course, it is important that action is taken to tackle the bullying that takes place in schools and, as I shall say later, to develop the sort of skills and attitudes in young people that are likely to tackle the bullying that takes place not only in schools, but beyond the school gates. Sometimes, it is necessary for schools to take extremely tough action against those who perpetrate bullying. That is why we have given schools the power, for example, to apply for court-imposed parenting orders to compel the parents of children who bully seriously to attend parenting classes or face fines of up to &#163;1,000. Head teachers have the power permanently to exclude violent and persistently disruptive pupils, including those who bully, and we have made it clear that we would not normally expect an exclusions appeal panel to reinstate them in those circumstances.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-42_para9">
<a name="stpa_460">We have developed a range of ways in which we can support anti-bullying activity in schools, including dedicated support under our national strategies, which have dedicated consultants in behaviour and attendance, and there is the work of the Anti-Bullying Alliance, which we support. We have put more adults than ever into our schools to help children inside and outside the classroom. They include teachers, classroom assistants, learning mentors, Connexions personal advisers, behaviour and education support teams, even police officers, all of whom are available to help tackle bullying.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-42_para10">
<a name="stpa_461">We have provided more than &#163;600,000 in funding to the Anti-Bullying Alliance to enable that organisation of more than 65 leading anti-bullying charities and experts to provide schools and local authorities with expert help to tackle bullying. But of course, other children are often in the best position to tackle bullying, by supporting and standing by their friends. Last year, more than 1 million children signed up to our beat bullying campaign and wore a blue wristband to make a visible commitment to show that they are not prepared to tolerate bullying and that they will stand by their friends.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-42_para11">
<a name="stpa_462">We have provided funding of &#163;600,000 over the past three years to the ChildLine in partnership with schools programme, which works directly with schools to encourage and train young people to establish their own projects to help each other in schools&#151;for example, with anti-bullying and peer-support schemes. In 2004&#150;05, those involved visited 636 schools, working with more than 45,000 children and young people. However, I know from our meeting and the points that my hon. Friend has made tonight that one of his key concerns is the misuse of mobile phones for bullying.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>31 Jan 2006 : Column 295</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-42_para12">
<a name="stpa_463">Of course, mobile phones can be put to positive use, but I shall focus to begin with on the misuse of mobile phones for bullying, which can be particularly unpleasant for those children and young people involved. There is often no let up in the abuse. Nowhere is safe if people are contactable at all hours by mobile phone. As my hon. Friend said, a very large majority of secondary school pupils now own a mobile phone. It is thus possible that the trend will develop and affect more of our children and young people. As my hon. Friend identified, an NCH survey in April 2005 found that 14 per cent. of 11 to 19-year-olds had experienced bullying by text message. I especially share his concern about the recent trend in happy slapping, which is when camera phones are used to record and transmit images of bullying, assault and other violence. Such activities often happen outside school, but nevertheless the images are shared and used to cause disruption in school.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-42_para13">
<a name="stpa_464">The issues regarding the use of mobile phones in schools can be an especially difficult challenge for schools and their leaders to address. That was why after my hon. Friend raised the matter with me, I specifically asked the practitioners group on behaviour to examine it. The group, which was chaired by Sir Alan Steer of Seven Kings high school in Ilford, was composed of heads and teachers with a particular interest and experience in managing pupil behaviour. As my hon. Friend said, the group recognised that mobile phones are now a part of daily life. However, it also noted specific worries about the negative impact that mobile phones can have on school discipline and behaviour.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-42_para14">
<a name="stpa_465">As my hon. Friend said, some schools have already banned mobile phones from their premises and that has been effective for a number of them. Other schools are reluctant to go down that route and, indeed, leaders argue that it would not be appropriate for some schools. Many schools have adopted the compromise of insisting that children keep their phones switched off and in their bags during lessons.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-42_para15">
<a name="stpa_466">As my hon. Friend said, the practitioners group sensibly concluded that all schools need to consider the matter carefully and should be required to have a clear policy on the possession and use of mobile phones on the school site. I plan to discuss that recommendation with key partner organisations at the next meeting of the ministerial stakeholders group on behaviour and attendance, which I chair and which includes representatives from the main teachers&#039; professional associations, Ofsted, local authorities and parent-governor groups.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-42_para16">
<a name="stpa_467">My hon. Friend was also right to draw attention to the contribution that mobile phone companies can make to tackling the problem. I am pleased to report that the major mobile phone networks have been proactive in addressing some of the wider child protection issues around new mobile phone technology. They have become an active part of the Home Secretary&#039;s taskforce on child protection on the internet and recently developed a code of practice for the self-regulation of new forms of content to alleviate some of the concerns and dangers presented by developments in mobile phone technology. They have also been willing to take forward specific projects. For example, over the 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>31 Jan 2006 : Column 296</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>past year, Vodafone has been working with the National Family and Parenting Institute to provide information for parents on mobile phones and how to support their children if they are being bullied in such a way. I have no doubt that the industry will have listened carefully, as I did, to what my hon. Friend said about the possibility of looking for positive ways forward both to tackle the misuse of mobile phones and to consider where and how they might have a positive contribution to make in our schools.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-42_para17">
<a name="stpa_468">There are several specific ideas for restricting the use of mobile phones in schools, although as I think that my hon. Friend realises, none of them offers a clear-cut answer. He referred to the device of cell blocking, which restricts the use of mobile phones in a specific area. While the technology prevents the circulation of photos that are taken by mobile phones in the school, it does not prevent photos of such incidents from being taken in the first place, especially if the incidents happen outside schools. Additionally, it does not prevent images from being circulated outside schools. When we examine the contribution that cell blocking can make, we must consider the use of phones by staff. In some schools, mobile phones are used to allow staff to communicate with one another&#151;for example, to respond to discipline problems. Staff access to their own phones would therefore be affected if we blocked the use of mobile phones in schools. It is possible that blocking technologies could interfere with other wireless communication systems in schools.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-42_para18">
<a name="stpa_469">I strongly believe that while mobile phone companies and school leaders should consider the positive and the negative aspects of the use of mobile phones in schools, the underlying problem of bullying and mobile phones does not stem from the rapidly changing technology. It provides the wherewithal for bullying, but we must address the underlying causes and take firm action if we are to provide a solution to bullying, whether perpetrated by mobile phone or in any other way. Children and young people who bully lack empathy with others and do not understand the impact of their actions. The social and emotional aspects of learning&#151;SEAL&#151;curriculum, which is available to all primary schools, is designed to enable children to develop those skills. A similar approach is now being piloted in secondary schools. As well as its general application to reducing bullying, the SEAL resource has a &quot;Say no to bullying&quot; theme, with ideas for explicit work to reduce bullying. Ofsted has already acknowledged the power of those resources to nip bad behaviour such as bullying in the bud.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-42_para19">
<a name="stpa_470">Pupils need not only to understand the impact of their behaviour but the way in which harm can be multiplied if abuse and bullying is recorded and circulated. They need to know that using telecommunications equipment for a crime, whether to circulate pictures of an assault or an abusive text message, is a crime itself for which they could be charged. That approach was successfully adopted by a secondary school in south London that briefed all its pupils about the issue, and it has reduced the problem significantly.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60131-42_para20">
<a name="stpa_471">In conclusion, I commend my hon. Friend on raising this important issue in the House and on recognising both the abuse of mobile phone technology and its 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>31 Jan 2006 : Column 297</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>benefits. School leaders are beginning to take the issue seriously and, through the ministerial steering group, I will look at what more we can do to support their consideration of the problem. The Government, teachers, governors and fellow pupils need to recognise that while even one child continues to suffer the pain and indignity of being bullied work remains work to be done, which is why we will continue to put in place hard-hitting measures which tackle bullying in our schools, however it is perpetrated.
