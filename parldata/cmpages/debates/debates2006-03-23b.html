 What powers and responsibilities the Office of Fair Trading has in respect of supermarkets; and if he will make a statement. [60671]</p>



<p><a name="st_o0"><a name="60323-01_spmin0"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Trade and Industry  (Mr. Gerry Sutcliffe): </b> 
 The OFT has responsibilities for enforcing UK competition and consumer protection regimes, which include supermarkets. The OFT has announced its decision to consult on a proposed referral of the grocery market to the Competition Commission for a market investigation. The statutory consultation, as required be section 169&nbsp;of the Enterprise Act 2002, will close on 6&nbsp;April, and I trust that hon. Members will take part. The OFT is also responsible for monitoring compliance by certain supermarkets with the supermarket code of practice, which was put in place after an earlier investigation by the Competition Commission.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o1"><a name="60323-01_spnew0"><b> Bob Russell: </b> 
 I thank the Minister for that reply. He will be aware of the recent report by the all-party small shops group, of which I am secretary, which refers to the growing dominance and near-monopoly powers of the four big supermarkets, which mean that there is not so much an un-level playing field as a huge slope. Will the Government take any measures to protect community stores, especially if they believe in sustainable communities?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o2"><a name="60323-01_spnew1"><b> Mr. Sutcliffe: </b> 
 First, I congratulate the hon. Gentleman and his colleagues on the all-party small shops group on the report, which has highlighted the issues and helped the debate along. It is clear that competition issues must be dealt with through the procedures of the Competition Commission and the OFT, and we look forward to that process. However, the Government will continue to monitor and consider issues relating to consumer policy. We have regular 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>23 Mar 2006 : Column 392</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>meetings with the British Retail Consortium and small shops groups, and are concerned about what is going on in that sector.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o3"><a name="60323-01_spnew2"><b> Mr. John McFall  (West Dunbartonshire)</b> 
 (Lab/Co-op): The Minister will know that the powers and responsibilities of the OFT extend to credit cards. The latest report indicates that the late payment ruling is an important landmark. Will he engage with the OFT to ensure that late payment charges are reduced so that the consumer feels the benefit?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o4"><a name="60323-01_spnew3"><b> Mr. Sutcliffe: </b> 
 My right hon. Friend chairs the Treasury Committee, I have had the pleasure of appearing before him, and I am sure that I will have the pleasure again soon. He is right that the issue is causing a great deal of concern, and we are considering the matter with the OFT. All party spokespeople on these issues have met APACS representatives to consider how the banking code applies to those matters.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o5"><a name="60323-01_spnew4"><b> Peter Bottomley  (Worthing, West)</b> 
 (Con): Do the Government have a view as to the share of the grocery market that supermarkets might reach? Does the Minister have a view on how many convenience stores can be owned by supermarkets in a particular town without affecting competition significantly?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o6"><a name="60323-01_spnew5"><b> Mr. Sutcliffe: </b> 
 That is why it is important that politicians and politics are taken out of this matter. The competition authorities must consider it in great detail, which is one of the reasons for the referral. When the OFT completes its consultation process, it will decide whether to refer the matter to the Competition Commission. The share of the grocery market will be one of the issues considered.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o7"><a name="60323-01_spnew6"><b> Mr. Andy Reed  (Loughborough)</b> 
 (Lab/Co-op): Will my hon. Friend ensure that the work done by the Competition Commission on this matter is tied up with his review of Sunday trading liberalisation. If Sunday trading is extended for large superstores, small stores will suffer a further impact. Will he ensure that those two matters are dealt with together?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o8"><a name="60323-01_spnew7"><b> Mr. Sutcliffe: </b> 
 Co-ordination is important, but the two matters are separate. The OFT is considering supermarkets&#039; share of the grocery market. On Sunday trading liberalisation, the Department of Trade and Industry is going through the process of asking stakeholders for their view. A cost-benefit analysis has been undertaken, the detail of which will be fully transparent. We hope to have a stakeholder event in May, and I am already receiving requests for meetings from bodies with a view on the matter.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o9"><a name="60323-01_spnew8"><b> Mr. Mark Prisk  (Hertford and Stortford)</b> 
 (Con): Further to that point, we welcome the OFT&#039;s investigation. As the excellent campaign by the <i>Evening Standard</i> has shown, however, small independent shops are facing multiple threats&#151;certainly from supermarkets, but also from over-regulation, rising crime and the internet. Given the limits of the OFT&#039;s powers, will the Minister accept his responsibility and organise a national debate on the future of retailing, and particularly on the future of small independent shops?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o10"><a name="60323-01_spnew9"><b> Mr. Sutcliffe: </b> 
 As I said, we have that discussion with retail bodies, whether it is the Association of 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>23 Mar 2006 : Column 393</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Convenience Stores or the Rural Shops Alliance. I am pleased about the <i>Evening Standard</i> campaign, which is a step in the right direction. What it says to consumers is, &quot;If you value your small shop, spend money in it.&quot; That is the basis of the campaign. We should not get into supermarket-bashing. Clearly, consumers will vote with their feet&#151;if they feel that they will get a better deal from supermarkets, they will do so. The whole purpose of the OFT investigation will be to consider the future, such as how to deal with planning matters, and to set the scene for what consumer policy should look like in the next 10&nbsp;to 15&nbsp;years.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o11"><a name="60323-01_spnew10"><b> Mr. Prisk: </b> 
 I note the Minister&#039;s cautious words, but he knows as I do that the OFT&#039;s inquiry will take place in two years. Small shops cannot wait that long. Given that, and the excellent evidence produced by the all-party group, will the Minister&#151;as I said&#151;accept his responsibility, and not follow the discussion but lead it? Will he turn his words into actions?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o12"><a name="60323-01_spnew11"><b> Mr. Sutcliffe: </b> 
 I am already doing that. It is clear that there must be a division of the process. The competition issues need to be dealt with by the OFT and the Competition Commission, as provided in the Enterprise Act. However, I have already been meeting representatives of the supermarkets and the Association of Convenience Stores, and I am happy to meet officers of the all-party small shops group to keep the issues under review. The referrals are about specific matters; we need to examine the overall issues relating to the future of shops, and I am continuing to do that.

 There have been many discussions with a wide range of stakeholders, including the nuclear industry, as part of the energy review consultation process, which runs until 14&nbsp;April. Responses to the consultation will be available imminently on the DTI website.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o14"><a name="60323-01_spnew12"><b> Dr. Kumar: </b> 
 What discussions has the Minister had with the nuclear industry, and do they suggest that once the review has been completed and if the Government decide to go further down the nuclear route, we shall have the nuclear scientists and nuclear engineers who can design, build, commission and operate plants for the future, given that since the 1980s there has been a great drop in nuclear research and given the fragmentation of the skills base?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o15"><a name="60323-01_spnew13"><b> Malcolm Wicks: </b> 
 I have had many discussions with the energy industry, including the nuclear industry, about skills and the scientific base. The United Kingdom is a centre of excellence in terms of nuclear science. I recently visited colleagues at Manchester university, for example. There are ideas about establishing a national nuclear laboratory. That is an interesting issue, which is under active consideration.

<p>
<a name="60323-01_para0">
<a name="stpa_o0">The energy review is considering the advantages and the disadvantages of a new generation of nuclear reactors. They are finely balanced: some issues weigh on one side, and some on the other. The Chancellor&#039;s announcement yesterday has no relevance to the decision that we will make in the summer, whether it be yes or no.

 (Lab): Can my hon. Friend confirm that the building of nuclear power stations is already totally permitted, and any company could apply to build one tomorrow? Fears that have been expressed that following the energy review the Government will somehow go nuclear are misplaced, because the regime is already in place. However, it is not financially viable to build nuclear power stations, and that is the problem with them.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o21"><a name="60323-01_spnew19"><b> Malcolm Wicks: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is right. There is nothing to stop someone from applying to build a nuclear power station&#151;but people do not do so. I think that that is because, in practice, the Government need to give a green or a red light. I believe that that has been the case in all nations. As for the economics of nuclear power, we hear different opinions. We ourselves are conducting a cost-benefit analysis of different technologies as part of the review.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o22"><a name="60323-01_spnew20"><b> Tony Baldry  (Banbury)</b> 
 (Con): The Minister must know that we have made absolutely no progress over the past 20&nbsp;years in disposing of nuclear waste. We are no further forward on the question of how we dispose of it than we were when I was doing the job that the Minister is doing today. The Government abandoned the recommendations of the Nirex public inquiry at Sellafield. Can the Minister explain to the House and the country how the Government intend to dispose of nuclear waste? Until they have an answer to that question, any suggestion of future nuclear power stations is simply irresponsible.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o23"><a name="60323-01_spnew21"><b> Malcolm Wicks: </b> 
 Until recently, over several decades, the record of Government and Parliament on the issue was very poor indeed. In fact, I would go so far as to say that it was irresponsible. I do not know whether that included the hon. Gentleman&#039;s term in office. Under this Government, however, we have a two-part strategy. Part 1&nbsp;involves the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority, with a substantial budget and a remit to clear up the waste on the various nuclear sites. It has begun its work. Part 2&nbsp;will follow the recommendations of the 

<br>&nbsp;<br>

That will involve making a judgment about a repository&#151;a long-term or medium-term one&#151;in which to put nuclear waste. So we have a strategy in place&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i> The hon. Gentleman shrugs, but being the Government who find a solution to this very difficult problem is a key test for this Government.

 The minimum wage has made a real difference to around 1&nbsp;million low-paid workers each year, particularly women, who make up two thirds of those benefiting. The latest increases, which we announced on Monday, will benefit 1.3&nbsp;million workers from October 2006. The adult rate will increase by 6&nbsp;per cent. to &#163;5.35&nbsp;per hour.

 I welcome this news from my right hon. Friend. As someone who originally gave oral evidence to the Low Pay Commission, I am filled with pride at what my party has done. When I recently visited Israel, its Labour party asked me whether we could inform it of our progress with the national minimum wage, because it wants to use our success as a model for Israel. Will my right hon. Friend help me to provide that information?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o26"><a name="60323-02_spnew1"><b> Alan Johnson: </b> 
 I certainly can help my hon. Friend. A number of countries are interested in our experience, and it has to be recognised that when we proposed the national minimum wage, there were predictions of doom and gloom not just from the Conservatives, but from the Liberal Democrats, who advocated a regional minimum wage. Incidentally, as recently as 2003, they were saying, in the person of the hon. Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable), that


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_o0">&quot;Making a commitment to a two-year deal, at levels significantly above inflation and at nearly double the current level of average earnings growth, sets a dangerous precedent at a time of almost unparalleled uncertainty&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>




</p>

<p>
<a name="60323-02_para0">
<a name="stpa_o1">Now, all the parties agree with the national minimum wage, but every time that we propose increasing it, we once again get these doom-mongers. The way in which the Low Pay Commission has approached the national minimum wage has led to its success&#151;one that countries such as Israel wish to replicate.

 As someone who served on the Committee that considered the National Minimum Wage Bill, I am delighted with the progress that we have made in recent years. My area was badly affected by low pay, and the regional variation proposed by the Liberal Democrats would have done no good whatsoever. I do have anxieties, however, about unscrupulous employers. How many telephone calls have been made 

<br>&nbsp;<br>

<p><a name="st_o28"><a name="60323-02_spnew3"><b> Alan Johnson: </b> 
 My hon. Friend raises an important point about enforcement. I do not know off the top of my head the number of such telephone calls, but I do know that the vast majority of employers are complying with the national minimum wage. There is, however, an irresponsible minority, and since the introduction of the national minimum wage, there have been 38,000&nbsp;investigations identifying more than &#163;22&nbsp;million in minimum wage arrears. My hon. Friend the Minister for Employment Relations, Consumers and Fair Markets announced last year a new concept of targeted enforcement, whereby we examine those sectors of the economy that our evidence suggests there is a particular problem with. So enforcement is very important, but the encouraging news is that, as I said, the vast majority of employers happily comply with the national minimum wage.

 May I gently chide the hon. Lady? We are not obsessed with the national minimum wage, which is important in tackling the very issue that she raises. As I said, two thirds of those benefiting from the increase in the minimum wage will be women. Since its introduction, that gap to which she refers has closed&#151;by some 4&nbsp;per cent.&#151;but not by nearly enough.

<a name="stpa_o2">My right hon.

 Funnily enough, I agree with the Prime Minister. The hon. Gentleman seems to see a contradiction between those two remarks; I do not think that there is one. Where it is necessary for our industry to compete&#151;and it is competing&#151;is at the high-level, high-skill, high-value-added end of industry, and in that context, the Leader of the House is right. The hon. Gentleman talks down British industry. About two thirds of the new jobs in this country have been in the private sector, and we have seen considerable success in our manufacturing industry, despite the fact that the number of people employed in it has fallen, as it has in every developed country.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o55"><a name="60323-03_spnew13"><b> Mr. Duncan: </b> 
 The climate change levy was supposed to be revenue-neutral on the grounds that it also reduced employers&#039; national insurance contributions. Since its introduction, both NICs and the levy have gone up. If the levy is genuinely to be a tax on climate change, not just a tax on energy use, surely all logic should compel the Government to design a system that constrains emissions, rather than just clobbers manufacturing. In what possible sense does the climate change levy distinguish between those who use energy that does produce emissions and those who use energy that does not?


</p>








<p><a name="st_o56"><a name="60323-03_spnew14"><b> Alun Michael: </b> 
 That sounded like an essay, rather than a supplementary question. The fact is that about 40&nbsp;per cent. of the reduction in carbon has come from precisely the approach that the hon.

It would be good if he pointed to the way in which the Government are supporting manufacturing industry and pointed industries in the direction of the help that is available to them, rather than seeming to want to undermine the success of manufacturing industry in this country.

Companies such as the Carlton brickworks and two glass companies, Potters Ballotini and Redferns, are seriously under threat because of the level of gas prices.

 I do look at gas prices and gas supply every day, but the sun is shining, soon there will be a host of golden daffodils and we will be out of the worst of this winter. The heavy users of gas and electricity, who use energy as part of the manufacturing process, have been hit very hard. For that reason, we are doing many things. We are pushing forward with the argument for market liberalisation in the European Union and I welcome strong reports from two European commissioners about that and the Chancellor&#039;s statement yesterday. Over the next year or so, there will be more infrastructure to bring liquefied natural gas into this country. The Langeled pipeline will bring a great deal of gas from the Norwegian fields.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o60"><a name="60323-04_spnew2"><b> Andrew Selous: </b> 
 Before the Minister waxes too lyrical about daffodils, perhaps he would like to reflect on the fact that many pensioners and low income households use pre-payment meters to pay for their gas. I have had complaints from many of my constituents that they not only pay more for their gas than direct debit customers but have not been able to take advantage of the recent price freeze offered to direct debit customers. Given the recent huge price rises, will the Minister take action to ensure that all customers are treated fairly?

 The issue affecting vulnerable people, particularly the older elderly community, is a subject close to my heart and one in which I am very interested. I could write a book about it&#151;indeed, I did. We need not be complacent, which is why I was so pleased by the Chancellor&#039;s announcement yesterday. We must attack the issue in different ways: first, through income maintenance proposals, such as winter fuel payments, and by targeting pension credit on the vulnerable; secondly, by making sure that the homes of the vulnerable become energy efficient, hence the warm front proposal; and, thirdly, by working with supply companies so that their social tariffs are intelligible to customers. I am talking to the supply companies about whether there could be some rationalisation so that the tariffs could be better explained.

 We are discussing that with the industry and social policy on energy is a key feature of the energy review. As I said earlier, the issue is crucial, but we need to think about the threefold strategy that I instanced. At the moment, the oldest among the elderly are still the most likely to live in the poorest homes for energy efficiency, but it is especially important that through the warm front initiative and the so-called EEC obligation&#151;energy efficiency commitment&#151;on the industry, we ensure that good insulation, draught-proofing and decent boilers and heating systems become a right for the most vulnerable in this country.

Does the Minister accept that &#163;200&nbsp;is totally inadequate, given the recent huge rises in gas prices, and will he press the Chancellor to increase the allowance and extend it to other vulnerable groups in society?

 I accept that there are no grounds for complacency because even in mild winters too many of our elderly people suffer from cold conditions. There is no room for argument about that, so we cannot be complacent and have to move forward. However, I also accept that the Government have done more than any other Government to tackle the problem. The number of people in fuel poverty was reducing until the worldwide increase in fuel prices hit domestic consumers and industry. We are working hard to find out what can be done about that. It is a crucial aspect of the energy review, and it remains a stain on our society that we have not fully tackled the problem. I am pleased about the progress, but there is much more to be done.

<p><a name="st_o81"><a name="60323-05_spmin3"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Trade and Industry  (Meg Munn): </b> 
 We have used positive role models very effectively, notably in science, engineering and technology. I recently spoke at the UK Resource Centre annual conference, which unveiled portraits of six inspirational women in science, engineering and technology, creating a legacy for future generations. 

<br>&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>The centre has also launched the GetSET Women database, providing access to thousands of female role models and mentors.

<p><a name="st_o82"><a name="60323-05_spnew7"><b> Tony Lloyd: </b> 
 I welcome my hon. Friend&#039;s positive comments. Does she agree that a necessary part of providing positive roles for women is getting rid of the negative images of women, especially those portraying women as willing or at least acquiescent victims of domestic violence, violence and rape? Will she make it clear that our Government will have no truck with those who suggest reduced sentences for the perpetrators of violence against women, particularly rape?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o83"><a name="60323-05_spnew8"><b> Meg Munn: </b> 
 The Government are playing an active role in tackling all aspects of violence against women. The information about sentencing was leaked. The guidelines for sentencing have not been issued. They will be produced later this year by an independent body and the Government will respond. The Government take rape extremely seriously. We will do all we can to combat this heinous crime and to ensure appropriate sentences for those who commit it.

 (LD): I am sure the Minister will join me in congratulating the positive women role models in sport, such as Olympic medallist Shelley Rudman, our 56&nbsp;women Commonwealth medallists from the home nations so far, and the five courageous competitors in &quot;The Games&quot; who are women, including my hon. Friend the Member for Falmouth and Camborne (Julia Goldsworthy). Is the Minister concerned that awards worth &#163;3.8&nbsp;million are made to elite male athletes&#151;over 50&nbsp;per cent. more than the &#163;2.3&nbsp;million in awards to women athletes? That entrenches the existing male bias in sporting role models.

 Perhaps we will find out later who that is. The Chancellor announced yet more money yesterday for investment in sport and to encourage everyone to get involved in it. On role models in sport, some of our best athletes at the last Olympic games were women&#151;Dame Kelly Holmes, for example. We will continue to ensure that women get the opportunities that they need to do well in international athletics.

As eight women from the Gateshead young women&#039;s project are observing our proceedings here today, does my hon.

It is enormously important to encourage more women to get involved in politics, so it is crucial that they have every opportunity to come here and are not prevented from doing so by old-fashioned practices that work against them.

 (Con): Is it not the height of hypocrisy for the Government to encourage others to provide a positive role model for women in society when its own splendid Minister for Women and Equality is the only Minister not to receive a ministerial salary?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o91"><a name="60323-05_spnew16"><b> Meg Munn: </b> 
 The hon. Lady is incorrect, as five Ministers do not receive salaries. I am not responsible for ministerial pay, but I wish that I had a pound for every time that I have been asked that question.

<p><a name="st_o92"><a name="60323-05_spnew17"><b> Mrs. Eleanor Laing  (Epping Forest)</b> 
 (Con): I agree with everything that the Minister has said so far, but does she agree that the lack of role models is not the main problem for women in our country today? There have been many role models in this place&#151;Barbara Castle, Shirley Williams and, the greatest of all, Margaret Thatcher&#151;but that is not the key problem. What are the Government going to do about breaking down the barriers that prevent women from following their role models, whether it be in business, science, teaching or other professions? The Chancellor was vague about that matter yesterday.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o93"><a name="60323-05_spnew18"><b> Meg Munn: </b> 
 Committing millions of pounds to help women back into employment&#151;and to woman returners, generally&#151;is not what I would call vague. The hon. Lady will be aware that the women and work commission recently reported and recommended a range of measures to tackle the pay gap and to ensure that women get through the glass ceilings&#151;or off the sticky floors, as we say&#151;and overcome the barriers. The Government are considering all the recommendations carefully and will respond in due course.

<p><a name="st_o97"><a name="60323-06_spnew2"><b> Vera Baird  (Redcar)</b>

He will know that on 4 February there was an incident at Nottingham East Midlands airport in Leicestershire that the CAA has simply dismissed, despite the fact that information about the incident was provided by a member of the air traffic control staff at the airport. Is he also aware that the draft master plan produced by NEMA, as it is called, will double the number of night flights and quadruple the amount of freight flown over my constituency between now and 2010? Will he also invite the CAA urgently to look into the recent incident at Great Glen in my constituency last Saturday, when a large lump of ice fell from an aeroplane on to the car of one of my constituents?
</p>








<p><a name="st_49"><a name="60323-10_spnew9"><b> Mr. Hoon: </b> 
 I know from regular use that Nottingham East Midlands airport is an excellent airport and the expansion that we have seen in recent years has provided a tremendous boost to trade and industry in the east midlands. The hon. and learned Member has raised some serious questions and I know that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Transport will want to deal with them.

 May I back the calls for a debate on the future of the health service and, in particular, the cuts that will be made? My constituents face a &#163;30 million cut in health care, leading to the closure of all the acute facilities at our hospital, including a brand spanking new stroke unit. My constituents want nothing more than a level playing field, so perhaps the debate could be used to explain why the Prime Minister&#039;s constituency, Sedgefield, gets &#163;1,210 per head for health care, but my constituents get &#163;960. That is a shortfall of &#163;250 per head and could have kept some of those departments open. We want a level playing field, not rhetoric from the Leader of the House.
</p>








<p><a name="st_51"><a name="60323-10_spnew11"><b> Mr. Hoon: </b> 
 Again, I have relayed to the House on several previous occasions the fact that the deficits in the health service are limited to a relatively small number of organisations. Some 50 per cent. of the deficits were incurred by just over 6 per cent. of health service bodies. I do not wish to minimise the difficulties that some health service organisations have had in managing their budgets, but I hope that the hon. Gentleman will join me 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>23 Mar 2006 : Column 424</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>in recognising that it is important that budgets are managed so that our constituents can have confidence that the money that they pay in taxes to provide excellent health care is used properly. On the specific issue of how those issues are calculated, he knows full well that the formula for funding depends on an assessment of the degree of deprivation and health problems in particular areas. It is right that those calculations should be made.

 I know that the Chairman of the Health Committee is concerned to try to find a way to establish an appropriate consideration, not so much of the time limit itself but of the underlying science affecting it. That would be a sensible way forward and, if the hon. Gentleman wishes to do so, he could write to the Chairman and urge him to conduct an inquiry by the Select Committee.

On four occasions that gentleman has been admitted to hospital and four times his operation has been cancelled for non-clinical reasons. I urge the Leader of the House to have a debate in Government time on the health service so that the Secretary of State for Health has to reply to the debate.

<p><a name="st_55"><a name="60323-10_spnew15"><b> Mr. Hoon: </b> 
 Everyone takes individual cases seriously, and it is important that they are resolved satisfactorily. However, it is equally important&#151;as I am sure the hon. Gentleman recognises&#151;that we should not treat individual examples of particular problems as somehow symptomatic of alleged widespread difficulties in the health service. The experience of right hon. and hon. Members across the country is of a remarkable improvement in the operation of the health service, and a significant reduction in waiting times. We need to continue and expand those reductions, but most Members of Parliament are delighted with the improvements that the Government have brought about in the health service.

 West Yorkshire police have recently announced that they are having to close the public help desk at several police stations, including two in my constituency at Shipley and Bingley. I am sure that the Leader of the House understands how important public access to local police stations is in reassuring people about the issue of crime.

<p><a name="st_59"><a name="60323-11_spnew1"><b> Mr. Hoon: </b> 
 It is of course vital that the public should have access to and confidence in their local police force, which is why the Government have spent so much extra money on providing more police officers and more community support officers in every part of the country, ensuring that the police are accessible to the local community in a way that has never been possible before.

<a name="time_1">
<a name="60323-11_time0"><h5>12.19&nbsp;pm</h5>




<p><a name="st_62"><a name="60323-11_spmin0"><b>The Minister of State, Ministry of Defence  (Mr. Adam Ingram): </b> 
 With permission, Mr. Deputy Speaker, I would like to make a statement about the Territorial Army, but before I do so I shall mention the situation regarding Mr. Kember. As a Defence Minister, I am pleased to confirm the involvement of British forces in the multinational rescue operation of Norman Kember. The rescue was the result of weeks of careful work and preparation and I pay sincere tribute to the professionalism of the British armed forces. To ensure that we do not compromise future operations, it is not appropriate to go into any detail about the operation or to confirm the troops involved. However, I stress how proud I am of the achievement of those involved in the rescue, which I know will be shared throughout the House.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60323-11_para0">
<a name="stpa_44">For many months, the TA has been consulted widely about the changes we should make better to integrate it into future Army structures, which, I remind the House, we announced in November 2004. As a result, much of what I have to say will be of no surprise to TA units. Their views, at all levels, have been sought and their input has helped to define the review outcomes. I am grateful for their comprehensive engagement in that process.I would also like to inform the House that I have written today to all Members whose constituency TA units are affected by the rebalancing, with details of the changes to those units. I am also placing details of all the changes in the Library.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60323-11_para1">
<a name="stpa_45">The size of the Territorial Army will not be changed. It will remain at an authorised strength of 42,000, including a university officer training corps of 3,500. Within that unaltered total, the changes we introduce will reflect the modern-day role of the TA as an integral part of our defence posture.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60323-11_para2">
<a name="stpa_46">The great change in the TA, which came about as a result of the reforms of the late 1990s, was to move it away from its cold war role. In its place, a mobilisation culture was introduced, such that members of the TA would expect in future to be mobilised and deployed on a range of operations in support of our defence policy overseas, rather than be held in reserve for defence against an attack on western Europe. Since then, the reserves generally, and the Territorial Army in particular, have made a major contribution to operations overseas&#151;for example, we have deployed about 12,000&nbsp;in Iraq since 2003. Once again, they have in a real sense earned their spurs. I pay tribute to their ability to adapt, in just a few years, to the changing and very demanding circumstances of the new century, and I publicly acknowledge their appreciable skills and courage.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60323-11_para3">
<a name="stpa_47">The operational experience gained from extensive use of the TA has allowed us to apply lessons learned in respect of its most effective employment. First, we are assigning to the TA its proper role in the more demanding contingencies for which it might be required to deploy. Each TA unit will be given a clear role to augment the regular order of battle for large-scale operations&#151;those on a scale similar to the campaigns in the Gulf in 1990&nbsp;and in Iraq in 2003. That is the role for which the TA will train.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>23 Mar 2006 : Column 427</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60323-11_para4">
<a name="stpa_48">Secondly, although we will structure the TA for larger-scale operations, we will continue to support individual members of the TA who want to volunteer for tours on operations of a lesser scale. Many soldiers indicate that they are very keen to deploy on such operations, and the experience they gain is invaluable. At the same time, we need to regulate the use of the TA so that unnecessary strains are not put on individual volunteers, their families or employers, so we will aim to limit the use of reserves on operations to one year in every five, unless individuals volunteer for more. Although that will be our aim, the legal position is that they can be called out once in every three years.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60323-11_para5">
<a name="stpa_49">Thirdly, in designing our TA units, we will take account of the realities of TA service. There will always be some volunteers who are still going through their basic training, and others who for good reasons are not available for mobilisation when a particular crisis occurs. We have, therefore, made allowance in our unit structures for both a training and a mobilisation margin, so that TA units are more robustly structured to deliver the trained manpower needed for operations.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60323-11_para6">
<a name="stpa_50">Fourthly, we will strengthen the affiliation of TA units to the regular units with which they are likely to operate, thus improving mutual understanding and operational capability. Closer affiliation to regular units for training purposes will also increase joint TA and regular training, thereby delivering more enjoyable, relevant and challenging training to the Territorial Army.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60323-11_para7">
<a name="stpa_51">Finally, we will strengthen the support we give TA units, with about 240&nbsp;permanent staff recruited to provide administration, welfare, training and employer support.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60323-11_para8">
<a name="stpa_52">The organisational changes of TA rebalancing will include strengthening the Royal Engineer element of the TA, the establishment of which will increase by about 1,600, as well as increases to the TA yeomanry, or Royal Armoured Corps, and the Army Air Corps. The following new TA units will be formed: an Army Air Corps regiment to support the Apache attack helicopter regiments in the Regular Army, to be based in Bury St Edmunds; and a new Royal Engineer regiment&#151;72&nbsp;Engineer Regiment Volunteers&#151;will have its headquarters in Gateshead, with a re-roled Parachute Engineer squadron in Wakefield, and will take under command squadrons in Newcastle and Sheffield. In addition, five new engineer squadrons will be raised in Kinloss, Cumbernauld, Failsworth, Northampton and Northern Ireland, as well as a new TA military intelligence battalion, which will have five companies based across England and Scotland. A military provost staff company will be formed in Colchester, which will be a new capability for the TA and will provide deployable expertise to assist and advise in the custody of detainees. A complete new transport regiment will be raised in the south-west, based in Plymouth, with squadrons in Truro, Dorchester and Poole.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60323-11_para9">
<a name="stpa_53">As we have already announced, the TA infantry will be reduced by about 900&nbsp;posts, and reorganised to form 14&nbsp;TA infantry battalions as an integral part of the future infantry structure. We will now revert to the practice of naming TA battalions after the regular regiments of which they will form a part, rather than after the regions in which they are based. As fewer 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>23 Mar 2006 : Column 428</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>volunteers will be required as signallers, logisticians and combat medical staff, there will also be reductions in a number of other arms and services.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60323-11_para10">
<a name="stpa_54">The changes I have outlined will happen not overnight, but over a number of years. For many volunteers, little will change at all. Those whose units are likely to change will, of course, be given every opportunity to discuss, understand and make an informed decision on their own future. The vast majority will, I am sure, continue to be active members of the TA.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60323-11_para11">
<a name="stpa_55">Territorial Army volunteers have shown over the past century that they are extremely adaptable to the requirements of national security. The changes I have announced today will ensure that the TA continues to be a force for good in dealing with the challenges of the next century, as an integral part of our land forces. I commend them to the House.

<p><a name="st_63"><a name="60323-12_spnew0"><b> Mr. Gerald Howarth  (Aldershot) (Con):</b> 
 First, I thank the Minister for providing me with an advance copy of the statement. I join him in congratulating our armed forces on the magnificent job that it appears they have yet again carried out in Iraq, in the release of Mr. Norman Kember, which will be welcomed not only on both sides of the House but throughout the land and, I hope, throughout the whole free world. It follows the magnificent operation undertaken in September 2005&nbsp;when British forces were instrumental in releasing two of our armed forces who were being held by the Iraqi police in Basra. As the Minister said, such operations illustrate the extraordinary professionalism of Her Majesty&#039;s armed forces, in which the whole House can take enormous pride.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60323-12_para0">
<a name="stpa_56">I associate the Opposition with the tributes paid to the Territorial Army by the Minister. Members of the TA do an outstanding job and it is genuinely debatable whether the Government would have been able to carry out their operations in Iraq without the support given by members of the TA&#151;not only in the specialist skills which they bring, but in their making up the shortfall in the Regular Army caused by the reduction in numbers under the Government.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60323-12_para1">
<a name="stpa_57">As the Minister said, since we became involved in Iraq about 12,580&nbsp;TA soldiers have been mobilised to plug the gaps. That number includes two extremely distinguished members of the reserve forces, my hon. and gallant Friends the Members for Westbury (Dr. Murrison) and for New Forest, West (Mr. Swayne), who have certainly played their part in the support of their country.


</p>

<p>
<a name="60323-12_para2">
<a name="stpa_58">I also think that we should pay tribute to the employers, without whose support and co-operation in releasing their employees for deployment the TA could not operate. In particular, we should acknowledge the special contribution of small businesses, which often have to make great sacrifices when members of their staff are deployed.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60323-12_para3">
<a name="stpa_59">In a written answer of the 22&nbsp;February, the Minister stated that, at 1&nbsp;December 2005, the total strength of the TA was 37,430, against an establishment of 41,610. Yet that figure was misleading, as it included 5,750&nbsp;members of the Officer Training Corps. The truth is that the actual number of TA personnel stands at around 31,680, making the actual shortfall in the establishment, leaving 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>23 Mar 2006 : Column 429</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>out the OTC, about 6,500. Furthermore, according to a recent report in <i>The Herald&#151;</i>a newspaper with which the Minister will be more than familiar&#151;it is alleged that only a third of the TA is ready for operations.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60323-12_para4">
<a name="stpa_60">More than 13,500&nbsp;men and women have left the TA since the invasion of Iraq in 2003&#151;over 6,000&nbsp;have left in the past year alone. That translates to a rate of about 600&nbsp;people a month leaving the TA. Previously, about 150&nbsp;people a month left. The TA&#039;s manning levels are now at some of the lowest figures since it was formed in 1906, yet the rate of deployments is higher than at any time in recent years.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60323-12_para5">
<a name="stpa_61">Across our armed forces, both regular and reserve personnel are being asked to do more with less. The Minister has presented the restructuring today as a means of increasing the TA&#039;s deployability and, of course, we welcome any increase in the utility of those forces. We particularly welcome the return to affiliating TA units to their regular counterparts&#151;something that is more than symbolic, as it will have practical operational consequences. We also welcome the creation of an Army Air Corps reserve regiment to support the Apache attack helicopter. The Army has been particularly adept in using air reserves.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60323-12_para6">
<a name="stpa_62">Although we also welcome some of the additional units proposed by the Government, we cannot understand the proposal to reduce some of the specialist units, such as medical staff. In the annual report for last year, the Ministry of Defence stated that there were areas of &quot;critical shortage&quot;, and the latest available figures indicate that, against an establishment of 6,880, there were only 4,080&nbsp;medics. Furthermore, we fail to understand why the infantry is to lose 900&nbsp;TA personnel.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60323-12_para7">
<a name="stpa_63">May I pose a few specific questions to the Minister? First, there is no mention in the statement of the civil contingency reserves. What has the Minister to say about the TA&#039;s role in countering terrorism at home and being available to deal with other civil emergencies?
</p>

<p>
<a name="60323-12_para8">
<a name="stpa_64">Secondly, what significance should we attach to the mobilisation of a new combat legal force, something that sounds distinctly menacing, the form of a military provost staff company? Perhaps the Minister could tell us whether part of its role will be to root out the likes of Mr. Phil Shiner and others who seek to undermine the work that is carried out by armed forces. If so, we would welcome that new legal battalion to act in support of our regular and TA forces.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60323-12_para9">
<a name="stpa_65">Thirdly, what can the Minister tell us about the haemorrhaging of TA members that I describe and the need to recruit, particularly given the strain that that places on employers? He mentions the objective that TA personnel should not be called up for further duty within five years. Can he tell us whether he expects to able to live within that or whether he will rely on the three-year legal requirement.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60323-12_para10">
<a name="stpa_66">Fourthly, can he tell us what proposals he has to maintain a TA presence in the Orkney and Shetland islands? People there are keen for that presence to be maintained, so I hope that he can give us something positive on that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60323-12_para11">
<a name="stpa_67">Although some welcome changes have been announced today, we should be under no illusion that the Government are relying too heavily on the TA as a

<br>&nbsp;<br>substitute for an adequate standing army. Today&#039;s announcement illustrates that fundamental. Rather than a rebalancing, this looks like a further web of cuts.
</p>








<p><a name="st_64"><a name="60323-12_spnew1"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman&#039;s reply was like the curate&#039;s egg in that he welcomed some parts of the statement, but I appreciate his opening comments in which he echoed some of what I said. Like him, I pay tribute to the employers&#151;small businesses and others&#151;who perhaps take the greatest strain in all this if any of their employees are called up, and they willingly co-operate with us in the main.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60323-12_para12">
<a name="stpa_68">A bit of history would not go amiss. Let us remember that the TA was halved in the 1990s.

 The cold war ended.
</p>








<p><a name="st_66"><a name="60323-12_spnew3"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 Given the end of the cold war, we considered what the post-cold war structure should be, as part of the strategic defence review. Of course, this further rebalancing will take account of the new Army structures and infantry structures. We are mirroring the restructuring, which involves recognising where the pinch points and the critical shortfalls occur. As the hon. Gentleman will be aware, we are re-roling about 3,000&nbsp;Regular Army posts to try to make good that problem, and the same applies across the TA. That is why the rebalancing is taking place. It will give those forces greater usability and greater impact, and therefore greater influence over what we seek to do in defence of the national interest.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60323-12_para13">
<a name="stpa_69">The civil contingency reaction force was not mentioned because it will remain unchanged. That role continues.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60323-12_para14">
<a name="stpa_70">The hon. Gentleman asked about harmony, and I said that it was an aim, but a legal requirement is involved. I do not know how that will play out, because it depends on tempo and usage. We will seek, as best we can, to achieve the higher harmony guidelines, because we value our people, but my experience of the TA is that a lot of them want to serve anyway, and they want to do so frequently.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60323-12_para15">
<a name="stpa_71">The hon. Gentleman asked about Orkney and Shetland. No change is planned on Orkney, but we are considering the possibility of closing the very small unit on Shetland. We are talking, from memory, about only 19&nbsp;TA members, with three support staff. Although it does not quite fit the neat rebalancing, I decided that is appropriate to keep the Shetland unit. Over time, it will be re-roled to match the engineer unit on Orkney. We will deal sensitively with those who are currently in the TA. We have decided to retain the unit. I am conscious of the fact that we recently decided to close Saxa Vord on Shetland. If the unit had closed, it would have meant that there was a bit of the United Kingdom where the military was not flying the Union flag. I did not think that such a decision would be appropriate, given the remoteness of the island.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60323-12_para16">
<a name="stpa_72">The hon. Gentleman asked about retention and recruitment. Of course, retention is clearly an issue. Some of the figures could be occasioned by the fact that, once people have completed their deployments and had their moment of contribution and excitement, some of them will probably leave, perhaps because they are under employment pressure. We need to get a better

<b>23 Mar 2006 : Column 431</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>handle on all that&#151;a better understanding of it&#151;but against a very significant decline in recruitment in the early post-SDR period, it is now increasing. That is encouraging, and we must seek to maintain all that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60323-12_para17">
<a name="stpa_73">As at 1&nbsp;January 2006, there were 297&nbsp;more recruits than in January 2005&#151;a 1&nbsp;per cent. increase. As at 1&nbsp;February 2006, there were 323&nbsp;more recruits than at 1&nbsp;February 2005&#151;again, a 1&nbsp;per cent. increase. That looks like an upward trend, but we must maintain that. Again, I make the point that we have consulted extensively on that among the TA, and the rebalancing will give greater focus and an even higher level of commitment, if that is possible, in the way in which the TA conducts itself, because it will have all the new arrangements, with a more coherent structure.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60323-12_para18">
<a name="stpa_74">On medical staff, there is no question that we have issues in relation to them. That is one of the critical points, and the NHS also suffers from it in trying to recruit. Our judgment is to get the numbers to a realistic size, but I mention history again: medical support to the Army was effectively undermined under the last Tory Administration.

 Well, it is 10&nbsp;years on, and we are recovering very significantly from the legacy that we inherited. We are growing the regular support and the number of the TA medical staff that we can recruit and retain is based on a much more realistic assessment of what the market can bear.

 The Minister is right to refer to the professionalism, adaptability, courage and tenacity of the TA, but recruitment and retention is still a key concern and the hon. Member for Aldershot (Mr. Howarth) is right to pay tribute to the tolerance of small businesses, in particular, in that regard. Those who leave the TA refer to three key things. First, they feel that they are not sufficiently valued. That is not true in the House, but it is certainly true elsewhere. Secondly, they do not always get access to the health care that they need when returning from foreign assignments. It is good news that the Minister has announced that they will be vulnerable to that only one year in five. The third problem is that many of them find that they have been sacked while they have been abroad. Is there anything more that he can do, among the welcome list of initiatives that he announced today, to reduce the chances of that happening so that those people are not deterred from serving their country in Iraq and elsewhere, where I understand that they have carried 10&nbsp;per cent. of the load in the past three years?

 That is an issue. My hon. Friend is aware of the extensive support mechanisms that we have put in place to assist those in the TA. I am not making any announcements on that today, but I hope that a message comes out of the statement about the way in which we will take things forward and the important element of the additional staff who will be employed to work alongside our own people on welfare and administration and also employers, which will allow them to create a greater awareness of the vitality and importance of the TA.

There could well be occasions when their own employees turned out to save the very businesses on which they depend. We can put over strong messages on this issue. Assistance from Members would be greatly appreciated&#151;I know that my hon. Friend provides that&#151;to get the message over about the importance, vitality and necessity of the TA.

 I welcome the liberation of Norman Kember and his associates and pay tribute to the professionalism and skill of those whose actions led to that. I thank the Minister for his statement, which should be welcomed as a broadly sensible measure to bring about the restructuring of the TA in line with the future Army structure plans. There was an implicit recognition by the Minister, at least of stretch&#151;even if not of overstretch&#151;on the part of the TA. It is right that the House should pay tribute to the work of the TA, particularly in light of the additional burden that it has carried in recent years.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60323-13_para0">
<a name="stpa_75">We have already had exchanges about the recruitment and, in particular, retention difficulties in the TA during the past couple of years, when the duties on them have been much more onerous. Is the Minister confident that it will be possible to preserve the current levels in the TA, as he said today is his intention, or will further over-tasking make the problems even worse? Can the changes that he has talked about be achieved, given the recruitment and retention problems? What action is being taken to tackle the shortfall, which, however one calculates it, must, at the very least, be 4,000&nbsp;or so?
</p>

<p>
<a name="60323-13_para1">
<a name="stpa_76">It is welcome that the statement says that reserves will be deployed only one year in every five, or more if they volunteer. The Minister reminds us that the legal situation is that they can be called up one year in every three. Will he undertake to make regular reports to the House about the regularity of deployment so that we can monitor that?
</p>

<p>
<a name="60323-13_para2">
<a name="stpa_77">I did not quite follow the Minister&#039;s reply to the hon. Member for Aldershot (Mr. Howarth) about medical staff. We all understand that there has been a shortage of medical staff, but the Minister&#039;s statement and his reply seemed to suggest that fewer staff would be required in the future. I do not quite understand how that can be.

<a name="60323-13_para3">
<a name="stpa_78">Finally, on the military footprint&#151;the geographical spread of the TA units&#151;I noted with interest where the new units will be based. I have to confess that I have struggled fully to assimilate the significance of the tables because they seem to be colour-coded, but were faxed in black and white. In the fullness of time, no doubt we will get a better impression. It is essential that there remains the widest possible military footprint from the TA so that as many parts of the country as possible are supporting and engaged in the work of the armed forces.

<a name="60323-13_para4">
<a name="stpa_79">The core of the key points that the hon. Gentleman raised was about whether we were certain, or satisfied to some degree, that what we announced would be delivered. If we did not restructure or rebalance, we would have a problem, because there would be an incoherence in relation to what we are now demanding in terms of the future infantry structure and Army structure, and the TA would feel somehow second class. Over recent years, it has become obvious that that mood&#151;if it ever existed in parts of our forces&#151;does not exist any more. On my visits, it constantly strikes me, that, very early on in operational theatres, people stop asking others whether they are TA because it is impossible to tell. They are very much an integrated part&#151;and even more so with the rebalancing.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60323-13_para5">
<a name="stpa_80">I gave the improvement in recruitment. We have got to make sure that that is continued. There can be no guarantee on that. We are competing in a very difficult environment, because of high employment and other opportunities, and we will continue to do so. However, there is the fact that we are bringing the TA more into the Regular Army structure and that there will be single command at the top end in relation to how we recruit both for the Regular Army and the TA. Someone who expresses an interest in joining the forces, but may not want to join the regulars would immediately be notified of their opportunities in the TA and vice versa. That co-ordinated approach should help recruitment.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60323-13_para6">
<a name="stpa_81">I was not saying that there was less need for medical staff. I was saying that medical support&#151;the Defence Medical Services&#151;was dramatically cut during the last Tory Administration. We are recovering from that legacy. It takes time to build things up. We are dealing with a massive increase in employment in the NHS, which relates to people going into the medical services. The size of the medical corps in the TA will match the real position. There is no point in having a large establishment that we will not need in a realistic assessment. Increasingly, there is a demand, but increasingly it will be met from the regulars, supplemented by the TA. I am talking about balancing those resources.

 I am fully conscious of that work and witnessed during the early stages of Telic 1&#151;just after the war fighting had ceased&#151;the role playing by TA personnel in the reopening of Umm Qasr. I also witnessed it in Afghanistan. Water engineers who were being deployed for a different purpose suddenly realised that they had specific expertise, so some remained to work on Department for International Development and non-governmental organisation projects and made a valuable contribution.

<a name="stpa_84">Of course, if people have a specific skill but joined the TA to serve in a different role, we cannot instruct them to use that civilian skill.

 The Minister entitled his short statement &quot;TA Rebalancing&quot;. Like my hon. Friend the Member for Aldershot (Mr. Howarth), I welcome it in broad terms. However, we should note that everyone accepts that, under the 1998&nbsp;strategic defence review, when the Secretary of State was Minister for the Armed Forces, the TA was cut to fund the Regular Army changes&#151;that is a fact. I welcome the rebalancing. Will we see a scale of weapons and equipment in the new units that is equivalent to that of regular units? Given the increasing role of the TA, especially on operations, what opportunities will there be for TA officers to command units on operations?

They will use that equipment because they would otherwise be unable to fulfil their role. I do not expect that that will mean that TA units will have all the kit in their own establishments, but they will be able to draw upon it so that there can be effective training.

<p><a name="st_81"><a name="60323-14_spnew3"><b> Mr. Julian Brazier  (Canterbury) (Con):</b> 
 The Government have done quite well over the past few years by ensuring that most deployments by Territorials have been formed sub-units commanded by Territorials. The Minister referred to individuals in his statement, so will he make it clear that the Government will continue to resist the demands of large elements of the Regular Army that the TA becomes a part-time personnel agency from which individuals, rather than formed sub-units, are drawn? I also thank the Minister for our meeting of a few weeks ago. I look forward to the detailed blueprint on the infantry and hope that the structure will encourage the retention, as well as recruitment, of good-quality people and, as such, look as much like a regular battalion as possible.

<p>
<a name="60323-14_para3">
<a name="stpa_87">The whole drive behind what we are doing is to ensure that the TA is integrated in the regular forces. We want to ensure that it is compatible, deliverable and able to achieve its objectives. It would thus be wholly wrong to see it as something that can be dipped in and out of. There will be training for a specific role in major operations because that is the right way of doing things. At any point in time, a third of the TA will be under training and two thirds will be trained&#151;that is the constant cycle that is likely to apply. As I said earlier, it is impossible to differentiate between TA personnel and regulars in the main, whether they are in the infantry or any of the other skilled trades. That reality will grow over the months and years ahead. I do not think that the hon. Gentleman&#039;s fear will be realised. I do not think that that is what the Regular Army wants, and I am certain that the TA would not allow itself to be misused in such a way.

 I welcome the news that the Minister brings about the Lerwick unit. He is right to say that it would be unacceptable for the Ministry of Defence not to have any presence in Shetland, and that view is widely held there. However, he will be aware that this is the second time in recent years when question marks have been raised over the future of the Lerwick unit. I think that that stems from the fact that there are specific recruitment challenges because of both the geography and local economic circumstances. If we are to have a strong future for the TA in Lerwick, special measures will need to be taken to entrench the unit&#039;s position. Will special consideration be given to the way in which we manage the unit?

 Every time the Minister makes a statement in the Chamber about the TA, it is accompanied somewhere, no matter how positive it is, by another salami slice and cut to the overall size of the TA. Today is no exception, because we read on page 3&nbsp;of the statement that we are to lose 900&nbsp;posts in the Territorial Army. I fully agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Aldershot (Mr. Howarth) that it is misleading to include members of the Officer Training Corps and the Army Air Corps in the overall figures for the reserve, so will the Minister please correct that?

We are trying to grow numbers. I accept that the TA is under strength, as is the Regular Army. It has ever been thus&#151;certainly, it has been the case for many decades. By rebalancing numbers and trying to integrate the TA with our regular forces we will give people who serve in the TA a new future and improve recruitment. The hon. Gentleman made a point about the setting up of the military provost staff company to deal with detainees. This is an issue, no matter where we are. If we go into a hostile environment we must have a legal construct for the way in which we deal with the individuals whom we apprehend. Clearly, that will be the case in Afghanistan. It is the case in Iraq, as it is in Sierra Leone, the Balkans and elsewhere. There are different memorandums of understanding and host country arrangements, and we need people who are well trained and capable of living within that legal construct and who understand it well.

The Chancellor has relied on his wise advice for many years, so I welcome them both to the fold. We are delighted that they are our comrades in arms, as they believe in sharing the proceeds of growth. Page 259&nbsp;of the Red Book deals with the proportion of GDP to expenditure in successive years. I was not surprised to learn, given the buffers into which the Chancellor&#039;s fiscal policies have run, that he intends that the proportion of spending compared with GDP should fall in successive years. That is called the &quot;sharing the proceeds of growth&quot; thesis. I am delighted that the hon. Gentleman and the Chancellor now agree with us that that is a necessity.

 My hon. Friend is right. During the election I recall saying to various journalists at various press conferences that there was a difference between the proposals that we made for a permanent reduction in council tax for the pensioners most affected by it, and the Chancellor&#039;s proposals, which we said would last only one year. I recall a journalist telling me&#151;I do not know whether accurately&#151;that the Government strenuously denied that that was a one-off move; it merely did not happen to be figured in the Red Book. I remember being told by one journalist that we were naive if we thought that that would be the effect, as he had received personal assurances from somebody&#151;I do not know from whom.

<a name="stpa_106">The Secretary of State for Transport is probably also a temporary occupant of that office. I note that the Chancellor thinks highly of him, and no doubt he will in due course offer us his own Budget, but for the time being he is constrained to dealing with transport, an important role which he fulfils with distinction. He is aware that the Government promised to reduce road congestion below 2000&nbsp;levels by 2010. <i>[Interruption.]</i> The Chancellor mutters. He is astonished that I should ever attribute to an opponent any nobility or propriety, but I do not believe that politics has to consist of being nasty about people. I tried to be nice about the Chancellor for some years, without the slightest effect on his consciousness. It works rather better with some of his colleagues, who are more inclined to an emollient view of life. The nation will see that in due course.

<br>&nbsp;<br>and genuinely desired effects? The nation and the House have not yet considered that question sufficiently. That process is beginning today, and I hope that we will have ample time over the next three or four years to examine that question in detail.

<p>
<a name="60323-16_para13">
<a name="stpa_110">Let me advance a proposition to explain that bizarre phenomenon. This Government genuinely desire good results, and they want them quickly, which is why they are inclined to do something to achieve them quickly. However, they do not have any deep understanding of the reaction that is likely to set in on the part of society from the action of government. Action meets reaction, and reaction causes the action to be invalid and useless. It is above all the Chancellor who is the architect of that view of life, and he has a basically static view of society. He desires a good result and thinks that society will more or less stay in the same position, except that anything that he does will bring about a determinate effect. Unfortunately, society does not work like that, and I shall give some examples.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60323-16_para14">
<a name="stpa_111">I have already referred to means-testing, and the fact is that the Chancellor is the architect of the vast increase in means-testing. He has increased means-testing because he genuinely wants to reduce poverty&#151;he has a moral passion in that respect, and I pay tribute to it. On both sides of the House, there is a shared desire to see poverty reduced in this country, but the problem is that there has been a reaction. The extension of means-testing has resulted in a disincentive to save, which has been a principal cause, along with the Chancellor&#039;s raid on pension funds and many other things, of the destruction of savings in this country. The result of the lack of saving has, alas, been poverty beckoning for many people who should have been rescued from it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60323-16_para15">
<a name="stpa_112">If that were one isolated example, it would be important and interesting, but it would not be a pattern, but it is not one example, and it is part of a pattern. Let us consider the Secretary of State who rejoices in the title of Deputy Prime Minister. He, too, has an admirable ambition, which is again due to the Chancellor and which is again right, that there should be more homes in this country. We all share the view that we should have more homes in this country, because we need more homes in this country&#151;many of my constituents cannot afford to buy a home. Unfortunately, however, because the desired result had to be achieved immediately without careful thought about reactions, the contractors who built those houses did not use low-carbon building techniques, because there was no incentive to do so. The result is rising carbon emissions, which directly contradicts the efforts that the Chancellor mentioned in his Budget and that the Government say that they are making to reduce carbon emissions.

Despite the vast wall of money, people who are trying to run hospitals are encountering difficulties, because they must constantly chase targets under a system by which they get directive after directive after directive.

I well remember those happy days in Millbank in 2001, when the right hon. Member for West Dorset (Mr. Letwin), having announced his plan to cut &#163;20&nbsp;billion of expenditure, then went missing, only to reappear a few days later in a field dressed in a sheet&#151;I think that he was meant to be a Roman emperor. Of course we also remember him in 2005, when he masterminded the plan to cut &#163;35&nbsp;billion from public expenditure, with similarly disastrous results for the Conservatives. I suspect that one or two of his colleagues wished that he had gone missing in that election as well.

<p>
<a name="60323-17_para4">
<a name="stpa_117">Having heard the second speech on the Budget from Conservative Front Benchers, I am struck by just how light they have been on Conservative party policy. As the Chancellor said yesterday, if we consider the big issues that face this country and the choices that we have to make to see what is best in our long-term interests, whether on education, transport, fairness, taking children out of poverty or dealing with world poverty, the Conservatives have had absolutely nothing to say.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60323-17_para5">
<a name="stpa_118">The interesting thing about the brief remarks of the right hon. Member for West Dorset&#151;who is after all in charge of making Conservative party policy, which gives Labour Members some comfort&#151;is that he made the case against any Government intervention at all. It was straight out of the book of the Republican party in the United States in the early part of this decade&#151;arguing that Governments cannot make any difference. We believe that whether in education or transport, of course the efforts of individuals make a difference, but it is absolute nonsense to argue that Government cannot make any difference or that it does not matter how much or how little one spends.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60323-17_para6">
<a name="stpa_119">The right hon. Gentleman eloquently demonstrated just how far to the right the Conservative party remains, despite everything that its leader has tried to pretend. It is clear that the dominant view in the Conservative party is now that the state&#151;the Government&#151;can play no part at all, and individuals should be left on their own, instead of the belief, which we hold, that Government can make a difference to the opportunities for people in this country, as we have shown by taking children out of poverty and improving their chances at school&#151;and yes, by putting money into the health service, which has dramatically cut waiting lists. People had to wait 18&nbsp;months when the Conservatives were in power; by 2008&nbsp;that will come down to just 18&nbsp;weeks.

<p><a name="st_141"><a name="60323-18_spnew0"><b> Mr. Graham Stuart: </b> 
 The right hon. Gentleman&#039;s description of Conservative party policy is a total travesty. What we heard in the excellent exposition by my right hon. Friend the Member for West Dorset (Mr. Letwin) is that the Conservative party is now the party of our national health service. <i>[Laughter.]</i> Labour Members may laugh, but during the 1990s, under the Conservatives, productivity in the health service increased year after year. Since Labour came to power, where has the money gone? Where has it been wasted by this Chancellor? It has gone in falling productivity, as shown on page 22&nbsp;of the booklet &quot;Productivity in the UK 6&quot;, which was produced yesterday.
</p>








<p><a name="st_142"><a name="60323-18_spnew1"><b> Mr. Darling: </b> 
 If the hon. Gentleman is talking about whether there are more doctors and nurses in the NHS, 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>23 Mar 2006 : Column 448</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>yes there are, and that makes a difference. It is why we have been able to reduce waiting lists, and it is one of the reasons why deaths caused by cancer and other diseases have fallen. But the right hon. Member for West Dorset was not making the case for the NHS. He was almost arguing the opposite&#151;that it makes no difference whether one puts money into the NHS. We saw what happened when the Conservatives ran the health service for 18&nbsp;years: we had long waiting lists. People had to wait for month after month to see a doctor, and for ages to see their GP. It is essential that we support people working in the health service, but we cannot do that if at the same time we deny them the means to do what they are supposed to be doing, which is treating patients.
</p>








<p><a name="st_143"><a name="60323-18_spnew2"><b> Mr. Letwin: </b> 
 Does the Secretary of State welcome or regret the fact that 2,000&nbsp;people have been sacked from the NHS in the past week?
</p>








<p><a name="st_144"><a name="60323-18_spnew3"><b> Mr. Darling: </b> 
 No one can be satisfied with a situation whereby NHS trusts get into difficulties. However, the point is that we are spending more money, with &#163;5&nbsp;billion this year and &#163;6&nbsp;billion to come next year. The vast majority of trusts are able to cope. Surely the Conservatives are not arguing that if a trust gets into deficit year after year it should simply be bailed out. If some trusts can manage their affairs, others can as well.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60323-18_para0">
<a name="stpa_120">In denying that there is a role for the Government or the state, the right hon. Member for West Dorset gets himself into the difficulties that were illustrated earlier this year, when he talked about reducing poverty and said:

<p>
<a name="60323-18_para3">
<a name="stpa_123">Of course the right hon. Gentleman has to say that, because the Conservatives have bound themselves dogmatically to their third fiscal rule, whereby spending has to fall as a percentage of gross domestic product regardless of the needs of the nation. Regardless of whether we need, as we do, to take children out of poverty and reduce pensioner poverty, regardless of what we need to spend on education or infrastructure, they are bound right from the start, before a single policy has been formulated, to cutting expenditure. First they said that they would do it annually, then over a Parliament, then over a cycle. That means that over the economic cycle, regardless of the needs of the economy, the infrastructure or any public spending, they have to cut their public expenditure.

<p><a name="st_148"><a name="60323-18_spnew7"><b> Mr. Darling: </b> 
 We have been moving towards that aim. We have increased expenditure on education. <i>[Interruption.]</i> The difference between the Labour and Conservative parties is that we have increased the money for education. We have reduced class sizes and refurbished and replaced hundreds of schools throughout the country. Doubtless the hon. Gentleman remembers the policy on which the Conservatives fought successive elections. They originally tried to encourage people to opt out. Subsequently, they have opposed every item of proposed expenditure in the past seven or eight years.

<a name="stpa_127">My right hon.

The first is continuing to make the necessary reforms to drive up standards. Secondly, we must back that up with the money necessary to employ teachers, provide the right IT equipment and so on. The Conservative party opposes that. The fiscal rule that it has adopted means that it cannot spend the money needed on education, or anything else, regardless of the needs of this country.

I believe that it originated in the <i>Witney and West Oxfordshire Gazette</i> in October 2000, when the now leader of the Conservative party was a prospective parliamentary candidate and first set out his belief that spending needed to increase below the economy&#039;s growth rate.

When I see the shadow Chancellor expressing increasing scepticism towards these tax credits, it becomes quite obvious what the Conservatives are about. They have always been hostile to the introduction of tax credits, yet I believe that those credits have played a substantial role in reducing poverty and helping families with young children.

<a name="60323-20_para1">
<a name="stpa_136">I turn now to the measures on the environment that were introduced in the Budget. They, too, reveal the gap between what the Conservatives say they are in favour of and what they actually do. The climate change levy has been very important, because it encourages energy efficiency in business. Through the levy, we have been able to reduce carbon emissions by about 28&nbsp;million tonnes, which is a substantial way of meeting our Kyoto obligations. However, the Conservatives have made it very clear that, despite all their rhetoric, they continue to oppose the climate change levy. The Chancellor announced yesterday that, from next year, the levy will increase in line with inflation. It will be interesting to see what the Conservatives actually do, despite the talk of the Leader of the Opposition and other Conservative Members, when asked to choose between doing something that really does reduce carbon emissions and simply talking about that policy.

 No, I do not, because it does reduce carbon emissions. There was a time when I thought that there was consensus in the Chamber that we should reduce carbon emissions, but there is no point in simply talking about doing it. We need to produce the means of reducing them, and without doubt, the climate change levy has done that. That is why the Conservatives ought to support it, rather than opposing it. It is all very well

One of them is to introduce an obligation to increase the use of biofuels, which will result in the equivalent of taking about 1&nbsp;million cars off the roads every year. I hope that the Conservatives will support that as well. The measures that we announced yesterday to change the road tax paid will also send a clear signal to people that they should think long and hard about what they do to reduce the environmental damage caused not just by transport but by other means as well.

The changes that we have made send a very clear signal to people, and they are important when we consider them with the other changes that we have introduced. When we vote on the climate change levy at some point, I hope that we will see the Conservative party change its mind.

I really thought that we would hear a great deal in the Budget about transport, because many transport issues tick many of the boxes that seem to be important to the Chancellor. Transport can be a tool of economic development, it can be a tool for environmental improvement and it can be a tool for social inclusion.

Those who can afford such vehicles will not be put off from buying or using them by an increase in vehicle excise duty of that scale. However, the use of larger 4x4&nbsp;vehicles is important for many people in constituencies such as mine and in other rural and remote communities.

In Watford, for example, the Government provided funding of &#163;300,000, but the eventual cost was no less than &#163;830,000. In Bath and North-East Somerset, the shortfall is in the region of &#163;200,000. Community transport schemes are suffering. Again, many people in remote and rural areas, where there is not an &quot;ordinary&quot; bus service, depend on such crucial schemes.

What we have had, in the words of the Chancellor, is cultural stability. People expect from this Government the ability to deliver Budgets that will help working people in this country, and that is exactly what we were given yesterday.
</p>








<p><a name="st_217"><a name="60323-22_spnew7"><b> Mr. Stuart: </b> 
 Perhaps, as the hon. Gentleman&#039;s memory is failing him, he will look at the inflation figures for 1997, when the current Chancellor came to office. The inflation rate then was 1.8&nbsp;per cent., compared with 2.1&nbsp;per cent. in 2005. Real growth in gross domestic product in 1997&nbsp;was 3.2&nbsp;per cent., compared with 1.8&nbsp;per cent. today. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman will reflect on that and realise that the inheritance, not anything that the present Government have done, has made the difference.
</p>








<p><a name="st_218"><a name="60323-22_spnew8"><b> Keith Vaz: </b> 
 Merely saying persistently that the economy was inherited does not justify the hon. Gentleman&#039;s proposition. I know that I will be 50&nbsp;this year, but my memory is not failing me. I know what a crisis is, and that is what we had. I also know what stability is: the lowest level of inflation, the lowest interest rates, the lowest unemployment and the longest sustained period of growth in our country. I think that that is a huge credit to the Chancellor.

<a name="stpa_155">Of course, Oppositions have a duty to oppose what Governments do; that is the nature of opposition. I was an Opposition Member, along with my right hon. Friends the Secretary of State for Transport and the Paymaster General, for 10&nbsp;years before our party became the Government, and of course one of our duties was to scrutinise. However, when the economy is going well and sustaining and benefiting our constituents, political parties have a duty to say so and to congratulate those who have made it a success. Indeed, the hon. Member for Beverley and Holderness (Mr. Stuart), has benefited from the economy&#039;s strength. I am certain that if the economy were not a success, the Opposition would have offered today a much more severe critique of this Government&#039;s efforts, instead of the platitudes and nonsense that we heard from the right hon.

<a name="stpa_156">I come now to three developments that we heard about for the first time yesterday, the first of which is the additional resources that will be given to education. The overall education budget has increased in the past 10&nbsp;years, which is only right. It is important that we have given so much money to education and that the economy is strong, so that we can generate the resources to enable our schools to provide our children with the best education that they have ever had.

<br>&nbsp;<br>importance was the decision to give the extra &#163;440&nbsp;million directly to head teachers. Members can doubtless cite past examples of secondary and primary heads raising with them their concerns about a particular expenditure item, or a staff issue that needed to be resolved. Under this Chancellor, instead of having to ask the local authority for money, heads have been able to use the special budget given to them to deal with urgent and emergency issues. The direct payment to secondary and primary heads gives them their own budget to spend on such matters, which is most welcome.

<a name="60323-22_para8">
<a name="stpa_157">Like other Members, I write constantly to local education authorities asking for support for our schools. In the city of Leicester, we have a Liberal Democrat-Conservative coalition and, strangely, although they are unable to get along in Westminster, they get along extremely well in Leicester. Whenever I wanted to deal with a particular issue raised by a school in my constituency, I used to have to write directly to that coalition, and thus the paper chase began. Now, there is a budget that allows head teachers to interface directly with their stakeholders and to spend money on their schools. That is of enormous benefit to schools, head teachers and children.

<a name="stpa_158">The second specific expenditure item in the Budget&#151;which I fully support&#151;on which I want to touch is the money being given to prepare our children and young people for the 2012&nbsp;Olympics. If we are to host the Olympics, it is absolutely vital that we have world-class athletes and that our young people are able to win medals. We cannot start indulging in these activities one or two years before the event. I know that we had a Labour Government for only three years before the millennium; nevertheless, we started our preparations for it far too late. We have six years in which to prepare our young people for the Olympic games, and we should all welcome the &#163;600&nbsp;million that has been allocated to allow us to train world-class athletes. There is a feeling in the east midlands, and Leicester in particular, that it is very much a London affair. By having the mini-Olympics all over the country&#151;we certainly wish to ensure that we have them in Leicester&#151;we will be able to train our young people early to compete with the best in the world.

It is essential that we as a country recognise that and I hope that the money will be well spent. I hope that we will make a better job of it than we did the Diana memorial, which keeps flooding and which nobody can visit because people keep falling over. What a terrible memorial to a great public figure. I hope that the new memorial will be properly designed and executed so that we can remember those people properly.

<p><a name="st_222"><a name="60323-23_spnew3"><b> Keith Vaz: </b> 
 My right hon. Friend the Chancellor spoke for one hour and two minutes, and that was a very, very long speech&#151;as we all know. I do not think that we would have wanted my right hon. Friend to speak for any longer than that, so I quite understand it if he did not mention every single aspect of policy that the Treasury has been involved in over the past few years. He does not need to mention the NHS because he has given so much money to the health service in Leicester. From 1997&nbsp;to 2006, the amount of money going to the health service in Leicester increased by 97&nbsp;per cent. Waiting lists have gone down. However, I wait to hear from my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Health whether she will give the go-ahead to the pathway project, so that the three hospitals in Leicester that have been told that they can have &#163;765&nbsp;million can go ahead&#151;just like Barts hospital, which has already received permission. However, that is not an announcement to be made by the Chancellor. As the hon.

 I appreciate that the hon.

I know that the money has been allocated and that the architects have spent &#163;60&nbsp;million on the hospital, so we want to know when work will start. Having my right hon.

<p>
<a name="60323-23_para3">
<a name="stpa_161">The first missing element was specific support for the textile industry. Thirty years ago, 140,000&nbsp;people worked in the textile industry in Leicester; today, the number is 28,000. The hon. Member for Wellingborough (Mr. Bone), whose constituency is in the Northampton area, knows that textiles also affect his constituency. I am worried about the industry&#151;about the high level of imports to the European Union and the EU&#039;s failure to act properly to stop the dumping of goods. I want specific measures and help for the textile and footwear industries in Leicester, which are important not just for Leicester but for the whole country. If we invest in them, it benefits our whole economy. Before the war, one in every five white shirts in Europe was manufactured in Leicester. We had a huge textile and footwear industry, but it is disappearing. I ask the Treasury to look at that industry before the next Budget, to make sure that specific help can be given.

<a name="stpa_162">The second omission from the Budget speech would have taken up only an extra minute&#151;unlike the health service. It is the Treasury&#039;s current assessment of our readiness to join the euro. In his Budget last year, the Chancellor said that he was not authorising a new assessment, but it is important that the Treasury keeps the five economic tests under review. I am fully signed up to the need for us to pass specific tests to join the euro. I understand why the Chancellor has said that it must be done, but I am concerned that we are not keeping the tests under review. In previous Budgets, my right hon. Friend has talked about the need for an assessment, so I hope that in the winding-up speech we will find out what has happened to the current assessment.

The Lisbon scorecard is extremely important, because Lisbon was the first European summit to benchmark European economic success. We asked why, over the past decade, America was able to create 10&nbsp;million jobs, while in Europe we could create only 1&nbsp;million. It was due to the nature of our economies.

Friend the Leader of the Opposition, in his admirable and energetic response yesterday, was certainly right: the Chancellor has indeed raised billions, he has spent billions and he has very little idea of where the money has gone or how effectively hard-working people&#039;s tax funds have been spent and to what ends.

Listening to his rather manic presentation, one was very conscious of the fact that, as my right hon. Friend the Member for West Dorset (Mr. Letwin) pointed out, it is not necessarily how much money is spent, but the way in which it is spent that counts.

<a name="stpa_172">Whether it can be considered a triumph to achieve what the Chancellor calls sound public finances when taxation is nearing 39&nbsp;per cent. of gross domestic product is in itself a question. What we do know is that his key policy mistake has been a massive transfer of resources into a largely unreformed public sector. His announcement of even larger spending increases on education and child care will, in my view, only make the situation worse. The long-term effect of the Budget will be a significantly higher tax burden, lower productivity and thus depressed growth, living standards and competitiveness, to our domestic and our international disadvantage. It is a huge disappointment that the Chancellor simply does not understand that while, of course, increased resources matter, so does a disciplined programme of expenditure matched with real reform and thus with better results. All the lessons of the past show that to be the case.

I suppose that that is not really surprising given that he knows what he spends, but because the Government have totally failed to grip reform in the national health service, they have no idea what it really costs. The health service in my constituency and all over Sussex and elsewhere is struggling to cope with unfunded cost pressures, inherited debts and not enough time or support to help it through. With the greatest anxiety, I await the inevitable outcome of the cuts in services that must follow on from the situation of those health authorities. The excellent think-tank Reform estimates that, at the present rate of growth in the NHS, there will be a resource gap of &#163;7&nbsp;billion in 2010.

Because of the war in Iraq, which I supported at the time, and which I still support, although I deeply resent the way in which the Americans handled the post-conflict arrangements and the trouble that flowed from that, the exercise of soft power has become even more important. America&#039;s soft power has diminished like the winter snows, and the country has lost almost all credibility abroad. America has 13&nbsp;carrier groups that it can deploy throughout the world, but to bomb the living daylights out of 30&nbsp;people is not the most sensible way of using military power. Soft power matters. Our country has a wonderful tradition of the use of soft power, and our assets include the BBC World Service, the British Council, British art and culture, the great traditions of democracy at Westminster, the monarchy and the law. All those things command great influence overseas, so they are vital assets.

However, when she deliberates on public spending I urge the Paymaster General to consider the need to deploy our soft power on an even greater scale. If we are to maximise the great opportunities afforded by the global economy, we must put more money into the great services provided by the British Council, the World Service and the Foreign Office. It is tremendously short-sighted to diminish the unbelievable expertise of the Foreign Office. Across the world, our remarkable diplomats do a wonderful job, so hacking away at the Foreign Office&#039;s overall budget is extremely short-term, bad politics and not in our national interest. It is in our national interest to make sure that those great assets are properly funded so that services do not struggle on a shoestring. A grotesque amount of money is spent ineffectively and inefficiently, and it would be spent much more efficiently and effectively by organisations such as the Foreign Office.

We are wonderfully good at defence diplomacy. Lord Robertson, when he was Secretary of State for Defence&#151;and a very good one, in my view&#151;made much of that in his White Paper. With the cuts and the huge pressure on the Ministry of Defence and on manpower, it is important to remember that defence diplomacy is a huge plus for this country.

 Does the hon. Gentleman believe that the climate change levy, by being a tax on energy and not on carbon, is wrongly based?

What does he think about that?
</p>








<p><a name="st_236"><a name="60323-26_spnew3"><b> Mark Lazarowicz: </b> 
 I am going to come to the question of working together in a moment. The fact is that the climate change levy has led to significant reductions in carbon emissions. By 2010, it will allow the overall energy demand in the economy to be reduced by more than 6&nbsp;per cent. Unless the hon. Gentleman is living on another planet, which I am sure he is not, he will at least accept that a fair element of the energy that we use originates from carbon. That is why the levy has a heavy impact on carbon emissions.

<a name="60323-26_para0">
<a name="stpa_194">It is not only me or the Government who say that. When I sat on the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee in the last Parliament, we had an investigation into the means to tackle climate change. The various groups that came before us to give evidence did not say that the climate change levy was the wrong instrument but that it should be increased. That is why it is particularly welcome that the Chancellor said that it will be indexed so that it will be seen to have an impact on reaching our targets on CO <sub>2</sub>  emissions.
</p>








<p><a name="st_237"><a name="60323-26_spnew4"><b> David Taylor  (North-West Leicestershire) (Lab/Co-op):</b> 
 There is no doubt that the Conservatives&#039; environmental policies are incoherent and all over the place. My hon. Friend and I were fellow-members of the EFRA Committee in the last Parliament. Does he recall the evidence from representatives of the energy-intensive industries such as the construction products industries in my constituency, and brick-making, who argued that the climate change agreements have delivered the reduction in emissions? At a time of high energy prices, they would welcome some respite, but recognise that penalties are needed if CCAs are not complied with. They have a point, do they not?
</p>








<p><a name="st_238"><a name="60323-26_spnew5"><b> Mark Lazarowicz: </b> 
 The two elements go together. On their present trends, the climate change levy and the climate change agreements will have a roughly similar effect in terms of a reduction of carbon emissions. They both have their role to play. Clearly, any tax can be refined and improved, but the key point is that the levy has had a significant impact on reducing emissions in the UK. Independent&#151;not Government&#151;research has shown that it has had a significant impact on the behaviour of businesses. Adding that fairly small, but visible, element to their costs encourages them not only to reduce their energy costs but to look at other ways of operating and improving energy overall, which has a positive effect on our carbon emission reduction targets. We must also bear it in mind that taken together, the overall effect of the reductions in energy demand and in national insurance contributions has been a reduction in costs for business as a whole. That has to be seen in the round. Elements can always be adjusted and improved, but the general direction is one that we should support.

Were the Chancellor, later this year, to go ahead with the increase in fuel duty, would they back him in that decision and not jump on a bandwagon with all sorts of unsavoury individuals to say why they cannot support an increase in that particular case?

 The hon. Gentleman demeans his green reputation by playing party politics to cover up the Government&#039;s failure.

 I was not trying to go too far down the road of making party political points, but the nature of the Chamber tends to encourage one to do that. My fundamental point is that if we are to get a real political consensus on tackling climate change&#151;a genuine one, not a notional one&#151;that requires parties across the Chamber to recognise the steps being taken. When, later in the year, we inevitably debate the level of fuel duty, I hope that the same commitment to tackle climate change will be shown by Opposition Members, rather than, as often happens, they deciding to jump on whatever bandwagon seems most popular with voters in the short term.

<a name="stpa_208">Just as motor vehicles raise the issue of fuel duty, the increase in air travel raises the issue of the continual and worrying rise in greenhouse gas emissions and of what measures to implement in response. I would have liked an increase in air passenger duty in the Budget, or some alternative form of taxation, in recognition of the problem caused by the growth in air travel. If we are to have a serious debate, the Opposition parties should make clear whether they are or are not in favour of an increase in air passenger duty at least in line with inflation. The hon.

 While many of us may want an increase, or indeed the imposition of tax on aviation fuel, that view would be expressed more credibly by Labour Members if the Government were not expanding the supply of airport space. When the availability of airport space is restricted, the price of using that space goes up and the increase must be passed on to the consumer, but when the space expands, the price of air travel continues to fall.

<p><a name="st_265"><a name="60323-28_spnew2"><b> Mark Lazarowicz: </b> 
 I have made clear my own reservations about the airport policy in so far as it affects my area and others, but I think that it would be wrong to think that the issue could be dealt with through airport policy alone. We must think about the pricing of air travel as well. It is a complex issue, and we are right to try and tackle it at a European and international level, but I think we could consider it here in the United Kingdom as well. I think that it would have been better if the Budget had provided for an index-linked rise in air passenger duty rather than a freeze.

 I am glad that we appear to be clear about the fact that that is the Liberal Democrats&#039; policy, although I must say again&#151;without wanting to become involved in the badinage in which some Members wish to engage&#151;that it is a pity that the Liberal Democrat policy in theory is not the same policy that is applied in practice. In Scotland, where the Liberal Democrats are in government, the Liberal Democrat transport Minister is subsidising air travel to many parts of the world. Indeed, he recently introduced an air travel subsidy for, as it happens, the constituency of Orkney and Shetland. First-class as well as economy tickets are being subsidised. As I have said, it is all very well to have a policy in theory, but in the case of the Liberal Democrats we sometimes do not see the same policy in practice.

That Bill is an example of how we can make progress on such issues through broad, cross-party support. The public are genuinely interested in taking steps in their own homes and communities to respond to the challenge presented by climate change. I welcome the Government&#039;s decision to put climate change and environmental issues at the heart of the Budget, and in doing so they are responding to growing public concern about such issues.

Those are not just the Government&#039;s figures; the National Audit Office has audited the trend rate of growth.

That is why people ask, &quot;How has all this money been spent with so little to show for it?&quot; The number of NHS administrators has increased by 66&nbsp;per cent., whereas the number of doctors and nurses has increased at a fraction of that percentage. The Prime Minister&#039;s own policy unit said in 2004&nbsp;that health service productivity had fallen by 20&nbsp;per cent. since the Labour Government came to power.

<p>
<a name="60323-29_para9">
<a name="stpa_229">At the heart of what is wrong with the Government is the fact that all we ever hear from them, in the context of the Budget or anything else, is a reiteration of their spending levels.

<a name="stpa_230">I looked at the chapter on improving productivity in the Red Book. One acronym did not appear at all in that chapter, or in the Chancellor&#039;s speech: NHS. The Red Book had nothing to say about improving productivity in the NHS. However, there is a chapter called &quot;Understanding Productivity&quot;&#151;a useful section for the Chancellor of the Exchequer, after so many years of failing to promote it in the private or the public sector&#151;in &quot;Productivity in the UK 6&quot;. We find that, despite its being said that productivity is the main determinate, the truth is that while spending has doubled, productivity on the standard measures in the NHS has fallen.

There has been a failure to deliver on the promises that were made before the Government came to power and, at every step&#151;every Budget&#151;it has been the Chancellor who has failed to deliver the mechanisms by which the country could change from a policy of growing emissions to one of cutting them.

 We are having a wide-ranging debate. Several hon. Members mentioned pensions and I know that others wish to speak, so I shall briefly focus on matters relating to pensions and, especially, the plight of our poor pensioners, before talking about business competitiveness in Northern Ireland and the opportunities that the Chancellor missed in his Budget to help in that regard.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60323-30_para0">
<a name="stpa_235">I acknowledge the improvements over recent years that have been made on pensioner poverty. I also acknowledge that the Chancellor announced yesterday the national bus scheme that will give pensioners free bus travel. There will also be increased funding for the insulation programme and the retention of the winter fuel allowance. However, the Chancellor failed to address several aspects of pensioner poverty. As several hon. Members have said, there is deep concern and anger among many people about the failure to continue the council tax rebate, which was applied as a rate rebate in Northern Ireland. Many people think that as the rebate was announced in the run-up to last year&#039;s election, the Government have cynically refused to continue it this year because they know that the next election will be some time away.

<a name="60323-30_para1">
<a name="stpa_236">If there was any logic behind the Government&#039;s position on the rebate, they would have carried forward something in the Budget for pensioners today. Pensioners will face enormous increases in their council tax bills. Those in Northern Ireland face an enormous increase in their rates bills because the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland has increased the regional rate for this year by 19&nbsp;per cent., which is massively over the rate of inflation. The situation is causing great concern in my constituency, which has a high proportion of elderly people. How will they meet that sort of increase when they also face the imposition of water charging for the first time, as well as swingeing increases in electricity and gas prices? When the Paymaster General winds up the debate, will she tell us why the rebate has simply been left out of this year&#039;s Budget? What possible explanation can there be for giving welcome assistance and help last year, but none whatsoever this year? Pensioners up and down the land deserve an answer to those questions.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60323-30_para2">
<a name="stpa_237">I welcome the fact that the winter fuel allowance will be retained, but there is a question mark over why there has been no increase to the allowance whatsoever, even to take account of inflation, since its introduction in 2000. The sum of &#163;200&nbsp;would have bought a household considerably more fuel back in 2000&nbsp;than it would today, especially given the recent price increases. In view of the Government&#039;s commitment to combating fuel poverty, I would have thought that the Chancellor could increase the winter fuel allowance from its level of &#163;200, at which it has been stuck for six years. I have no doubt that Ministers could point to the fact that the situation is a major improvement on that which went before. I accept that and pay tribute to the Government for what they have done. However, after such a length of time, surely there is an unanswerable case for increasing the winter fuel allowance to bring it in line with its original value in 2000.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60323-30_para3">
<a name="stpa_238">A lot has been said about the Chancellor&#039;s raid on the pension funds when he first came to office. Several hon. Members have talked about crises, and many tens of thousands of people in this country are affected by the crisis caused by the closure of company pension schemes that have shortfalls. I accept that the Government have brought forward the Pension Protection Fund and the financial assistance scheme, but the fact of the matter is that although some 85,000&nbsp;people and their dependants have been put in a real crisis through no fault of their own, the Government have rejected completely and utterly the findings of the parliamentary ombudsman following the investigation of the matter.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60323-30_para4">
<a name="stpa_239">The Government have failed to provide those people with any hope of a decent standard of living in their later years, even though they paid into pension schemes in good faith&#151;and were advised to do so by Government leaflets. The ombudsman found that the Government were at fault, but they have simply rejected that finding, not only undermining the office of the ombudsman, but leading people to question whether they should invest in pensions at all. If that is the Government&#039;s reaction to the findings of an independent ombudsman, can people have faith that if they follow today&#039;s advice about investing in pensions for the future they will not be out of pocket and facing a dire future in old age?

<br>&nbsp;<br>one of the test cases at which the ombudsman looked&#151;are in dire straits. They believe that they were robbed, not just by the initial collapse of their pension scheme, but latterly by the Government&#039;s failure both to accept the ombudsman&#039;s report and to rescue them from poverty, heartache and hardship. The Government say that it would cost &#163;15&nbsp;billion to &#163;17&nbsp;billion to do so and that they cannot find that money. The fact is that money could be found to compensate those pensioners, not least from unclaimed assets. The Chancellor has said that he will use some of those assets for youth provision&#151;a fine and laudable objective&#151;so why can he not use them to fulfil his responsibilities to those pensioners? It is a very serious issue and I urge the Government to treat it as such. There is an urgent need to rescue the lives&#151;I put it as strongly as that&#151;of people who are in very bad way indeed as a result of what has happened to them through no fault of their own.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60323-30_para6">
<a name="stpa_241">On the more general issue, we await the outcome of the consultation on the Turner report, but we need help for today&#039;s pensioners as well as tomorrow&#039;s pensioners. There is a growing reliance on means-testing to help our poorest pensioners. Initially, means-testing was necessary to target resources on the poorest pensioners, but in 2006&nbsp;that is counter-productive. Forcing more and more people to apply for means-tested benefits and pension credit is a disincentive to save. It is demeaning for many people, who find the application process difficult. The figures clearly show that a great deal of money to which people are entitled has not been claimed. The outcome of the consultation on Turner should be that we move away from means-tested benefits and implement a properly funded, decent state pension that is indexed to earnings. That is the way forward.

<a name="60323-30_para7">
<a name="stpa_242">Turning briefly to business competitiveness in Northern Ireland, in the next few weeks there will be a renewed effort on the wider political front to achieve political progress there. I hope that it is possible to achieve progress and restore devolution on the basis of adherence to democratic values, but even if devolution is restored and local people can make decisions through their local representatives, the reality is that many decisions by the Treasury, and by the Chancellor in particular, will be more important than all the decisions by local Ministers in Northern Ireland combined. In particular, that applies to Government fiscal policy and rates of corporation tax, which affect business competitiveness. In infrastructure and skills, Northern Ireland is every bit as competitive as our neighbours, but we lose our competitive edge in the cost of doing business.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60323-30_para8">
<a name="stpa_243">Some of the difficulties faced by businesses in Northern Ireland are the same as those experienced throughout the country. The challenge to business from eastern Europe and south-east Asia is felt right across the United Kingdom, but there are problems that are unique to Northern Ireland. Central to that is the fact that we share a land frontier with the Irish Republic. A 30&nbsp;per cent. corporation tax rate in Northern Ireland puts business at a major competitive disadvantage with our counterparts in the Irish Republic, where corporation tax sits at 12.5&nbsp;per cent. No matter what incentives are offered and no matter how skilled our work force is, it is difficult for the Province to compete 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>23 Mar 2006 : Column 489</b>

</p>

<p>
<a name="60323-30_para9">
<a name="stpa_244">It is the Government&#039;s stated wish to see the private sector grow in Northern Ireland, but we have higher energy and transport costs than the rest of the United Kingdom and higher corporation tax rates than the Republic of Ireland. We must be allowed to compete on a level playing field. If we are to be a competitive and effective economy, and if the Government want less reliance on the public sector, which we want as well, the appropriate fiscal arrangements must be put in place. I regret that an opportunity has been missed in the Budget for the Government to address some of those issues. The levy on fuel duty at the present rate in Northern Ireland, compared with the Irish Republic, encourages fuel smuggling and fuel laundering. The Government need to deal with that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60323-30_para10">
<a name="stpa_245">Local politicians in Northern Ireland want devolution to be restored. We want local Ministers to have responsibility. Free transport for our pensioners, for example, was a policy introduced by Democratic Unionist Ministers in the former Northern Ireland Assembly, so we welcome the fact that the rest of the country is catching up with us. However, there is only a certain amount that a devolved Administration can do. Tax rates will continue to be set here in the House and by the Government here at Westminster. On behalf of the business community and our economy in Northern Ireland, I appeal to the Government to consider the particular circumstances&#151;the disadvantages that we suffer as a result of sharing a land border, and the difficulties that we suffer as a result of the differences in corporation tax rates between the Irish Republic and Northern Ireland. I urge the Minister to address those issues when winding up the debate.

<a name="60323-31_para2">
<a name="stpa_248">I wish to deal with the success that my constituents have enjoyed over the past nine years and the background to the Budget. Our economy has faced oil price shocks. We have had the highest sustained oil prices for a quarter of a century, which have doubled since 2004&nbsp;and trebled since 2002. Growth among the eurozone economies has been slow, yet the UK had the largest export market in 2004&nbsp;and 2005. Those are not merely figures, they are the underlying reasons why employment in my constituency is at record levels.
</p>

<p>

<a name="stpa_249">In previous decades, faced with such challenges, our economy would have tipped into recession. Indeed, I intervened on the hon. Member for Beverley and Holderness (Mr. Stuart) to remind him of the two largest shocks that the UK economy had suffered since the war under the previous Conservative regime. Inflation rose to 25&nbsp;per cent. and unemployment passed 2&nbsp;million. That is what used to happen, but it has not happened this time. That is a key backdrop to the Budget that my right hon. Friend delivered yesterday.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60323-31_para4">
<a name="stpa_250">Labour&#039;s economic reforms have helped the UK economy continue to experience successive periods of growth. In 2005, the UK&#039;s economic growth was higher than that of any other major European economy. These things do not happen by chance, and I certainly do not accept the argument that it is down to inheritance. We have low inflation and stable interest rates, which are key to hard-working families in my constituency. In the previous years of boom and bust under the previous regime, any parts of the economy that did well tended to be in the south-east, while the north-west, where my constituency is, suffered at the hands of the mismanagement that occurred. Under this Government, we have low inflation, stable interest rates and stable growth. The north-west has benefited from that, as have all parts of the country in their respective ways.

 It is a great pleasure to follow the hon. Member for Wirral, West (Stephen Hesford) who, as ever, delighted the House with his fluency and wit. Certainly, there was a fair degree of laughter on this side of the House, and I am grateful to him for that. I wish to return to the issue of productivity raised in the forceful speech of my hon. Friend the Member for Beverley and Holderness (Mr. Stuart).
</p>

<p>
<a name="60323-32_para12">
<a name="stpa_269">Productivity is hugely important, and the Chancellor devoted much of his speech to measures intended to improve it. He has said in the past:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_37">&quot;Productivity is a fundamental yardstick of economic performance, and poor productivity condemns a nation to be held back.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="60323-32_para13">
<a name="stpa_270">There is an element of complacency about productivity in the documentation produced by the Treasury. The impression gained is that the Treasury is rather proud of this Government&#039;s productivity record. The hon. Member for Normanton (Ed Balls) intervened on that point earlier to say that, as is stated in the Red Book, the evidence points to raised productivity growth over the current cycle compared with previous cycles. I think that that is the gist of his remarks.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>23 Mar 2006 : Column 495</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60323-32_para14">
<a name="stpa_271">Interestingly, that same point was made to an economist on &quot;Newsnight&quot; last night, who replied that the current economic cycle has yet to be completed, so there are a number of years in which productivity is expected to be low as part of that cycle. Therefore, the comparison is not like with like. The expression that she used to describe the Treasury&#039;s presentation of the productivity figures was &quot;sleight of hand&quot;. I am not an economist, so I am in no position to say whether she was correct.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60323-32_para15">
<a name="stpa_272">There is no doubt that current productivity, on the basis of the 2005&nbsp;figures, is very poor. It is at a record low, whether one measures it by growth in output per worker or by growth in output per hours worked. Productivity growth in 2005&nbsp;was extremely slow&#151;either the slowest since records began or at least since 1991, depending on which measure one follows. As for the projections, the Treasury continues to predict sluggish productivity growth in future years.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60323-32_para16">
<a name="stpa_273">The key question for the House to determine is what is causing this poor productivity. There are a number of reasons for it. First, the balance of the economy has changed, in the sense that the public sector is now bigger, compared with the private sector, than a few years ago. The productivity record of the public sector, particularly in health and education, is not impressive. It should also be acknowledged that it is difficult to measure productivity in that sector. In terms of progress and new evidence of growth, the Treasury&#039;s, &quot;Productivity in the UK&quot; makes that very point. None the less, the Office for National Statistics is attempting to find better ways of measuring productivity. Whichever method it uses, however, it tends to find a problem.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60323-32_para17">
<a name="stpa_274">On health, the ONS report produced by Tony Atkinson estimated the decline in NHS productivity as 1&nbsp;per cent. per year since 1997. On education, the ONS changed its methodology to measure productivity&#151;I am not critical of it for doing so&#151;but the previous methodology suggested a decline of 2&nbsp;per cent. per year in recent years. A more sophisticated approach still results in a decline of 0.5&nbsp;per cent. per year since 1998. Whichever way one cuts it, productivity is not impressive in the public sector. That is the gist of the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Beverley and Holderness.
</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060323/debtext/60323-33.htm"/>







<p><a name="st_309"><a name="60323-33_spnew0"><b> Mr. Soames: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is right that it is extremely difficult to gauge, but by any standards, by and large, productivity in the public sector is way inferior to that in the private sector.
</p>








<p><a name="st_310"><a name="60323-33_spnew1"><b> Mr. Gauke: </b> 
 That is absolutely true, and it brings me neatly to what I was about to say. Productivity in the private sector has also not been impressive in recent years, but the change in balance, with the public sector growing at the expense of the private sector, has reduced our overall productivity because productivity in the public sector has been particularly poor in recent years.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60323-33_para0">
<a name="stpa_275">There are a number of explanations for what is happening in the private sector. Many economists would argue that a large element of it is due not to policy failures but to what might be described as labour-hoarding. A number of businesses expect a slowdown in the economy, which means that there is less work, but 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>23 Mar 2006 : Column 496</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>rather than lay off staff&#151;and expecting the slowdown to be followed by some economic growth, which would mean having to find new staff&#151;they retain existing staff for longer than they might have otherwise.
</p>








<p><a name="st_311"><a name="60323-33_spnew2"><b> Ed Balls: </b> 
 I want to be sure that I understand what the hon. Gentleman is saying. He seems to be saying that in the past, when the economy experienced a tough year, people were laid off, unemployment shot up and employment fell. Because nowadays people think that a tough year in the British economy will be followed by a return to growth, they do not lay off staff but retain them in their jobs. That is why in that particular year employment stays high and productivity figures are slightly lower. I understood the hon. Gentleman to be saying that that was good news for the British economy rather than bad news&#151;or did I misunderstand?
</p>








<p><a name="st_312"><a name="60323-33_spnew3"><b> Mr. Gauke: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman may find this hard to understand, but I was not making a partisan point. I know that this will be beyond his comprehension, but I am not claiming that labour-hoarding results from a failure of Government policy. All I am saying is that it is happening&#151;that it is an observable fact. It is a good thing. If it is thought that the economy will grow and that it is therefore unnecessary to lay people off, that is clearly a good thing. There was no criticism in what I was saying at that point; but&#151;
</p>








<p><a name="st_313"><a name="60323-33_spnew4"><b> Ed Balls: </b> 
 But!
</p>








<p><a name="st_314"><a name="60323-33_spnew5"><b> Mr. Gauke: </b> 
 Yes, there is a &quot;but&quot;. When labour is hoarded&#151;if that is the correct phrase&#151;and growth does not follow, there is more vulnerability to an increase in unemployment. If the downturn lasts longer than expected, there will be higher unemployment. That is a potential difficulty. In 2006&nbsp;we are witnessing some increase in unemployment, perhaps suggesting that the labour-hoarding is unwinding to some extent. We shall see.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60323-33_para1">
<a name="stpa_276">There are, however, more substantial reasons why productivity has been so poor. One is the increase in regulation. According to the &quot;Burdens Barometer&quot; published by the British Chambers of Commerce, the cost of regulation has risen by &#163;14&nbsp;billion since 1998. The World Economic Forum says that since 1997&nbsp;the United Kingdom has fallen from 13th in its league table to 30th in terms of Government regulation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60323-33_para2">
<a name="stpa_277">The Chancellor focused a great deal on the City of London in his Budget and the papers that have been produced. The City faces great challenges and regulation, which in general are not domestically driven. They come not from the United Kingdom but from the European Union: the markets in financial instruments directive, for instance, is causing concern.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60323-33_para3">
<a name="stpa_278">Taxation is another problem. Business taxes have risen substantially. The Ernst and Young analysis shows that if North sea oil revenue is excluded, taxes are the highest that they have ever been. The level of taxation is not the only difficulty, however. We should observe what is being done by our competitors. We are to be taxed more heavily than Germany, and it is no surprise that Germany&#039;s growth is likely to exceed ours in the years ahead.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60323-33_para4">
<a name="stpa_279">We should consider not just our own taxation level, in absolute terms and relative to those of our competitors, but the complexity of taxation. Let me give an example. 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>23 Mar 2006 : Column 497</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>I know that vehicle excise duty is not a business tax, and I am not particularly critical of the policy per se, but it is rather characteristic of this Chancellor that we are to have seven different rates whereas once we had only one. That illustrates this Government&#039;s tendency to complicate matters. According to a World Economic Forum assessment, in terms of tax simplicity the UK is ranked 67th in the world, tied with Benin.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60323-33_para5">
<a name="stpa_280">A further element threatening productivity is the decline in business investment. The Chancellor said in his 2001&nbsp;Budget that


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_38">&quot;To achieve our first ambition&#151;to secure the fastest productivity growth of our competitors over the next decade&#151;business investment must rise&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 7&nbsp;March 2001; Vol. 364, c. 298.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="60323-33_para6">
<a name="stpa_281">That is not happening. Business investment is falling, in part because of the taxation and regulation that I mentioned earlier. It is now at a record low: about 9&nbsp;per cent. of gross domestic product, which is the lowest level since records began in 1965.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60323-33_para7">
<a name="stpa_282">The British Chambers of Commerce and the CBI have offered substantial criticism of our skills levels. I know that more is being spent on education and I am not critical of that, but we must get the value for money that the Government have not achieved in the past. Until we get the full reforms that we need, I will not be all that optimistic. To be fair, the Government are moving in the right direction through their Education and Inspections Bill, but there is still a long way to go.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60323-33_para8">
<a name="stpa_283">This country has enormous advantages, such as the English language and strong cultural links with many other parts of the world. In an increasingly globalised world, we should be able to succeed, grow and prosper. There is cross-party consensus on the need to embrace globalisation, and we at least all talk about a belief in and desire for free trade, even if we do not always implement it. But our economy is becoming increasingly clogged up and it is less competitive and productive than it was. There are some fundamental economic issues that we need to face, and I fear that this Budget has completely failed to do so.

 It is a great pleasure to follow my hon. Friend the Member for South-West Hertfordshire (Mr. Gauke), who talked about productivity in detail and with great knowledge. Indeed, he somewhat embarrassed the Government.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60323-33_para9">
<a name="stpa_284">Yesterday was the first Budget that I had witnessed as a Member of the House of Commons. I got here very early to put my green card by my normal seat, only to discover that the place was packed with green cards. I felt a sense of great anticipation: this was going to be a packed House, and I was about to hear the iron Chancellor tell us about his great new reforms. According to the bookies, it was to be the right hon. Gentleman&#039;s last Budget as Chancellor, and he will be elevated to the role of Prime Minister very soon. So although it is always a thrill and an honour to enter the Palace of Westminster, I felt a little extra anticipation yesterday.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60323-33_para10">
<a name="stpa_285">The Chancellor spoke for just over an hour, but it seemed like three hours. After half an hour, a fellow Conservative whispered, &quot;I&#039;ve given up the will to live.&quot; 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>23 Mar 2006 : Column 498</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Another said to me, &quot;When does the Budget start?&quot; I thought that they were simply being partisan, but I noticed on looking across to the Labour Benches that three Back Benchers had fallen asleep. Later, some of them left. I thought that the Front Benchers would be okay, but when I looked at the Deputy Prime Minister, I noticed that even he was enormously bored. The Prime Minister was grinning, but it was even more artificial than usual. So in that sense, I was very disappointed with the Budget. The leader of my party said more in eight minutes than the Chancellor said in over an hour.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60323-33_para11">
<a name="stpa_286">I thought that I should measure the Budget against the expectations of the people of Wellingborough, whom I regularly survey through my &quot;Listening to Wellingborough and Rushden&quot; survey. Of the issues that they mention, five in particular always come top: pensions, council tax, police and crime, education, and health. Wellingborough is a rapidly expanding town. Indeed, according to the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, over the next 15&nbsp;years 9,825&nbsp;new dwellings will be created in one half of my constituency, and 6,800&nbsp;in the other. So there will be an enormous increase in the number of people in the constituency. It worried me that the Budget provided no encouragement for first-time buyers. The small increase in stamp duty exemption did not even cover the average price of a new home for a first-time buyer. That was a little mean, and the Chancellor could have done better on that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60323-33_para12">
<a name="stpa_287">One important issue in Wellingborough is pensions. I agree with previous comments about the 85,000&nbsp;people affected by the failure of their company pension schemes. It is unfair that the Government have not dealt with that problem. If an ombudsman criticises the Government on an issue, they should take notice of what she says. We cannot let 85,000&nbsp;people down through maladministration and do nothing about it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60323-33_para13">
<a name="stpa_288">People are now beginning to realise the implications of the &#163;5&nbsp;billion that has been stolen from pensions each and every year, as their pensions are being slashed. I should congratulate the Chancellor on one point: he has put the tax burden up to its highest ever level, but he has done so cleverly. He has done it through stealth taxes that people have not noticed initially, but they are now all coming home to roost.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60323-33_para14">
<a name="stpa_289">In my constituency, a group of pensioners were so fed up that their pension was going up by less than the increase in the council tax that they started a campaign. They had public meetings, and shadow Ministers came to speak to them. What annoyed those pensioners so much was that the basic state pension was not going up enough to cover the increase in council tax in my constituency. They were also fed up with means-testing. Many people knew that they could get more money if they applied to the Government for pension credit, but they were not prepared to do so. They did not want the Government to know all their financial background. They thought that after paying in year after year, they should not have to go on bended knee to the Government for a few extra pounds a week. That is the problem with the pension credit. We should get rid of it and all the other bribes, and give people a decent pension. One of the few issues on which I agreed with my predecessor was that the millions, if not billions, of pounds of unclaimed pension credit could be added to the basic pension right now. I do not know why the Government do not do that.

<p>
<a name="60323-34_para4">
<a name="stpa_296">I do not believe a word that the Government say about education. I do not believe that any extra money will go into education in Wellingborough. The Government&#039;s history over the past nine years is that in Wellingborough educational provision has gone down. It may be great in the hon. Gentleman&#039;s constituency but it is not in mine, and the Government should take that into account. Wellingborough should receive its fair share of education spending.

<a name="60323-34_para5">
<a name="stpa_297">The most important issue in Wellingborough is the health service. As many Members have said, the Chancellor did not mention the health service at all. I am not really surprised. Dentistry in Wellingborough has been privatised, and I saw no commitment in the Labour party manifesto to do that. There were far more NHS dentists in Wellingborough in 1997&nbsp;than there are today. If people can find an NHS dentist who will take them on, it is almost a miracle. On GP appointments, we have one of the lowest ratios of doctors to patients in the United Kingdom, and it was much better in 1997.

<a name="stpa_298">The most important problem in the area relates to Kettering general hospital. There is no hospital in Wellingborough, and we should have a community hospital there. We hear that the Government are in favour of community hospitals, but there is no money for one in Wellingborough. However, the Government have a very useful formula for funding the NHS to make it fair across the country. That is a very good idea. The only problem is that when they announced that funding, they provided my area with only 85&nbsp;per cent. of what the 

<br>&nbsp;<br>

<a name="60323-34_para7">
<a name="stpa_299">I am pleased that other areas get more than their formula share, but that is not good enough for the people of Wellingborough. All the talk of the formula and funding may not really mean anything to the people of Wellingborough, but when the local hospital must cancel 3,000 out-patient appointments and 600 operations, close a ward and an operating theatre, and transfer nurses from one area to another, that is when it comes home to roost.

 May I gently suggest to the hon. Gentleman that he check his figures on the formula funding in Wellingborough? I think that he will find that from 1&nbsp;April 2007, no primary care trust in England will be below 95&nbsp;per cent. of formula. I very much doubt whether his PCT is currently 15&nbsp;per cent. off formula, because I think that I am right in saying that no PCT in England is anywhere near 10&nbsp;per cent. off formula. So I urge him in his litany of doom and gloom for Wellingborough&#151;it does sound dismal&#151;to check his figures on the NHS.

 The figure that I cite has never been challenged locally. In fact, I am told that it translates into &#163;21&nbsp;million less for the local hospital. I am pleased to hear that progress will be made, but the Government always promise jam in the future, and I really do not believe it.

She has been admitted to the accident and emergency department on three or four occasions. She needs an operation. The operation was planned, but it was cancelled because of the cuts. Someone in my constituency is in agony, because of the cuts forced on us by the Government. Mrs. Baddock had to wait more than six months for her operation, yet the Government say that no one is waiting more than six months for an NHS operation. What they say and reality are completely the reverse. Mrs. Cutting has a heart complaint. In September 2005, she was told that she needed an electrocardiogram. I should not have thought that an ECG was a particularly difficult thing to arrange, but she has been told that she will not have one until November 2006. She has pointed out to me that it will be four years from when she first fell ill to when she gets any treatment whatsoever.

 I am pleased to follow my hon. Friend the Member for Wellingborough (Mr. Bone), who spoke with such passion about how the Budget will affect his constituency. He started by talking about the hype that surrounded the Budget. I agree with him&#151;for many of us who, for the first time, were able to sit in the Chamber and listen to the Budget, there was an awful lot of hype surrounding the event. In fact, one could describe it as a non-event. We had a 61-minute speech and lots of documents&#151;1,000&nbsp;pages in all, I think&#151;but there was very little to tackle some of the challenges that we face today. There was nothing to assist productivity growth, pensioners or the NHS. When we remove the North sea oil revenues, we find that we are being taxed more now than ever before.

 It has been a common practice to be able to read the two sets of figures: one with North sea oil revenues and one without. That gives a good indication to the public. They can recognise how much contribution is made from North sea oil.

<p><a name="st_329"><a name="60323-35_spnew3"><b> Dawn Primarolo: </b>

 I think that the right hon. Lady is deliberately trying to mislead me. We are trying to show that if there is a significant sector that is contributing to the revenues and that is removed, it gives a good indication of what the rest of the economy is doing. I am not saying that we should take any one sector in isolation, but North sea oil provides such a large amount of revenue for this country that it is important that we are able to see both figures.

<br>&nbsp;<br>that an extra &#163;1&nbsp;billion has been put into the NHS, but today we became diverted on to a debate about whether simply to throw money at something. That debate was entirely misleading. Conservative Members do not question the fact that extra spending must be put in, but it is the way in which the money is spent that is important.

The Chancellor will be pleased to hear that if the Prime Minister introduces real NHS reform with the same Conservative direction of travel, he will again be able to rely on our support to get it through, even if he cannot rely on Labour Back Benchers.

<a name="stpa_332">As for child care, the House will be aware of rising complaints from private, voluntary and independent providers that the Government are driving them out of business because of the lack of a level playing field in child care, and today I can provide the House with new figures. According to Laing and Buisson&#039;s day nursery market report 2006, in the year to January 2006, 40,030&nbsp;places provided by local authorities opened, but in the same year 17,715&nbsp;day nursery places provided by the private sector closed, which is very serious. That is the first time that I have seen figures showing a decisive tilt from the private sector to the public sector, and that figure throws into question the Government&#039;s commitment to a mixed market in child care. Perhaps the Paymaster General will say what the Budget will do to provide a more level playing field in child care between the public sector and the private sector.

The vigour, creativity and strength of British business&#151;strength largely achieved despite Government policy, not because of Government policy&#151;are to some degree masking all those moves in the wrong direction. There is so much that is good in the British economy, but the economy could and should be even better. The great challenge presented to the Chancellor and to this Budget was the challenge of 21st-century change. There is no global pension fund waiting to be raided by countries that have run out of incomes to tax by stealth, and there is no international tax credit system waiting to bale out Governments who get into

<a name="stpa_334">The Budget should and could have put stability first by making the assessment of the Chancellor&#039;s fiscal rules independent. It could have sent Britain in the right direction, but it did not do so, because this is an old-fashioned, tax-and-spend Chancellor who has run out of ideas and who is running out of time. Yesterday, he ran away from using his Budget to tackle the crisis in our health service. He is a Chancellor who is preparing himself for the premiership and not preparing Britain for the future. This is a Budget for Brown, not a Budget for Britain.

<a name="60323-37_para2">
<a name="stpa_337">The Budget announced yesterday by my right hon. Friend the Chancellor demonstrated a vision for a modern Britain leading on enterprise and prosperity and leading in opportunities and fairness. It sets out world-class public services and an ambition to build on a platform of stability and growth. As my right hon. Friend said, we have had 54&nbsp;quarters of consecutive growth&#151;the longest expansion in British history. This is a stable economy, with inflation at the 2&nbsp;per cent. target, interest rates low and record employment. The crucial difference between this Government and the previous Government is record levels of employment, with more than 2.3&nbsp;million more jobs since 1997.

Support for local business environments through the local enterprise growth initiative, worth &#163;50&nbsp;million next year, is an important contribution to that, as is the improved access to finance for small businesses through the enhanced incentives to invest in small businesses through venture capital trusts.

<a name="stpa_339">Yesterday, my right hon.

Those reforms will help us to meet the challenge of climate change. I shall deal with the points that hon. Members made about that shortly. The reforms will be embedded in our public services for long-term efficiency.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60323-37_para5">
<a name="stpa_340">Let us be clear about the economy&#039;s current position. The UK economy has coped well with the challenges in 2005. They include sustained higher oil prices, weak euro area demand and a subdued housing market. Under the stewardship of the Conservative party, all those factors would have driven the economy into recession. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development described the UK economy as a paragon of stability. The International Monetary Fund emphasised that macro-economic stability remains remarkable in the UK. In the nine years since 1997, the UK economy has grown by 24&nbsp;per cent. In the previous nine years, under a Conservative Government, it grew by 15&nbsp;per cent. If growth in the past nine years had been the same as in the preceding nine years, the average household would be more than &#163;3,300&nbsp;worse off than it is today.

 No, not at the moment. When North sea oil is included, the tax take is not as high as the peak in 1984. The OECD measure&#151;the approved, internationally comparable measure of the tax burden&#151;states that, in the UK, we rank below the OECD average and the European average. Indeed, every year since 1997, the tax burden has been below the peaks that were reached in 1984&#150;85. Let me remind Conservative Members that some of the choice measures that they included in their previous Budgets included VAT on fuel and increasing VAT to 17.5&nbsp;per cent. The Conservative Government cut advance corporation tax in 1993&nbsp;and had the same effect on funds as they claim that the Government are now having.

<a name="stpa_342">The hon. Member for Mid-Sussex made many points about pensioners. I agree that every hon. Member should be concerned about that, but I want to remind him of a few factors. Reforms to pensioners&#039; tax and benefits since 1997&nbsp;have meant that pensioners are, on average, &#163;27&nbsp;a week better off and the poorest third of pensioners are &#163;39&nbsp;a week better off. Let me put it another way: 2.1&nbsp;million pensioners have been lifted out of absolute low income between 1996&#150;97&nbsp;and 2004&#150;05, and more than 1&nbsp;million have been lifted out of relative low income in the same period. They became the victims of low income and poverty under the previous Government&#039;s policies.

<a name="60323-37_para10">
<a name="stpa_345">The health service was mentioned repeatedly. Let us get a few things straight. The Government&#039;s plans for the NHS were set out in the Budget of 2002, providing clear plans for right up to 2008, offering long-term certainty for the NHS in order for it to plan. Since 1997, UK health spending has risen from the &#163;33&nbsp;billion that we inherited from the previous Conservative Government to &#163;97&nbsp;billion, representing a 7&nbsp;per cent.

Now, 99&nbsp;per cent. of people suspected of having cancer are seen by a specialist within two weeks, and we no longer have to listen to horrendous stories in our surgeries resulting from Conservative Government policy. If the Conservatives want to know where the money went, I shall tell them. It has gone towards 660,000&nbsp;more operations and 1&nbsp;million more elective admissions each year. These represent increases of 88&nbsp;per cent., 89&nbsp;per cent. and 108&nbsp;per cent. in people&#039;s treatment.

<a name="60323-37_para11">
<a name="stpa_346">Alongside that, there are now 79,000&nbsp;more nurses and 27,000&nbsp;more doctors. By the end of the 2004&nbsp;spending round, the NHS will have 90&nbsp;per cent. higher spending in real terms than it did in 1997. The money has not gone to pay for managers&#039; salaries, as Conservative Members insist on saying. NHS managers now comprise 3&nbsp;per cent. of the staff, whereas that figure was 5&nbsp;per cent in 1997, so the percentage is falling under this Government.

However, the NHS report shows improved productivity as a result of lower levels of staff sickness and the reduced use of agency staff in 2004&#150;05, which freed up about &#163;60&nbsp;million more for patient care. But, of course, it cannot end there.

 The hon.

The ONS acknowledges that these measures represent staging posts towards an ongoing programme to improve productivity in regard to information, so that we can get a much fairer picture of what is going on. We are clearly flagging up that this is about getting accurate and timely information to give us a proper assessment of the productivity.

Mortgage rates are at their lowest levels since the 1950s and the cut in the cost of mortgages has resulted in a level that is now about &#163;4,000&nbsp;a year. Interest rates, at 4.5&nbsp;per cent., remain close to their historic low levels and it is estimated that there will be about 2&nbsp;million more home owners by the end of 2006&nbsp;than there were in 1997. That shows that the Government are introducing precisely the kind of measures that assist home owners by providing stability, low interest rates and certainty.

<p><a name="st_363"><a name="60323-38_spnew7"><b> Clare Short  (Birmingham, Ladywood) (Lab):</b> 
 I want to raise the case of Omid Farivar and his family, who are asylum seekers from Iran living in my constituency. Over the years that I have been in the House, I have dealt with many hundreds and probably thousands of asylum cases. Some have been distressing, and some disturbing, but probably none has been worse and more worrying than this one. I have therefore written to the Home Office and the Minister on a number of occasions, and have asked for a meeting with the Minister, which he refused. I am therefore bringing the case to the Floor of the House to try to draw the Minister&#039;s attention to this case&#039;s extremely distressing features, which inspire compassion, in the hope that I can get him to reconsider.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60323-38_para10">
<a name="stpa_358">All of us who deal regularly with asylum cases know that there has been a continuing hardening of attitudes in the Home Office in recent years, and a growing unwillingness on the part of Ministers to use the discretion given them by Parliament to deal with cases that truly arouse compassion. I still find it hard to believe, however, that any UK Minister, let alone one who claims to be a Labour Minister, can possibly refuse this case. If I do not achieve a reconsideration by the Minister, my concern is that the doctors of my constituent&#039;s 13-year-old daughter fear that she is unlikely to reach the age of 14&nbsp;and extremely likely to commit suicide. I will come to the evidence of that in a moment. In addition, her father, if returned to Iran, is very likely to be executed.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60323-38_para11">
<a name="stpa_359">I should stress that I am anxious not to identify the family too closely. I have given the name of my constituent, and I hope that that will not cause ramifications. The obvious reasons for my hesitation are those of privacy and concern for the mental health of the daughter, but also that the family are fearful of any consequences of publicity here for their family in Iran. My regional television company, Central television, was anxious to take up the case and interview the family. Although that might have helped them, they refused, because they fear what might happen at home if they draw attention to themselves.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60323-38_para12">
<a name="stpa_360">My constituent is a graduate in chemical engineering. For a time, he was a lecturer, and then became a development and research manager in a substantial factory. His wife is also a chemical engineering graduate, production manager and part-time chemistry teacher. Obviously, the family are highly educated and were living comfortably in Iran.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60323-38_para13">
<a name="stpa_361">In February 2003, however, my constituent was involved in a road traffic accident in which a child was seriously injured. That was obviously a tragedy, but it turned into a nightmare for the family, because the boy was the son of a high-ranking member of an Islamist group referred to in Iran as Hizbullahi&#151;as I understand it, all such groups are fanatically supportive of the Government, but this particular group is especially fanatical, tends to enforce Government rules, and is known as Feshar. My constituent tells me that its members are hard-line militant enforcers of Islamist rules.

</p>

<p>
<a name="60323-38_para14">
<a name="stpa_362">After the accident the police went to the scene, talked to witnesses and took my constituent to a police station, where he was held for three days. The father of the boy then went to the police station and claimed that my constituent had knocked the boy over on purpose. He kicked and beat him. At first the police were inclined to stop that, but when the political-activist senior figure said that my constituent had knocked the boy over on purpose they joined in, and he was beaten very severely.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60323-38_para15">
<a name="stpa_363">On the second day, my constituent was asked to sign a confession. He resisted, but was beaten more and then gave in. The confession stated that he had deliberately injured the boy because he was trying to harm the father, and that he had been drinking alcohol. That was all completely untrue, but he signed the confession because he was beaten. He was then taken to court, and was detained while they waited to see what would happen to the boy. He was in prison for two to three weeks; then the boy sadly died.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60323-38_para16">
<a name="stpa_364">My constituent&#039;s family experienced great difficulty in getting any solicitor to represent him because of the political position of the boy&#039;s father, but eventually they found a solicitor who secured his release from prison on bail. When the boy died, however, he was detained again. The court then ordered him to pay blood money or be executed. Obviously he accepted the order to pay blood money, but in such cases the offended party must agree. The boy&#039;s family would not accept blood money, but said they would agree to accept it and would not demand execution if my constituent agreed to engage his 11-year-old daughter to the brother of the boy&#039;s father, a 42-year-old. The boy&#039;s father also went to see my constituent, and said that even if my constituent was executed he would follow his family and take the life of a young person to pay for the life that his own family had lost.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60323-38_para17">
<a name="stpa_365">My constituent then talked to his wife and father about what he should do. He thought that perhaps he should accept execution to release his family from the pressure that they were under, but they said &quot;No: agree to the deal. Then at least we can get you out of prison, and try to find a way forward.&quot; He therefore accepted the deal and paid the blood money, which he tells me was 15&nbsp;million toman. I have no idea how much that is, but I imagine that it is a substantial sum.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60323-38_para18">
<a name="stpa_366">Then the daughter was engaged to the brother, but whenever the man called at their house she would shake in fear. Her father felt absolutely dreadful, and decided that he could not do it: she was too young. Then his father paid a people-smuggler&#151;one of those people who now run the asylum system of the world&#151;to take the family out of the country. But the smuggler was arrested&#151;I do not think that it was to do with this case&#151;and put in prison, so the money was lost and that plan did not work.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60323-38_para19">
<a name="stpa_367">The fianc&#233;&#151;the 42-year-old brother&#151;kept calling at my constituent&#039;s house to see his daughter. My constituent said that he could not accept it any more. He dismissed the engagement, and returned the presents that the fianc&#233; had brought.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60323-38_para20">
<a name="stpa_368">Before the engagement, the family of the boy who had died in the accident had come to my constituent&#039;s house, broken windows and harassed and threatened the family. All that stopped when the engagement was on, but after it was broken off the attacks started again. 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>23 Mar 2006 : Column 517</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>That led to an invasion of the house. The invaders found the satellite television, which is illegal in Iran. They also claimed to have found political books and alcohol. My constituent tells me that he did have a satellite television, but did not have political books or alcohol. He was not involved in any political activity in Iran. However, the allegations were being made by a political faction, which made him into a political prisoner.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60323-38_para21">
<a name="stpa_369">My constituent was then taken to the fanatical group&#039;s own prison, which he tells me was very nasty, like a cage, with sharp needle-like pieces of metal embedded in the cement of the floor. He was there for 10&nbsp;to 12&nbsp;days. There was no light, and he did not know whether it was day or night. He was taken out of the cage and beaten, then put back, many times. He was then released, because his father had paid a lot of money for him to be released, and told to report to the group daily. He tells me that there are special courts to deal with political offences&#151;Islamic revolutionary courts.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60323-38_para22">
<a name="stpa_370">Given the doubts of the regrettably misinformed adjudicator in the case, let me say that Human Rights Watch is very clear about the fact that there are political courts in Iran: there is no question about that. My constituent was not politically active, but he was accused by a political faction of being politically motivated, and was therefore treated as a political prisoner.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60323-38_para23">
<a name="stpa_371">My constituent&#039;s father, having got him released from prison, looked for a way to get him and his wife, son and daughter out of the country. They found and paid a people-smuggler, who got them false visas on their real passports. By now, they were not staying at home but moving between friends and family. Then, they got the message to go to the airport very early on a fixed day. The smuggler gave them their passports and told them which passport check-line and door to go through. My constituent assumes that people were bribed to let them through. They did not know until that morning where they were going. They had no motivation to get to the UK; they just wanted to get out of the country and the danger that they were in. They were given tickets and told to rip up their passports on the plane and to apply to UK authorities when they arrived, which they did. My constituent knew nothing whatsoever of asylum or any asylum seekers before he came to the UK.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60323-38_para24">
<a name="stpa_372">Since the family have been in this country, the daughter has had constant nightmares and will not eat. Her doctors have written medical letters to me; indeed, they are so worried about her that they have even come to see me at my advice bureau. They are extremely fearful that she will commit suicide. I have provided the Home Office with copies of those letters.

There is no doubt about the sincerity of his belief&#151;I have been to their house and spoken with them at some length&#151;that if he is sent back he would be sent before a political court, because he has been accused of political activity, and probably executed. His children would also be targeted, as was threatened.

<p>
<a name="60323-38_para44">
<a name="stpa_392">I have written to my hon. Friend the Minister and asked for a meeting. His letter of 6&nbsp;March relies on an adjudication that turned down the family&#039;s case. Some of the medical evidence that I have given today was not put before the adjudicator, but the adjudicator simply did not believe the story. There is no doubt in my mind that the adjudicator was simply wrong. The reason Parliament gives Ministers discretion is so that they have the right to overturn a decision when the adjudicator gets it wrong.

<a name="stpa_393">It is notable also that in October 2003, before the adjudication, the Home Office argued that the general human rights situation and freedom of speech in Iran were improving, and the country was in a state of transition. I hope it is accepted&#151;it is certainly the rhetoric of our Government&#151;that since the 2005&nbsp;elections and the appointment, in particular, of Mostafa Pour-Mohammadi as Minister of the Interior, that is emphatically no longer the case. He was previously involved in a decision to execute thousands of political prisoners in 1983, an event that Human Rights Watch considers a serious crime against humanity under international human rights law.

<a name="stpa_394">That is the case that I am bringing to the Floor of the House and before the Minister tonight. I am sure that he is very busy and has many cases to consider. Perhaps he has not in the past had time to consider all the details of this case, but I ask him to please, please use his discretion to allow the family to remain in the UK on compassionate grounds because that would save their lives. They are a very nice and highly educated family and, if allowed to stay, I am sure that they would be very good citizens of our country.

I also consider it inappropriate to discuss this case on the Floor of the House because the applicant&#039;s legal representatives have applied for the case to be heard before the High Court under judicial review, and that application remains outstanding. In that context, it simply is not proper for me to discuss the substance or the individual circumstances of the case.

Friend is more than aware that asylum and human rights applications are considered by the Home Office on their individual merits, in accordance with our obligations under the 1951&nbsp;UN refugee convention and the European convention on human rights. When cases are assessed as well founded, we provide protection by granting asylum to those who meet the definition of a refugee under the 1951&nbsp;convention, and by granting humanitarian protection to people who are not refugees but who would face a serious risk to life or person arising from torture, inhumane or degrading treatment or punishment, the death penalty or unlawful killing, and who are not subject to specified exclusion criteria.

<a name="stpa_399">The Government firmly believe that the right approach is to continue to assess carefully the protection needs of individuals on an individual basis.

<p>
<a name="60323-39_para5">
<a name="stpa_400">As my right hon. Friend knows, since the new single-tier appeal system was introduced in April 2005, unsuccessful applicants have been able to appeal to the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal. If unsuccessful at appeal, an applicant may submit an application to the tribunal for a review of the decision. The AIT is an independent body established by Parliament to adjudicate on matters of that kind, and I would not normally intervene where an applicant&#039;s appeal had been dismissed by the tribunal, except in the most compelling circumstances. In cases where an applicant still has an avenue of appeal, such as an application for judicial review of an immigration decision, it would not be appropriate for a Minister to intervene.

We are doing all we can to improve not only the decision-making process and the information made available during that process, and how the IND and the Home Office work with MPs and their caseworkers and correspond about cases, but more broadly in creating a more robust asylum process, rooted in the 1951&nbsp;convention, which is and must be our starting point.

<a name="stpa_404">In conclusion, the IND and the Home Office are doing things far more efficiently, but not in the context of a more hard-headed approach or a growing unwillingness to use discretion. Of course the asylum system, rooted in the 1951&nbsp;convention and the European convention on human rights, is and should be about dealing with political repression and the circumstances of specific cases and their ins and outs. Rather than going into the specifics of a case&#151;to be perfectly honest, it would be inappropriate to do so on the Floor of the House or in any public forum&#151;it is right and proper that I have dwelt on the broader issues that I hope will be of some use to my right hon. Friend.
