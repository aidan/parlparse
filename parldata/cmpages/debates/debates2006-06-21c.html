 The new office of the third sector will build on steps taken since 1997, including significantly increased resources and the compact on joint working, to ensure that we can support the third sector&#146;s role in all aspects of our national life, whether it is helping to deliver public services, running social enterprises, or campaigning for social justice.</p>

 My hon. Friend is entirely right. The third sector can play an important role in innovating and getting close to the user, which the public sector sometimes cannot. For Labour Members, the fact that we have increased public spending since 1997 to deliver improved public services is absolutely consistent with an increased role for the third sector in delivery. Using the third sector is not about Government abdicating their responsibilities to fund public services adequately.</p>

 The hon. Lady raises an important point about the operation of the Criminal Records Bureau in relation to volunteers. One of the important things about the CRB is that volunteers do not get charged for having the check done. She is right that there is a balance to be struck between the necessary protections that we need and ensuring that it is not done in a bureaucratic way. We are working with the CRB on streamlining the process for the voluntary sector and will continue to work on that in the coming months.</p>

We are attempting to improve the streets, but in some cases we do not know who owns the house in question. In other cases, the owners have refused to improve the property. We have now decided to take over the management of such houses, improve them and bring them up to the standards that we want for those homes. They will then become available to the owners if they wish to take them back. The payment for the improvements will come from the rents that we will impose on them.

It is true that we need to do much more, and we are looking at that, but if we want to protect our borders properly, the electronic border system that we are introducing will be important.

He tried to suggest that the Sentencing Guidelines Council was the reason why he voted against the Criminal Justice Act 2003. Actually, he was in favour of the Sentencing Guidelines Council, and his party&#146;s spokesman at the time said that it was &#147;admirable&#148;. The reason why Conservative Members voted against the 2003 Act was the issue of withdrawal of trial by jury&#151;on which, incidentally, they were also wrong. It was not because the measures were too soft; it was because they were too tough.</p>

When the energy review is published, he will see that as well as dealing with the difficult issue of nuclear power, there will be a great emphasis on energy efficiency and renewable energy. The frank and brutal truth is that we will have to act through a whole range of measures to ensure that we can both guarantee energy supplies and reduce carbon dioxide emissions.</p>

 First, I entirely agree with what the hon. Gentleman says about what was obviously a shocking crime. I agree that we are providing more prison places precisely because those who need to be in prison should be in prison. However, I point out that as a result of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, such people can now be given indeterminate sentences, in which case they are not automatically paroled, but released only when they are no longer a danger to the community. It was precisely because of cases such as the one that he mentioned that we introduced the provision, and I think that I am right in saying that almost 1,000 people have been subject to it.</p>

I think that where we can get the right partnership between the independent and voluntary sector and the public sector, we should have it, but it is all according to one principle, which is NHS care free at the point of use.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o21"><a name="60621-0004.htm_para5"><a name="06062158000191">I thank you, Mr. Speaker, for the opportunity once again to introduce a Bill on an issue that I sincerely believe to be dear to the hearts of so many in this country. The date of 23 April as the day of the patron saint of England means a great deal to the people of our country throughout our green and pleasant land. Sadly, it has become undervalued in recent times. When I introduced a similar Bill in autumn 2004, it was unfortunately defeated after an impassioned speech by the then Labour Member of Parliament for Hornchurch. Unfortunately for him, his constituents disagreed, remembering that to be born an Englishman is to have won the first prize in the lottery of life. I am pleased to say that my hon. Friend the new Conservative Member for Hornchurch (James Brokenshire) fully supports the Bill before the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o22"><a name="60621-0004.htm_para6"><a name="06062158000192">Some were also concerned that the previous Bill sought to remove May day as a public holiday. Although I am still personally in favour of that idea, hon. Members will notice that in the interests of gaining cross-party support such a clause is not included in the Bill before us. I should further make it clear that I am also in favour of extending the same rights for St Andrew&#146;s day in Scotland and St David&#146;s day in Wales, but I shall leave that to other hon. Members, although I am sure that some of the reasoning that I shall put forward today is valid for all parts of the United Kingdom.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o23"><a name="60621-0004.htm_para7"><a name="06062158000193">It is not just I who wish formally to recognise the day. Many people and organisations are clamouring for St George&#146;s day to be given adequate recognition. Indeed, St George&#146;s day is fast becoming a national event. Last year, a third of members of the Trades Union Congress voted in favour of reclaiming the day for public enjoyment and celebration; unsurprisingly, the Royal Society of  St George is also doing an enormous amount to promote St George&#146;s day; and if anyone was lucky enough to have visited Romford market on 23 April this year, as I was, they will have noticed that every stall displayed the cross of St George flag, as market traders proclaimed pride in their country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o24"><a name="60621-0004.htm_para8"><a name="06062158000194">In Romford, red roses were handed out in the town centre by my local St George&#146;s committee. Flags were given away to children and live music and entertainment were provided. As you might expect, Mr. Speaker, my loyal Staffordshire bull terrier, Buster, did a walkabout dressed in the flag of St George, proving once again that he is Romford&#146;s most patriotic dog. Indeed, there was a genuine belief that people of all backgrounds wanted to celebrate the day. My local council, the London borough of Havering, ensures that the flag of St George is displayed alongside the Union flag, not only on  23 April but throughout the year. Many hon. Members will have experienced the same sense of celebration in their constituencies, as businesses, shops, schools, scout groups, charities, sports clubs and churches joined in the commemoration of England&#146;s own day.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o25"><a name="60621-0004.htm_para9"><a name="06062158000195">Many people choose to celebrate St George&#146;s day, because it represents the true spirit of England. Making it a public holiday would give all the people of England a wonderful opportunity to participate in events and parties celebrating our country. A fine example of such a practice is to be found in Ireland, where St Patrick&#146;s day&#151;17 March&#151;is famously celebrated. Gibraltar&#146;s national day&#151;10 September&#151;is a magnificent celebration not only of Gibraltarians&#146; pride in being British but of their love of their homeland. On the Isle of Man, Tynwald day is a public holiday, with celebrations throughout the island, and the Falkland islands mark Liberation day and Battle day with public holidays and celebrations. British people everywhere else are proud to participate in the celebration of our culture, history and heritage, so why not in England? Australia, New Zealand, Canada, the United States and scores of countries, particularly in Scandinavia, celebrate their national day in style, with great pageantry as well as great parties. In Switzerland, 1 August is a wonderful day in the calendar of that proud independent nation at the heart of Europe, with the sound of alpine horns and cow bells echoing throughout the land as the distinctive Swiss flag flies from every building and, indeed, every home. It is no accident that all those nations have a strong sense of pride in their national identity, which is a source of strength and unity in any country. I hope that England follows their example and gives our country an annual day to remember and cherish.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o26"><a name="60621-0004.htm_para10"><a name="06062158000196">There are economic advantages in celebrating St George&#146;s day. A recent study by the &#147;Value of St George&#148; campaign, which aims to make companies aware of the benefits of making our patron saint&#146;s day a national celebration, said that while celebrations had increased, much more could be done. It concluded that businesses across England were missing out on nearly &#163;40 million a year by failing to celebrate their national day as much as their Irish counterparts. During the World cup, there has been a resurgence in English pride. The Prime Minister and my right hon. Friend the Leader of the Opposition have shown their pride in St George by displaying the flag on their homes and bicycles. What better way to show our support, thanks and pride in our rugby team, who won the World cup, our cricket team, who won the Ashes, our Olympic team, who have won many gold medals, and our football team, who will win the football World cup, than by making St George&#146;s day a public holiday in England?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o27"><a name="60621-0004.htm_para11"><a name="06062158000197">St George&#146;s day is a day when we can celebrate Englishness, represented not only by sporting achievement but, at best, by great English heroes such as Churchill, Nelson, Wellington, Shakespeare and Margaret Thatcher, who all believed in the values of St George. Ours is a country that believes in tolerance and understanding, welcoming everyone who wants to celebrate our English way of life under the red and white banner of  St George. Let us not allow our pride and enjoyment in taking part in the World cup to be forgotten in a month&#146;s time. It is time that we celebrated pride in our country, our flag and our English way of life and allowed all English men and women to celebrate their heritage and culture each and every year. Therefore, I call on all Members&#151;of all parties, and from all regions and countries in the United Kingdom&#151;to join me and to celebrate 23 April in order to allow England to come  <br>

Many Members of this House&#151;and many in the other place&#151;have taken a keen interest in the debate on charter renewal and in the negotiations on the BBC licence fee. However, we learned that the licence fee announcement had been postponed from the expected date in late July until some time at the end of this year not from the Secretary of State on the Floor of the House, or anywhere else in the House, but from comments she made at a recent drinks party, which <i> The Guardian</i> reported.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o34"><a name="60621-0004.htm_para18"><a name="06062158000206">Can the Minister tell us why the decision was announced in that way? Can he also tell us the reason for the delay, because as yet we have received no official explanation? Indeed, it does not even warrant a statement on the Department for Culture, Media and Sport website. Is the reason for the delay, as some suggest, that the recent reports by PKF and Indepen have undermined the submission made by the BBC, or has the Secretary of State simply kicked the decision into the long grass?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o35"><a name="60621-0004.htm_para19"><a name="06062158000207">All that adds to a sense that there has been a lack of transparency in how the negotiations have so far been conducted. The process has been dogged by delays and  <br>

 That is an important point. It will be said that we must preserve the BBC&#146;s editorial independence, which is absolutely right. It has also been said that the public do not want politicians interfering with the BBC, but that is not what we are talking about with regard to NAO involvement. The World Service has had the NAO looking at its books since its inception, and no one has ever suggested that the NAO has any impact on editorial independence. That is a red herring.</p>

 Again, my hon. Friend is entirely right. The NAO has examined the World Service&#146;s books for many years, and it is increasingly able, almost by invitation, to examine some of the BBC&#146;s books. But the 30 per cent. of people questioned who expressed dissatisfaction with the BBC might be more inclined to express some satisfaction if they knew that there was full and transparent accounting of where the money is going and what, at the end of the day, they are being invited to pay for.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o58"><a name="60621-0005.htm_para16"><a name="06062158000251">I was extremely pleased to hear one thing from the hon. Gentleman&#151;that he was glad to be able to support the future of the BBC. However, like a child picking a daisy and proceeding to pull every petal off until there was nothing left, he and his hon. Friends proceeded to attack it, describing it in terms of poll taxes and stealth taxes and as being over-funded. He asked us not to interfere, then asked us to interfere in the pay of presenters. As always, one contradiction followed another.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o59"><a name="60621-0005.htm_para17"><a name="06062158000252">It may be helpful if I bring some appropriate clarity to what is really happening, as opposed to the caricature presented by the hon. Gentleman, and by the leader of his party in a recent speech to the Newspaper Society, with regard to what the BBC is doing and what we are doing in the review of the charter and the settlement of the licence fee.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o60"><a name="60621-0005.htm_para18"><a name="06062158000253">The review of the BBC charter has been conducted against a background of unprecedented public consultation. From the beginning of the review at the end of 2003, we were determined that it would be the most comprehensive and open process in the history of the BBC. For the benefit of hon. Members, and to help the hon. Member for East Devon, I remind him that we have so far held three major public consultations, with more than 10,000 respondents. We have run a comprehensive research programme, inviting further responses from the public. We have held regional tours, seminars, webcasts and public meetings. During the review there have been four Select Committee reports and several parliamentary debates in both Houses. In addition, we have produced a Green Paper, a White Paper and two draft charters and agreements.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o61"><a name="60621-0005.htm_para19"><a name="06062158000254">The purpose was clear from the beginning and it remains our guiding principle to deliver the strong and independent BBC that the public want. We recognise that the BBC has a unique place in the esteem and affection of the nation. It is one of the most trusted public institutions in the country, and it is an institution with which we have all grown up. In today&#146;s debate, let us try not to play politics with the BBC. Let us recognise the role that we believe the public want the BBC to play for the future. If we get that right, we will do the right thing not just for ourselves and our respective parties, but for the public.</p>

 The BBC is the largest employer in my constituency. The representations that I receive from staff show that although they are appreciative of the consultation process, they are looking for a decision and for clarity with respect to oversight and funding. Why have those key decisions been postponed? That is not good for morale in the BBC. The Minister would have the support of key staff in the BBC if he brought about some accelerated decision making.</p>

 The Minister rightly claims credit for the wide consultation that has taken place. Consultation is all very well, but what matters is whether the Government listen.

 I wholeheartedly agree with my hon. Friend that we need a strong BBC and that we should not fetter it so much that it is unable to flourish in future generations. Britain would sadly miss the BBC. However, in some areas, particularly in commercial radio, there are legitimate concerns about the overweening power of the BBC, as reflected in Radio 1 and Radio 2, both of which I enjoy listening to. I wonder whether the BBC sometimes crowds others out of the marketplace.</p>

 The BBC, of course, engages in new media and new technology. People who are being asked to pay a licence fee would expect that. The questions that my hon.

 I fully recognise the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point. He is an excellent constituency MP in the north-west, and I know how strongly he has lobbied. I am sure that he will have been pleased by last week&#146;s announcement by the governors. In the course of my remarks, I will discuss the proposed move to Greater Manchester&#151;specifically, Salford media city.</p>

Members on both sides of the House think that the BBC epitomises the best of what the nation has to offer in service industries. It commands respect around the world&#151;indeed, it sells its programmes around the world&#151;and has endured and evolved in the context of a vibrant, dynamic commercial sector. We should pay close attention to the charter review and involve the public because we are, after all, setting the direction of the BBC, which will inform the direction of the market for the next 10 years. We must get it right, and that includes the licence fee.</p>

 If my hon. Friend means the excellent programmes that the BBC makes, I agree absolutely. If he means the way in which the BBC appropriately gets involved in innovation so that it can compete in the global media market, that is right, too.</p>

Member for East Devon suggested that the Government somehow made known the date for the announcement at <i> The Guardian </i>cocktail party. However, he chose to forget the fact that a specific date has never been set for the announcement of the date for settlement of the licence. There is a date by which the announcement must be made, which is early next year, but I am sorry to tell the hon. Gentleman that, despite the jokes and caricatures, he is simply wrong. Throughout the process, we have made it clear that the figure will be produced by the beginning of next year. We have always said that, although if we can produce the figure more quickly, we will.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o64"><a name="60621-0006.htm_para1"><a name="06062158000267">What matters is that we get the fee right. The hon. Gentleman cannot have it both ways. One cannot say that one wants absolute certainty that value for money has been obtained, that the bid has been taken to pieces and that the figure is right, but then say that it would be far better to publish the figure tomorrow. What matters is getting it right for the BBC and for the licence fee payer. The settlement will not be driven by inappropriate pressure or haste. Trying to play politics with settling the licence fee by arguing for an early settlement is not in the interests of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s constituents or of viewers throughout the country.</p>

 My hon. Friend the Member for East Devon (Mr. Swire) raised specific questions about BBC funding, particularly in relation to the licence fee, and the heart of the matter is the cost of the spectrum charge. One reason why we called the debate is that the figures used to calculate the licence fee are ambiguous. Will the Minister take the opportunity to discuss who will pay the spectrum charge and how it will relate to the taxpayer and the BBC?</p>

 There are legitimate concerns among commercial broadcasters about advertising revenue, and an excessive licence fee settlement would distort the market and prevent some commercial broadcasters from spending money on quality productions, such as dramas.

 The hon. Gentleman has made an important point about the commercial sector and advertising. However, it may be worth reminding him that the problems faced by the commercial sector in television and advertising are not unique. Some regional newspapers, for example, face a crisis generated by advertising spend. Advertising and the commercial media is a huge issue, and the danger is that it is viewed as a problem created by the BBC, which is not the case. The  <br>

last licence fee was settled seven years ago, when there was unprecedented growth in advertising for commercial television. Since then, the market has changed dramatically, which has created a whole new set of pressures.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o65"><a name="60621-0006.htm_para2"><a name="06062158000272">We must examine the impact of the settlement on not only commercial ITV, but regional newspapers. There is a problem, but there is also an opportunity. Most people who run regional newspapers agree that they have been slightly late in recognising the advantages offered by online facilities. Innovation and competition will probably allow regional newspapers to sort out some of their problems, but there is no simple solution for the commercial problems faced by ITV in a market in which overall advertising has decreased in the past few years. It is a mistake to caricature the matter by saying that the problem is the fault of the BBC and that it can be fixed by removing the BBC from certain areas. That is not the right solution, and it would be dangerous to go down that road.</p>

 The Minister has rightly said that regional newspapers must look to alternative methods of distribution, such as online content, in order to preserve their market position.

little experience of his party, that I was not aware of a great rush for more transparency on any subject during the two years when I sat on his side of the House. Looking back on the way in which Conservative Members conducted themselves in relation to the BBC and the licence fee review, let alone the charter, I do not recall that transparency was up front. That compares significantly with the process in which we have been engaging.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o69"><a name="60621-0006.htm_para6"><a name="06062158000280">The hon. Member for East Devon completely ignored the levels of public consultation that we have engaged in relentlessly for three years. He completely ignored the work of the independent advisers commissioned to scrutinise the bid of the BBC and the fact that we have published, and will continue to publish, the advice that we receive. He ignored the research we have conducted into the public&#146;s willingness to pay, which we have said we will publish, as we will. That research is helping to inform us in the Department in getting the right figure rather than the hasty figure that he would like. He ignored the work that has been done by Lord Burns in the course of advising us on the settlement, and he ignored the advice that we have invited and received from the industry.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o70"><a name="60621-0006.htm_para7"><a name="06062158000281">If it is transparency and robust scrutiny that inform the demand for debate, I urge hon. Members to reflect on the sheer scale and volume of consultation and the transparency in which it has been conducted. It is of course open to Parliament to express its views on such matters in such debates, as it is to Select Committees. In fact, Select Committees have been looking at this issue for some time, not only in this House but in another place. It is right that they offer clear advice and conclusions about the level of the licence fee and the process that produces that settlement. Parliament has the right to object to changes to the level of the licence fee. Under the negative resolution procedure, it remains open to the House to debate the statutory instrument that sets that level.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o71"><a name="60621-0006.htm_para8"><a name="06062158000282">Before we lose sight of the real argument, let us remember that in the course of the consultation we went directly to those people whom we represent here in this House, as we have relentlessly for three years. One of the documents produced more than two years ago on the review of the charter said that when the public were asked who they wanted to have a greater say in running the BBC, Parliament did not do very well. I suggest that hon. Members who want more and more say should go back to what the public said to us about whether they wanted us to have more involvement or less. One cannot have it both ways. One cannot say, &#147;Let&#146;s have less interference,&#148; and then demand more.</p>

 The crucial matter at the heart of this is that the licence fee is now called a licence tax.

 Of course it is a tax; that is why the Government should be at the heart of setting it and should not abdicate the responsibility to the National Audit Office. The NAO should be involved in advising us, but at the end of the day it is rightly a decision for Government.</p>

It is very simple: it will not. That is why we are not proceeding with the hasty and pressured response that the hon. Member for East Devon would like. The settlement will give the BBC the funds that it needs to deliver its work for the public&#151;in the words of an author slung out of the Conservative party, &#147;not a penny more, not a penny less&#148;. The licence fee is not flawless. We recognise that for those on lower incomes a greater proportion of their disposable income will be spent on their licence fee&#151;that is common sense. However, as a percentage of household income, it has declined since 1982. In survey after survey, the licence fee still emerges as the best way to continue funding the BBC. We may call it the least worst option, because nobody much enjoys paying tax, but nobody has come up with a better way of doing it that commands the same incredibly high level of public support.</p>

Let me briefly explain what that means. For the first time, there will be an effective separation of the responsibility for challenging, scrutinising and strategic oversight of the BBC. The trust will undertake that responsibility. In a separate structure, the executive board will look after day-to-day management. That separation of powers is critical. That is critically different from what happens with the existing board of governors because we want to ensure that the conflicting roles that governors have been obliged to play in the past are appropriately separated.</p>

 My right hon. Friend&#146;s brilliance is that I no longer need to remind hon. Members because he has so eloquently done so for me. He is right and gives a good example of the separation of powers.</p>

 The Minister is right that the powers of the public value test will reside with the trust rather than the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, as currently happens, and that Ofcom will provide the market value impact assessment. However, would not providing for Ofcom, rather than the trust, to make the final decisions about market value impact assessment on a new service be one solution to the uncertainty that the varying roles create?</p>

<p><a name="st_o169"><a name="06062158000302"><a name="60621-0006.htm_spnew24"><a name="06062158001330"><b>Mr. Woodward:</b>
 I am grateful for the hon. Gentleman&#146;s acceptance of the clarity and division between the roles of the trust and the executive board. However, I disagree with his interpretation and his conclusions about who ultimately determines the services that the BBC offers. I shall revert to that shortly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o76"><a name="60621-0006.htm_para13"><a name="06062158000303">We were concerned about the dual role that the board of governors played as regulator and cheerleader. The old system was not up to the job of providing clarity, which all hon. Members want, of direction and purpose for the BBC, especially in an increasingly complex global communications market.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o77"><a name="60621-0006.htm_para14"><a name="06062158000304">The charter and agreement will define the responsibilities of the new bodies clearly. That is critical in ensuring that the trust can hold the executive board to rigorous account in the interests of the public, who are the licence fee payers. The trust will have wide-ranging duties to consult the public and publish the reasoning behind decisions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o78"><a name="60621-0006.htm_para15"><a name="06062158000305">We and the public believe that the trust represents the most efficient way of protecting both the independence of the BBC and the interests of the licence fee payer. To do that, it needs the expertise to discharge its responsibilities in a professional and businesslike way. To have the best trust, we must ensure that its members are paid an appropriate salary to do their job. I recognise that criticisms have been made from some quarters in the House as well as in the wider press of the remuneration of the trust members.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o79"><a name="60621-0006.htm_para16"><a name="06062158000306">I stress that the decision on the rate of remuneration reflects the increased responsibilities and the commitment of time needed from trust members. That is entirely in line with the proposals in the White Paper on the charter review, which proposed that rates should be comparable with those for Ofcom board members. We believe that that will attract the widest range of candidates with stronger backgrounds and ensure that new trust members are the best people for the job.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o80"><a name="60621-0006.htm_para17"><a name="06062158000307">Since we put out the advertisement, we have received many applications and we expect more before 26 June. We want to encourage a diverse range of appropriate applicants. I stress to hon. Members who are present and those who may read the debate in <i> Hansard </i>that we should encourage those who are interested in broadcasting to apply. When hon. Members say that a flood of constituents come to their surgeries every Friday afternoon or Saturday morning to discuss the BBC, a short-term but good solution might be to ask some of them whether they have considered applying. It would be appropriate for more members of the general public, whatever their background, to put themselves forward to represent the public as trust members.</p>

 The point is that we are not trying to draw up an A list of candidates&#151;we are trying to invite the public to apply.

However, we do not want to dilute the BBC&#146;s ability to continue to set standards; nor do we want to create a neo-protectionist market in which existing and new competition are unable to thrive.

That is also why, in setting out its priorities, the trust will have to work with the grain of what others have to offer. The new purpose remits will provide a vehicle for ensuring that the trust engages with the world outside the BBC in deciding how the public purposes should be delivered. It is also why, to embed transparency and certainty in its decision making, we have put in place a new triple-lock system, comprising service licences, content characteristics and the public value test. It is important that the BBC&#146;s place in the market is not subject to caricature. Let me assure hon.

 We believe that we have set the appropriate arrangements in place. I shall not fantasise about exercises that I cannot imagine for the benefit of the hon. Gentleman. That would be absurd. We believe that we have set up the appropriate governance arrangements for the BBC, based on consultation with the public and the industry, and on the advice of Ofcom and of others who have given us expert advice over nearly three years.

Taken together, this is a powerful set of reforms for the BBC. For the public, that will lead to improvements in production and in the quality of the programmes that they see. They want a better BBC, and we intend to help them to have it. One of the mechanisms that we want to use to achieve that is the window of creative competition, which will help to stimulate further competition to produce quality and quantity in the programmes produced and put out by the BBC.</p>

 We need to understand that last week&#146;s announcement was that Salford is the preferred bidder. This has not been finalised yet, and it is important to consider the matter in that context. The BBC has clearly declared its interest in that area, and it is now conducting firm negotiations for the future there. My hon. Friend asked me about the potential of such a move. I spent 10 years working in the broadcasting industry in the 1980s, when it would have been almost impossible to conceive of the new media and new opportunities that exist now. This is a bit like trying to see round corners. The media city will provide the kind of opportunities that we see when we visit places such as Seoul or Dubai, where media opportunities have been created as a result of extraordinary growth.</p>

He does not need to spend any money actually visiting them; he can do the research here. If he does, he will see that such development leads to huge growth, massive numbers of new jobs and&#151;in the case of Salford&#151;the opportunity to bring in not only the BBC, independent production houses and commercial competition but the games industry, the software industry, the music industry and the film industry.</p>

We have to see this development in the context of the fantastic renaissance and regeneration that is happening in the north-west generally.

There is an awful lot happening, and it is absolutely right that the BBC has made this strategic decision, and that it has chosen the Salford bid.

 Having had a number of conversations across the industry, I have not received the impression that the senior managers in the BBC who are making this decision have any intention of wriggling out of it. They genuinely see the advantages of moving to the Greater Manchester area, and of diversification and greater regional production. They also see the advantages of bringing in talent that has been constrained by the perception of the BBC as being so London-centric. My hon.

At the end of the era, if it does not have that, it will not have the services to offer. They have also recognised that places such as Dubai, Seoul and other locations in the far east&#151;which offer different services but use a similar model&#151;create opportunities through diversification, which does a huge amount of good to the local, regional and national economy.</p>

 Does the Minister agree that more than just personnel and resources are involved in devolution, as the mindset is also important, along with recognition of the different features and factors of the modern UK? Scotland has its own Government and its own national life, but we still have a news service that is metropolitan based and becoming increasingly irrelevant. Surely as part of devolution, we should start looking into having a Scottish news service that serves the Scottish people. We should be moving towards regional and national news services.</p>

 I acknowledge that. Of course we believe in devolution, but the programmes are a matter for the broadcasters. We already have services such as BBC Scotland. Some hon. Members were rather denigrating the BBC&#146;s creation of local news services earlier. I invite them to go and see what the BBC does and the services it offers. In an interactive age, it will get easier for people to make local programmes&#151;exactly what the hon. Member for Perth and North Perthshire (Pete Wishart) is asking for.

We have learned from the 70 per cent. of the UK that has gone digital so far that the real barrier is not income. By and large, the barrier to has been age and disability. If targeted assistance is to mean anything and we are to get best value from the money given to the BBC to enable the rest of Britain to complete switchover by 2012, we will have to take some tough decisions.</p>

I do not deny that it might be in some cases, but the real barrier is the people who are 75 or 80&#151;or even my age of 47&#151;and feel challenged by a remote control.

 We are now about two years from the commencement of digital switchover, so it is critical to know what the licence fee will be before it begins, but there appears to be some dislocation. When we debated the announcement of the licence fee, the Minister stated categorically that at no stage would a date be published. However, I have with me a document, &#147;BBC Charter Review: Your BBC, Your Say&#148;, which was printed five minutes ago from a DCMS website. It states that phase 3 includes</p>

Is the Minister wrong, or is it the website? If it is the website, I suggest that the Minister urge his civil servants to amend it. If he is wrong, perhaps he will retract his statement.</p>

 I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for bringing that to our attention. What it reveals is that we said that we were going to have a debate, which we are having. Secondly, it shows that we said that we would make an announcement about the licence fee. The hon. Gentleman has referred to the fact that a document mentions mid-2006, but it does not provide a specific date&#151;<i> [Interruption.] </i>That is what the hon. Gentleman said. Let me tell him that he will get a date when it is right for us to make the announcement. What we will not do, however endearing, charismatic and persistent he is in his demands, is make the announcement before the right time, which will be when we have achieved the right number.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o99"><a name="60621-0007.htm_para18"><a name="06062158000344">After nearly three years, this process is drawing to a close and the announcement on the fee will be made shortly. It might be made in a few months, but I am afraid that the hon. Member for East Devon will have to wait. We have conducted the debate with extensive public consultation and the issues have been discussed in Parliament through Select Committees and in Green and White Papers. An extensive process of consultation has taken place on the charter and the licence fee settlement. The end product will be a BBC that is right and forward-looking, helping to create the appropriate marketplace for the UK in the digital age.</p>

changing world of broadcasting, we must ensure a future for the BBC that enables it to remain the best in the world and the envy of the world. That means, in my view, that it must be strong, independent&#151;not least from the Government&#151;and well and securely funded. It must be equipped to meet the challenges of the digital multi-channel, multi-platform age.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o100"><a name="60621-0007.htm_para19"><a name="06062158000346">We believe that much in the White Paper, to which the Minister has already referred, and in the draft charter and agreement will help to achieve those aims. Liberal Democrats certainly welcome the decision to have a 10-year charter, which will provide stability for the BBC through the period of digital switchover. We welcome the increased opportunities for independent television production through the window of creative opportunity, but I hope that the BBC will work harder to provide more opportunities for independent radio producers than they have at present. We welcome the concept of service licences for each BBC service, but like the hon. Member for East Devon (Mr. Swire), I certainly believe that we need greater differentiation in the services covered by such licences.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o101"><a name="60621-0007.htm_para20"><a name="06062158000347">Although I have some concerns, which I shall explain in a few moments, we welcome the improvements in the system to assess market impact and public value in respect of new BBC services or the development of existing services. We accept that the licence fee is, as the Minister described it, the least worst option currently available. It is certainly far better than alternatives such as direct Government funding, subscription, advertisements or sponsorship. We also welcome and support the planned move to Salford Quays in Greater Manchester.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o102"><a name="60621-0007.htm_para21"><a name="06062158000348">As critical friends of the BBC, we have a number of remaining concerns about some of the Government&#146;s proposals&#151;most notably governance, which the Minister dwelt on. He was absolutely right to say that the old system under which the governors were both flag wavers for and regulators of the BBC was simply untenable and had to change.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o103"><a name="60621-0007.htm_para22"><a name="06062158000349">We propose that a totally independent regulator should be established for all public service broadcasters. We certainly do not believe that what the Government propose will give us what is urgently needed&#151;a genuinely independent regulator. For example, some of the existing governors will transfer to the new trust. That is certainly evidence of continuity, rather than radical overhaul. Perhaps more importantly, the White Paper very clearly describes the BBC Trust as a</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o107"><a name="60621-0008.htm_para3"><a name="06062158000353">We are convinced that the trust is an improvement on the current governor arrangements, but it still does not provide an independent regulator, so the BBC will be its own judge and jury. That will certainly give no confidence to people who fear that, as was suggested by the hon. Member for Rhondda (Chris Bryant), the BBC will use its powers to crowd out others from the marketplace if it does not have an independent regulator to make those decisions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o108"><a name="60621-0008.htm_para4"><a name="06062158000354">Indeed, we have already heard from a number of hon. Members that similar concerns have been expressed by a wide range of bodies in the broadcasting and media sector. I have certainly heard such views from local and regional newspapers&#151; including <i> The Bath Chronicle</i> in my constituency<i> , </i>which is excellent&#151;from the commercial radio sector and from other TV and internet companies. Yes, we have a better system now, but if the BBC is ultimately to be its own judge and jury, the system will not give the BBC&#146;s competitors confidence about whether they will be protected from being crowded out.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o109"><a name="60621-0008.htm_para5"><a name="06062158000355">Just before I turn to the licence fee, I want briefly to mention three other issues relating to the BBC&#146;s future. First, although I acknowledge the advice that Lord Justice Auld gave in 2001, I fail to understand why licence fee evasion should continue to be a criminal offence. I hope that the Government are prepared to reconsider that issue, and find out whether such evasion could become a civil offence&#151;and, incidentally, whether we could introduce a fixed penalty system, like those used for failing to pay parking fines, the congestion charge or whatever.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o110"><a name="60621-0008.htm_para6"><a name="06062158000356">Secondly, hon. Members have already expressed the view that we want to see a strong BBC, but not an omnipotent BBC. The BBC benefits from competition in public service broadcasting. A monopoly would benefit no one, including the BBC. We need to do more than is currently proposed to protect the other players who deliver public service broadcasting, including some, such as Sky and those in the commercial radio sector, who are not defined as public service broadcasters but make an important contribution to public service broadcasting. I certainly welcome the BBC&#146;s proposals to work in partnership with, for instance, Channel 4, but we also need not only stronger measures to protect the market but a much more urgent review than is currently planned of what the hon. Member for East Devon called PSB in the round.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o111"><a name="60621-0008.htm_para7"><a name="06062158000357">Thirdly, all hon. Members would accept that the World Service is the jewel in the crown. Many of us are delighted at the World Service&#146;s proposals to introduce a new television service in the middle east, but I simply fail to understand why, for the sake of just &#163;6 million, we cannot ensure that it becomes a 24-hour service, rather than the 12-hour service that is proposed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o112"><a name="60621-0008.htm_para8"><a name="06062158000358">Now I come to the crucial issue of the licence fee. Like others, I am concerned by the undoubted delay in the Government&#146;s announcement of the licence fee. It worries me enormously that we will end up with two separate announcements&#151;one about the charter and agreement, and the other about the licence fee. Surely those announcements need to be brought together. In other words, we need a menu with prices.</p>

<p><a name="st_o189"><a name="06062158000359"><a name="60621-0008.htm_spnew0"><a name="06062158001350"><b>Daniel Kawczynski (Shrewsbury and Atcham) (Con):</b>
 I, too, applaud the hon. Gentleman&#146;s sentiments about the BBC World Service, but does he agree that it is regrettable that the BBC is cutting some radio services to eastern Europe?</p>

<p><a name="st_o190"><a name="06062158000360"><a name="60621-0008.htm_spnew1"><a name="06062158001351"><b>Mr. Foster:</b>
 In fairness, I must say that the BBC has looked very carefully at that issue, and has been in discussion with the Foreign Office about the services that it will cut. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will agree that the listening figures for the vast majority of those services do not justify their continuation in comparison with the benefits that will accrue from the new television service in the middle east. Of course, in an ideal world one would want the continuation and development of all those services, but people must work within a tight budget. Sadly, the BBC cannot even get an extra &#163;6 million for the middle east television service.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o113"><a name="60621-0008.htm_para9"><a name="06062158000361">On the overall figure, the BBC proposes to use the formula of the retail prices index plus 2.3 per cent. Since it made that announcement in November, a number of its figures have changed. For example, the cost of the welcome move to Manchester has gone down, whereas its expected pension costs have gone up. I understand from the BBC that the net effect of all the changes will not substantially alter the proposal to use the RPI plus 2.3 per cent. formula. I hope that, as the Minister has indicated, the most up-to-date costings supplied by the BBC will be published in the near future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o114"><a name="60621-0008.htm_para10"><a name="06062158000362">I suggest that, for two reasons, the BBC&#146;s proposed figure is too high. First, we must be mindful of the effect of a cash-rich BBC, combined with inadequate independent regulation, on the rest of the broadcasting and media ecology. That point has been well made already. Secondly, the BBC&#146;s figures include costs that simply should not fall on the licence fee payer. Providing free television licences for the over-75s was a Government policy, and the Department for Work and Pensions rightly hands over millions of pounds every year to the BBC to make up its lost revenue. Similarly, digital switchover is a Government policy, so it should be paid for by the Government, possibly from the revenues that they will gain from the disposal of the analogue spectrum. It certainly should not be a cost for the licence fee payer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o115"><a name="60621-0008.htm_para11"><a name="06062158000363">Similarly, the Minister talks about the hundreds of millions of pounds that will be spent on the very important targeted assistance to help the elderly and vulnerable to benefit from the digital revolution. That is a sensible policy, but it is a Government social policy, and therefore it should be paid for by the Government, not by the licence fee payer. Those are not broadcasting costs, as the Government keep describing them, but Government policy costs. Charging the licence fee payer for them is simply a smash-and-grab raid&#151;yet another stealth tax, as others might call it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o116"><a name="60621-0008.htm_para12"><a name="06062158000364">If the Government were to go still further, as some have already suggested, by imposing a spectrum charge on the BBC, which, in turn, the licence fee payer would have to bear, it would be yet another smash-and-grab raid. I therefore hope that the Government will look carefully at the independent report produced in April this year by .econ that concluded:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o119"><a name="60621-0008.htm_para15"><a name="06062158000367">As other hon. Members&#151;notably, the hon. Member for East Devon&#151;have already pointed out, it has been argued in various other reports, such as ITV&#146;s Indepen report or the PKF report, that the BBC&#146;s licence fee is too high for other reasons, and I shall deal with those reasons briefly.</p>

<p><a name="st_o191"><a name="06062158000368"><a name="60621-0008.htm_spnew2"><a name="06062158001352"><b>Mr. Whittingdale:</b>
 The hon. Gentleman is presenting a number of very good arguments. He said that the BBC&#146;s bid of RPI plus 2.3 contained elements that were unjustified. The assistance package is not included in that figure; once it is included, the bid becomes even larger.</p>

<p><a name="st_o192"><a name="06062158000369"><a name="60621-0008.htm_spnew3"><a name="06062158001353"><b>Mr. Foster:</b>
 That is absolutely true. A number of other issues have not yet been taken into account, which is why it is so important for us to debate them. However, because I do not believe that any Member of Parliament&#151;and that includes me&#151;is capable of doing full justice to all the competing claims that have featured in the Indepen report and the PKF report and have emanated from the BBC and others, it is also crucial for us to ask the National Audit Office not only to take a greater role in scrutinising the BBC&#146;s accounts, but to take a much greater and an immediate role in scrutinising the various reports and proposals. As I am sure the hon. Gentleman knows, some reports have suggested that the BBC has not taken adequate account of the number of new homes that will be built and the number of households that will consequently pay the licence fee. The hon. Gentleman will also know that a number of people have said that the BBC&#146;s proposals do not give enough weight to the savings that could be made through greater efficiency.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o120"><a name="60621-0008.htm_para16"><a name="06062158000370">I am aware that the BBC has contradicted those claims, but as I have said, I am not in a position to judge the competing claims being made. That is why the NAO must have that crucial scrutiny role, and must report to Parliament following its scrutiny. Not only is that in the Conservatives&#146; motion, but the Liberal Democrats proposed it back in 2003.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o121"><a name="60621-0008.htm_para17"><a name="06062158000371">The hon. Member for East Devon was absolutely right to say, as does the motion, that Parliament should have the final say on the level of the licence fee. That is not a subject for a debate in a Committee Room on a negative resolution. There must be a substantive amendable motion, which must be approved on the Floor of the House. I accept what the Minister said about research evidence: the public will be willing to wear an additional licence fee&#151;but only if they are confident that they will not be paying for things for which they should not be paying, and that they will benefit from improved quality and value for money.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o122"><a name="60621-0008.htm_para18"><a name="06062158000372">This is a crucial debate, and one that the Government should have initiated by now.

<p><a name="stpa_o123"><a name="60621-0008.htm_para19"><a name="06062158000376">One thing that the BBC has done is make a major contribution to digital switchover through the innovation of Freeview, following the failure of the ITV digital project. I pay tribute to Greg Dyke for his initiative in bringing that about. Another of his initiatives, also deserving of tribute, is the decision to move to the north-west. I am convinced that the BBC fully intends the move to go ahead. It would be idle of me to deny that there is disappointment in the city of Manchester over the provisional decision to move to Salford&#151;I understand that that is likely to happen, although not overwhelmingly likely, as the BBC has still to make the final decisions&#151;but whether the move is to the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Manchester, Central (Tony Lloyd) or to Salford Quays, which is a superb area of innovation, what is important is the recognition that a new centre of media initiative and a new cluster of enterprise is being created. I pay tribute to the BBC for making it clear, very firmly, that it wants the move to the north-west to go ahead.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o124"><a name="60621-0008.htm_para20"><a name="06062158000377">It is obvious that all broadcasters face huge challenges. As a tax-funded public corporation, the BBC has a special responsibility for meeting those challenges. When the Select Committee on Culture, Media and Sport, which I chaired before the election, looked into BBC charter renewal, we wanted&#151;anticipating the possibility of a new 10-year charter&#151;to think about the nature of the technological and content-related environment not just in 2006, but in 2016. Since the Committee reported and since the Government decided that the BBC should have that new 10-year charter, technological change has moved exponentially ahead within not much more than a year. Given the prospect of 10 more years following the end of this year, it is essential for the BBC, when making its plans, to take account of what Bernard Shaw had in mind in his play &#147;Back to Methuselah&#148; when he entitled the last act &#147;As Far as Thought can Reach&#148;.</p>

Anyone who moves around any of our cities, such as London or my own city of Manchester, will see young people wearing earphones and constantly looking at their mobile phones, not simply to make calls and send text messages but for all sorts of reasons. If the BBC is to be ahead of the game, as we all want it to be, and if it is to attract the kind of participation that will justify its being financed by a tax, it is essential for it to understand one thing. Although the concerns of many Members of Parliament are focused on the most conventional forms of BBC transmission, such as Radio 4, Radio 3 and even Radio 1 and Radio 2&#151;mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Rhondda (Chris Bryant)&#151;those are now very small minority channels in comparison with what a large number of people are using the BBC and broadcasting for.

The interactive services that it provides on BBC News 24, for example, are miles behind what Sky provides. The BBC mechanism is very clumsy, whereas Sky&#146;s is very clear.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o128"><a name="60621-0008.htm_para24"><a name="06062158000381">At one time, the BBC&#146;s principal website was regarded as the pioneer for all such sites, receiving large numbers of hits. I fear that that is no longer so, and newspaper websites such as those of <i> The Guardian </i>and <i> The Daily Telegraph</i> are far ahead of what one gets from BBC Online. That is another matter that the BBC needs to consider.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o129"><a name="60621-0008.htm_para25"><a name="06062158000382">It is perfectly clear that we need a public service broadcasting corporation that is not funded by advertising. I am very glad that we have the public service Channel 4, which does a superb job, as does the More4 channel. Channel 5 is now doing very well with its innovative and cultural broadcasting, but the BBC is unique, because it is funded by a tax. The House of Commons has decided that there should be a new BBC charter, and it is extremely important that the BBC reciprocates by ensuring that it leads technological change.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o130"><a name="60621-0008.htm_para26"><a name="06062158000383">That must not happen just for its own sake, as the BBC must take account of social change in this country. More and more people&#151;mainly but not exclusively young people&#151;are creating their own visual and audio entertainment and information channels.</p>

 I by thank my colleagues on the Opposition Front Bench for giving us this opportunity to debate the future of the BBC. Despite the Minister&#146;s claims about the number of debates that have been held and the scrutiny that has occurred, this is the House&#146;s first opportunity to debate it since the general election. We last debated it in March last year, when we considered the report of the Select Committee on Culture, Media and Sport, which I now chair, but which at that time was chaired by the right hon. Member for Manchester, Gorton (Sir Gerald Kaufman). It is a great pleasure to follow him this afternoon.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o133"><a name="60621-0008.htm_para29"><a name="06062158000387">Since then, the Government have published a White Paper on charter renewal, and the BBC has unveiled its bid for a licence fee settlement to cover the seven years from next April. The BBC&#146;s chairman and director-general chose to reveal the bid for the first time during the course of their evidence to the Select Committee last October. The Select Committee was able to question them about their plans, and I congratulate the BBC on a bold and brave initiative, which I hope will be maintained.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o134"><a name="60621-0008.htm_para30"><a name="06062158000388">The BBC bid was for 2.3 per cent. each year, over and above inflation. At the time it looked excessive, but increasing pressures since on commercial broadcasters have made it look even more disproportionate. However, if we are to consider the case for a licence fee increase, we must look at the case made at the time of the previous licence fee settlement. That was for 1.5 per cent. over inflation each year for seven years from 2000, and has led to the licence fee rising by well over a third since 1997. Yet the income from the fee has risen much faster, as the number of homes has increased steadily as well. As a result, the BBC&#146;s total licence fee income has grown by more than 50 per cent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o135"><a name="60621-0008.htm_para31"><a name="06062158000389">At the time of the previous settlement, the then Secretary of State said that he was</p>
<a name="60621-0008.htm_brev4"><a name="06062158001103"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;not going to allow the BBC the massive injection of funds that it has sought from the licence fee&#151;an increase reaching more than &#163;700 million a year by 2006.&#148;&#151;[<i> Official Report</i>,  21 February 2000; Vol. 344, c. 1239.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o136"><a name="60621-0008.htm_para32"><a name="06062158000390">In fact, the BBC&#146;s income in the period will have risen by very nearly &#163;1 billion, so it is no wonder that the present director-general said&#151;when he was in another capacity at Channel 4&#151;that the BBC had been bathing in a jacuzzi of cash.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o137"><a name="60621-0008.htm_para33"><a name="06062158000391">At the same time, the funds available to commercial broadcasters have been squeezed. There has been a proliferation of digital channels, and the switch to digital has meant that the main commercial broadcasters have seen a steady decline in the market share that they command and, as a result, in their advertising revenue as well.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o138"><a name="60621-0009.htm_para0"><a name="06062158000392">Moreover, advertising spend has been diverted to online services.

of personal video recorders and timeshifting will exert even greater pressure on commercial television. For that reason, the BBC&#146;s claims that, even after the licence fee settlement, it will have a smaller share of media revenues is at best disingenuous, since that includes internet advertising.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o139"><a name="60621-0009.htm_para1"><a name="06062158000393">In 1998, ITV and Channel 4 revenues exceeded the licence fee income by &#163;300 million. Indeed, the BBC argued at the time of the previous settlement that it needed an increase to keep up with commercial television. Now, the income from the licence fee is significantly greater than the combined advertising income of ITV, Channel 4, Channel 5, GMTV, S4C and all their associated channels.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o140"><a name="60621-0009.htm_para2"><a name="06062158000394">That is the context in which this licence fee bid must be judged. The BBC is already by far the biggest player: an increase of the size suggested would distort the market still further, and place it in too dominant a position.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o141"><a name="60621-0009.htm_para3"><a name="06062158000395">Of course, the BBC claims that the licence fee is good value for money. That is supported by some opinion surveys, but as long as the fee remains a compulsory television tax that people have no choice but to pay, it is difficult to judge its acceptability.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o142"><a name="60621-0009.htm_para4"><a name="06062158000396">The Government claim that the licence fee is subject to parliamentary scrutiny, but the Minister said earlier that that is achieved through the negative procedure. In no other area is a &#163;3 billion tax increased by a procedure that does not allow amendment and which is often not even debated. When it is debated, the proceedings last 90 minutes in a Committee Room upstairs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o143"><a name="60621-0009.htm_para5"><a name="06062158000397">The negative procedure also means that Parliament has no ability to approve or disapprove particular uses of licence fee money. We know that the BBC has asked for an increase of 2.3 per cent., but that does not include the cost of the assistance package. My Committee, like others, took the view that the licence fee is a social rather than a broadcasting cost, and that it should therefore be financed from Exchequer funds. I regret that the Government are unwilling to accept that.</p>

<p><a name="st_o197"><a name="06062158000398"><a name="60621-0009.htm_spnew0"><a name="06062158001358"><b>Chris Bryant:</b>

<p><a name="stpa_o144"><a name="60621-0009.htm_para6"><a name="06062158000400">We still do not know the total cost of the assistance package, but it will represent an extra amount on top of the licence fee. It will not be just a stealth tax, but rather a stealth poll tax, as the licence fee, as the motion correctly points out, hits low-income families hardest.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o145"><a name="60621-0009.htm_para7"><a name="06062158000401">The reason for that is a flaw in the licence fee itself. In the previous Parliament, the Select Committee under the chairmanship of the right hon. Member for Manchester, Gorton reported that the fee was regressive and unfair. In the long term, I do not think that it is sustainable, and I regret that the Government appear to have batted that question into the long grass for the course of the next licence fee period. I hope that the Government will consider at least some of the anomalies when they come to make their announcement. One in particular has been identified by the Select Committee&#151;that people who pay the licence fee by instalments end up paying more than those who make a one-off payment. That is another way, therefore, in which those on the lowest incomes have to bear the largest burden.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o146"><a name="60621-0009.htm_para8"><a name="06062158000402">I want to speak briefly about charter renewal. I welcome the creation of the BBC Trust; it improves the position of the governors, which was widely recognised as unsustainable after the Hutton report. However, Michael Grade had already put in place arrangements to distance the governors from the management of the BBC, so it is not clear how the new arrangement differs from what the BBC has already done. It does not resolve the underlying difficulty that the final arbiter of the behaviour of the BBC is a body that is part of the BBC. Ofcom has responsibility for tier 1 questions, but not for the key areas of the BBC&#146;s public service remit&#151;impartiality and fairness. Nowhere is that more important than in the area of the BBC&#146;s creative futures plan.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o147"><a name="60621-0009.htm_para9"><a name="06062158000403">The world is changing rapidly, as the right hon. Member for Manchester, Gorton pointed out; people are accessing media via the internet, iPods and mobile phones. It is right that the BBC should make programmes available on whatever platform people choose to use, but the BBC&#146;s plans go considerably further. It is not just making its programmes available on different platforms; it proposes to introduce whole new services. To take just one example: the BBC plans to make news content available to mobile providers for nothing, so that the consumer will pay a charge only to the mobile operator and not to the news provider. When asked about the impact of that new service on ITN, the BBC told the Committee that ITN could finance the service through advertising, but advertising is not developed on mobile so that suggestion is wholly unrealistic. The result will be that the BBC service undercuts a commercial service before it has even got off the ground.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o148"><a name="60621-0009.htm_para10"><a name="06062158000404">As has been said, there are concerns about the BBC&#146;s ambitions in the area of local newspapers, the creative archive and MyBBC Player, and the fact that the BBC&#146;s licence fee bid is for &#163;1.2 billion to finance new digital services means that there will be a major impact on the market. Under the new arrangements, the BBC&#146;s new services will be subject to a market impact assessment and a public value test, which is certainly a step forward. However, although Ofcom is due to carry out the market impact assessment, the final decision&#151;the public value test&#151;will rest with the BBC. By definition, that will be a subjective judgment. What criteria will the BBC apply to judge the public value of a new service when compared to the market? I share the view of my Front-Bench colleagues that it would have been better to give that decision to Ofcom rather than leaving it with the BBC. If the BBC is to make it, it is essential that each new individual service is subject to a public service licence and a market impact assessment. It is not good enough to have one service licence embracing all of them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o149"><a name="60621-0009.htm_para11"><a name="06062158000405">The BBC is an immensely powerful organisation and is often a force for considerable good, but it needs to be subject to proper checks. The measures in the motion will achieve that.</p>

That will complement the Government&#146;s strategy for investment in the regions, and the north-west is perfectly placed to nurture that creative investment and capitalise on it, which will be most beneficial to my Eccles constituents.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o151"><a name="60621-0009.htm_para13"><a name="06062158000408">In 2004, the BBC committed itself to establishing a state-of-the-art BBC centre in the Manchester area with</p>

All that was to be achieved by 2010.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o153"><a name="60621-0009.htm_para15"><a name="06062158000410">It is a wise commitment. In the past decade, cultural and economic development in the north-west has been increasing rapidly, and the area is now the busiest production centre outside London. The success of the BBC&#146;s investment will be central to sustaining the growth of the media industry and the regional economy. I shall summarise that growth. Filming in Manchester rose by 30 per cent in 2005-06, with 2005 being the busiest year ever. In the first quarter of this year, production in Merseyside reached &#163;6.7 million, constituting a huge increase on the previous year. Following the opening of North West Vision&#146;s film office in Cumbria, a two-week shoot in the county was secured for the Hollywood feature film &#147;Miss Potter&#148;, starring Renee Zellweger. The Cheshire-based company Mackinnon and Saunders won its first children&#146;s commission for the BBC after receiving development investment from North West Vision. One hundred and fifteen Lancashire-based crew and facilities companies with current TV credits have registered on the North West Vision database used by productions that need to employ crew and use facilities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o154"><a name="60621-0009.htm_para16"><a name="06062158000412">Last week, the BBC announced in principle that it is proposing to establish a northern centre in Salford&#146;s MediaCity:UK, based at Salford Quays, subject to resolving some outstanding issues. The project must also pass the two tests of value for money for licence fee payers and affordability, so the BBC has said that a final decision cannot be taken until the licence fee settlement is known. There are lots of t&#146;s to be crossed, but everything is still to play for.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o155"><a name="60621-0009.htm_para17"><a name="06062158000413">I do not blame the BBC for using its bargaining strength to get the best possible funding deal. As a former negotiator myself, I respect that tactic. However, although I support a reasonable increase in the licence fee, I point out to the BBC that the Salford MediaCity:UK is such an exciting, world-class development that its move there should be confirmed in any case. The move should go ahead whether or not there is an above-inflation increase in the licence fee.</p>

The vision is powerful: a globally significant, new media city to compete with emerging media cities in Seoul, Singapore and Dubai; and a modern, digital city for the UK, surrounded by four excellent universities, which will be the centre of BBC production on Salford Quays. Salford will have a silicon canal to match the US silicon valley and Scotland&#146;s silicon glen. It is estimated that the project will bring 15,500 jobs, and it includes a recording studio for the BBC Philharmonic orchestra, floating stages for concerts and theatre, studio and technical facilities for media industries, a media skills institute and a research academy.

Warsaw were listening intently to the BBC World Service, which brought a true reflection of the world to those oppressed people&#151;it brought them the reality. It also brought great hope to people behind the iron curtain. It could be argued that the BBC World Service helped to bring about the revolutions in eastern Europe that finally drove out the communist oppression that had held them for such a long time. People could not trust their local radio. I feel a great shame, as I said in my earlier intervention, that the service to eastern Europe will be cut. I am pleased that the Foreign Secretary was defeated by 24 votes to one in her intention to stop the BBC and other channels broadcasting the events of the Council of Ministers, because broadcasting has an important role to play in the scrutiny of this Parliament and of what goes on in Brussels and the European Parliament.</p>

That is important in today&#146;s global world. I know that President Chirac of France is intent on spending hundreds of millions of euros on trying to come up with an equivalent to the BBC World Service and CNN. He realises that France is losing out on a tremendous amount of influence globally because it does not have an equivalent. The French version of events is not being broadcast around the world.</p>

Its programmes involve many discussions about political, social and economic issues all around the world. Recently, I watched a television programme on the BBC World Service that was extremely incisive about the new political developments in Bolivia. I wish that we had more of that type of broadcasting in the United Kingdom. We need to have more programmes like that to teach our children about other countries and cultures. We live in an increasingly multicultural United Kingdom and we need to make sure that our young citizens know about the good things around the world, rather than just listening to the coverage at the moment, which is so negative about world events. <i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> Yes, about the Government in particular&#151;quite right. I should say negative but effective and correct. The programmes that we tune into on the domestic BBC tend to focus on problem areas such as Iraq, Afghanistan and other areas of great conflict. There is a tremendous amount of good going on around the world, particularly in developing countries. The BBC World Service does a good job of highlighting that and I regret that the domestic BBC does not follow suit.</p>

the BBC coverage of the bombing of Tripoli in Libya. I believed at the time that the coverage was extremely biased. However, I was greatly encouraged by the way in which the BBC exposed the Labour Government over the weapons of mass destruction in Iraq and the way in which it stood by its guns over the issue. That has led me to believe that although there are times when political parties feel that the BBC is acting against their interests, overall it is impartial.</p>

He went up in my estimation for the way in which he handled the situation. However, we cannot leave it to chance that we will always have somebody like Greg Dyke who will stand up for the best interests of impartiality and the BBC, no matter how much force is brought to bear on him or her. I will go as far as to say that I was appalled by the way in which members of the board of trustees left him out to dry.

<p><a name="st_o205"><a name="06062158000431"><a name="60621-0010.htm_spnew0"><a name="06062158001366"><b>Mr. John Grogan (Selby) (Lab):</b>
 It is a pleasure to follow the hon. Member for Shrewsbury and Atcham (Daniel Kawczynski), who spoke with great verve and style about the international role of the BBC and the importance of the BBC&#146;s independence, as well as costume drama. I will concentrate on perhaps the oldest service that the BBC has provided, although it is one in which there has been plenty of innovation in recent years: BBC radio. Before I do so, however, I wish to make a few observations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o168"><a name="60621-0010.htm_para0"><a name="06062158000432">It is possible to overstate the strength and power of the BBC. I respond directly to the remarks made by the hon. Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford  (Mr. Whittingdale)&#151;we have discussed this matter before. We should consider the total industry revenue. I admit that advertising has declined in the commercial sector, but Sky&#146;s subscription revenue and online revenues are extremely buoyant. When Mrs. Thatcher left office, the BBC had more than 40 per cent. of total market revenue, but now it has 23 per cent. Even if the BBC got what it wanted from the licence fee settlement, best estimates suggest that it would have a fifth of industry revenue. It is thus worth putting the power of the BBC in perspective.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o169"><a name="60621-0010.htm_para1"><a name="06062158000433">As the Minister pointed out, the licence fee has fallen as a proportion of people&#146;s income in recent years, and it will probably continue to do so. Importantly, the licence fee has also fallen as a percentage of the income of the bottom 10 per cent. of the population, although that is not to say that it is not a burden on many households.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o170"><a name="60621-0010.htm_para2"><a name="06062158000434">We must consider the overall output of our system of broadcasting, of which the BBC is such an important part. In Britain, $75 a head is spent on home-produced programming each year, which is more than is spent in the United States and Germany. That is a product of a strong BBC and a strong licence fee.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o171"><a name="60621-0010.htm_para3"><a name="06062158000435">We have heard about the BBC&#146;s plans to innovate. My right hon. Friend the Member for Manchester, Gorton (Sir Gerald Kaufman) talked about the success of Freeview, and we have heard about the success of BBC Online under Greg Dyke&#146;s predecessor, John Birt. Those proposals were controversial in their time. The commercial sector asked whether it was right for the BBC to go into those areas, just as it now asks whether it is right for the BBC to create an open and a creative archive so that licence fee payers can access BBC content. People ask whether it is right that the BBC produces local television news. There are many options for partnerships with commercial interests. For example, in the west midlands, where local television news is being pioneered, the BBC has signed a joint letter of intent with Trinity Mirror, the commercial organisation that runs the main evening newspapers in Birmingham and Coventry.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o172"><a name="60621-0010.htm_para4"><a name="06062158000436">It is thus possible for the BBC and the commercial sector to be partners, but I would urge hon. Members to be sceptical about some of the commercial sector&#146;s claims that the BBC crowds it out. Since the BBC&#146;s inception, it has been in competition with the private sector and has thus distorted the market. BBC Parliament is probably the only BBC product that does   <br>

not distort the market because it does not have a commercial competitor&#151;<i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> It is unlikely to have one, too.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o173"><a name="60621-0010.htm_para5"><a name="06062158000437">To respond to a point made by the hon. Member for Shrewsbury and Atcham, is it not one of the great glories of the independence of the BBC that all the different views expressed in this debate, some of which will be critical of the BBC, will be reported on &#147;Today in Parliament&#148;? After the Hutton inquiry, output at all levels of the BBC reflected the different views expressed. Sky News would never broadcast a discussion on the Murdoch empire or the fact that no one is watching test match cricket on Sky and that access to one of our crown jewels of sport is thus being reduced. One of the great things about the BBC is that it has such independence and thus no thought can be unspoken.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o174"><a name="60621-0010.htm_para6"><a name="06062158000438">Let me move on to radio, as I promised. The commercial sector makes three criticisms of BBC radio: it is too big; it should be more involved with the independent sector on programming; and Radio 1 and Radio 2 should perhaps be privatised. It is true that the BBC has a 56 per cent. share of the radio market. Two or three years ago, the BBC and the commercial sector were saying that given the advent of more stations due to digital radio and the powers in the Communications Act 2003 to allow commercial radio stations to merge, the BBC&#146;s share would have gone down considerably by this stage. To an extent, the BBC is embarrassed by its success. The situation reflects not only the decline in the independent sector&#146;s advertising revenue, but the sector&#146;s lack of ambition. The programming on many commercial stations is in exactly the same format.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o175"><a name="60621-0010.htm_para7"><a name="06062158000439">The Commercial Radio Companies Association has a case to make, but sometimes it overstates it. For example, its briefing for today&#146;s debate says:</p>
<a name="60621-0010.htm_brev0"><a name="06062158001105"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Radio 2 has refocused towards younger listeners.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o176"><a name="60621-0010.htm_para8"><a name="06062158000440">BBC Radio 2 has changed in recent years, so I wondered whether the allegation that it had suddenly abandoned the middle aged and elderly of Britain and gone for  15 to 24-year-olds was true. The audience of Radio 2 is very homogenous. The average age of listeners to Terry Wogan is 52, as is the average age of listeners to Jeremy Vine. The average age of listeners to Jonathan Ross&#151;we have heard about him&#151;is 52, and the average age of listeners to Steve Wright is 50. That makes me feel like a young man again.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o177"><a name="60621-0010.htm_para9"><a name="06062158000441">Radio 2 has innovated and has a broad range of programming. Radio 1 and Radio 2 play much more original music than the commercial sector and have a much richer range of programming. We have heard about the importance of involving youth in the BBC and the media. &#147;Newsbeat&#148;, which is broadcast on BBC Radio 1, is the news programme that attracts more 16 to 24-year-olds than any other, as it has done for many generations. In debates in previous Sessions, Conservative Front-Bench spokesmen talked about privatising BBC Radio 1 and Radio 2. I am glad that we have not heard such comments today. Such privatisation would be a shame, not least for the commercial sector, because unless the advertising market expanded by 25 per cent., many existing commercial stations would lose out.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o178"><a name="60621-0010.htm_para10"><a name="06062158000442">Let me say a word about the contribution of the independent sector to BBC radio. I am pleased that   <br>

BBC radio is committed to more than doubling the proportion of hours that it will guarantee to independents. It says:</p>
<a name="60621-0010.htm_brev1"><a name="06062158001106"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The floor will move from around 2,600 hours at present to 7,300 hours by 2007/8&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o179"><a name="60621-0010.htm_para11"><a name="06062158000443">Although the outsourcing of television programmes to independents has been successful, it is more difficult to outsource radio programmes. Part of the reason for that is the fact that the independent sector is still developing in the radio market and much of radio is live. It would probably be difficult to outsource a lot of programming on BBC local radio, which is one of the jewels in the crown of BBC radio that reaches all our communities. Indeed, there might be cost advantages in keeping programming in-house, and I am pleased that the BBC is addressing the matter. Some radio sport coverage is being outsourced. For example, the coverage of grand prix has been outsourced this year for the first time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o180"><a name="60621-0010.htm_para12"><a name="06062158000444">I hope that the Government will continue to value both the international BBC World Service, which, as we have heard, has record audience figures, and BBC radio itself. I am pleased that it looks as if we will have much-needed competition from the commercial sector on speech radio for the first time. If Channel 4 successfully gains digital space, it will be good for the BBC and will probably reduce its 56 per cent. share of the market slightly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o181"><a name="60621-0010.htm_para13"><a name="06062158000445">I conclude by saying a word about BBC Sport and the importance of having a well-funded BBC to take on subscription TV in particular. It is a joy in Britain that all the World cup matches are available on BBC or ITV, unlike in Germany, where half are on subscription TV, or in Spain, where more than half are on subscription TV. That is not an accident but the result of an intervention in the broadcasting market, as a result partly of a desire to show the crown jewels of sport, of which the World cup is one, and partly of the fact that we have a sufficiently funded BBC licence fee, so that it can compete in the market and secure such rights. Is not it a joy,  Mr. Deputy Speaker, to watch some of the games without adverts? Is not it a joy that every pub and restaurant in London can put up a TV and everyone can watch them? Is not that a contrast with cricket, which is only shown on subscription TV and has only 200,000 viewers on Sky? Long may the BBC have a sufficiently funded system so that, according to the old adage, it can make the good popular and the popular good.</p>

 I shall confine my remarks to the future of the BBC as it applies to Scotland, which is perhaps not unsurprising.

It might surprise a few hon.

the game that we are watching, not some extended update about the progress of the England team. All that is fine for English Members&#151;it is great that they are getting that; it is fantastic, right and appropriate&#151; but Scotland does not need the commentary on another nation, but that is exactly what we are getting.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o182"><a name="60621-0010.htm_para14"><a name="06062158000447">We can use the red button on our remote to get different BBC commentaries, but they range in their support for England from the mildly hysterical to the apoplectic. The button that we in Scotland are using more and more is the volume button to turn down some of that nonsense.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o183"><a name="60621-0010.htm_para15"><a name="06062158000448">While that is merely irritating, it starts to get a bit more serious when it comes to news coverage, which is increasingly irrelevant to public life in Scotland. The crux of all that is the need, desire and real requirement for a Scottish 6 o&#146;clock news that will adequately reflect Scottish public life and political life post-devolution, with our own Scottish Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o184"><a name="60621-0010.htm_para16"><a name="06062158000449">The history of that campaign has been protracted and is one of the greatest stories of political subterfuge in the past few years. We witnessed the actions of the former director general, John Birt, who took it upon himself to make it a political mission to stop the &#147;Scottish 6&#148; happening. He saw it as a great threat to the Union of the United Kingdom. To support his cause, he involved the most powerful allies he could, including the Prime Minister. John Birt is clear in his autobiography what he got from him. He went to the Prime Minister, who was quick, as ever, to grasp the case. &#147;Let&#146;s fight,&#148; the Prime Minister said. He of course enlisted the help of Peter Mandelson, who at the time was Minister without Portfolio, and his most trusted aide-de-camp, and he worked with the BBC on a plan of action to stop the &#147;Scottish 6&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o185"><a name="60621-0010.htm_para17"><a name="06062158000450">That was later confirmed in the diaries of Lance Price when he recorded on Friday 30 October 1998 that</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o186"><a name="60621-0010.htm_para18"><a name="06062158000451">It was collusion at the highest level between the Government and the BBC to stop a &#147;Scottish 6&#148;. That is the campaign that the &#147;Scottish 6&#148; was exposed to. It is entirely at odds with the commitment in the BBC&#146;s royal charter. It is intended to be an independent corporation. That is why it remains such a hot issue. Most recently, the new director-general of the BBC once again ruled out a &#147;Scottish 6&#148;, saying that there was no clamour in Scotland for such a service.</p>

People are turning on and tuning in to see Scottish news coverage because they believe that it is important that their national life is seen on the television.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o189"><a name="60621-0010.htm_para21"><a name="06062158000458">It is a challenge to the BBC. Why does it not accept that? I have written to Scottish Television to say, &#147;Get ahead of the BBC on this one. If you provide a Scottish 6 o&#146;clock and 10 o&#146;clock news service, you could steal a march on the BBC. Grasp the thistle. Go for it, Scottish Television.&#148; It would find that it could probably steal a march on the BBC by securing the viewers for the rest of the evening.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o190"><a name="60621-0010.htm_para22"><a name="06062158000459">Furthermore, we can do that on radio. We have the supremely important and successful &#147;Good Morning Scotland&#148; programme, which competes very effectively with the &#147;Today&#148; programme&#151;in fact, it beats it in terms of listeners. They want a diet of Scottish news in the morning and it had some 11.2 per cent. of audience share in Scotland in 2004. The question has to be asked: if we can do that so successfully on radio and corner such a large share of the market, why can we not do it on television?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o191"><a name="60621-0010.htm_para23"><a name="06062158000460">We then have to ask: what do Scottish viewers get out of the 6 o&#146;clock and 10 o&#146;clock bulletins? Aberdeen university asked that question, researched it, and came to the depressing conclusion&#151;not very much at all. Just 2 per cent. of stories on the 6 o&#146;clock news network could roughly be called Scottish compared with 34 per cent. of those that could be considered English. It found that there was probably 10 times more English cricket on the BBC 6 o&#146;clock news than there was Scottish politics. We are constantly served a diet of irrelevant news stories, which headline the 6 or 10 o&#146;clock news. They are to do with English health, English education or English criminal justice, which have nothing whatsoever to do with the Scottish people. In fact, they are as irrelevant to the Scottish people as the health and education policies decided by the French Government.</p>

 There is recognition at last by some of the people and players in the BBC. The former national governor for Scotland said that there was &#147;some way to go&#148; in the BBC</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o194"><a name="60621-0010.htm_para26"><a name="06062158000465">towards Scotland in the BBC&#146;s coverage of the UK in its national news bulletins. Quite, Madam Deputy Speaker.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o195"><a name="60621-0010.htm_para27"><a name="06062158000466">It is not just in the core areas of news and sport that Scotland is short-changed by the BBC. We are told that the new licence fee&#151;the massive inflation-busting hike&#151;is to pay for all the new interactive services that are supposed to be put in place, but many of my constituents cannot access the new digital services. However, they will be asked to pay an increased licence fee.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o196"><a name="60621-0010.htm_para28"><a name="06062158000467">We have also looked at the disparity of what is collected in Scotland through the licence fee and what we are given back in return. In 2003-04, the licence fee raised was &#163;2.798 billion, of which the Scottish 8.5 per cent. pro rata contribution was &#163;246.2 million. However, Scotland has 9 per cent. of all UK households, suggesting that the licence revenue from Scotland could be as much as &#163;251.8 million. In contrast, BBC Scotland&#146;s income was a mere &#163;160.4 million, of which &#163;10.1 million came from external sources. Under the current arrangements, Scottish broadcasting expenditure is &#163;32 per person. If the full revenues were realised, Scotland&#146;s figure could be up to &#163;50 per person.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o197"><a name="60621-0010.htm_para29"><a name="06062158000468">If we compare like-sized countries throughout Europe&#151;comparing Scotland to, say, independent Ireland or Denmark&#151;it is clear that less money is spent and fewer jobs are created in Scotland&#146;s creative sector. RTE in Ireland, for example, employs 2,169 people and DR in Denmark employs 3,464 people. That compares with 1,427 employed by the BBC in Scotland. Clearly Scotland is getting a poor return from its licence fee contribution under the devolved settlement, in which broadcasting remains under the control of Westminster and the BBC is controlled from London. If every pound paid by Scottish licence payers were reflected in jobs, Scotland would see an additional 690 broadcasting jobs for no additional cost.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o198"><a name="60621-0010.htm_para30"><a name="06062158000469">A distinctive BBC in Scotland is now absolutely required to allow us to promote our indigenous culture and to portray Scotland to the rest of the world. A distinct channel would be our window to the world, reflecting our people&#146;s priorities and playing an integral part in everyday Scottish life. By establishing a sustainable television industry north of the border, high-value jobs would be created, boosting our economy and offering opportunities for the skilled media graduates. The charter review provides an opportunity to go down that road, making the BBC in Scotland truly autonomous, giving Scotland control over its broadcasting, increasing the capacity in Scotland and ensuring that the BBC in Scotland reflects the cultural life of our nation.</p>

 I will take heed of what you have said, Madam Deputy Speaker.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o199"><a name="60621-0011.htm_para0"><a name="06062158000473">I start by declaring an interest. In my previous profession as an independent television producer, I benefited from BBC commissions and suffered from its management.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o200"><a name="60621-0011.htm_para1"><a name="06062158000474">There has been agreement on many things across the Floor of the House in this debate. Of course the BBC must be efficient; of course any increase in the licence fee must be justified; of course the management of the BBC must be transparent; and of course the BBC must not crowd out competition in a very fast-moving industry. There is general agreement, too, that the BBC is an excellent national institution of which we can all be proud&#151;but I am concerned that there has been relatively little discussion this afternoon about the source of that excellence: the people who work in the BBC. It is no accident that the BBC is so excellent. Good broadcasting and communications are the product of training and experience in a centre of excellence, and the BBC is the major source of that for the entire industry in this country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o201"><a name="60621-0011.htm_para2"><a name="06062158000475">Any efficient market must operate within an infrastructure that is often not provided by that market. That is the case in broadcasting and other communications industries, and in this country the BBC is the major source of that infrastructure. For generations it has acted as a centre of excellence, training some of the brightest young people in this country and giving them the experience of making programmes&#151;letting the talent flourish in a secure environment. That is largely as a result of the existence of the licence fee. We would be very foolish indeed to do anything that jeopardised that centre of excellence, because it fertilises the entire industry.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o202"><a name="60621-0011.htm_para3"><a name="06062158000476">When we talk about crowding out, unfair competition and everything else, I hope that Members will remember that it is the BBC that enables the market to work so well by providing the talent and training the talent that everybody needs. When we consider the public value test and the market impact assessment, I hope that we will also remember the role of the BBC in providing the infrastructure. When we look at the independent sector&#151;not much has been said today about its role; I speak as a former independent television producer&#151;I hope people will not be deceived by any belief that it can provide the breadth of training and expertise that the BBC can provide.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o203"><a name="60621-0011.htm_para4"><a name="06062158000477">Of course the independent sector has a role to play&#151;I was grateful in my previous life when that role was extended, as I benefited from it&#151;but we should not go too far. It is an ephemeral and polarising industry, which is highly segmented and driven by very short-term considerations. It cannot take the long-term perspective or train people and give them experience in programme making as the BBC does across the piece. Many hon. Members have today rightly characterised the industry as fast moving, and we cannot preclude  <br>

the BBC expanding into such areas in order to provide the experience and expertise necessary to fertilise the industry as a whole.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o204"><a name="60621-0011.htm_para5"><a name="06062158000478">I hope that when we consider the motion we will reflect carefully on how the Government have tried to balance all those different perspectives. It is a very difficult job. My hon. Friend the Minister made a cogent and compelling argument for why the Government have taken the approach that they have. They have the balance right; their approach will enable the BBC to continue to flourish as that centre of excellence and as an organisation that will give the country the talent that it needs for the creative industries to flourish. I therefore hope that the House will vote against the Opposition motion.</p>

 I am grateful for the opportunity to participate in the debate, and to follow the hon. Member for North Swindon (Mr. Wills), who, as he said, benefited very much from the largesse of the BBC&#151;and also did his bit to support the career of my hon. Friend the Member for Surrey Heath (Michael Gove) when he was a journalist.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o205"><a name="60621-0011.htm_para6"><a name="06062158000480">I share the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point&#151;indeed, I was going to make it myself&#151;about the cross-fertilisation of the BBC and the private sector, but with the greatest respect to him, his experience is based on broadcasting and programme making, and the problem that I want to address in my remarks is the enormous expansion of the BBC into areas where hitherto it has not had a role. That expansion has been driven by new technology. There are those who advocate that the BBC should certainly be playing a role in those new areas, but the House must be aware of the hugely damaging impact that the BBC&#146;s expansion might be having on creative industries in those new areas. I certainly take on board the point that, as Salford media city gets under way, the BBC will act begin to as a pump primer for many new technology industries, but I want to put the other side of the case, about how it could inadvertently undermine some successful private companies in this country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o206"><a name="60621-0011.htm_para7"><a name="06062158000481">In the debate in the other place on the House of Lords Select Committee report on the media, the Government spokesman said that the BBC had to operate in a market without strangling or unduly compromising the competition, and I agree with every word. It is welcome that the Government recognise the importance of scrutinising the BBC in that area. However, the power of the BBC has increased, is increasing and ought to be diminished. In some areas, the BBC is becoming the Roman Abramovich of the content-broadcasting digital world. It has a huge amount of financial muscle and can quite easily outspend its competitors.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman is generous in giving way. I accept his point, but he characterised me wrongly. I accept that the BBC can crowd out new industries. Indeed, as an Education Minister I fought unsuccessfully to try to prevent it from doing just that in one sector. Does he agree, however, that it is important that the BBC is in such areas, partly to provide the pool of talented people who can if necessary leave the organisation to set up creative industries in this fast-changing world?</p>

drawing on a pool of talented people who gained their experience in the private sector. There is cross-fertilisation&#151;and the BBC&#146;s role in education is precisely what I want to talk about.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o207"><a name="60621-0011.htm_para8"><a name="06062158000484">Earlier in the debate, the hon. Member for Cannock Chase (Dr. Wright) said that the BBC was crowding out the private sector because it was driving out mediocre and bad firms. I am very much looking forward to writing to the chief executives and employees of the two firms to which I am about to refer, which are being crowded out, to let them know that a senior Labour Back Bencher considers them to be mediocre and bad people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o208"><a name="60621-0011.htm_para9"><a name="06062158000485">The two companies that I am thinking of are RM plc in my constituency&#151;a classic British success story, which was started 30 years ago by two graduates and now employs 2,000 people&#151;and Harcourt Education, part of the Reed Elsevier group, which is based just outside my constituency and employs many people. Both of them, as the hon. Member for North Swindon is aware, are successful providers of educational software, but they face a significant threat from BBC jam. We could have a separate debate on BBC jargon and names, but BBC jam&#151;formerly the BBC Digital Curriculum&#151;provides a broadband learning service for five to 16-year-olds. It was launched in January 2006, after extensive consultation and approval by the DCMS in January 2003.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o209"><a name="60621-0011.htm_para10"><a name="06062158000486">At the time the industry warned that BBC jam would be anti-competitive, and would threaten the existing commercial market and drive out innovation and diversity. To their credit, the Government accepted that argument, because the DCMS said that</p>
<a name="60621-0011.htm_brev0"><a name="06062158001110"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;the proposal would have had a significant: impact on the market, potentially disproportionate to the evident public benefit, in the absence of measures which would prevent such an impact&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o210"><a name="60621-0011.htm_para11"><a name="06062158000487">To mitigate that impact, the Government set out 18 conditions, the fourth of which stated:</p>
<a name="60621-0011.htm_brev1"><a name="06062158001111"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The service must innovate continually, and exploit the extensive archives of the BBC and its media-rich resources, and promote technological and pedagogical experimentation. The service, taken as a whole, should be distinctive from and complementary to services provided by the commercial sector.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o211"><a name="60621-0011.htm_para12"><a name="06062158000488">Hon. Members will not be surprised to learn that people who know the service well do not think that the BBC has exploited its extensive archives, or provided a complementary service.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o212"><a name="60621-0011.htm_para13"><a name="06062158000489">In summer 2005, the content advisory board wrote to the BBC expressing concern about the development of BBC jam, and questioned whether the service complied with the fourth condition. That board was set up by the Government, and its members include officials from the Department for Education and Skills, the Department for Culture, Media and Sport and the Department of Trade and Industry. DCMS approval for BBC jam included a requirement that</p>
<a name="60621-0011.htm_brev2"><a name="06062158001112"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;the BBC...work closely with the...Content Advisory Board&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o213"><a name="60621-0011.htm_para14"><a name="06062158000490">In summer 2005, the board recommended that BBC jam be subject to immediate review to address the question of whether it had complied with the fourth condition. In February 2006, however, Lord Adonis, a Minister in the Department for Education and Skills, rejected that recommendation. On 7 March, in a written  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="21 Jun 2006">

<notus-date day="21" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>21 Jun 2006 : Column 1368</b><br>
answer to a question that I had tabled, he confirmed that it was &#147;too soon&#148; to review the service.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o214"><a name="60621-0011.htm_para15"><a name="06062158000491">BBC jam will be launched in full in September 2006. Industry sources estimate that its advertising budget is &#163;3.5 million&#151;three and a half times the advertising budget of its nearest private sector competitor. That figure does not, as far as I am aware, include the promotion and cross-fertilisation of programmes in the BBC family&#151;a practice that has become all too prevalent. Should we be worried that a big beast has moved into the sector? On the surface, the BBC is about to offer primary schools free broadband digital content. That sounds fantastic, but in fact that content is not free, because it costs the taxpayer &#163;150 million a year. If the service is successful, it will be at the expense of jobs, opportunities and innovation in the private sector, and it will damage leading global businesses in the UK.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o215"><a name="60621-0011.htm_para16"><a name="06062158000492">The provision of educational software to schools is not simply a matter of sending a pack to schools, because the companies that I have mentioned have enormous experience in the field, and work extremely closely with schools and other organisations to provide technical support, know-how and training for teachers. The BBC, however, is in danger of creating a monopoly. It has blundered into the area without careful thought, simply because it has the money and resources to do so. That small example, which is close to home as it affects my constituency, is symptomatic of the new BBC. People who worked for the BBC used to be prepared to accept lower pay in return for greater job security and a better pension. Now, however, people who work for the BBC earn as much as people in the private sector, if not an astonishing amount more. The salaries received by Jeremy Paxman and Jonathan Ross are not simply a matter of tabloid tittle-tattle, because they go to the heart of what is happening in the new BBC. As a matter or urgency, the Government should make the BBC publish a list of salaries, as they are another example of BBC largesse distorting the market.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o216"><a name="60621-0011.htm_para17"><a name="06062158000493">There has been extensive discussion of the BBC&#146;s coverage of the World cup. That, too, is an example of its largesse, as it has three times as many technicians and reporters in Germany as ITV. The BBC has therefore not made the case for an enormous increase in the licence fee.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o217"><a name="60621-0011.htm_para18"><a name="06062158000494">In conclusion, we should look at the role of the private sector in public service broadcasting. There is false consensus that the BBC alone can undertake public service broadcasting; if it does not operate in a particular field, it is thought, a public service is not available. I bumped into the broadcaster Henry Bonsu two days ago. He left the BBC to set up a radio station for a black audience, because the BBC thought that a black audience wanted only music and entertainment, when in fact it wanted talk, politics, debate and discussion. He has set up a digital station&#151;Colourful on the Sky platform&#151;thus providing public sector broadcasting that does not cost a penny of taxpayers&#146; money. I hope for his sake that he is not too successful; otherwise in a year&#146;s time the BBC will set up a rival and drive him out of business.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o218"><a name="60621-0011.htm_para19"><a name="06062158000496">I congratulate commercial broadcasting organisations throughout the United Kingdom, and not just Scotland. In the spirit of the contributions from the hon. Member for Wantage (Mr. Vaizey) and my hon. Friend the Member for North Swindon (Mr. Wills), I shall consider whether the BBC contributes to the well-being of broadcasting and whether there is cross-pollination. We have excellent commercial broadcasting, simply because of the existence of the BBC, which drives up standards. In our debates, we must focus on transparency and the cost to licence fee payers while supporting the BBC and the innovations that it hopes to achieve.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o219"><a name="60621-0011.htm_para20"><a name="06062158000497">The White Paper on the BBC outlined clear pathways in respect of what the BBC is about, which is high-quality programmes that are challenging, original, innovative and engaging. Those are qualities that we can all sign up to, and they offer a clear opportunity for the BBC&#146;s future. In the few years preceding the White Paper, we began to wonder about that future, but I firmly believe that this debate will demonstrate that it is very safe.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o220"><a name="60621-0011.htm_para21"><a name="06062158000498">I well remember that a constituent of mine,  Mr. Wheeler, launched a one-man campaign to get himself on to the BBC board of governors, because he was very concerned about its lack of openness and transparency. He had an absolute hatred of the irritating little logo that appears in the corner of the screen from time to time&#151;many Members present probably share that view&#151;often in the middle of an important programme.  Mr. Wheeler will greatly welcome the new plans for the BBC, because they very much involve what he was looking for: a champion and a proper voice for licence fee payers, to ensure that there is no muddling of their views.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o221"><a name="60621-0011.htm_para22"><a name="06062158000499">We may not be actually pleased to pay the licence fee, but, as with most of the bills that we receive, we know that we have to. However, we have to make sure that it is worth paying, and this debate is about ensuring that we understand that point. We must keep a careful eye on the most vulnerable groups, who may have difficulty paying their fees. Although this point does not relate strictly to the BBC, I sincerely hope that we will look carefully at the criminalisation of licence fee payers. I do not believe that people should not pay the licence fee simply because they cannot be bothered, or because they do not think that they need to, but we should take a genuine look at those for whom paying is a major problem.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o222"><a name="60621-0011.htm_para23"><a name="06062158000500">The problem with today&#146;s debate is that the biggest issue in broadcasting has not been raised: the demise of &#147;Top of the Pops&#148;, which is a very serious matter. Looking around the Chamber now, I see quite a few Members who must have watched the show at a particular time. However, although its demise is sad, I completely understand the reason for it. This is an opportune moment to reflect on its demise and to realise the difficulties that the BBC faces. For many of us who grew up in the 40 years since it was first broadcast, &#147;Top of the Pops&#148; was the only way to get to know exactly the sort of music to listen to, and who was fashionable and what they were wearing. Young people today have a very different panoply of media to go to, which demonstrates the challenges facing the BBC.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o223"><a name="60621-0011.htm_para24"><a name="06062158000501">I have noticed that there is a growing interest in podcasting.

respect and understand why the BBC has to change, and why Members of Parliament need to take a close interest in these issues on our constituents&#146; behalf. I hope that the Minister will say a little more about the question of Members consulting constituents on these issues, because we are interested in their views and want to put them forward.

Member for Crawley (Laura Moffatt), and I congratulate her on bringing the passing of &#147;Top of the Pops&#148; into this debate. She is right say that that illustrates that programming has to change and evolve regularly. It is extremely rare to find a BBC programme that has endured as long as &#147;Top of the Pops&#148;, and personally, I see its passing as a sad reflection of my advancing middle age, as much as anything else.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o225"><a name="60621-0011.htm_para26"><a name="06062158000503">In the time available to me, I should like to touch on a few points, the first of which is the size of the licence fee. The Minister said that the Government were going to take time to get it right and that the proposed increase would not be excessive. I regret to say that he did not tell us the criteria by which that increase will be judged, or the methodology that the Secretary of State intends to use in arriving at the eventual figure. The Minister did claim that the licence fee had declined as a percentage of household income in recent years&#151;I think that that was the comparison he made; I fail to recall exactly what period he was referring to&#151;but that is not a very spectacular claim when the cost of media hardware and software has been falling around the world. It is because costs have been coming down, thanks to technological advances, that there is such a proliferation of alternative outlets for media use, so there is no great argument over whether the licence fee, as a proportion of household income, should be coming down. By definition, it should be, so such a decline is no justification for the above-inflation increases that the BBC is proposing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o226"><a name="60621-0011.htm_para27"><a name="06062158000504">Why should the BBC get the generous settlement that it seeks for the next seven years? It is looking for twice inflation, guaranteed for seven years. In the context of any other economic endeavour, that would be extraordinary. Across the commercial sector, any sector would be delighted to have a guaranteed source of income of twice inflation during an era of rapid price deflation in most of the markets in which it operates.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o227"><a name="60621-0011.htm_para28"><a name="06062158000505">Let us compare another sector, the water industry, which is subject to regulatory oversight by a regulator, Ofwat. Water bills are affected by the K factor. In the first years after the water industry was privatised, that meant inflation minus a K factor. Subsequently that has changed to a positive K factor, but not to the level sought by the BBC. All that took place when the water industry had an enormous capital expenditure obligation to fulfil each year to renew its decaying pipe infrastructure, which had been in significant decline. Can the Under-Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, the hon. Member for Tottenham (Mr. Lammy) tell us what comparators the Government will use when they come to set the licence fee?</p>

of transparency. I very much welcome the pledge given by my hon. Friend the Member for East Devon  (Mr. Swire) to bring the BBC within the remit of the National Audit Office under the next Conservative Government and to allow the Public Accounts Committee to scrutinise all spending of the licence fee, and not just by permission. I was disappointed by the Minister&#146;s reaction. He was signally unable to give a single example to support his contention that that would mean some undermining of editorial integrity. I will take up his generous offer and write to him, to give him an opportunity to explain what he has in mind.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o229"><a name="60621-0011.htm_para30"><a name="06062158000507">There is no doubt that as technology constantly evolves and the outlets for BBC output expand, there is a need for regulatory oversight of this increasingly substantial amount of what is effectively a tax, as we have heard today. That in itself justifies the full scrutiny powers of the National Audit Office.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o230"><a name="60621-0011.htm_para31"><a name="06062158000508">I shall touch briefly on two aspects of what the licence fee should cover. The Minister spoke about digital switchover. It is appropriate for the BBC to have a responsibility to secure coverage for those who are paying for the service. I raise the matter with an eye on my constituency and my own household. At present, analogue access is poor on both sides of the Welsh border, including in my constituency in Shropshire, where many households, including my own, do not receive a clear signal through an aerial. <i> [Interruption.] </i>From a sedentary position, my hon. Friend the Member for Shrewsbury and Atcham (Daniel Kawczynski) includes Shrewsbury in that category. I am sure he is right. In my home it is not possible to receive BBC Radio Shropshire either, because of the topography.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o231"><a name="60621-0011.htm_para32"><a name="06062158000509">At present, I understand, there are no plans for the digital signal to expand its coverage when the analogue signal is switched off. It is entirely reasonable that part of the increase in licence fee should be used to bring TV coverage to people who are paying their licence fees, so that we achieve 100 per cent. coverage. It is extraordinary in the 21st century that we are proposing a new system of technology that does not allow for universal coverage.</p>

For hon. Members who are not familiar with it, the service provides a 10-minute per hour magazine-style feature of four to six packages. It is a high-quality service, as one would expect from the BBC. It is welcome to those of us who occasionally feature on it and, I assume, to those who are able to view it.</p>

I also remember when &#147;Nationwide&#148; flummoxed us all by giving us the impression that spaghetti grows on trees.

without openness and transparency, particularly in the definition of what actually constitutes public service broadcasting and in the detailed scrutiny of the figures and planning assumptions behind the BBC&#146;s application for an unprecedented increase in its licence fee.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o240"><a name="60621-0012.htm_para7"><a name="06062158000524">Indeed, the Minister seems miffed that we have called the debate, which was warmly welcomed by my hon. Friends the Members for Shrewsbury and Atcham (Daniel Kawczynski), for Wantage (Mr. Vaizey) and for Maldon and East Chelmsford (Mr. Whittingdale) and the hon. Members for Bath (Mr. Foster) and for Eccles (Ian Stewart). It is no argument to say that the Government are calling a debate on the BBC next month, because that debate will cover only charter renewal and not the licence fee.</p>

Friend the Member for East Devon  (Mr. Swire) has already mentioned the DCMS website, but the Minister failed adequately to deal with his point. The section of the DCMS website entitled &#147;BBC charter review&#148; states that the charter review is expected to be completed in mid-2006. It also states:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o243"><a name="60621-0012.htm_para10"><a name="06062158000527">In other words, both the charter and the licence fee were expected to be on the table for next month&#146;s debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o244"><a name="60621-0012.htm_para11"><a name="06062158000528">On 6 June, however, the Secretary of State, who was speaking to the all-party group on the media at a Channel 4 bash, said that the decision would be made towards the end of the year. Why did the media section of <i> The Guardian </i>state that that comment scotched speculation that a deal might be concluded before Parliament goes into its summer recess? The &#147;speculation&#148; was on the DCMS website. Mid-2006 does not mean October and November, but June and July&#151;when Parliament is sitting, not when it is in recess.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o245"><a name="60621-0012.htm_para12"><a name="06062158000529">The DCMS website gives the game away. Something has happened between the publication of that and what the Minister said today and the Secretary of State said at the drinks bash the other evening. The real reason is that the DCMS has been rocked by criticism from the independent commercial sector. The PKF report commissioned by the Department, which is yet again mired in an ongoing difference of opinion with the Treasury, concluded:</p>

We consider that our detailed report contains specific information for the Government to progress discussions with the BBC which would point to a lower settlement than currently sought. There are, however, a number of areas, especially in relation to digital switchover, where figures can only be finalised following policy decisions by Government&#148;.</p>

There has been a powerfully expressed view in the media that the bid offered by the BBC in October 2005 requesting the RPI plus 2.3 per cent. settlement presents no more than a superficial wish list of spending demands that is not grounded in adequate evidence or justification. The House of Lords Select Committee on the Review of the BBC Charter said that the BBC&#146;s costings were</p>
<a name="60621-0012.htm_brev3"><a name="06062158001116"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;rudimentary and could be significantly reduced...the BBC has admitted that the figure in the bid was based on the easiest calculation possible rather than on a real estimate of how best value could be provided.&#148;</p>

My hon. Friend the Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford said that it would crowd out competition and asked why Ofcom will have only a limited input in looking into BBC practices. According to the way in which the charter review is worded, the BBC Trust will act as both poacher and gamekeeper. Licences for online services seem to be lumped together whereas, as several hon. Members have said, each online activity should have its own specific licence.</p>

<p>A report published last month by the consultancy, Indepen, commissioned by ITV, said that the BBC&#146;s bid risked fuelling &#147;super-inflation&#148; in the recruitment of on-screen talent. It also claimed that the proposed above-inflation rise in the licence fee would hit lower-income families harder and contradicted the BBC&#146;s claim that the cost would fall as a percentage of disposable income.</p>

They provide for a BBC that will co-exist with a vibrant and dynamic commercial sector, which is the envy of the world. They also provide for a BBC that can continue to fulfil its role as a trusted guide, bringing the benefits of new technologies to audiences.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o253"><a name="60621-0012.htm_para20"><a name="06062158000538">The BBC has always played such a role, from the earliest days of radio, to black-and-white and then colour television, to FM radio, digital television and radio and the internet. We have much for which to thank the BBC. In many ways, it has grown the market. That is why I do not agree with the hon. Member for East Devon (Mr. Swire), who contests the idea that Mark Thompson should be ambitious to ensure that the BBC competes with the best in digital and online services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o254"><a name="60621-0012.htm_para21"><a name="06062158000539">We have heard a great deal today from Opposition Members, especially the hon.

Friend the other Under-Secretary set out in a compelling case, apart from the fact that Parliament has the right to object to changes in the licence fee, the process so far has been characterised by an openness not previously experienced under any Government. I remind Conservative Members that since the BBC&#146;s inception, most charter reviews have been conducted under Conservative Administrations. There has been more openness under the Labour Government than ever before.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o255"><a name="60621-0012.htm_para22"><a name="06062158000540">The public have told us that they do not want Parliament to have more control than it currently has. That raises wider issues beyond the scope of the debate, but it means that the focus of the argument has been, rightly in the Government&#146;s view, on the public rather than the parliamentary sphere. However, in that context I pay tribute to the work of the Select Committee on the BBC Charter Review in another place, whose thorough scrutiny over a lengthy period has contributed much to the debate. I must not overlook the work of the Select Committee on Culture, Media and Sport, whose review in 2004, towards the start of the process of charter review, set the tone. We are especially indebted to my right hon. Friend the Member for Manchester, Gorton (Sir Gerald Kaufman), whose characteristically robust approach was of considerable influence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o256"><a name="60621-0012.htm_para23"><a name="06062158000541">Today, my right hon. Friend set out, in an insightful and intelligent speech, the opportunities and challenges that the BBC and the media more widely face as technologies change. We agree that the BBC must be able to respond and even lead the changes, to stay relevant to licence fee payers. It is also important that the BBC should not stifle growth and development in the commercial sector. These principles are at the heart of the new charter and agreement.</p>

 On a point of order, Madam Deputy Speaker. For the benefit of the House, will you tell me whether I am right in saying that this debate does not have to finish at 4 o&#146;clock?</p>

 That is absolutely right, but it is in the gift of Her Majesty&#146;s Opposition to determine when the debate finishes, and I have had an indication of when they wish that to happen.</p>

 I want to reassure the hon. Member for Bath that the new trust will be a powerful body that will have ultimate responsibility to the licence fee payer, as defined in article 9.3 of the agreement. Hon. Members have raised the issue of the delay in the announcement of the licence fee, but we have never specified the date on which we would make that announcement. We have said that this is an important issue and that it is right that we think about it clearly and work with the BBC and others to get it right. We will make that announcement in due course&#151;</p>

 I have said to the hon. Gentleman&#151;I hope that he can understand English&#151;that in the four minutes that I have available, I will not give way. I want to deal with the points that all hon. Members have raised.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o259"><a name="60621-0012.htm_para26"><a name="06062158000555">The hon. Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford raised the issue of the role of Ofcom and the BBC Trust in relation to the public value test. We recognise that Ofcom has a key role to play, in that it will provide the market impact assessments that will be an important element of the public value test. The hon. Gentleman says that he accepts that. The trust will be the body that is responsible for upholding the interests of BBC licence fee payers, so it is right that it should make the final decision about whether a new activity should go ahead. It must make such decisions objectively, after consultation, and it must publish the reasons for its decisions. The hon. Gentleman also&#151;</p>

 On a point of order, Madam Deputy Speaker. I am left with no alternative but to raise a point of order as the Minister will not let me intervene on him. He has raised a number of points, not least on the delay in the announcement of the licence fee. As you have heard, this was announced by the Secretary of State&#151;who has now honoured us with her presence&#151;  <br>

albeit at a drinks party rather than in Parliament. Neither she nor any other Minister has given any proper explanation as to why they were unable to attend this debate. I understand that the Secretary of State was at the lottery monitor conference this morning in London, but she was spotted at a nearby restaurant between the hours of 1 and 2 o&#146;clock, when she could readily have been attending this debate to do her job&#151;</p>

Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford raised the issue of the BBC&#146;s income increasing by  &#163;1 billion. Much of its additional income is due to its own efforts to reduce evasion and cut collection costs, which must be a good thing. Over the period, the range of services offered by the BBC has grown and licence fee payers and the public say that they support that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o261"><a name="60621-0012.htm_para28"><a name="06062158000560">My hon. Friend the Member for Eccles (Ian Stewart) gave an engaging speech about the importance of the BBC&#146;s move to the north-west to that region. Underlying his comments was his deep concern, as we would expect, with issues of social inclusion. We rightly welcome the latest indications from the BBC governors that they are serious about moving significant amounts of production to centres outside London.

They then go next door and do the same deal, going as far along the road as possible doing the same thing. They apply for planning permission, which is turned down by the local council as the local planning authority, so they appeal. Their appeal is upheld on the basis of the Government&#146;s new density policies and a block of flats is built, with 30 or 40 new inhabitants and many extra cars, and the extra stress on the infrastructure causes havoc.</p>

In fact, almost half the brownfield development is on garden land. Feelings are rising so high in the borough of Solihull that more than 2,000 people have signed my petition calling for that kind of infill development to be stopped. Colleagues facing the same problem have urged me to make it a national petition, which we will do. Next time hon. Members are in a garden, I ask them to look around and imagine how it would feel if the land next door were developed and their privacy lost because they were overlooked.</p>

The destruction of those precious ecosystems, which house everything from badgers and foxes to squirrels and birds of prey, should provoke outrage.

 I shall make some more progress.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o291"><a name="60621-0014.htm_para9"><a name="06062166000078">The communities that are now being asked to accommodate garden development were originally created with an infrastructure to support a particular population density. The Government cannot expect the same infrastructure to serve adequately a population often twice that size. The result is that everyone loses out one way or another&#151;not least those who are looking to get on the housing ladder, as I shall explain.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o292"><a name="60621-0014.htm_para10"><a name="06062166000079">In the past the Government have cited housing shortages and the need to help first-time buyers as a defence of garden development. I will now look at how, in practice, the policy works against providing the sort of affordable housing that the country so desperately needs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o293"><a name="60621-0014.htm_para11"><a name="06062166000080">The problem with garden development is that far too often it generates houses or apartments at a price beyond the reach of first-time buyers. The reason is very simple: location, location, location. Houses with gardens large enough to be developed are mostly in areas where house prices are high. The result is that the new build is beyond the pocket of first-time buyers. We must also be clear that much of the development that is defended on the grounds that it helps first-time buyers is not generating houses for that market. The average price of one of those new flats in my constituency is &#163;200,000&#151;well beyond the pocket of those on the waiting list for housing. Solihull borough, which has met its target, and half as much again, in each of the past five years, still has a waiting list of 5,000 people, most of whom cannot afford to buy what is being developed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o294"><a name="60621-0014.htm_para12"><a name="06062166000081">Part of the reason for that is a misdiagnosis of the housing affordability problem. We welcome the aim of increasing housing supply, but the wrong sort of homes are being supplied in the wrong places to meet genuine need. The perverse consequence of an affordable housing quota for larger developments of 25 or more dwellings is driving the more lucrative option of garden development, which is below that threshold. What is so frustrating is that that rush to develop gardens has meant that exciting new opportunities for regeneration are being disregarded.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o295"><a name="60621-0014.htm_para13"><a name="06062166000082">We have a vision of building a lot more houses and homes as new garden suburbs for the 21st century, replacing the urban dereliction of the near-city ring. [Hon. Members: &#147;Where?&#148;] I hear hon. Members asking where. Nearly all British cities are configured on such a pattern; perhaps the nearest such city will come to Members&#146; minds as I speak. Those cities have a regenerated central business district. In Birmingham it is the Bullring; in Manchester it is the result of the unfortunate consequences of a bombing; in Liverpool we see a regenerated city heart, as we do in Newcastle and in Leeds. Surrounding the central business district, virtually within spitting distance, is a ring of dereliction. That is the challenge for regeneration.</p>

Whether we are talking about an inner-city area or East Grinstead in my constituency, where 2,500 houses will be built on the Government&#146;s whim without any additional investment in infrastructure, how will such development improve people&#146;s quality of life?</p>

 My hon. Friend gave me advance notice of his intervention, and as he rightly suggests, the Government have applied the word, &#147;sustainable&#148;, to communities that are not in the true sense sustainable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o296"><a name="60621-0014.htm_para14"><a name="06062166000085">First-time buyers are often of an age at which they want to live close to the city centre, with all its cultural and social advantages. They want to carry on living in the city where they studied or where they work and have a network of friends. There is a great opportunity to meet that demand with affordable housing for first-time buyers between the city centre and the more affluent suburbs. Garden development creates more commuting journeys from the outlying towns and villages to the main economic hubs, but cities will become more sustainable if we shorten the commute.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o297"><a name="60621-0014.htm_para15"><a name="06062166000086">Near-city development is better suited to the stronger and more developed infrastructure already in place in our cities. There is a strong economic rationale for such development, as those sites are on former industrial land that has fallen into decay. With imagination and willpower, however, it could house apartments, shops and entire communities in new urban villages that enable people to find their feet as home owners. Our approach reflects that housing life cycle. <i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ] </i>Hon. Members asked me to explain where those homes would be built, and I am doing so. I suggest that they listen, then they will learn.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o298"><a name="60621-0014.htm_para16"><a name="06062166000087">In our vision, first-time buyers could start with an affordable house in a new garden suburb, move somewhere slightly larger in a new urban village when they settle down with a partner, then scale up to a family-sized house. Other people will want to move further out to a town or village with more space and a larger garden, so we need to create those choices. That brings me back to my starting point&#151;gardens. The sad irony is that young people aspire to live in houses with large gardens and in neighbourhoods with green spaces, which are being lost. Of course, that pattern does not apply to everyone.</p>

We have championed the cause of more affordable housing in rural areas for some time, but unlike the Government, we want to empower local people to decide how genuine local need should be met. We want to restore local democracy, and the emotive issue of housing is a good way of showing that we mean it.

The simplest and most effective measure they could take is to amend planning policy statement 3 so that gardens are no longer classified as brownfield sites; that does not even require primary legislation. Local authorities should be allowed to decide the appropriate density for their community. Once a site is returned to its proper classification as a garden, there is nothing to stop someone applying for planning permission, but it is the council&#146;s responsibility to judge the application on its merits. As a result, we would lift the threat to our urban green spaces and remove the fears of people living in the shadow of unwanted development.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o301"><a name="60621-0014.htm_para19"><a name="06062166000096">The Secretary of State must surely understand that gardens are not what people accept as brownfield sites.

Secondly, there has been no change in the definition of brownfield land since 1985, when the current definition was first used by the Conservatives for the purposes of land use planning statistics.</p>

There have been relevant changes to planning policy guidance over the years, and, indeed, more are in the process of being introduced. As she readily acknowledged, this Government have been much keener to encourage local authorities to seek out brownfield sites for development rather than greenfield sites. Why? Because re-using land that has already been developed reduces the need to use new greenfield land and helps regenerate our cities and towns by bringing often derelict land back into use.</p>

 Will my right hon. Friend comment on the planning guidelines in respect of social housing on small development sites? In London the planning authorities often insist on 15 units or more before social housing is included, which in inner urban areas like mine means that no social housing at all is built on such sites.

 I am about to come on to how planning policy guidance changed and the impact that that had on the development of brownfield land and previously residential land. The planning guidance introduced in 2000 stated that there should be a clear priority for brownfield development over greenfield development. However, it also included safeguards for quality. It stated that</p>
<a name="60621-0015.htm_brev1"><a name="06062166000265"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;considerations of design and layout must be informed by the wider context, having regard not just to any immediate neighbouring buildings but the townscape and landscape of the wider locality.&#148;</p>

Member for Meriden, there was no presumption that brownfield land had to be built on simply because it was brownfield. In fact, the guidance specifically asks local authorities to consider a wide range of matters in deciding whether to allocate land for housing and whether to grant planning approvals. The range of matters includes the location and accessibility of sites, the capacity of existing and potential infrastructure, including, for example, social infrastructure such as schools and hospitals.</p>

Planning, who is sitting on the Front Bench, wrote a letter to <i> The Daily Telegraph </i>not long ago saying that the safeguards were sufficient to enable local authorities to protect sites. When I showed that letter to planners in West Berkshire council, however, they said that they were being as robust as possible, but whenever they feel that a development is inappropriate in the way that the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government has just described, it gets overruled on appeal because of the ODPM wording. The matter is centrally controlled, and the safeguards described in the letter from the Minister for Housing and Planning, which the Secretary of State has just voiced, are not happening on the ground.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman should have waited a few moments; if he looks at what has happened as a result of the changes in policy guidance over the years, the facts speak for themselves. In 1992, when the previous planning guidance was introduced, the percentage of brownfield development on previously developed residential land was 40 per cent. In 2003&#151;the last available count&#151;that figure was 33 per cent. In absolute terms, land released for development in that period fell from 978 hectares to 966 hectares, which means that the increase in brownfield land for new housing has been in the use of non-residential brownfield land, such as industrial, commercial and vacant land.</p>

 My hon. Friend makes an important point.

 My hon. Friend is right to draw attention to that point. Local authorities already have the power to refuse inappropriate development, and they should make use of those powers. The question is whether we can give local authorities more flexibility to sequence the land that they bring back into use for development in particular ways. The new draft planning policy guidance on which we are consulting attempts to do that. That should introduce new safeguards into the system.</p>

We recognise the need for it and we have always supported it, so can we nail the myth once and for all?</p>

 Absolutely not. If the hon. Lady is not prepared to say where the investment will come from to build the extra homes, she frankly does not support the homes. We have clear policies for a planning gain supplement to fund the necessary infrastructure for development.

Will she make those difficult decisions and enable us to deliver the homes in a sustainable climate?</p>

the conclusion of the bidding round for new growth points. Many local authorities expressed an interest, but 22 had worked out detailed bids. They were keen for new houses to be built, and included the Tory-led local council of the hon. Member for Meriden, which proposed new developments. In total, the proposals represent 80,000 new homes by 2016 on top of what is already planned. <i> [Interruption.] </i>I am delighted that the hon.

Do they now believe that the Government&#146;s planning policies are right, whereas last Thursday they thought that they merited debate because they were wrong?

Will the redefinition safeguard gardens from further development? I do not think so, and it would be the same if they redefined them as greenfield development.

 As a fellow Stockport Member, the hon.

 I am indeed a Stockport Member, although I am a member of a different party. I understand what the hon. Gentleman has said, and it is quite interesting. He and I could probably enlighten the House a good deal on the planning policies that apply in Stockport.</p>

Councillors, when they have thought it appropriate, have tried to limit the damage, in conjunction with the communities in whose areas the applications have been made. Sometimes an application could be properly refused and sometimes it could be substantially modified, but the treatment of the whole curtilage of the home as housing land has too often meant that inappropriate development could not be resisted&#151;a situation already described by others. If it was resisted, there would be an appeal, the Secretary of State&#146;s inspectors would recommend that it be granted, and the Secretary of State would grant it.</p>

Gentleman has said, every problem has a solution, but every solution has its own problem. Stockport is now officially full. All the planning applications that should be granted, according to the Secretary of State, have been granted. The present position is that no applications should be granted, which means that the council can refuse applications relating to garden sites. Unfortunately, as the hon. Gentleman pointed out, that and the Secretary of State&#146;s guidelines have had the unintended consequence that the council cannot be flexible when it comes to Reddish. That, surely, is one of the key points to which the Government should respond. Even in one local authority planning area there can be fundamentally different circumstances, which must be dealt with by means of more flexible local policies.</p>

 I am sure that Islington, like almost every other local authority in the country, has a rising council house waiting list. For example, Stockport has 13,000 council homes, and a waiting list of 6,000 households looking for social housing. The council would willingly provide more social housing units if it were given the finances and authority to do so.</p>

The guidelines should also make it clear that any development should be sustainable, should protect biodiversity and should take into account legitimate concerns about local amenity. I have referred already to the Bill introduced by my hon. Friend the Member for Solihull, which I believe sets out very clearly the framework within which we should proceed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o342"><a name="60621-0016.htm_para21"><a name="06062166000199">However, there is a serious case to answer on the broader issues. I hope that the Secretary of State, or the Minister for Housing and Planning, will respond positively to the problems that exist, and explain how she intends to develop her policies to tackle them. I am sure that the Secretary of State will be sympathetic on the specifics; she certainly should be, as she has taken plenty of trouble in the past to protect the interests of her constituents faced with similar problems. I am sure that she will want to ensure that the same protection is available to people in Stockport, Solihull, Meriden or anywhere else.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o344"><a name="60621-0017.htm_para1"><a name="06062166000201">As part of that comprehensive guidance, the Secretary of State should also make it clear that any proposed garden developments must comply fully with those criteria and that they will be refused if they do not.

 Yes, my hon. Friend is right. Many letters written by Ministers to Members of Parliament are in the same vein as the one that he received. They say that such and such a decision is a matter for local discretion. Whether we ask about schools, social services or planning, we receive the same letter and it is absolutely meaningless, because local authorities do not have the flexibility or authority, and certainly not the money, to deliver on the choices that Ministers say that they can make.</p>

No doubt she will argue that to support it would in some mysterious way make the problem worse, but I urge her to recognise that bringing just a fraction of the 680,000 empty properties in England back into occupation would go a long way towards ameliorating the position, as would even half of the 1 million homes that her funded working group recommended be developed in commercial premises and over shops. If only a fraction of her working party&#146;s recommendations were implemented there would be a tremendous step forward in housing availability.</p>

 I thoroughly agree with the hon. Gentleman about bringing empty properties back into use.

We hoped that we would hear from the Opposition on a number of rather important issues. They include how we can expand the supply of new homes, both for sale and for rent, in areas where they are needed; how we can ensure that we have sustainable developments that will prove attractive for people to live in for many years ahead, and that we do not repeat the mistakes of some past patterns of development that have not proved satisfactory; how we can raise design standards and environmental performance in housing and so reduce carbon emissions; how we can help first-time buyers to get a foot on the ladder and extend opportunities for affordable home ownership; how we can ensure an adequate supply of rented housing for those who need or want to rent, rather than buy; how we break down some of the pernicious divisions between tenures that characterised much of 20th century housing policy; how we can ensure better provision for the homeless and for those requiring support and care, as well as a roof over their head; and how we can best continue to improve the conditions of poorer-quality housing and areas in need of regeneration. We would have liked to hear from the Opposition on those, and many other vital issues for housing, but, sadly, we were disappointed.</p>

Whereas new housing in the 1980s and early 1990s, when the Conservative party was in government, was characterised by sprawling development which was often poorly designed, of low density, usually on greenfield sites, usually exclusively for sale, and ate remorselessly into the countryside, in recent years there has been a dramatic increase of mixed tenure developments on brownfield sites, and a great step forward on the regeneration of many of our inner-city areas. There have also been real improvements in the quality of design and environmental performance. We have not gone as far as we should, but there have been very fine exemplars of good development.</p>

They are clear illustrations of how wrong the hon.

 I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman; I gave way to him during my speech. The site to which he refers is of course exceptional because everyone will remember it as the site of the dome. It is thus in a category of its own in terms of its need for regeneration.</p>

 Again, the hon. Lady is wrong. There is not just the dome but the Greenwich peninsula, the Woolwich Arsenal and the Kidbrooke regeneration. There is a series of major sites on which we are seeing high-quality new urban development. The hon. Lady seems to shake her head&#151;she does not want to know. Her whole attitude has been one of visceral hostility to new housing. We heard that for years during the previous Opposition regime, when she was given a fairly free rein to oppose housing developments. She now has to choose her words slightly more carefully, but she has the same message: hostility to housing.</p>

That development ensures that people have good-quality homes to rent or buy; the two types are side by side, and mostly indistinguishable. It is planned so that there is easy access not only to public transport but to schools, health centres and other public services. There is a stunning ecology park that is doing more for biodiversity and wildlife than was ever the case on that formerly polluted gasworks site. In summary, the exemplary new development has been created as a result of, and is an exemplar of, the Government&#146;s housing and planning policies. It is because of such developments&#151;and there are many more&#151;that more than 70 per cent. of new homes are now on brownfield sites, compared with about 50 per cent. or less in the Tory years.</p>

It is intellectually untenable for the Opposition to suggest that the increase in brownfield development in recent years has reflected the gobbling up of gardens in suburbia. That simply is not the case.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o359"><a name="60621-0017.htm_para16"><a name="06062166000239">There has been a serious oversimplification of the issues.

There are instances where that is happening, and that should be resisted. Inappropriate development in back gardens would not have my support. However, there are also appropriate infill developments that make use of land that has not been used well, and is in locations where there is good access to transport and other services, which makes it sustainable, and the quality of the area is enhanced as a result.

who aspire to have more space and who would like the opportunity to have an extension or conservatory should be warned that if the Opposition had their way, that development would become much more difficult, because there would no longer be an assumption that any such site might be regarded as brownfield.</p>

That was very much the thrust of planning policy guidance note 3, which was issued in 2000. The Opposition now decry it, but I take a certain amount of pride in it because I was the Minister with responsibility for planning when it was prepared and issued. It put the focus on increasing brownfield development and on better-quality design. It shifted the emphasis significantly in that way, and gave a strong thrust towards sustainability objectives, all of which I stand by&#151;and I hope that the House would do the same, because they are important measures of quality in development. We should be trying to achieve those objectives to ensure that inappropriate, poor-quality and badly designed development proposals are rejected, and that good-quality appropriate developments on garden sites are supported. The House should be adopting that approach.</p>

Those are precisely the arguments that allow her to sit on the fence and say, &#147;I do believe in more housing,&#148; to please the house builders, while at the same time saying, &#147;No, no. We will resist housing developments,&#148; to please the people in her party who remain viscerally opposed to new housing development.</p>

Friend the Member for Meriden (Mrs. Spelman) was in any way suggesting that people wishing to extend their houses&#151;adding porches, patios, sun lounges or whatever&#151;would not be able to do so. I will return to that, but I thought that the record needed to be set right straight away.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o364"><a name="60621-0018.htm_para0"><a name="06062166000249">I am immensely grateful, as my constituents will be, to my hon. Friend for moving the motion. It is a specific and important issue that needs to be fully addressed. The person to whom we must be most grateful is my hon. Friend the Member for Tunbridge Wells (Greg Clark), who has done so much on this subject. I recently addressed a public meeting in my constituency at which a resolution was passed that I should thank him, and I now do so publicly, on the Floor of the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o365"><a name="60621-0018.htm_para1"><a name="06062166000250">The reason why this is an important debate is that it affects so many constituencies. As the hon. Member for Hazel Grove (Andrew Stunell) said, it affects Members in all parts of the House, and the early-day motion tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Tunbridge Wells has been signed by Members of all parties. The most telling interventions came from the right hon. Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field) and the hon. Members for Sunderland, South (Mr. Mullin) and for City of Durham (Dr. Blackman-Woods), all of whom rightly pointed out that the problem is huge in their constituencies. As the hon. Member for Sunderland, South said to the Secretary of State, she has to do something to put it right.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o366"><a name="60621-0018.htm_para2"><a name="06062166000251">I represent a largely suburban constituency; it is not rural. We have had terrific development pressures; we have taken more than our fair share. Greenfield sites have been built on, and more will be built on in the next few years, to provide much-needed social and other housing. What desperately upsets my constituents, whether they live in Bracknell, Sandhurst, Crowthorne or Finchampstead, is building on gardens.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o367"><a name="60621-0018.htm_para3"><a name="06062166000252">That was when the Secretary of State showed that she is not yet up to speed with her brief. I am confident that when the Minister for Housing and Planning winds up the debate later she will correct the record and be more positive. My constituents will be appalled at the Secretary of State&#146;s saying, &#147;Oh, this is just something about building between houses.&#148; That is not at all the case. We are talking about developers offering huge sums of money to people, one after another, to have their usually modest bungalows or houses knocked down so that the site can be redeveloped as a block of flats. Those blocks of flats are not of sufficient density to lead to any more social housing, so people in Bracknell Forest borough and Wokingham unitary authority who are on a long housing waiting list are not helped at all. The flats take a long time to sell or let, and they completely change the nature of the area in which they are built. They put terrific strains on infrastructure and are not wanted.</p>

Member for Hazel Grove came to this conclusion too, although he took a little time about it&#151;we need to give powers back to local representatives. Again and again, local residents oppose an application to build a block of flats on a site where property already exists. They are supported by their locally elected representatives&#151;the Member of  <br>

Parliament, the town or parish council and the borough council, and the planning authority turns down the application. What happens then? We all know that, again and again, the developer appeals to the Secretary of State, and the Secretary of State and her inspectors come down in favour of the developer. We are left to pick up the bits and pieces.</p>

 The right hon. Gentleman has explained the problems in his constituency very clearly, but he appears to suggest that people are compelled to sell that land. Some of his constituents, however, make money by selling land to developers, thus destroying the neighbourhood for their friends and neighbours. Can he explain that anomaly?</p>

 The hon. Lady has a distinguished record as an academic, so I am surprised by her intervention. We both live in the real world. If someone was offered half as much again for their property they would need a strong moral compass to refuse. We must ensure that local elected representatives make the final decision on what is built, as they will be held accountable for their decision when they seek re-election. If I may say so, the hon. Lady&#146;s intervention on my hon. Friend the Member for Meriden (Mrs. Spelman) was much better than her intervention on me. She said that development could not take place in the hamlets in her part of the north-east, which caused unnecessary development elsewhere. If power were restored to her local planning authority and people wanted development in the hamlets&#151;she suggested that they did&#151;that development would take place. If elected representatives get it wrong on planning and do not provide sufficient housing, or if they allow unreasonable and intrusive development that people do not want, they will be slung out at the next election. Democracy works well because it concentrates the minds of elected politicians, and that is what we want to do.</p>

There have been two public meetings in Crowthorne, which is not a very big place. More than 500 people attended the first meeting&#151;as politicians, we do not often attract such attendance&#151;which I started to address inside the Morgan centre. However, the organisers were worried that many people were waiting in the crush outside, so I had to go out in the dark and address them in the recreation ground. It was like Gladstone and Disraeli again! The second public meeting was as full as the first, and it was attended by representatives of the other main political parties in my constituency. Everyone was united at that non-political event. It was characteristic of the right hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich to play party politics but, mercifully, the Labour representatives behaved much more responsibly at that meeting. That is not surprising, however, knowing them and knowing him.</p>

Local planning officials who came to the public meetings said that a village design statement would be helpful, so a group of hard-working independent people who had not taken part in objections to the development spent a great deal of time preparing such a statement for Crowthorne. It is extremely impressive, and the planners say that it will be made available to developers and other interested parties. It defines Crowthorne in a  <br>

We also want an indication from the Minister and the Secretary of State that the democratically elected local politicians on planning authorities, and local residents, will be listened to far more than they are at present. If the Minister can give me that assurance when she winds up, I will leave the House tonight a very happy Member.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o374"><a name="60621-0018.htm_para10"><a name="06062174000015">The crisis is imminent&#151;it is upon us now, given the urgency of the problem of homelessness and overcrowding. There are 3,500 people on the housing waiting list in Luton. Some 60 per cent. are homeless, 20 per cent. are applying for a transfer, and the remaining 20 per cent. will never see the light of day in terms of housing. As of the last financial year, the council was receiving 130 housing applications per month. In addition, huge numbers of people are spending more than a year&#151;sometimes two years&#151;in temporary accommodation. The overcrowding crisis is such that I regularly see in my constituency office surgeries families of six or more who are living in two-bedroom flats. How can those families survive in those conditions?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o375"><a name="60621-0018.htm_para11"><a name="06062174000016">Opposition Members&#146; solution to the problem is a flight of fancy; I want to talk about the reality. Throughout the country, some 900,000 children are living in similarly overcrowded conditions. Ethnic minority communities such as the Pakistani and Bangladeshi communities in my constituency are seven times more likely to experience overcrowding than other communities, but the problem ranges across every community in my constituency. Overcrowding has an incredible impact on the health of those families. A survey by Shelter found that 90 per cent. of the families questioned felt that overcrowding was damaging their children&#146;s health; 93 per cent. of the severely overcrowded families surveyed said that they were experiencing depression, anxiety or stress; and 80 per cent. felt that the overcrowding experience was having a detrimental effect on their children&#146;s chances of a good education, because there was simply nowhere for them to do homework, or to find space for playing or learning. The life chances of generations of children and families are affected by overcrowding.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o376"><a name="60621-0018.htm_para12"><a name="06062174000017">The hon. Member for Meriden dismissed the idea of extensions to houses, but for many of those families, it is their only way of getting some small additional space. In addition to the short-term solutions to overcrowding that have been mentioned, we need to consider greater opportunities for extension of housing. That is happening in the owner-occupied sector and it is what most of us do if we own our homes&#151;we build a loft and an extension. For people in the council and social housing sector, I have never understood why we cannot allow similar extensions within the social housing framework. The housing corporation in my area recently funded one such extension, built by Luton Community Housing, which I commend. In crowded areas such as mine that is often the only solution. I ask my hon. Friend to include that among the short-term solutions that we need to consider.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o379"><a name="60621-0018.htm_para15"><a name="06062174000024">That target is to be commended. The fact that Luton is part of the south midlands growth area strategy is our lifeline of hope for the thousands of people on our waiting lists, who are desperate for a transfer because of overcrowding and other needs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o380"><a name="60621-0018.htm_para16"><a name="06062174000025">One of the arguments deployed by the Opposition, apart from the garden issue, relates to infrastructure, which has been mentioned many times. Of course, the infrastructure needs to be in place for the sustainable development of affordable housing. In my area I cannot see any dereliction of duty on the part of the Government in terms of providing infrastructure&#151;rather, the reverse. They have put millions of pounds into transport infrastructure, such as the widening of the M1 and the introduction of the east Luton corridor and the Translink rail system, all of which&#151;together with plans for the expansion of London Luton airport, which we look forward to&#151;will provide necessary transport and employment opportunities and other infrastructure measures that underpin the growth strategy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o381"><a name="60621-0018.htm_para17"><a name="06062174000026">I welcome the Government&#146;s targets for the increased supply of housing&#151;200,000 homes by 2016&#151;but the recent excellent report from the Select Committee on the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, &#147;Affordability and the Supply of Housing&#148;, goes further. We have not yet got the Opposition to agree the first target and I am asking for another, but let us be aspirational. Shelter believes that a further 20,000 homes are needed on top of the target, and I agree. It would be as well for the Minister in her winding-up speech to suggest imaginative ways of adding to the target.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o382"><a name="60621-0018.htm_para18"><a name="06062174000027">We need to consider short and medium-term solutions to crises such as those in my area. Many families cannot wait four, five, six or seven years for the growth strategy to become a reality&#151;for new homes to be available. I mentioned extensions. Converting existing homes should also be considered, although it is not straightforward. We need to deal with the issue of VAT on the refurbishment and repair of existing homes. The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors has raised consistently with the Chancellor, as have I, the point that there is no level playing field for VAT. I welcome the Chancellor&#146;s moves to ensure a reduction in VAT to bring empty properties back into use, but we need to act further and faster to rehabilitate older properties, such as those in the most deprived area of my constituency, which takes me right back to what I was doing when I first entered the social housing field.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o383"><a name="60621-0018.htm_para19"><a name="06062174000028">We also need urgently to tackle the issue of empty properties. As I have said, there are 680,000 empty properties nationally, which is 3 per cent. of the housing stock. There are a number of empty properties in Luton, and we should take cognisance of the Government&#146;s existing target to reduce long-term empty properties by 25,000 by 2010, which would be a good start. The Empty Homes Agency has said that we need to be more ambitious given the scale of the crisis, and it has suggested the target of a 50 per cent. reduction by 2010 in the number of properties empty for more than six months. We need to be that ambitious, because the crisis is acute for the families I see day in, day out in my surgeries.</p>

 If you were to go down to Tunbridge Wells today, Mr. Deputy Speaker, you would be sure of a big surprise. You would progress through some of the most beautiful leafy roads in Britain, which look at their best at this time of year. If you were to walk from the station, you would come before long to Forest road, where you would see family homes built in the 1920s and 1930s. Those homes have mature trees and gardens that teem with wildlife. The surprise is that you would be looking at a brownfield site.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o385"><a name="60621-0018.htm_para21"><a name="06062174000031">An even bigger surprise is that those houses are under threat because of that definition. This is what happens: developers offer one of the residents a big cheque, and before very long the hoardings go up, the house comes down, the garden is ploughed up and the flats go in. In a short space of time, a road that has contributed to the character of an area for 50 or 60 years is replaced by a block of apartments and a parking lot. In those circumstances, the people who live next door think that the same thing will happen on the other side, so they panic and sell up. Within a short time, a domino effect ripples down such roads in my constituency and others like it, which completely changes the character of an area.</p>

When I introduced a ten-minute Bill on the subject four months ago, I did not know that it would attract e-mails, telephone calls and letters from all over the country&#151;from Stockton-on-Tees to Bristol and from Cardiff to Rochdale. All the people who contacted me said that their local areas are being degraded, while the affordable housing that we need is not being provided. I accept the need for more housing and, in particular, for affordable housing. But I am concerned that such garden-grab developments are being used to avoid the affordable housing requirement, because they involve less than 15 units of housing. Such developments are displacing the development of genuine brownfield sites and robbing the poorer members of our society of their entitlement.</p>

already have sufficient discretion to turn down such applications, and secondly, that the definitions have been consistent. I concede that the definition of brownfield sites has been around since 1985. However, it was never part of planning guidance, but merely a convenient way of recording statistics. Since then, two things have happened. First, the Government have introduced targets for building houses and for building on brownfield land. We all know that once one applies a target to a definition, that definition becomes important, which is why this definition is important now.</p>

Under planning policy statement 3, that could increase to as many as 70 in urban areas. As they say, &#147;Do the math&#148;: if an existing home is to be replaced and those doubled, perhaps trebled, density targets are to be met, it cannot be done without the garden.

If we treat local people as infants and do not allow them any say but only to kick out against decisions taken from afar, it is no wonder that we see such pent-up anger in our constituencies.

 Like several of my hon. Friends, I am disappointed by the narrowing of today&#146;s debate. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State said that it was two years since the Opposition previously asked for a debate on housing. The debate before that took place four years earlier. In the past five debates on housing for which the Opposition called, I note an uncanny consistency in that all the motions contained the phrase, &#147;serious threat to the nation&#146;s green fields&#148;, or something similar. We have moved from that to a serious threat to the nation&#146;s back gardens. We are narrowing the debate all the time.</p>

My right hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich and Woolwich  (Mr. Raynsford) listed the many topics that we could consider. Even in the context of the motion, overdevelopment is an interesting subject and we could have profitably debated the fact that many developers try to overdevelop inner-city sites. However, the debate has been narrowed to such an extent that one has to ask why. My hon. Friend the Member for Luton, South (Margaret Moran) suggested that the answer was shortage of policy. I would not go that far, but the Opposition display a reluctance to put any more than their toe in the water.</p>

Secretary of State effectively demolished the argument in the motion by saying that brownfield development and the volume of green belt land have increased under Labour, that the percentage of residential land that is being developed has decreased and that local authorities have discretion in the planning process. None of the Opposition arguments makes sense and one must therefore ask why they have chosen the topic. I fear that it signals a return to &#147;dog whistle&#148; politics. It proclaims that, whatever the Conservative party says at the moment about being friendly and wanting to tackle the housing shortage, if people listen carefully, it is not genuinely in favour of development anywhere.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o396"><a name="60621-0019.htm_para6"><a name="06062174000051">I have had the privilege of living in the London borough of Hammersmith and Fulham for some  40 years and I remember when there was a Tory-Liberal coalition there from 1978-86. Not a single council property, save for sheltered housing, was built in that time. Under a Labour administration, 70 per cent. affordable housing was built in the borough. To revert to the point that appeared to trouble the Opposition spokesman, any development of five or more homes had to include an affordable element. That was such a contrast with neighbouring Kensington and Westminster. I am sad to say that we now have another Conservative administration in Hammersmith and Fulham. Already, in only two months, developers tell me that they are coming under pressure to reduce to a minimum the percentage of affordable housing in schemes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o397"><a name="60621-0019.htm_para7"><a name="06062174000052">The hon. Member for Meriden (Mrs. Spelman) is wrong about the mythical &#147;Harry Potter&#148; realm between the inner city and the suburbs, full of oases of brownfield sites that can be developed&#151;but there are one or two, even in my constituency. In those places, the developers are being told, &#147;It&#146;s more difficult because of the Greater London authority and the 50 per cent. rule&#151;but let&#146;s keep it down as much as we possibly can.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o398"><a name="60621-0019.htm_para8"><a name="06062174000055">More widely across London, the figures for social rented housing completions since 1998 speak far more eloquently than any of the words of the Opposition can. In Tower Hamlets, the figure is 3,902; in Hackney, it is 2,563; and in Hammersmith and Fulham, it is 1,587. Let us compare those figures with that of Richmond, at 628, and Wandsworth, at 492. A borough that is twice the size of Hammersmith and Fulham managed to complete only a third of the number of social housing units in that time. The only other connection to be made is that it is the Conservative boroughs that are building the smaller numbers of housing units, and the Labour boroughs that are building the large numbers. I wish that I had time to go through all the figures, because the same applies to the current round of housing allocation. It is absolutely shameful that while Hammersmith and Fulham is planning to build almost 1,000 units in the current two-year period, Wandsworth&#151;a borough of twice the size&#151;is planning only 248.</p>

It will therefore be of concern to him that every affordable housing development in Hammersmith and Fulham between 1986 and 4 May this year was opposed by the Conservatives in that borough. That is the truth about Conservative housing policy. We have heard &#147;Don&#146;t build it on greenfield sites,&#148; and we are now hearing &#147;Don&#146;t build it on brownfield sites.&#148; The Conservatives&#146; consistent policy is &#147;Don&#146;t build it.&#148; That is the message that comes through loud and clear.

However, they might be a bit more concerned about the young professionals and first-time buyers who are also desperate for accommodation, but who cannot get on the housing ladder&#151;although the Conservatives did oppose the introduction of home sellers&#146; packs. They might also be concerned about the young families who are trying to trade up, but who have little chance of doing so in London. We need a better intermediate housing market for those people. The Conservatives are obviously not even concerned about the empty-nesters who are selling their properties to developers so that they can get a pension out of it, as my hon.

<p><a name="stpa_o416"><a name="60621-0019.htm_para26"><a name="06062174000080">The situation is likely to become still worse because of the changes to planning policy guidance note 3 in the new planning policy statement 3, which increases the density pressure. We recognise that, as the hon. Member for Denton and Reddish (Andrew Gwynne) pointed out, some communities will want sensitive garden and infill development, and we believe that communities in which there is strong popular backing for such development should be allowed to go their own way. The problem with policy at present is that local autonomy is denied, and communities that wish to resist development are robbed of the power to do so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o417"><a name="60621-0019.htm_para27"><a name="06062174000081">The hon. Member for Hazel Grove (Andrew Stunell) congratulated us on raising an important issue and, a second later, said that he was disappointed that we had selected this subject for debate. I am used to hearing Liberal Democrats saying different things to different audiences, but that was an example of one Liberal Democrat saying different things to the same audience. All I would ask the hon. Gentleman is: why have the Liberal Democrats not used any of their Opposition day debates to discuss housing and planning issues in the past? Let me give the House an assurance: I will talk about housing and planning whenever the Government give me an opportunity, and I shall be delighted to use any opportunity that may be extended by the Minister or the Secretary of State to hold the Government to account for their failure to deliver on their housing targets.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o418"><a name="60621-0019.htm_para28"><a name="06062174000082">The hon. Member for Hazel Grove asked my hon. Friend the Member for Meriden why she had not talked about rural housing affordability, supply generally or location. In fact, my hon. Friend explicitly mentioned all three. The hon. Gentleman spoke of the importance of football analogies; let me give him such an analogy. He took his eye comprehensively off the ball, and scored a series of own goals. [Hon. Members: &#147;Very funny!&#148;] I am grateful for those generous words.</p>

Member for Greenwich and Woolwich (Mr. Raynsford), whose commitment to housing and planning is well known, made a fascinating speech. He understandably referred to the regeneration in his constituency, which in many cases I would applaud, but, as my hon. Friend the Member for Meriden pointed out, much of the investment there was due to the millennium dome. Given public investment on that scale, I am not surprised that there has been urban regeneration&#151;but I doubt that the Chancellor of the Exchequer will allow the level of public expenditure in the right hon. Gentleman&#146;s constituency as a result of the dome to apply in the constituencies of the rest of us.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o420"><a name="60621-0019.htm_para30"><a name="06062174000084">The right hon. Gentleman also suggested that we were opposed to patios and extensions. As my hon. Friend the Member for Meriden said, it is unfortunately the changes to council tax that the Government are contemplating that will discourage people from enhancing their homes as we would like them to do. Our policy would enable local authorities to allow precisely such enhancement.</p>

In particular, she drew attention to its seriousness among black and ethnic minority people. I agree with her that we need to address the problem. Indeed, I have had the opportunity to make the point in Westminster Hall. I hope that the hon. Lady will join me in pressing the Minister to change the statutory definition of overcrowding, so that we have a more appropriate benchmark for government policy in the future. I also hope that she will join me in recognising that it was under the Conservative Government that we succeeded in increasing the amount of social housing that was supplied, and that under the present Government the amount of social housing released and supplied has diminished.</p>

Friend the Member for Tunbridge Wells&#151;who deserves enormous credit for having introduced a ten-minute Bill, which a Government Whip, sadly, tried to strangle the other day&#151;spoke with passion, fluency and great intellectual authority about the perversity of encouraging development on urban green space when the original brownfield designation was intended to ensure that industrial land was redeveloped. He pointed out, crucially, that for those of us who believe in creating more social and affordable housing, infill and garden development of the kind that we are seeing does not trigger the requirement to provide such housing that is laid down in the Government&#146;s regulations. That point was backed up by the hon. Member for Islington, North (Jeremy Corbyn).</p>

 We have had a wide-ranging debate this afternoon. The hon. Member for Hazel Grove (Andrew Stunell) raised issues to do with environmental standards for housing, about which I agree. My right hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich and Woolwich (Mr. Raynsford) pointed out some of the rather absurd&#151;if unintended&#151;consequences that the Opposition motion would have for extensions, which would be regarded as brownfield development.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o426"><a name="60621-0020.htm_para5"><a name="06062174000093">The right hon. Member for Bracknell (Mr. Mackay) asked about village design statements. I shall be happy to respond to him in more detail, but I assure him that we support those statements and want to give them a stronger role in the new planning guidance. My hon. Friend the Member for Luton, South (Margaret Moran) talked about the serious need for new homes in her constituency.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o427"><a name="60621-0020.htm_para6"><a name="06062174000094">The hon. Member for Tunbridge Wells (Greg Clark) raised a variety of points, and I shall respond to many of them in due course. However, he raised an important issue when he said that small housing developments do not include affordable housing. I agree that that is a significant matter, and it is one of the factors supporting the introduction of the planning gain supplement that may be more appropriate for smaller sites.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o428"><a name="60621-0020.htm_para7"><a name="06062174000095">My hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton  and Shepherd's Bush (Mr. Slaughter) raised some important points. I was very concerned by what he said about the attitude towards affordable housing of the new Conservative-controlled council in his area. That is a serious problem for people in his constituency.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o429"><a name="60621-0020.htm_para8"><a name="06062174000096">Opposition Front Benchers touched on a range of issues to do with density and planning guidance. However, I can tell the hon. Member for Surrey Heath (Michael Gove) that the Government make no apology for saying that we think that density should be greater. For many years, low-density executive developments have taken up large areas of greenfield land, and it is simply not true that one cannot build at relatively higher densities and still include gardens or wonderful designs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o430"><a name="60621-0020.htm_para9"><a name="06062174000097">I turn now to the main issues in the debate. The Opposition have called for an end to building on back gardens, but we need be clear about the facts. In 2005, 14 per cent. of new homes were built on residential land. <i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> Opposition Members have made their points, and I want to respond. That figure includes homes built on the footprint of previous buildings, and is not confined to homes built on drives or back gardens. In 1990, in contrast, 20 per cent. of new homes were built on previously developed residential land. Therefore, the proportion of new homes being built on previously developed residential land is lower today than it was in 1990.</p>

 Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I apologise to the House, but I now have very little time to respond to the many points made in the debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o431"><a name="60621-0020.htm_para10"><a name="06062174000103">It is certainly true that this Government have increased the emphasis on the use of brownfield land. We make no apology for that, as the result has been a renaissance in our cities and towns, the regeneration of many abandoned industrial sites and a substantial reduction in the amount of greenfield land needed for development. According to the urban taskforce, 90 people were living in the heart of Manchester in 1990; today, 25,000 people live there and the city is thriving as a result. The proportion of new homes on former industrial and commercial sites has more than doubled since 1997 as a result of the measures we have taken.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o432"><a name="60621-0020.htm_para11"><a name="06062174000104">Members have raised specific issues about brownfield categorisation. I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Tamworth (Mr. Jenkins): the issue should not be about blocking whole categories of development as either greenfield or brownfield, but about quality and appropriateness. It should also be about meeting needs. Opposition Members must recognise that we need to make sure that we meet the needs of the next generation for homes. To listen to some of them talk about flats and the problems of developing flats, we would think that flats was a dirty word. They need to recognise that it is not planning definitions and Government requirements that put pressure on their constituencies, but need and demand for housing. We all have an obligation to respond to that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o433"><a name="60621-0020.htm_para12"><a name="06062174000105">I agree that we need to strengthen the focus on quality and design both of buildings and of their neighbouring environment. That is why we set out in December new consultation on planning guidance, which states clearly:</p>
<a name="60621-0020.htm_brev0"><a name="06062174000707"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;New development should be of high quality inclusive design...The key consideration should be whether a development positively improves the character and environmental quality of an area and the way it functions.&#148;</p>

 To be fair to the hon. Member for Aldershot (Mr. Howarth), I am happy to clarify the point. We received no responses from Opposition Front Benchers on that issue&#151;nor from the hon. Member for Tunbridge Wells, who has made such a point of debating it in this place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o437"><a name="60621-0020.htm_para16"><a name="06062174000114">That is not what the debate is really about; it is about the fact that the Conservatives still oppose new housing. They still do not accept the fact that we need 200,000 new homes every year if we are to meet the needs  of future generations. The hon. Member for Meriden (Mrs. Spelman) has not only said that she will refuse to agree to the 200,000 additional homes we need, but has also told <i> The House Magazine</i> that she thinks 140,000 new homes is too many. We are already building more than 140,000&#151;that number is not too high.</p>

 I realise that the hon. Lady is short of time so I am grateful to her for giving way, but her point about our opposition to new homes cannot be squared with the Secretary of State&#146;s acknowledgement that I supported the proposal of the Conservative-controlled council in my borough to build new homes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o438"><a name="60621-0020.htm_para17"><a name="06062174000117">Conservative Members are still not facing up to the difficult question of where new homes should be built. They will not support the additional homes that we need and they will not support the additional funding for infrastructure, because they keep opposing anything like a planning gain supplement. They do not want new homes in the suburbs; they do not want them in the countryside either, where they want even more green belt to protect villages and towns. They do not want new homes on industrial land. The hon. Lady said in the <i> Western Morning News</i> that she objected to the &#163;60,000 homes on former industrial and NHS sites because:</p>
<a name="60621-0020.htm_brev2"><a name="06062174000709"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The grim reality is that the homes are in less than desirable locations such as next door to mines.&#148;</p>

 I present a petition from my constituent, Mr. George Hamilton, of Tweedmouth. Mr. Hamilton was employed by Borders regional council as an assistant head teacher at Duns primary school for 12 years. Subsequent to that employment, in 1988 he applied for a teaching post elsewhere but was unsuccessful.

 After recent local elections, one of my constituents, Mr. Alec McFadden, was subject to a sudden violent attack at his home in front of his two young daughters. A stranger called at the house, and tried to barge his way in when the front door was opened. My constituent fought to keep him out while he was punched and hit on the face. His oldest daughter had the great presence of mind to call the police as the struggle continued at the front door. Thankfully, the police arrived at the scene within two minutes, but the man fled, leaving my constituent covered in blood. He had not been punched at all, but knifed about the head, arms and face. He had to attend the accident and emergency department at Arrowe Park hospital to receive treatment for his wounds.

There appears to be a pattern of violence aimed at the individuals targeted by this website that cannot be simply a coincidence. The site appears to be registered to the Nazi group, Combat 18, and features advertisements for Aryan Nations and other extreme Nazi organisations. Much of the information on it appears to be sent in by BNP activists.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o461"><a name="60621-0021.htm_para18"><a name="06062174000652">The anti-fascist organisation, Searchlight, investigated the site in 2003 and found a sinister discussion group attached to it called the &#147;mole intelligence bureau&#148;, which includes the following call to arms:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o463"><a name="60621-0021.htm_para20"><a name="06062174000654">Rigorous action should be taken in respect of such incitement. The police have the power to monitor extremist chatrooms for the purposes of ensuring that criminality is not being organised. I certainly hope that that &#147;mole intelligence bureau&#148; and any of its successor chatrooms feature on the radar of the police in the monitoring role that they must perform to defend law-abiding citizens exercising their democratic rights.</p>

He was immediately featured on Redwatch for his trouble in raising the matter. Among other things, the Baroness emphasised the Protection from Harassment Act 1997 and mentioned the Internet Watch Foundation. Government responses to previous parliamentary questions about Redwatch have also referred to protection from racial and religious harassment. That is right, but the protection offered in the harassment statute does not appear to fit well with incitement to what I call political hatred which leads to violent criminal acts. That is what this hate website appears to be co-ordinating.</p>

 Does my hon.

Internet crime of all sorts is becoming a greater threat to us all, and it is clear that racists and fascists are taking advantage of loopholes to operate their websites with impunity.</p>

 I thank my hon. Friend for her intervention, which is very much to the point. She is right that any loopholes that exist because of the international nature of the internet and its rapid expansion need to be investigated carefully by the Government. I hope my hon. Friend the Minister agrees.</p>

If so, why has no action been taken to date to deal with Redwatch? If the Public Order Act is not appropriate to catch this sinister activity, will my hon. Friend undertake to review the protections that currently exist in domestic law to see how the gaps can be closed?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o473"><a name="60621-0022.htm_para2"><a name="06062174000668">Will my hon. Friend confirm that the fact that the hate website is hosted abroad does not shield it from prosecution if it incites violence, as my hon. Friend the Member for North Ayrshire and Arran (Ms Clark) just pointed out to the House? Will he explain what action has been taken by the police and prosecuting authorities to deal with the threat that such hate content presents to law-abiding UK citizens? I know that my hon. Friend the Minister has been at the forefront of the fight against images of child abuse appearing on websites and that he has been effective in working with internet service providers to close down UK-hosted sites and to filter criminal paedophile content from abroad. Will he now consider extending that sensible and effective approach to other extremist hate sites such as Redwatch? I note in the news today that an internet site that distributed links to illegal free music-swapping sites has been closed down by the Dutch authorities, because it encourages and facilitates lawbreaking. The time is right to end the scourge of hate sites in this country, which do the same thing for violent political ends.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o474"><a name="60621-0022.htm_para3"><a name="06062174000669">There will be those who argue that the existence of hate sites such as Redwatch is an expression of our freedom of speech that should be tolerated even if we disagree with it, but that argument is profoundly mistaken. When this House passed the Public Order Act 1936, Oswald Mosley&#146;s blackshirts were terrorising the east end of London and Hitler&#146;s brownshirts had brought him to power in Germany, and tolerance did not feature noticeably on their agenda. In that time of great peril, this House realised that there are limits to freedom of expression and that those limits lie in ensuring that ideologies of hate and violence are not given free reign. Such ideologies must be curbed in the interests of all and for the public good. That remains as true today as it was in the dark days that led to the second world war and the death of millions of innocent victims. Hate websites do not deserve the protection of the principle of freedom of speech when they seek to prevent others from exercising their democratic rights.</p>

 I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Wallasey (Angela Eagle) on securing the debate and on her excellent speech. The importance of the debate is apparent, because many of my hon. Friends have chosen to attend. Informed and constructive discussion is key to tackling the menace of extremism, and today&#146;s debate presents an excellent opportunity to examine the issues around extremist websites that incite hatred. I will try to answer my hon. Friend&#146;s points as I make my speech.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o476"><a name="60621-0022.htm_para5"><a name="06062174000672">The Government deplore extremism of that kind, and strongly condemn websites such as Redwatch. I am sure that we all agree that although freedom of expression and open debate are cornerstones of British democracy, there is no place within the wide spectrum of British politics for organisations that encourage violence or intimidation against those whose views they disagree with. I was particularly sorry to hear about the cowardly attack last month on my hon. Friend&#146;s constituent, Alec McFadden. My sympathies are with him and his family, and I wish him a speedy recovery from his injuries.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o477"><a name="60621-0022.htm_para6"><a name="06062174000673">It may be helpful if I set this issue in the wider context of the Government&#146;s work on hate crime. Hatred, violence and incitement to violence are deplorable in any circumstances, but when that hatred is founded on some belief, difference or characteristic of the victim, as is the case with the Redwatch website and as it is with racists and homophobes, it is particularly deplorable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o478"><a name="60621-0022.htm_para7"><a name="06062174000674">A Home Office working group is currently considering how to deliver a number of objectives in connection with the issue. The first objective is increasing the public&#146;s confidence in the criminal justice system and improving the way in which the criminal justice system responds to hate crime. The second objective is increasing the reporting of hate crime. The third objective is improving the proportion of hate crimes that are brought to justice. The fourth objective is improving the local response to hate crime, particularly in areas with high rates of hate crime. The fifth objective is increasing our knowledge base on hate crime.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o479"><a name="60621-0022.htm_para8"><a name="06062174000675">This work is currently focusing on crime motivated by race, faith and homophobic hatred, but the parallels with the topic that we are debating today are clear. A successful outcome, as measured against those objectives, will be a blow to the far right. Indeed, it could in some ways be regarded as indicative of positive changes in society that Redwatch feels so threatened by the anti-racism activists whom it targets that it feels the need to take such drastic action against them.</p>

Although there is no direct incitement to commit any criminal offence against the people publicised on the website, the language used to describe them is highly offensive and insulting, and the possible consequences very grave. The degree of intimidation that the website&#146;s targets feel as a result of being pictured or having their personal information published must be considerable.

It is an offence to incite others to commit an offence such as assault or criminal damage. Under the Public Order Act 1986, it is also an offence to use threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour, or to distribute threatening or abusive material with the intention of causing another person to believe that immediate unlawful violence will be used against them. Under the Protection From Harassment Act 1997, it is an offence for any person to behave in a way that they know, or ought to know, amounts to harassment or causes someone to fear violence. Under the same Act, victims of harassment may apply to the High Court for a civil restraining order. Such an order has in the past successfully been obtained by victims of animal rights extremists.

I want to respond to an important point that my hon. Friend raised. Anything that is illegal off line is also illegal online. Therefore, if a UK-based website publishes material that is not only offensive but illegal under the above framework, action can be taken against the person who owns the website, exactly as with somebody who might have published a leaflet or a poster. However, operators of some websites have been careful to try to avoid overstepping the conduct that the legislation has defined as criminal.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o485"><a name="60621-0022.htm_para14"><a name="06062174000685">The difficulty occurs when the website is hosted outside UK jurisdiction, as in the case of Redwatch, which is hosted in the United States. In those circumstances, we do not have the power to close down that website, or, in some cases, to prosecute the people responsible for it if illegal material was not distributed in or uploaded from the UK. However, the offence of inciting others to commit crimes would not be exempt from prosecution in those circumstances, regardless of whether the perpetrator had used a website hosted in a foreign jurisdiction. That is a genuine challenge, which calls for greater international co-operation and collaboration. We seek to do that whenever we have the opportunity, and we have initiated inquiries with the US Department of Justice to establish whether hosting such a website constitutes a breach of US law, regulations or industry good practice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o486"><a name="60621-0022.htm_para15"><a name="06062174000686">For UK-based websites, there is positive co-operation between internet service providers in this country and law enforcement agencies. Examples of that are the &#147;acceptable use&#148; policies, which most service providers put in place. They vary between companies, but will generally enable service providers to remove material from their site not only if it is illegal but in other circumstances. They may include complaints from people whose details have been published without their consent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o487"><a name="60621-0022.htm_para16"><a name="06062174000687">I can inform my hon. Friend and other hon. Members who are present that I shall raise all those issues with the internet service providers the next time I meet them.</p>

<p><a name="st_o451"><a name="06062174000688"><a name="60621-0022.htm_spnew5"><a name="06062174001300"><b>Angela Eagle:</b>
 I thank my hon. Friend for his positive response. Will he ask whether the internet service providers can extend the protections that they apply to the use of abusive photographs of children to the sort of content that we are considering? If so, they could filter out and close down the websites that can be accessed from the UK if they contain such criminal content. That would be a great step forward. Will he meet a delegation from the TUC and others to discuss the prospect of making progress on this matter?</p>

 As I said, I will raise all the issues that have been mentioned in the debate with the internet service providers the next time I meet them. I shall be happy to meet my hon. Friend, and a delegation, as soon as we can match diaries.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o488"><a name="60621-0022.htm_para17"><a name="06062174000690">I can also answer my hon. Friend&#146;s question about the Internet Watch Foundation. It has a remit to minimise the availability of potentially illegal internet content pertaining to images of child abuse hosted anywhere in the world, criminally obscene content hosted in the UK, and incitement to racial hatred content hosted in the UK.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o489"><a name="60621-0022.htm_para18"><a name="06062174000691">It is for the police to investigate complaints and decide whether there is evidence that website operators have committed offences&#151;for example, because of the content of their websites or links between such sites and other harassment or attacks against individuals. It is the approach of the police that if any person becomes aware of any threatening, racist or other hate material on a website, they should report it to their local police force. It is vital to report such material; otherwise the police cannot investigate it. I would encourage the police to continue their vital work of enforcing the law in this respect.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o490"><a name="60621-0022.htm_para19"><a name="06062174000692">Looking to the future, the Association of Chief Police Officers is working with the Home Office and the police national high-tech crime unit and will review its position on that sort of crime.</p>

 I am delighted that my hon. Friend has stated publicly that he would encourage the police to take action. Will he especially encourage West Yorkshire police to take action, given that Redwatch is based in Leeds and run by three individuals who are known to West Yorkshire police through a history of extreme political violence stretching back many years?</p>

<p><a name="st_o454"><a name="06062174000694"><a name="60621-0022.htm_spnew8"><a name="06062174001303"><b>Mr. Coaker:</b>
 I can confirm to my hon. Friend that we will be pleased to raise these issues with the police to see what their advice is on taking all these matters forward.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o491"><a name="60621-0022.htm_para20"><a name="06062174000695">The Home Office and police are also undertaking separate but related work on animal rights extremists&#146; use of the internet. A consultative seminar with practitioner stakeholders is being planned, which will look at the current guidance to police forces and seek to agree procedures and identify any gaps. Issues raised by hon. Members in the course of this debate will also be taken on board at the seminar.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o492"><a name="60621-0022.htm_para21"><a name="06062174000696">I am aware that the TUC did indeed write to the then Home Secretary in June 2005, following a meeting in March that year. May I apologise for the fact that the TUC did not receive a response to that letter? That was an unfortunate administrative oversight. I assure my hon. Friend that the TUC will now be updated on the matter as soon as possible.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o493"><a name="60621-0022.htm_para22"><a name="06062174000697">I hope that I have been able to provide some assurance to hon. Members that the Government are committed to tackling hate crime and incitement to violence wherever it is found. In conjunction with our broader work on hate crime, we are planning to review and strengthen the police response to this type of activity, and to take the appropriate measures to ensure the safety of the public.</p>
