 I start by paying tribute to the 15 brave men who tragically lost their lives in Afghanistan over the past 13 days. We have now lost 184 lives in the conflict, and each and every one of them is a terrible loss. The last week has been a hard week for those serving in theatre, but their resolve is incredible. In these tough times, they are determined to get on with their mission, and in the teeth of heavy resistance they are making progress. I urge colleagues in all parts of the House to be unfailing in our support for them. They deserve no less.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o0"><a name="90713-0001.htm_para0"><a name="0907134000024">Progress is being made, but the insurgency remains resilient. The majority of people can go about their daily lives, but in certain areas of the country, in particular in the south and east, significant security challenges  remain. In Helmand, British, Afghan, Danish, Estonian and American troops are currently engaged in major offensive operations to secure key population centres in the run-up to the Afghan presidential elections.</p>

 I join the Secretary of State and the whole House in paying tribute to the service personnel who lost their lives in recent days. They died serving their country and, to use those immortal words, for our tomorrows they gave their today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o1"><a name="90713-0001.htm_para1"><a name="0907134000026">Some of the greatest security threats that our service personnel face in Afghanistan are on the ground. Can the Secretary of State explain why he believes that the current provision of, and support for, helicopter cover is sufficient, particularly in the context of recent changes in policy and in the approach to operations in theatre, which put our troops' lives at greater risk?</p>

 As we have said repeatedly, we have seen a huge uplift in the helicopter frames available to commanders, and also in helicopter hours: over the past two years, there has been an 84 per cent. increase. There will be more: by the end of the year, we will have the Merlin in theatre, and we will get some of the eight Chinooks out into theatre in 2010. The issue that the hon. Gentleman raises points up the problem; changes in how operations are being conducted have led to more ground operations, which cannot be conducted from helicopters. At the moment, troops involved in Operation Panchai Palang are clearing compounds and taking on the Taliban in one of their heartland areas. There has been hand-to-hand fighting, which, sadly, resulted in some of the deaths that took place over the past week or so. That cannot be conducted from inside a highly armoured vehicle or a helicopter.</p>

 May I put it to my right hon. Friend that, tragic though all the deaths are, and although we must do as much as we can to minimise casualties, it is irresponsible and dishonest to pretend that if only the Government had provided this piece of equipment or that piece of equipment, all those lives could have been saved? That only serves to upset unnecessarily the grieving relatives.</p>

 My hon. Friend is right. In the Sangin area, we have lost five people who were conducting a security patrol. Such patrols are vital, and are done from time to time. There was a pretty well-planned ambush set for our people. One cannot conduct those security patrols other than on foot. We lost a member of 4 Rifles who had just dismounted from a Mastiff vehicle. It is the most heavily armoured vehicle that we have in theatre, but our troops have to get out to engage with people and to deal with the insurgency. Our troops have to take those risks; they understand that. I think that the British public understand that, too. I appeal to Members of the House to accept that that is inevitable. It is our duty to supply the kit and equipment needed to keep people as safe as we can, but we cannot remove risk from that kind of operation.</p>

 I agree with what the Secretary of State just said, but when the Chancellor of the Exchequer said over the weekend that the Treasury would ensure that the Ministry of Defence was not short of money, what, in practice, did he mean? What new actions will the Secretary of State take to take the Chancellor up on his promise?</p>

<p><a name="st_o6"><a name="0907134000031"><a name="90713-0001.htm_spnew5"><a name="0907134000867"><b>Mr. Ainsworth:</b>
 My right hon. Friend the Chancellor meant, for example, that the Treasury has lifted the urgent operational requirements ceiling of £635 million, which was announced in December, to include another £101 million, so that we get the latest capability into theatre. Everything that we need for that theatre of operations, we will present, and we will make sure that we get what is needed to keep our troops as safe as they can be. At a time when we are involved in the most serious operations in theatre-not only ourselves, but the Americans-people are contrasting the kit and equipment that we have with the Americans', but our colleagues have lost more people over the past couple of weeks than we have, despite their great inventory.</p>

 I was in Afghanistan earlier this year and, talking to ordinary soldiers who have been on several tours of duty, I was struck by the fact that they were forming the view that we were losing the battle of hearts and minds, and that we had gone from being seen as a force liberating the Afghan people from the Taliban to being seen as an occupying force. Does the Secretary of State agree that vital to our winning the battle, however we define winning, is keeping the support of ordinary Afghan people?</p>

 Absolutely. I have not personally come across that opinion out there, but I would not deny that there will be Afghans who hold that view. My hon. Friend is right. This operation will not be won by killing Taliban. It will be won by winning over the people-by protecting the people, and by the people accepting that we and the Afghan Government are on their side. That is the absolute priority of the new commander, General McChrystal, in the instructions that he is giving to forces of all nations in Afghanistan.</p>

not a shot would be fired? Was this not the beginning of a really serious misreading of the situation in Helmand, which is still continuing today and for which our armed forces are paying a heavy price?</p>

 It never was said that there was hope of not a shot being fired. What was said-it was said from the Dispatch Box and elsewhere, and I remember that I was sat in that chair along there at the time-by the then Secretary of State was that we would be happy if not a shot were fired. He was responding to a question. He was expressing a desire, but he would not have been putting 16 Air Assault Brigade into a theatre of war if he thought that there would not be a little bit of trouble in the area.</p>

 May I confirm what the Defence Secretary has just said? May I tell the right hon. and learned Member for Devizes (Mr. Ancram) that, no doubt inadvertently, he has just misled the House? I never at any stage expressed the hope, expectation, promise or pledge that we would leave Afghanistan without firing a shot. I did, however, insist that we would not be aggressors. We did not seek war. We did not go there as part of an invasion. For our part, we would be happy to go and work with the Afghan Government and leave without firing a shot. It was clearly in that sense that it was said, and I would be extremely obliged if that could be confirmed again from the Front Bench, and that Opposition Members would stop the misrepresentation of what was said when we went in.</p>

 No one denies that these are difficult and dangerous operations, but surely that does not absolve us of the responsibility to do everything in our power to minimise casualties. Is not the fundamental problem for the Government the fact that there is no comprehensive strategy to deal with the military, political, economic and narcotics issues, and that until a comprehensive strategy is agreed and implemented, we will continue to struggle in Afghanistan?</p>

 I would say two things to the right hon. and learned Gentleman. First, I keep hearing that there is no strategy. If people want to disagree with the strategy, that is fair enough, but please let no one deny that there is one. The strategy is about building up Afghan capability, both in security and in governance, so that the Afghans can get to a point where they are able to defend their own country from the insurgency and provide the basics for their own people. It will be a long time before they can do that. Afghan tax revenues doubled in the past year, but the Afghans will be dependent on international donations for a long time yet.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o2"><a name="90713-0001.htm_para2"><a name="0907134000040">Secondly, there is a strategy, but let us not pretend that its existence will get us out of a situation where our people must take on a very ingrained insurgency right in the heartland. They know how important it is that they maintain control of those central Helmand belts. Our people are going in there and clearing the insurgency  <br>

from that heartland. That is why our people are fighting. They know how important it is-how utterly important it is-to hang on. Sadly, we have lost some people. The insurgency has lost a lot of people-</p>

<p><a name="st_o16"><a name="0907134000042"><a name="90713-0001.htm_spnew15"><a name="0907134000877"><b>Mr. David Crausby (Bolton, North-East) (Lab):</b>
 We are, I believe, winning the war in Afghanistan, but if we do not work together in political partnership, we will certainly lose the argument with the British people for the justification of the conflict. So does my right hon. Friend agree that any attempt to play politics or point score while our troops are laying down their lives is beneath contempt?</p>

 Does the Secretary of State agree that the objective in Afghanistan is ultimately political, and that the military battle is a precondition for achieving that? Eight years in, the Taliban have been contained to a terrorist insurgency and no longer fight as a standing army. How does the Secretary of State believe that the international community can shift from a predominantly military battle to a political battle? Is not the lesson of all other terrorist insurgencies that, ultimately, they have to have a political solution, alongside the military one, and that that is what is needed if we are to avoid General McChrystal's warning about winning tactical victories but suffering a strategic defeat?</p>

 I think the hon. Gentleman is right. The military side of things can go as well as it likes, but unless we can make progress on those other strands, all will be for nought. There is not a single member of our armed forces who does not understand that, right down the chain of command. There is an election on 20 August, and it is important that it is credible; that it goes on to improve governance; that it goes on to provide better for the Afghan people; and that it goes on from a position not of weakness but of strength to hold out a hand to those parts of the insurgency that are prepared to come across, give up the armed struggle and involve themselves in politics.</p>

 It is a very great shame that we are currently engaged in an unseemly media row about airlift in Afghanistan. The defence world will know what that is about. It will expect my right hon.

 We need to maintain our support for our armed forces in the field.

I give my absolute assurance that I will do everything that I can to bring those dates as far forward as possible.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman goes back to a decision that was taken some time ago. We have made great strides to increase helicopter availability and capability, with a large degree of success over the past two years in Afghanistan. There are now 60 per cent. more helicopter frames and 80 per cent. more helicopter hours. Merlin is yet to be moved into theatre, and enhancements are possible both to Lynx and Chinook. That would make them better helicopters, more capable of dealing with a very difficult theatre.</p>

 I shall take that as a yes, shall I? People in this country understand the security need for our mission in Afghanistan and they understand that in wars there are casualties and fatalities. What they do not understand is why we are not doing everything we can to reduce the risks to our forces. We do need more and better armoured vehicles and we do need better ways of countering improvised explosive devices, but if we cannot move our forces by air, they will be more vulnerable on the ground. As Lord Guthrie, the former Chief of the Defence Staff, said:</p>

 We are looking at the MARS project, but I do not want my hon. Friend to be under any illusion about it. Where building war-fighting vessels such as the carriers or the Future Service Combatant, which will come on line after the carriers, are concerned, we have made a strategic decision as part of the defence industrial strategy to ensure that those ships are built-and, of course, subsequently supported-in this country. Where we are talking about logistic support ships or tankers, however, that does not apply, as we need to get the best value for money. It would thus be quite wrong to say that those ships are being reserved for the shipyards in the Clyde or elsewhere in the UK, but that does not mean that British shipyards would not be most welcome to bid for them-indeed, we would be delighted if they did and if they won a contract on a best-value basis.

 This has been a sad and difficult time for our armed forces and for our country, and I am sure the whole House will join me in sending our sincere condolences to the families and friends of the servicemen killed in Afghanistan in the past few days: Rifleman Daniel Hume, 4th Battalion the Rifles; Private John Brackpool, Prince of Wales's Royal Regiment; Riflemen Daniel Simpson, Joseph Murphy, James Backhouse and William Aldridge and Corporal Jonathan Horne, all of the 2nd Battalion the Rifles; and Corporal Lee Scott, 2nd Royal Tank Regiment. Riflemen Murphy, Backhouse and Aldridge were just 18 years of age. It is at times of loss and sadness such as these that we become ever more aware of the service and the sacrifice our armed forces give for our country. We owe them, and all those who have been killed or wounded in conflict, a huge debt of gratitude.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o8"><a name="90713-0004.htm_para0"><a name="0907134000156">I want to make a statement about the conclusions of the G8 meeting, the major economies forum on climate change, and our outreach meetings with African leaders, and to thank Prime Minister Berlusconi for his organisation of the G8 and related summits, but first I will focus on one of the most important and urgent matters considered in detail at our G8 meeting. This is a time of great challenge for our armed forces serving in Afghanistan. I have written to the Chair of the Liaison Committee and placed a copy of the letter in the Libraries of both Houses, and we are also making time available on Thursday for a debate on Afghanistan, but perhaps, Mr. Speaker, following the G8 discussions I could take this opportunity to update the House on our current strategy and operations in Afghanistan, alongside 40 other nations, and our work with Pakistan.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o9"><a name="90713-0004.htm_para1"><a name="0907134000157">Eight years ago, after 11 September 2001, the case for intervention in Afghanistan was clear: it was to remove the Taliban regime and deprive al-Qaeda of a safe base for terrorist plots that were a threat to countries around the world. In 2009, the case for our continued involvement is the same: to prevent terrorist attacks here in Britain and across the world by dealing with the terrorist threat at its source-that crucible of terror on the border and mountain areas of Afghanistan and Pakistan. We must not forget that three quarters of terror plots against the United Kingdom have roots in these areas.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o10"><a name="90713-0004.htm_para2"><a name="0907134000158">To succeed, we must succeed both in Afghanistan and Pakistan, so our strategy, which I set out to the House in April, reflects an integrated approach to both countries. If progress in one is to be sustainable, we must have progress in both, and progress requires three things: military action against terrorists and the insurgency; action to build the rule of law; and economic and social development to give local people a stake in their future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o11"><a name="90713-0004.htm_para3"><a name="0907134000159">In the last few months, the Pakistan Government have taken action, launching successful operations to drive out the Pakistan Taliban from the Swat and Buner regions. While the overwhelming majority of the Pakistani people fully support their Government's actions, operational success has come at a high humanitarian cost, with about 2 million displaced people. As we must ensure that this does not become a pretext for radicalisation, we are helping to lead in providing humanitarian assistance to Pakistan-as are other G8 countries-for these internally  <br>

displaced people, combining our support for Pakistan's security and military forces with development assistance and help with reconstruction.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o12"><a name="90713-0004.htm_para4"><a name="0907134000160">In Afghanistan, international forces must take the lead on the front line, because the Afghan army and police are not yet able to maintain control alone. Again, our strategy is to combine coalition military action with civilian support for development and training the Afghan forces to take more control.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o13"><a name="90713-0004.htm_para5"><a name="0907134000161">As the House knows, British troops are today involved in a major military operation-Panther's Claw-fighting to bring security to areas in central Helmand until now beyond the reach of the Afghan Government. American forces are engaged in a similar, co-ordinated operation in the south of the province. We are combining our military advance with civilian action. When we go into the towns and villages and districts in Helmand, our forces are supported by the Afghan army and police who, with our help, can hold the ground that we are clearing, and prevent the Taliban from returning. Our civilian and military stabilisation experts work with Governor Mangal and his district governors to follow up with plans for new roads, clean water and other basic services including, above all, justice-not the mediaeval brutality of the Taliban, but the rule of law.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o14"><a name="90713-0004.htm_para6"><a name="0907134000162">Earlier this year we announced an increase in our numbers for the summer campaign and the Afghan election period to around 9,000. Today, the figure on the ground is just above 9,100, as commanders rotate troops that have been fighting at peak intensity-it is right that those operating in the most arduous conditions are given respite when they need it. We keep our force levels under constant review, depending on the operational requirement, and I have been reassured by commanders on the ground and at the top of our armed services that we have the manpower we need for the current operations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o15"><a name="90713-0004.htm_para7"><a name="0907134000163">I spoke with President Karzai yesterday. He expressed his condolences at the loss of precious lives in Helmand, and I urged him to make available this summer-in addition to the 500 already involved in Panther's Claw-more Afghan army personnel for operations in Helmand, so that our hard-won gains can be fully consolidated.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o16"><a name="90713-0004.htm_para8"><a name="0907134000164">Our troops will continue to face a tough and dangerous battle, and we will continue to give their safety the highest priority. Since 2006-07, we have increased funding for the Afghan operation year on year, from the Treasury reserve and in addition to the defence budget, from £700 million in 2006-07; to £1.5 billion in 2007-08; to £2.6 billion in 2008-09; and to more than £3 billion this year-over and above the defence budget of £30 billion. The Chancellor has made it clear that all operational requirements will be met.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o17"><a name="90713-0004.htm_para9"><a name="0907134000165">In the last two years, we have increased helicopter numbers by 60 per cent. and because we have provided more crews and equipment we have increased capability by 84 per cent. Since 2006, we have spent more than £1 billion in urgent operational requirements for vehicles, including 280 Mastiffs, which offer world-leading protection against mines and roadside bombs. We will go further this year with the deployment of the new Ridgeback vehicles and Merlin helicopters. We have also just agreed a £100 million programme for the upgrading of Chinook helicopters.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o18"><a name="90713-0004.htm_para10"><a name="0907134000166">The Chief of the Defence Staff has said that</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o19"><a name="90713-0004.htm_para11"><a name="0907134000167">But we are not complacent. Our troops operate in a dynamic, ever-changing environment. This Government, and our military commanders, recognise the need to adapt as conditions develop.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o20"><a name="90713-0004.htm_para12"><a name="0907134000168">Despite the tragic losses of the last two weeks, our commanders assure me that we are having a major impact on the Taliban in central Helmand and that morale among our forces is high. Our brave servicemen and women know that taking the fight to the enemy as they are now doing, to prevent terrorism on the streets of Britain, will inevitably put them in harm's way. The majority of recent casualties have been sustained not in direct confrontation with the insurgency, but from improvised explosive devices, and from April we have begun to deploy additional units to tackle this growing threat.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o21"><a name="90713-0004.htm_para13"><a name="0907134000169">As I made clear in April when I announced for the period of the Afghan elections a temporary uplift to around 9,000 through the summer, we will review that commitment after the Afghan elections, with the advice of our commanders and in discussion with our allies. At the same time we will continue to strengthen our approach in the ways set out in our April strategy: by better continuity of our campaigns; by further improvements in civilian-military integration; by the closest possible co-ordination with American forces; and above all by a gradual shift towards training and mentoring of the Afghan army and police so that they can take more responsibility for what is happening in Afghanistan.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o22"><a name="90713-0004.htm_para14"><a name="0907134000170">At the G8 meeting, all members agreed on the importance of the work now being done in Afghanistan, and I talked directly with President Obama about the challenges we will face together. It has been a very difficult summer, and it is not over yet, but if we are to deny Helmand to the Taliban in the long term and if we are to defeat this vicious insurgency-and by doing so make Britain and the world a safer place-we must persist with our operations in Afghanistan. I am confident that we are right to be in Afghanistan, that we have the strongest possible plan, and that we have the resources we need to do the job.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o23"><a name="90713-0004.htm_para15"><a name="0907134000171">Let me turn to other matters raised at the G8 summit. The summit will be remembered as the climate change summit where we achieved real progress towards our goal of reaching a global climate change agreement at Copenhagen in December. First the G8 and then the major economies forum concluded that average global temperatures must rise by no more than 2°. That is an unprecedented and universal agreement, taking in developed and developing countries alike. It reflects a worldwide consensus unthinkable only a few years ago that the scientific evidence for climate change is irrefutable, and all of us now have a duty to act.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o24"><a name="90713-0004.htm_para16"><a name="0907134000172">The summit agreed that developing countries will contribute to a global agreement by undertaking actions promptly</p>

The G8 also agreed a global consensus on what we have to do to accelerate progress on maternal and child health and on the millennium development goals on which, historically, we have made the least progress to date. In meeting with leading African nations, President Obama, I and other leaders agreed decisive action on food security to avert the hunger emergency.

 I join the Prime Minister in paying tribute to the eight servicemen killed since last Wednesday: from the 2nd Battalion the Rifles, Corporal Jonathan Horne and Riflemen William Aldridge, James Backhouse, Joseph Murphy and Daniel Simpson; from the 2nd Royal Tank Regiment, Corporal Lee Scott; from the Prince of Wales's Royal Regiment, Private John Brackpool; and from the 4th Battalion the Rifles, Rifleman Daniel Hume. They died serving our country. We must look after their families. We must thank them for what they have done, and we must never forget what they have done for our country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o42"><a name="90713-0004.htm_para34"><a name="0907134000191">Everyone serving in Afghanistan should know that they have the support and admiration of hon. Members on both sides of the House and the whole country. Does the Prime Minister agree that more needs to be done to set out and explain the right strategy in Afghanistan? It must be tightly defined, hard-headed and realistic. As he said, we need to be absolutely clear about what our mission should be: it is about security; it is to deny the ability of al-Qaeda to have bases in Afghanistan.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o43"><a name="90713-0004.htm_para35"><a name="0907134000192">On equipment, the Prime Minister talks about the increase in helicopter capacity since 2006, but is not the real point that the number of troops has doubled since 2006, so, proportionately, there has not really been an increase in helicopter capacity at all? Does he regret the £1.4 billion cut in the helicopter programme that he, as Chancellor of the Exchequer, pushed through in 2004? Of course, helicopters alone are not enough and helicopters are not invulnerable, but the former Chief of the Defence Staff, Lord Guthrie, has said very clearly that more helicopters would save lives, so does not more need to be done right now?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o44"><a name="90713-0004.htm_para36"><a name="0907134000193">On troop numbers, when the Prime Minister is asked whether military commanders requested 2,000 more troops, his response is always that 700 more troops are being provided for the election, but can he now answer the key question: was he asked for 2,000 more? If he turned down that request, can he explain the reason that he gave at the time? I listened very carefully to what  <br>

he said in his statement: "I have been reassured by commanders on the ground and at the top of the armed services that we have the manpower that we need for the current operations." Those are clearly very carefully chosen words, but they raise the question of whether commanders asked for more troops to do more things, so that it would be easier to achieve the objectives that we all want to be achieved. I hope that he will be able to answer that question when he stands to speak again.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o45"><a name="90713-0004.htm_para37"><a name="0907134000195">On Pakistan, it is right that we have a combined strategy. Can he tell us how much aid is being delivered by British non-governmental organisations and the British Government in tribal areas, where it is extremely difficult to get through?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o46"><a name="90713-0004.htm_para38"><a name="0907134000196">On the Afghan national army, which the Prime Minister talked about in his statement, can he tell us not just how many troops are now available, but what agreements he achieved following his discussions with President Karzai? Figures suggest that less than 10 per cent. of Afghan forces are actually in Helmand province, even though almost half the fighting in Afghanistan is taking place in Helmand. Can he confirm those figures?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o47"><a name="90713-0004.htm_para39"><a name="0907134000197">On other issues discussed at the G8, I welcome what the Prime Minister said on non-proliferation. I very much agree with what he said about Iran. I welcome the fact that we will take a lead in drawing up EU sanctions if Iran does not take positive steps forward.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o48"><a name="90713-0004.htm_para40"><a name="0907134000198">Clearly, the central issues at the G8 were development, trade, climate change and the economy; let me ask briefly about each. On development, this morning we reaffirmed our commitment to 0.7 per cent. of gross national income to be spent on aid by 2013. I know that the Prime Minister will welcome cross-party agreement on that issue. Does he agree that it strengthens our ability to ask other countries to do more? Is it not the case specifically that Italy is cutting its aid budget this year and is planning to spend little over 0.1 per cent. of its national income on aid? Does that not make a mockery of the G8's Gleneagles commitments that were solemnly entered into four years ago? By next year, 2010, development aid was meant to have increased by $50 billion, with $25 billion of that going to Africa. Is it not the case that, four years on, countries are on track to meet around half of their commitments, and will that not sap people's faith in these meetings and the promises that are made?</p>

and India are now over, so those stumbling blocks are being overcome, but can the Prime Minister tell us whether he sees real evidence of political will to make progress happen?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o50"><a name="90713-0005.htm_para1"><a name="0907134000204">On climate change, let it be said that getting agreements from all these countries on cuts in carbon emissions which are domestically painful is not easy, and the progress made at the G8 is very encouraging given the importance of the Copenhagen conference later this year. Is it not the case, though, that of the three things that were necessary, two have happened? First, every country committed to the 2° target, and secondly the G8 committed to the 80 per cent. goal for industrialised countries. However, is it not disappointing-and is it not better to acknowledge this-that the wider group of countries did not commit to the 50 per cent. goal for the whole world? Does the Prime Minister agree that that highlights the need for interim targets before 2050 if we are to have any chance of getting those other countries on track?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o51"><a name="90713-0005.htm_para2"><a name="0907134000205">On the economy, the G8 discussed financial regulation, bank support for business and the need to get deficits under control. In each of those three areas is it not clear that Britain is failing badly? On financial regulation, will the Prime Minister finally take this opportunity to admit that the tripartite system that he established has failed? On bank lending, let us just take one scheme. Can the Prime Minister confirm that as of a week ago the automotive assistance programme, launched in a blaze of glory to help the car industry, had yet to guarantee a single loan? On deficits, will he confirm the IMF's finding that we are heading for the largest budget deficit not only in the G8 but in the entire G20? Is it not the case that the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development forecast a deficit of 14 per cent.? That is twice as high as when Denis Healey went to the IMF in the 1970s, and by far the largest figure since the war. Does the Prime Minister not agree that the most important lesson this country needs to learn is that it should never allow the public finances and the budget deficit to get in such a mess again?</p>

 Let me start with Afghanistan. I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman for what he said about the debt that we owe to our troops. Over the past weekend, which has been very difficult for our forces, I talked to the Chief of the Defence Staff, and I talked this morning to our commander on the ground in Afghanistan, Brigadier Tim Radford. I visited the Northwood joint headquarters to receive a briefing on Operation Panther's Claw, and this morning I visited RAF Benson to see the progress of the Merlin helicopter programme and talk to some of our very brave helicopter pilots who are in Afghanistan. Of course, I have also talked to President Obama about progress in Afghanistan, and yesterday to President Karzai, who I keep in regular touch with to talk about events in Afghanistan and what we can do.</p>

come Afghan forces, whose numbers I want to see raised very substantially over the next few weeks. The civilian effort led by Governor Mangal is in place. It is our hope not only to take the ground and to clear it, but to hold it, using both our own forces and Afghan forces. At the same time, there should be a civilian effort to make sure that the land is held and that people believe that they have a stake in the future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o53"><a name="90713-0005.htm_para4"><a name="0907134000208">I have to say to the right hon. Gentleman, despite his quotations from various people, that the British Army spokesman in Helmand province, Lieutenant-Colonel Nick Richardson, has repeated what has been said to me in private. He said publicly:</p>
<a name="90713-0005.htm_brev0"><a name="0907134000843"><ul><p class="tabletext">"Absolutely we have the proper equipment. Our equipment is first rate and we have plenty of it. It's...about having a full range of equipment, people are being critical of vehicles, we have a full range of vehicles here that help provide the protection that soldiers need."</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o54"><a name="90713-0005.htm_para5"><a name="0907134000209">He went on to say:</p>
<a name="90713-0005.htm_brev1"><a name="0907134000844"><ul><p class="tabletext">"So everything from the vehicles to the personal protective equipment, whether it's body armour, helmets and also the weaponry, and also the specialist equipment, it's here, it's great...it works".</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o55"><a name="90713-0005.htm_para6"><a name="0907134000210">I have to say, also, that when he was asked about helicopters, he said:</p>
<a name="90713-0005.htm_brev2"><a name="0907134000845"><ul><p class="tabletext">"There's much speculation about helicopters and have we got enough. It's a sad fact that helicopters would not have saved the lives of the individuals last week. We've got to be...on the ground, we've got to be interacting with the population-you cannot conduct a war from a helicopter. So the equipment we have is very, very good. In terms of would we like more, any commander will say yes, we'd like more. Yes, we'd like more equipment and we'd like more troops, whatever it may be, but my commander is very hard over on the fact that he has sufficient to get on with the task...which he has been given."</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o56"><a name="90713-0005.htm_para7"><a name="0907134000211">I hope that the information that comes from people on the ground who are working in Afghanistan is taken on board by the House in this debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o57"><a name="90713-0005.htm_para8"><a name="0907134000212">We have increased the number of helicopters by 60 per cent. in less than two years. Because we have more crews and because we have made adjustments to those helicopters, we have increased the capability of those helicopters-in other words, the flying hours that they can do-by 84 per cent. By the end of this year, the Merlin helicopters, which I saw this morning when I visited RAF Benson, will be on the ground in Afghanistan. In addition, we contract from NATO a lot of helicopters that do the work of getting our equipment on to the ground. We have created a helicopter fund, so that we and other people can contribute to countries that will provide helicopters, and we will pay for them to be upgraded. That will create 11 helicopters over the next period of time. We are working very closely with the United States of America on those issues, and of course we have set aside £6 billion for future investment, particularly in the new Lynx helicopter, over the next 10 years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o58"><a name="90713-0005.htm_para9"><a name="0907134000213">I hope that Opposition Members who want to make an issue of the fact that there are insufficient helicopters will take it on board that while of course we would want more helicopters, there has been a 60 per cent. increase, and there will be more on the ground by the end of the year. In addition, of course, we are converting eight Chinooks to enable them to deal with the weather in Afghanistan. I have to say that to move helicopters from Iraq to Afghanistan is very difficult, because the weather in Afghanistan and the terrain on which people are operating are very difficult. The helicopters have to be converted. Our crews have got to be trained for the  <br>

ground on which they are fighting. I believe that people appreciate that we are striving daily to have the best equipment available for our troops in Afghanistan.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o59"><a name="90713-0005.htm_para10"><a name="0907134000214">As for the numbers of troops, in our discussions with the military, of course one talks about all the options that are available, but let me just make it clear that we decided, after discussion with our military and with President Obama, that we would increase the number of troops from 8,100 at the point at which we discussed the matter to 9,000. There are today about 9,150 people on the ground in Afghanistan. I repeat that I have been reassured by commanders on the ground and at the top of the armed services that we have the manpower that we need for current operations. I have also said that once the elections are over, we will review the numbers with our allies and with our commanders on the ground.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o60"><a name="90713-0005.htm_para11"><a name="0907134000215">We have made our additions to the numbers in Afghanistan. We have persuaded some other countries to contribute more troops, but we are the second largest provider of troops for Afghanistan. We are far ahead of other countries, and we insist that there has got to be proper burden-sharing across NATO. I hope that every section of the House will want to support that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o61"><a name="90713-0005.htm_para12"><a name="0907134000216">I repeat that in April we published our strategy for Afghanistan and Pakistan. We understand very clearly that we must have success in both countries if we are to be able to deal with the problem of terrorism. We also understand that military action alone, although vital, is not sufficient. We need action on the ground with development aid, and we need to train local people to take responsibility for security in their areas. Our strategy in Afghanistan and Pakistan is to tackle the terrorist threat. We are now in a position where the Pakistan Government are taking action in the Swat and in Waziristan, and progress is being made in the Swat valley.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o62"><a name="90713-0005.htm_para13"><a name="0907134000217">Therefore, we have a complementary strategy in Afghanistan and Pakistan to tackle the terrorist threat, to strengthen local forces on the ground, to bring development help to these areas, and in Afghanistan to tackle the heroin trade that is so costly not only in Afghanistan, but around the world. That is the strategy that we are pursuing with our American allies and with 40 other allies in the region, who are contributing to the effort.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o63"><a name="90713-0005.htm_para14"><a name="0907134000218">I repeat that there needs to be burden sharing not just in troops, but in development. We are contributing a substantial amount of development aid both in Afghanistan and in Pakistan. We have shifted aid from the other areas of Pakistan to the north-west area. We are determined to do more in those areas to help young people to go to school, for example, and to make sure that the internally displaced people in Pakistan have homes that they can go to and proper services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o64"><a name="90713-0005.htm_para15"><a name="0907134000219">I come to the other issues raised by the Leader of the Opposition. It is precisely because we must meet our commitments on development aid that we, the British Government, have issued a call to action. We have asked other countries to join us in realising the poverty emergency that exists and what we have to do.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o65"><a name="90713-0005.htm_para16"><a name="0907134000220">Let me be clear that the reason that we could not get an agreement on trade in 2008 was that the Indians and the Americans could not come to an agreement on what was called a very specific safeguard clause for Indian imports. I believe that that barrier is being removed. That is why I believe that there is hope that the new  <br>

<p><a name="stpa_o66"><a name="90713-0005.htm_para17"><a name="0907134000221">On climate change, the right hon. Gentleman knows that our policy is not only long-term targets and that there must be help for developing countries; interim targets must be agreed as well. That is what we will be discussing at the Pittsburgh summit, then at the United Nations, and then on the road to Copenhagen in December.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o67"><a name="90713-0005.htm_para18"><a name="0907134000222">On the economy, I repeat that it is because we have succeeded in getting global action, partly at the G20 meetings in Washington and London, and partly at the G8 meeting that we have just had, that the world has a shared policy to deal with the recession. It is to create financial stability. The Americans are proposing a similar arrangement to the one that we have-the regulators, the central Bank and the Government work together. That is precisely what the Americans are proposing to do. I remind the right hon. Gentleman that no financial policy in future can work unless the Treasury, the Bank of England and the financial regulatory authorities work together. To my knowledge, no country that was at the G8 shares the right hon. Gentleman's proposal to cut public spending at a time when people need it, and to fail to support a recovery.</p>

 I thank the Prime Minister for his statement and join him in paying tribute to Corporal Jonathan Horne, Rifleman William Aldridge, Rifleman James Backhouse, Rifleman Joseph Murphy and Rifleman Daniel Simpson, all of the 2nd Battalion the Rifles, Private John Brackpool of 1st Battalion the Welsh Guards, Corporal Lee Scott of 2nd Royal Tank Regiment, and Rifleman Daniel Hume of 4th Battalion the Rifles. This is a heartbreaking roll call of losses, including many young men who displayed courage and a professionalism well beyond their years. We all owe them a great deal.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o68"><a name="90713-0005.htm_para19"><a name="0907134000224">I believe that the British people are resilient and understand the sacrifices that are inevitable in conflict, as long as the purpose of that conflict is clearly explained and understood, but how can people understand the true nature of this war when the Government have refused to explain what the achievable aims of the mission really are? For the past eight years, the Government have been sending mixed signals about the nature and purpose of the deployment. In the past week we have had the Prime Minister and the Defence Secretary giving different justifications for the war.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o69"><a name="90713-0005.htm_para20"><a name="0907134000225">We on the Liberal Democrat Benches support the Afghan mission to stabilise Afghanistan and to reduce the threat of terrorism to British citizens. However, we need to be very clear about the limits of what we can achieve. Military action may be able to contain problems but not resolve them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o70"><a name="90713-0005.htm_para21"><a name="0907134000226">We have learned some difficult lessons in the past eight years.

space for the state to grow? Does he see that, since our troops first stepped into Afghanistan, the Government's strategy has been over-ambitious in aim and under-resourced in practice? Is it not time to commit the necessary resources and to set a reasonable goal? When exactly-he still has not answered this question today-will he find a way to send the desperately needed helicopters to our troops on the ground?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o72"><a name="90713-0005.htm_para23"><a name="0907134000228">When will the Prime Minister seek full co-ordination of the international political strategy in Afghanistan? We know that President Karzai vetoed last year the appointment of a single, strong political figure to co-ordinate the international effort in Afghanistan, so will the Prime Minister prevail upon President Karzai or his successor to reverse that decision and to accept the appointment of a single senior figure with sufficient authority to bring together the piecemeal strategies of the international community?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o73"><a name="90713-0005.htm_para24"><a name="0907134000229">Finally, I should like to turn to the G8 summit conclusions on nuclear non-proliferation. It is likely that conflicts such as Afghanistan will dominate in the coming years, rather than the old, state-to-state conflicts of the cold war era, so I welcome the position-the strong line-taken at the G8 on nuclear non-proliferation and the 2010 non-proliferation talks. However, does the Prime Minister not agree that rushing to commit Britain to like-for-like replacement of the cold war era Trident system hardly puts us at the forefront of such efforts? Is it not time both to admit that we do not need and cannot afford Trident on that scale, and to start to look properly at the alternatives, so that we can then commit the resources needed to our brave troops on the ground in Afghanistan and elsewhere?</p>

 I hope that the right hon. Gentleman will agree that what I set out as our Afghanistan and Pakistan strategy is very similar to what he asks us to do: first, that military action has to be complemented by other actions; secondly, that we must get the Afghan people into a position where their troops and their police are able to take responsibility for law and order, justice and security in their own area; and, thirdly, that that must be matched by development aid. Our increase in development support for farming and the social and economic development of Afghanistan is exactly what the right hon. Gentleman wants to see.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o74"><a name="90713-0005.htm_para25"><a name="0907134000231">Our strategy is very clear: to deal with a terrorist threat that could affect the streets of our own country, we have to take pre-emptive action to deal with terrorism in Afghanistan and Pakistan. In 2001, al-Qaeda was based in Afghanistan and was pushed out into Pakistan, but in 2009 we have the Afghan Taliban, the Pakistani Taliban and al-Qaeda in the mountainous areas on the borders of Pakistan. We have to see joint, co-ordinated action both in Pakistan to deal with the terrorist threat there, as is now happening, and in Afghanistan, where we are clearing areas and making it possible for free elections to take place. I hope that the right hon. Gentleman will agree that both our strategy and the way in which we are seeking to pursue it are in line with what he is suggesting.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o75"><a name="90713-0005.htm_para26"><a name="0907134000232">I repeat to the right hon. Gentleman, because I do not think that he heard what I said, that there has been a 60 per cent. increase in helicopters and an 84 per cent.  <br>

increase in the capability of our helicopter forces. The Merlin helicopters from Iraq are being adapted so that they can be brought to Afghanistan as quickly as possible; we set up a helicopter fund to allow other countries to contribute helicopters, to upgrade them for the terrain in Afghanistan and to contribute to that development effort; and, of course, we are working with the Americans, who have helicopters, too, so that we can share the use of that particular equipment. I hope that he will agree also that the £6 billion that we are investing in helicopters is something that all of us can support.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o76"><a name="90713-0005.htm_para27"><a name="0907134000233">On development in Afghanistan, I should remind the right hon. Gentleman that General McChrystal is head of ISAF and the US operations, so there is now the co-ordination that before there was not. Kay Eide is the head of the development operation. Of course we want development projects to move a lot quicker, and of course I keep pressing President Karzai to ensure that his Government take direct action to ensure that that happens. However, 6 million Afghan children are at school who were not at school previously, and there are huge increases in the amount of health care available to the Afghan people. I caution the right hon. Gentleman: the support for the Afghanistan-Pakistan strategy is common to America and the 41 nations that are part of the coalition. We all have the same objective: to reduce and remove the terrorist threat by supporting the development of local control in Pakistan and Afghanistan.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o77"><a name="90713-0005.htm_para28"><a name="0907134000235">Let me say this to the right hon. Gentleman about the non-proliferation treaty. What we want to achieve is in the spirit of the original non-proliferation treaty. We offer to non-nuclear states the chance of civil nuclear power under conditions in which the transfer of that power to those states can be safe. At the same time, we secure an agreement that they will not adopt nuclear weapons. Furthermore, unlike in the case of Iran, the duty of those countries will be to show that they are not proliferating nuclear weapons, rather than our duty being to prove that by our investigations. I hope that there will be major progress on the non-proliferation treaty.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o78"><a name="90713-0005.htm_para29"><a name="0907134000236">As for Trident, let me be clear. We need collective action for disarmament involving all the nuclear states, and that is also one of the promises of the non-proliferation treaty. At a time when North Korea and Iran are developing nuclear weapons and other countries in the Gulf are threatening to do so, people would find it strange for Britain-a country that has nuclear weapons-simply to surrender hers unilaterally at the moment.</p>

 The Defence Secretary has rightly said that our role in the south began in 2006, and it has been a very important role, because Helmand is the most dangerous of the provinces. For as long as there is a terrorist threat and it is not possible for Afghanistan or Pakistan to deal with it, they will need some kind of help from other powers. That does not necessarily mean military forces on the ground, but it does necessitate help to back them up. We are committed to giving help to the Pakistani authorities to deal with the terrorist threat in their areas. We are working closely with the security services but also giving what support we can to the army, and making it clear that development aid is available. We have to deal with the situation in Pakistan and in Afghanistan by working together with their Governments, but we hope that over time they will take more responsibility for their own affairs. Particularly in Afghanistan, we hope that the numbers in the army can rise from 80,000 to 130,000, and perhaps a great deal higher, and the number of police can rise to about 70,000, so that the country will be able, gradually, step by step, to take more control over its own affairs.</p>

With the Americans and other coalition powers, we are training about 2,000 new troops in Afghanistan every month. The Afghan army has grown in numbers to between 70,000 and 80,000, and, as I said, it is set to grow to 130,000. In the long term, we want the Afghan army and the Afghan police to be able to take more control over their own affairs.

I have made my statement about the commitments that we have made in relation to troop numbers. We will review that with President Obama and others after the election. However, the hon.

 My right hon. Friend makes very wise comments about the connection between Afghanistan and Pakistan. First, let me say to him that if I can help in any way with his constituent's problem, will he please raise it with me directly and I will investigate what has happened? It is important to recognise that the Pakistan Government and the Pakistan army are now taking action in the Swat valley against the Pakistan Taliban, and that they are preparing to take action in Waziristan against al-Qaeda as well. That is an important development for the future prospects of security in the region. The fact that action is being taken in Pakistan, and that it is being complemented by the action that we are taking in Afghanistan, means that there is a legitimate hope that we can curtail the threat from terrorism and, at the same time, strengthen the institutions of Pakistan and Afghanistan. Like my right hon. Friend, I want Pakistan to be a strong member of the Commonwealth.</p>

The exercise, Panther's Claw, which is being carried out at the moment, has the resources that are necessary and is making real advances.

 My hon.

In the past two weeks, we have set up the innovation fund, which will enable companies with low-carbon technology innovations to apply for help. We estimate that, along with the £150 million that we are investing, about £1 billion of private investment will come forward. Any company in my hon. Friend's constituency or elsewhere in the country that wishes to see investment in low-carbon technology and believes that it can benefit from the innovation fund should apply for that support.

Bearing in mind the Prime Minister's reference in his statement to burden-sharing and his specific comment that, "In Afghanistan, international forces must take the lead on the front line", will he name the major European countries that over the past year have committed soldiers on the ground in Helmand province, provided helicopters and other military equipment and provided financial support for the British effort in Helmand?</p>

 May I assure my right hon. Friend that the House, and indeed the whole country, will be very reassured by his assurance that we are strictly realistic in our aims in Afghanistan?

There has been a shift in strategy to enable them to be involved in discussions that I hope will lead to greater reconciliation in Afghanistan. He is absolutely right that it is the combination of the military action we have taken, the building up of Afghan police and security, the development of relationships at the local level with the tribal chiefs, at the same time as pursuing a course of economic and social development, that will bring stability to Afghanistan and ensure that the land is free of terrorist influence.</p>

It should receive Royal Assent before that date, or before the House rises for the recess at the very latest. However, it is only prudent for us to take precautions to ensure that it will endure in the event of parliamentary timetabling-which is always strained at this point in the Session-making it impossible for it to complete its passage within that time frame. The extension motion is intended to ensure that the life of the Bill-an important Bill that has spent some time in the House already-will continue beyond 17 July this year if that is necessary for the effective timetabling of parliamentary business. The motion in no way reflects any lessening of the Government's determination to put the Bill on to the statute book as soon as possible-I hope that Members in all parts of the House will agree on that-but it is only right for us to make provision for all future possibilities.</p>

 I think it fair to say that the Minister and I, and our respective teams, have come a long way with this marathon piece of legislation. What was a very weak and partisan Bill became-bit by bit, debate by debate, in both Houses-a Bill that I think we can broadly say was built on consensus. I am afraid, however, that that seems no longer to be the case. Given that we received the Minister's amendments only today, no one has yet been able to give proper and full consideration to the impact of clause 8 in its amended state.

Have the Government really become so weak that they have to introduce a series of major amendments to our electoral law just a few hours before they are debated? Frankly, this is outrageous. The Bill has been passing through Parliament for more than 18 months and it is unacceptable that this issue could not have been dealt with earlier within one of the two Houses.</p>

I should take this opportunity to acknowledge the usual spirit of co-operation that we have enjoyed with the Secretary of State and his Minister. However, it is totally unacceptable for them to come here today and announce this major change of policy, which I first saw only in Saturday's edition of <i> The</i><i> Guardian</i>,<i> </i>and then to throw six pages of complicated amendments at us this morning.

Our position now is that the Government should take this Bill away, rethink it and come back in the next Session with a new Bill that we can debate properly. A significant number of knock-on issues emanate from this, and we need to think them through carefully.

 I thought that the hon. Gentleman was keen to disagree-I am delighted that I have the agreement of the Labour Back Benchers. They do not wish to intervene and tell me that I am wrong to want more time to discuss these matters. Please will the Minister reconsider, will he see that this has broken any chance of consensus and will he grant us more time? There is plenty of time this week or next week.</p>

 Will my right hon. Friend the Minister guarantee that there will be sufficient time to discuss the important issue of politically motivated leaders of local authorities who deliberately try to keep registration at a low level? The Minister will recall that I have given the example in previous debates of the Liberal leader of Islington local authority, who, when approached by the Labour group to have a registration drive before an election, was adamantly opposed to that idea because that was how Liberals won elections. Will there be sufficient time to discuss these important issues?</p>

 I am not at all surprised that the Conservative party opposes the Bill. I want to see it come on to the statute book as soon as possible so that we can get more transparency on the funding of political parties and of elections in particular. I know that this Bill will cause problems for the Conservative party because it currently abuses the system. It acts in a way that the public perceive as totally improper in funding campaigns with tens of thousands of pounds even before the starting point of the election is reached. That is an abuse of the system. I want to see that stopped, and that is why I will be supporting the Government.</p>

 Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. I shall abide by your wishes and not be distracted from the motion that we are discussing.

 As always, we have had a very interesting little exchange on these matters, but the contributions from Opposition Members have been unusually baffling and illogical. Of course, I agree with the hon. Member for Argyll and Bute (Mr. Reid). He is quite right that we need to get this done as quickly as possible, but the contributions that we have heard from both Opposition Front Benchers demonstrate exactly why we need to allow a little bit of time for the Opposition to get their act together.</p>

 Does the right hon. Gentleman realise quite how offensive it is to suggest that the Opposition need time to get our act together, when the Government, on a matter of huge difficulty, which is the legislative equivalent of brain surgery, have produced six pages of amendments on the morning that these matters are to be debated in the House? To suggest that the Opposition need time suggests a lack of self-awareness that beggars belief.</p>

 With great respect to the right hon. Gentleman, I certainly would not want to cause any offence whatsoever, but if he had borne with me just a little, I would have explained precisely why the Opposition need to get their act together. I do not wish to cause him offence, but if he listens to me, I will explain exactly why I said that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o100"><a name="90713-0008.htm_para6"><a name="0907134000333">These amendments were debated at some length in the other place. I respectfully point out to Opposition Front Benchers that consensus is a matter not just of two Front-Bench teams reaching agreement, but of the whole House reaching agreement in so far as possible. We also need to take proper recognition of the sentiments in the other place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o101"><a name="90713-0008.htm_para7"><a name="0907134000334">In the other place, as the right hon. Gentleman will be aware, a very large number of Conservative peers take the Conservative Whip-200 or so. I wonder whether he can remember how many of them voted against the amendments that the other place passed. I will remind him: it was 40. He will be aware that a significant number of Cross Benchers also voted in favour of the amendments. We have to take account of the sentiment of the other place, and I am surprised that Opposition Front Benchers do not wish to do that. We believe that it is right and proper to do so. We are conscious of the time frame. These issues have been debated. We think that there is sufficient time to debate that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o102"><a name="90713-0008.htm_para8"><a name="0907134000335">I reassure my hon. Friend the Member for Vale of Clwyd (Chris Ruane) that we will have time in later debates to discuss the matter that he has raised, and I will do so in relation to the appropriate clauses.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o103"><a name="90713-0008.htm_para9"><a name="0907134000336">I am baffled by the contribution of the hon. Member for Cambridge (David Howarth). On the one hand, he seems to be calling for a strict deadline to be imposed on the Bill; on the other hand, he has been vituperative in his criticism of us for not allowing sufficient time to discuss the Bill. As so often, I am afraid, the Liberal Democrats are facing both ways.</p>

 Before I deal with the substance of the amendments, Madam Deputy Speaker, I wonder whether I would be allowed to put on record my deep shock and sorrow at the death of Lord Kingsland, of which I learned yesterday. I have recently had a great deal to do with Lord Kingsland, although I did not know him particularly well before that. I talked to him only last Thursday in the context of the Parliamentary Standards Bill. I know that I speak for all Labour Members in saying that everybody who dealt with him found him utterly delightful, courteous, and firm in his opinions but ready to concede that others have opinions. I would like to send my deepest condolences to his family and friends, and to his party.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o108"><a name="90713-0009.htm_para2"><a name="09071325000496">The amendments arise from those moved by Lord Campbell-Savours in the other place during a well-attended debate on 15 June. At that time-I had expressed this view in this House-the Government advised the other place to vote against amendments that would have had the effect of making donations impermissible unless the donors met standard conditions for a permissible donation and, in addition, were ordinarily resident and domiciled within the United Kingdom. My noble Friend Lord Bach spoke, at <i> Hansard </i>column 914, about the Government's serious concerns about the amendments on what he described as "principled, practical and legal grounds", and set out the position of the Government. It is no great secret that that has indeed been the Government's position.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o109"><a name="90713-0009.htm_para3"><a name="09071325000497">No one, least of all myself, has a difficulty with the idea that those who make donations to political parties, like those who participate more widely, should have a clear and practical connection with our democracy, not just a technical one. The issue is not one of sentiment but about the matters to which my noble Friend referred in the other place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o110"><a name="90713-0009.htm_para4"><a name="09071325000498">As my right hon. Friend the Minister of State said a short while ago, we in this House have to take account of sentiment here, among all parties and on the Back Benches as well as the Front Benches, as well as sentiment in the other place. That does not mean that we simply accept every amendment that is moved, but two things  <br>

were striking when the matter came before the other place. One was the extent of the alliance that led to the amendments tabled by Lord Campbell-Savours going through, and the other was the difficulty that both the Conservative and Labour Front-Bench teams, if I may say so, found in encouraging otherwise loyal party supporters into the Lobby.</p>

However, in producing our amendments we had to acknowledge that although Lord Campbell-Savours did his best with his amendments, which are found in Lords amendments 11 and 12 and in clause 9 of the Bill as it came out of the other place, they were completely technically unworkable and complicated. I think that Lord Campbell-Savours and his supporters in this place accept that.</p>

Government concerns about the practicalities and enforceability of Lords amendments 11 and 12, does the Secretary of State share the public concern, as well as that in the House, about the need to restrict the definition of "permissible donors", and to exclude people from abroad who do not participate properly and fully in our tax system? We could thus exclude people such as Lord Ashcroft, who has bankrolled the Conservative party for many years. That abuse of the electoral system must be stopped, and stopped quickly.</p>

 I understand the hon. Gentleman's argument. Part of what concerned Lord Bach, other colleagues and me was ensuring some consistency between the regime for donations and that for more general participation in our system. As I said, the Government have decided that it is possible to accept the burden of the amendments, and I now want, if I may, to get some important points on the record, not least to take account of the point that the right hon. Member for Horsham made about the short time for tabling amendments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o112"><a name="90713-0009.htm_para6"><a name="09071325000506">Lords amendments 11 and 12 refer to residence for the purposes of the Income Tax Act 2007, but residence is not appropriately or meaningfully defined. Part 14 simply sets out residence in certain specific cases. The amendments fail correctly to refer to the place where an individual is not domiciled. That risks casting unnecessary doubt on the way in which the provisions are supposed to work. The Government have therefore tabled amendments (a) to (f) in lieu of amendments 11 and 12. However, let me state from the outset that the amendments do not fully deal with the problems these the defects of the amendments in their current form cause. Should amendments (a) to (f) be agreed by the House today, the Government will table, when the Bill returns to another place, such further amendments as they consider necessary to put a fair and workable scheme in place. I am happy to make the drafts of those amendments available to members of other parties. I do not ask them to endorse them, but if they find it helpful to see them, it is our responsibility to provide them, and I happy to do that. I recognise the frustration about the time available.</p>

Under the system that that Act introduced, political parties are not permitted to accept what are called "impermissible" donations of above £200, although the Bill raises that threshold to £500. When a party receives a donation above the threshold, it must take "all reasonable steps" to verify that it has been received from a permissible source. If it receives a donation from an impermissible source, it is required to return it in 30 days. It is an offence not to do so. The party must also report receipt of any impermissible donation to the Electoral Commission. Additionally, if   <br>

<p><a name="stpa_o115"><a name="90713-0010.htm_para1"><a name="09071325000510">Amendment (a) would add to the existing requirement for an individual to be registered on an electoral register by requiring that a registered party may not accept a donation from an individual unless that person is resident, ordinarily resident and domiciled in the United Kingdom in the previous year. Colleagues will know that an individual's tax status-particularly their residence status-can change from year to year. It is therefore almost impossible to establish somebody's tax status, and particularly residence status, in the middle of a tax year. For that reason, we have alighted on the previous year, although we are open to arguments about whether that approach is correct.</p>

 I will draw this exchange to a close, but just say that it illustrates that the hon. Member for Perth and North Perthshire (Pete Wishart) does not even concede the idea of a Union. He simply wants Scotland to be a foreign country. That is his business, but it is not where the majority of the Scots are on that matter, and it is certainly not where the majority of those who live in the United Kingdom are.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o116"><a name="90713-0010.htm_para2"><a name="09071325000523">On residence, we looked closely at whether the wording, which seeks to right the technical defects in Lords amendments 11 and 12, provides the right results. We would want to be sure in finalising the drafting of the relevant clauses that the overall approach was proportionate-a point that I was trying to reflect in my answer to the hon. and learned Member for Torridge and West Devon (Mr. Cox). Domicile is a common-law concept. Our understanding is that large numbers of people may be non-domiciled in those terms, but still pay full UK income tax. If Lords amendments 11 and 12 were aimed not at such a category, but more at those who seek to restrict their tax liabilities through their residence or domicile status, we would need to think about whether amendment (a) should be revised with that aim in mind. We will certainly listen carefully to the debate today. Given that a person's right to freedom of association, as enshrined in article 11, is in play, we should not be complacent about the potential ECHR implications of any proposals in this area.</p>

The result would be that the restriction would target only those who donate significant sums of money-that is, amounts that require that the fact of the donation be made public. Anyone wanting to make a smaller contribution would not be subject to the new requirement, with the result that the proposal would not operate as an absolute bar on a potentially large category of donor. Also,  <br>

setting the permissibility threshold in relation to taxation status only at the level of the amount at which donations must be reported to the Electoral Commission would plainly be much easier for political parties to operate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o118"><a name="90713-0010.htm_para4"><a name="09071325000525">There is a consensus on that, and long may it continue. We have sought throughout to ensure that the changes made to the Bill take account of the impact that the regime for party funding has on the volunteers who staff our parties. Our very good officials and the Electoral Commission sometimes forget this, but as I have told them, our political parties are not staffed by career civil servants, but by volunteers. They are not paid and they do not get expenses; they do what they do because they believe in it. We need to honour them and respect that.</p>

 I wonder whether the Secretary of State has considered not only article 11, which he mentioned, but article 10, which guarantees freedom of political expression.

 Typically, those sums are aggregated over a year. If I am wrong, I will let the hon. Gentleman and the House know, but the limits cannot easily be evaded, so that if the limit is £7,500, it is £7,500 given by one donor in any one year to a party.</p>

They simply need to check that the person in question is registered to vote or, in the case of a company, to check that it is registered in this country. Even in that context, there was a complaint against my party and, therefore, indirectly against me, although the Electoral Commission did not find that we had acted dishonestly or dishonourably in any way.

They need to check whether someone is on the electoral register. Having established someone's identity, it is relatively straightforward to check whether they are on the electoral register or the name of the company. People's tax records, however, are confidential to Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs. Moreover, I recall that the Revenue holds tax records for only 9 million people, out of an adult population of about 40 million. It does not keep the other people's records. Why should it? Only about 9 million people complete an income tax return. The rest pay their taxes through the pay-as-you-earn system. There are overwhelming objections to providing access to the Revenue's database, but even if there were none, that database would not reveal whether someone was resident, ordinarily resident and domiciled in this country.</p>

We have made a lot of progress on this, but we need to make a little more. My right hon. Friend the Minister of State made the point to the House-and, indirectly, to the right hon.

We feel that it could be unreasonable to impose requirements that are so difficult to meet, particularly when the consequences are so draconian. It may be an infringement of an individual's right to freedom of expression; it is most likely to be contrary to European law; it would contribute to the isolation of UK citizens living abroad; it is contrary to regulatory principles; and it links political rights to taxation. Furthermore, it does not correctly address a mischief that the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000 aimed to address-namely, a clarification of the rules on party donations.</p>

The permissible-donor provisions would impose a three-prong test, which all political parties would have to perform before accepting any political donation. The first test-whether the donor is on the electoral register-was introduced precisely because it was straightforward and easy to implement and to check.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o137"><a name="90713-0011.htm_para8"><a name="09071325000567">When the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act was enacted, Parliament chose to use a formulation that would have included, in the category of permissible donors, individuals who were eligible to be on the electoral register-recognising the difficulties that any other formula would create.

<p><a name="stpa_o139"><a name="90713-0011.htm_para10"><a name="09071325000569">There is no statutory definition of "residence". The tests for residence are based on a mixture of legislative interpretation and case law. In addition, Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs has published guidance in HMRC 6 that outlines its view and interpretation of the legislation and case law, which is intended to help people to determine their residence status. There is no register of UK-resident individuals. It would therefore be necessary to provide individuals with information in an attempt to enable them to determine whether they are resident in the UK, and then to require them to make a declaration that they are resident at the time they make a donation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o140"><a name="90713-0011.htm_para11"><a name="09071325000570">The Secretary of State quite properly mentioned the problems that treasurers would have in verifying residency details. In some circumstances, it may not be possible to establish with certainty whether a person is UK-resident on the date when he or she makes a donation. It is conceivable, albeit unlikely, that people could make a donation to a political party at a time when they believed themselves to be resident in the UK, but it could be determined at a later date that they were not. Such a situation might arise as a result of one of the different tests for determining a person's residence that are summarised in HMRC guidance, which may combine an individual's intention with average-day counting over a four-year period to determine whether the individual is UK-resident.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o141"><a name="90713-0011.htm_para12"><a name="09071325000571">Let me give an example. Those who spend 183 days or more in the UK in a tax year will always be treated as UK-resident. However, those who spend less than 183 days in the UK in a tax year but come to the UK with the intention of spending, on average, at least 91 days, and then spend an average of 91 days or more per tax year over a four-year period, will be treated as being UK-resident from the tax year in which they first came to the UK. If their intention fails and they leave the UK earlier than expected, they may not be treated as UK-resident from the date on which they first came to the UK. It would clearly be impossible to determine with certainty until the end of the four-year period whether a person should be treated as UK-resident according to that test, and that may affect the validity of a donation made to a political party during the period.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o142"><a name="90713-0011.htm_para13"><a name="09071325000572">Another question that might arise is whether there would be any tracing rules that would prevent non-domiciled or non-UK resident husbands or wives, for example, from giving their UK-resident and domiciled spouses money to donate to a political party. Has the Minister considered that issue?</p>

 I am finding it difficult to envisage the practical circumstances in which the hon. Gentleman's example would apply. It seems to me that people making a claim to the tax authorities would know what they had claimed to be their resident or non-resident status. I cannot imagine circumstances in which someone would say to the tax authorities "Yes, I am resident" and then, strangely, turned out to be non-resident. I cannot see what tax advantage there could be for the taxpayer in such circumstances.</p>

 If, after what I have said, the hon.

<p><a name="stpa_o143"><a name="90713-0011.htm_para14"><a name="09071325000575">The third prong of the test in the permissible donor provisions is domicile, a notoriously slippery concept to anyone who has had to deal with or advise on it. Political parties will have to determine, in relation to every political donation, whether a person is a non-domiciled UK resident. HMRC recently issued new technical guidance on domicile, consisting of 42 pages. The introduction stresses the difficulties inherent in the determination of domicile. HMRC states:</p>
<a name="90713-0011.htm_brev1"><a name="09071325000636"><ul><p class="tabletext">"It is vital to remember that domicile is primarily a matter of common law. The decisions of the courts in the UK and other jurisdictions provide a set of guiding principles, but each case will depend on its own facts".</p>

<a name="90713-0011.htm_brev2"><a name="09071325000637"><ul><p class="tabletext">"As domicile depends on the facts of an individual's life, each case is unique."</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o145"><a name="90713-0011.htm_para16"><a name="09071325000577">Many people will never have had cause to consider the question of where they are domiciled. In general, the only people who will have had cause to consider it will be those who are resident in the UK and who have substantial foreign income or gains in respect of which they would like to claim the remittance basis of taxation, or those who have been involved with certain family law issues that may require their domicile to be considered. Such persons are likely to be confined to a relatively small proportion of the total number of individuals who have come from abroad and settled in the UK. It is therefore likely that not only would the vast majority of people never have considered the question of where they might be domiciled, but they would not be familiar with the test for determining domicile. As there is no register of UK-domiciled persons, the political party in receipt of a donation would probably need to ask the donor to make some form of declaration that he or she was so domiciled.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o146"><a name="90713-0011.htm_para17"><a name="09071325000578">Domicile is a general law concept, and is therefore not defined in statute. Given that many people are likely to be unfamiliar with the general law concept, it would be necessary to provide some form of guidance on what domicile means, and how people could determine where they were domiciled in order to make the relevant declaration. It is clear from the guidance notes published by HMRC that it is not necessarily straightforward to determine domicile in all cases, and it is arguably unreasonable to require political parties to make the complex and intrusive inquiries that they would have to make to ascertain whether a donor was non-domiciled.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o147"><a name="90713-0011.htm_para18"><a name="09071325000579">Let me explain the tax issues in slightly more detail. It is not absolutely clear what would be meant by income tax liabilities to be determined on the basis that the individual was domiciled. That applies more to the Government's latest amendments. Under current rules, an individual's income tax liabilities are affected by domicile only if the individual elects for the remittance basis of taxation. The election can only be made by non-domiciliaries, but can be made on a year-by-year basis.

 I have been listening attentively to the hon. Gentleman's speech for nearly a quarter of an hour. He has been saying, basically, that it is all very difficult. Does he agree in principle that it is undesirable for British politics to be financed from abroad?</p>

The only residual concern, if the restriction relates to an actual claim to the remittance basis, is that the claim does not need to be made until the individual files his tax return. That may not be until 31 January, following the end of the tax year which is 10 months through the donation year. The exception will be that many individuals will not take the decision until close to the filing date because they will need to calculate whether the election is to their advantage. They may not have the financial information to enable them to do that until some way through the year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o149"><a name="90713-0011.htm_para20"><a name="09071325000583">There is, therefore, a clear possibility that an individual might make a donation in the expectation that they would not be claiming on the remittance basis, but at a later date decide to make a claim. Would a donation in that context have to be repaid? Would someone commit an offence in making a declaration that they expected to be true at the time it was made? Once they had made a donation, would they be prohibited from claiming on the remittance basis? If a declaration that is given in good faith is wrong or turns out to be incorrect, is the effect still that the party will have received a donation from an impermissible donor and the donation will therefore be subject to forfeiture?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o150"><a name="90713-0011.htm_para21"><a name="09071325000584">The party, however, will not be guilty of an offence even if the declaration was made in bad faith if it can show that reasonable steps were taken to verify that the donation was permissible and that the treasurer believed that the donation was permissible, assuming the defence in the Bill is passed. What is considered to be reasonable is likely to depend on the circumstances of the donation and the individual donor. For example, are there factors that might suggest residence outside the UK?

The prohibition on the acceptance of impermissible donations and the duty to return any such donations within 30 days of receipt are subject to criminal and civil enforcement regimes.

<i> v.</i> the United Kingdom of 1998 showed that the European Court of Human Rights would step in to protect the right to freedom of expression even in the case of UK primary legislation designed to regulate the conduct of elections. In that case, it was found that the spending limit on third parties, which was £5 at that time, imposed by section 75 of the Representation of the People Act 1983 was an infringement of the right to freedom of expression under article 10 of the European convention on human rights.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o158"><a name="90713-0012.htm_para3"><a name="09071325000602">As that right is a qualified right, the Court went on to look at whether the spending restriction was prescribed by law, pursued a legitimate aim, and was necessary in a democratic society. In considering the latter condition, the Court looked at whether the means employed were necessary and proportionate to the aim pursued. It found that the limit was not necessary or proportionate, and the UK Government subsequently amended the legislation to raise the limit.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o159"><a name="90713-0012.htm_para4"><a name="09071325000603">It is generally established that the right to give a political donation is part of the right to freedom of expression. Clearly the amendment would be a restriction on that right. A court would therefore have to look at whether the restriction was necessary and proportionate to the aim pursued. We cannot pass legislation that restricts an individual's freedom of expression, particularly when we have not been provided with any evidence on whether such a restriction would be necessary and, importantly, proportionate to the aim pursued.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o160"><a name="90713-0012.htm_para5"><a name="09071325000604">We must also consider the EU law implications of the amendment. According to article 18 of the Maastricht treaty, citizens have a right to move and reside freely within the territory of any of the member states, subject to the limitations and conditions contained in the EU treaty and secondary legislation. The European Court of Justice has defined Union citizenship as the "fundamental status" of Union citizens. Union citizens have a conditional right of residence, and a limited right to equal treatment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o161"><a name="90713-0012.htm_para6"><a name="09071325000605">Article 19 of the treaty provides that Union citizens residing in a member state different from that of nationality have the right to vote, and to stand, in the local elections of the state where he or she is residing, under the same conditions as nationals of that state.

The "mischief" at which section 54 of the 2000 Act is aimed, is that of "foreign donations". There appeared, at the time the legislation was passed, to be particular concern about donations from foreign Governments and donations from individuals and persons who had no direct relationship or involvement with the United Kingdom.</p>

Will the Minister now update the impact assessment before this returns to the other place? I hope that the answer to that is yes. The provision is also disproportionate to the aim of the original legislation, which is to impose restrictions on "foreign donations". Individuals who are on the electoral register have a connection with the United Kingdom, and therefore should not fall within the category of impermissible donors.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o172"><a name="90713-0012.htm_para17"><a name="09071325000618">The Electoral Commission has stated that if these permissible donor provisions are agreed in their current unamended form, those whom it regulates will be unable to comply with the resulting law, which is therefore unlikely to be enforceable in practice. The Electoral Commission is particularly concerned that the Bill does not provide donation recipients with a right to obtain reliable information-for example, from HM Revenue and Customs-about the donor's tax status. Whether its concerns have been addressed by the Government amendments is something that we will wish to consider carefully before this Bill returns to the Lords.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o173"><a name="90713-0012.htm_para18"><a name="09071325000619">In the current climate of voter apathy, dwindling party membership, and an increasing disinclination to participate in the political process, is this the right message to send to those UK citizens living abroad who may be affected by the amendment? We should be encouraging people to get involved with democracy and not provide barriers to getting involved in the political process. The reality of modern life is that many people do need to live and work abroad. Are we really saying, in this age of globalisation, that some of our most industrious people-those who get out around the world and promote our country in foreign lands-should be rewarded by having their political tights removed in such a way?</p>

Taking that aim to be to prohibit foreign donors, it is arguable that the existing law already achieves that purpose by limiting donors to those on the electoral register. Since a connection with the UK is necessary in order to be on the electoral register, the amendment is therefore not necessary. However, if the aim, as intimated in debate in the other place on 30 April, is to attack the tax status of certain specific donors or to prevent undue influence on parties from large donors, it is arguable that both of those aims are better pursued through other measures, and that this particular measure is not proportionate in those contexts.</p>

fairly relaxed-that mean that the rule applies only when the sum of £7,500 is involved. That is a very large donation, in my view. I do not think that there can be any question about whether there is a violation of rights to participate in associations-an article 11 argument-because there should not be any fundamental right to participate in organisations that it costs more than £7,500 to join.</p>

 No, in fact, I said the opposite.

I am not denying that people who go abroad have the right to vote, but I am saying that those who go abroad and then seek to change their tax status to reduce their liability distance themselves from monetary aspects of the political system of this country in a way that should lead to a restriction on their right to influence others through money.</p>

 I fear going along the lines that the right hon. Gentleman wants me to, but the answer is yes. A fundamental problem in the politics of this country is that foreign-owned media groups are so influential. However, that is not the issue before the House at the moment.</p>

His argument was that there is no legitimate purpose in the restriction. If that were right, it would be equivalent to the £5 limit on third party activity in the Bowman case. I disagree with him, however. There is a legitimate purpose. It is the purpose that was put forward in the Bowman case, which is the need to protect the equality of arms between different candidates-in other words, as the Secretary of State said, to keep big money out of politics. That is a legitimate aim and the European Court of Human Rights recognises it as a legitimate aim. The Court said that the provisions in the Bowman case went beyond that and amounted to a bar on any expression by Mrs. Bowman at all. That cannot possibly be the case with this proposal, because, first, it applies only to donations and, secondly, it applies only to donations of more than £7,500.</p>

 I have enormous respect for the hon. Gentleman, who is a thoughtful contributor to such debates, but I find his distinction "convenient", if I can put it like that. The truth of the matter is that his argument would have more intellectual respectability if he were arguing for a cap on all donations. It is inconsistent and irrational, however, to single out a single class who are entitled under the law to vote, who are British citizens and who have a powerful connection with this country and to deny them the right to donate while allowing it to the hon.

<p><a name="stpa_o181"><a name="90713-0013.htm_para0"><a name="09071340000012">There are, however, some problems with the Bill as drafted. I am glad that the Secretary of State said that the proposals would be considered further before they finally pass. The point about the student that the hon. Member for Ribble Valley (Mr. Evans) mentioned in his first contribution does not work. The Secretary of State did not reply to it, but my understanding of existing law-he might correct me if I am wrong-is that volunteering in someone's own free time does not count as a donation. That point is also important in answering the issues raised by the hon. and learned Member for Torridge and West Devon. This is not a restriction on political activity across the board; it is merely a restriction on donating money.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman suggests that this is a merely a restriction on donating. This is a matter of freedom; this is a matter of the free expression and the full implementation of expression of one's political opinions. If I have worked hard by getting donations down the street or however I have acquired my money, I should be entitled to put it behind my political opinions.</p>

 The hon. and learned Gentleman is right to make that point, but it is one with which I fundamentally disagree. This really is the heart of the matter, and I am glad that we have reached it. The view that money equals freedom in all circumstances is one that, as far as I can tell, only the US Supreme Court takes. I have great respect for the US Supreme Court, but very few other political systems take that view to that extremity.</p>

If one is to balance the two, one can conclude that the provisions are justified. Moreover, one must take the view that, to balance the two, one must be in favour of a cap on donations of any sort at all. The hon. and learned Gentleman seems to be arguing against any sort of donation cap under any circumstances; otherwise donors might be told that they cannot express themselves any more by making a donation above £50,000, £10,000 or £7,500. There must be a limit.</p>

 As the hon. Gentleman seeks to characterise my argument, let me say at once that I might well support of a general cap on donations, but it would have to be done fairly and consistently, and the problem with the measure is that it is not fair and consistent. It may well be said that a proportionate limit on all donations allows for the freedom that I have described, while making allowance for the points that he makes,   <br>

<p><a name="stpa_o183"><a name="90713-0013.htm_para2"><a name="09071340000022">Let me conclude by pointing out a couple of difficulties in the present draft of the Bill. First, it is not clear whether the legislation would be easily evaded simply by using companies as a conduit for donations. There appears to be an inconsistency between two parts of the way in which the provisions work. They start simply by talking about whether individuals satisfy particular tax status rules, but the declaration part of the provisions talks about whether that individual has caused a donation to be made. That seems to be different. Whether an individual is a permissible donor based on their tax status is one question; whether the person has caused a donation to be made is a second question. One can cause a donation to be made without being a donor oneself: one can use a company as a conduit or agent. The Government have got things half right. In the declaration provisions, they are getting there-it is about causing donations-but they need to think about whether the provisions themselves, not just the declarations provisions, should cover people causing donations to be made. In fact, in previous debates on this matter, we proposed, without any vote being called, provisions that would, in effect, equate the individuals who control companies with those companies. That would have the effect of changing the entire position.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o184"><a name="90713-0013.htm_para3"><a name="09071340000023">Let me end by talking about consensus. Throughout the debates on the Bill, for almost a year, the Government have said that it is not possible to make any further progress with the Hayden Phillips proposals, with the cap on donations that would apply to everyone, with global spending restrictions and with a fair resolution of the relationship between the Labour party and the unions, because there was no consensus.

Conservative party had a veto on any progress on those matters. We now reach this late stage on the Bill and-the hon. Member for Huntingdon must be right about this, because he makes it so, by the very fact that he objects-the Government have broken that consensus. I very much regret that the Government have wasted the opportunity, throughout the rest of the debates on the Bill, to break the consensus in a far more general way and, to take one of the points made by the hon. and learned Member for Torridge and West Devon, to produce a comprehensive settlement of the party funding issue in a way that would have satisfied the public, even though it might not have satisfied the parties.</p>

 To suggest that the reason that we did not make progress on the Hayden Phillips proposals was simply that the two main parties did not agree is to parody what happened. The simple fact is that, among many other objections to implementing the Hayden Phillips proposals, is an overwhelming one that illustrates that there is no consensus with the public and that the Liberal Democrats refuse to acknowledge but is correct: the Hayden Phillips proposals are predicated on a high level of state funding. I do not believe that there is a consensus for tens of millions of pounds of additional public money to be used to support the political parties at the moment. That is the fundamental problem.</p>

These multimillionaires, some of whom have written books about their tactics, live in their tax havens and influence our politics by bankrolling political parties and buying elections, and their actions pollute our democracy. It is scandalous that Conservative Members, with their lawyerly language, tell us that there are higher considerations that we must take into account. There are no higher considerations.</p>

Why does the Appointments Commission do that? It was because Lord Laidlaw, a former vice-chairman of the Conservative party and a self-confessed tax exile living in Monaco, told the commission prior to his elevation in 2004 that he would bring his tax affairs onshore, and then he refused-he reneged on that promise. But he still gave £3 million to the Conservative party and over £100,000 to a candidate for the mayoral elections in London. The Conservative party did not consider that to be tainted money and handed it back; no, it held on to those millions from Lord Laidlaw.

Multimillionaires and others who want to give a lot of money to political parties will have to sign a declaration that they are a permissible donor, which will include a reference to their tax status. It will be a criminal offence for them knowingly to give an inaccurate or false declaration, and I say three cheers for that. If they knowingly mislead the wider public, the political party and, indeed, Parliament, they can be sent to jail. These declarations are not new. When we stood, all of us, for election to the House of Commons we had to sign a declaration, which went to the returning officer, saying that to the best of our knowledge we were not disqualified from sitting in this place because, for example, we were a peer or had a criminal record.

to do. We heard from the Member for Huntingdon that the proposal is contrary to European law; well, let that be tested in the courts. We are absolutely doing the right thing. I shall vote for the Government tonight, and I urge all my friends to join me in the Lobby to make sure that the provision gets on to the statute book.</p>

 We heard the authentic voice of Labour in that speech from the hon. Member for Pendle (Mr. Prentice), who has insulted the British electorate in a big way. I do not believe that it is possible to buy an election in the way that he suggests. No matter how many millions the Conservative party might have spent in 1997 if the rules had been different, we would have lost. No matter how much money Labour spent in the European elections this year, they would have lost. The British public are quite able to discern what they want and who they want, and they are not driven by the biggest-spending party on any given occasion.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o196"><a name="90713-0013.htm_para15"><a name="09071340000052">The hurried and perhaps botched amendments that we are considering worry me for both general and specific reasons. I think that they are botched because, as the Justice Secretary kindly admitted, he will have to return to them in the other place, as he knows that they do not deal with all the matters that are coming out in this rather short debate, and that will come out as further consideration is given to the Bill. That shows the danger of legislating in such haste, after quite a long period in which proper consideration could have been given, both in the Chamber and in more general consultation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o197"><a name="90713-0013.htm_para16"><a name="09071340000053">My general concern about the new proposals is that they are part of a drift to ensnare our politics in so much legalese and complexity that it puts off many amateurs who would otherwise be involved and be able to participate. I referred in an intervention to the plight of a party treasurer of whatever party. It is difficult enough to conform with the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000. We have seen all parties get into difficulties-inadvertently, I am sure. I am sure that they are trying to comply. Even that legislation has proved quite demanding and quite complicated, but as we have heard from Front Benchers of both main parties, it has the merit that all that the treasurer or other responsible official has to do is prove that the individual is registered to vote in this country and is on the electoral roll. There is a roll to which they can refer, and which is reasonably accessible, to establish that they have had due diligence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o198"><a name="90713-0013.htm_para17"><a name="09071340000054">The proposals before us involve considerably more complication, in that three separate tests would be applied, and then a person would have to try to ascertain whether all the forms had been accurately filled in. I understand that there is to be self-certification by the individual seeking to make the donation, and that is where the burden will lie. As my hon. Friend the Member for Huntingdon (Mr. Djanogly) explained, that individual could genuinely be unsure, or they might make a perfectly accurate declaration, but the facts and circumstances might change subsequently. Given the speed with which events can occur during an election campaign, it would be quite possible to imagine members of different parties making mistakes. There would be a long legal process afterwards to try to sort it all out.</p>

First, it means that politics becomes about the process of politics, and it means that individuals and parties hurl allegations at each other in a way that can only damage the general reputation of politics and drag all parties further downwards. If, under clause 8, one party finds something wrong with somebody's declaration, the natural reaction of the other parties will be to find things wrong with the alternative party or parties, through the declarations. They would then throw allegations-perhaps fair, perhaps unfair. That will become part of a process of making politics about whether parties stick to the box-ticking letter of the law, rather than about the big issues that concern constituents and enliven political debate and general elections.</p>

As the Justice Secretary has rightly said, that would be exceedingly unpopular with voters of all dispositions at the moment. However, the more it is made difficult for individuals, companies and trade unions to put their money into political parties on a voluntary basis, the more the political parties will seek other ways of finding state funding-and at a time when the state does not have any money and is having to borrow it all. The public would think that that was extremely unreasonable.</p>

 I have rather more sympathy for that view. I have said that I favour a tighter cap on election spending, affecting all the major parties. It would be much easier to control any problems that parties may see in the current system through spending controls, rather than through donation controls. That would be easier to police. We know that it is quite possible to police a spending control because there is one in place at the moment; such a control applies to each one of us when we seek re-election, and applies at the national level to each major party. There have not been too many problems with those spending caps. That is a productive and sensible suggestion. I cannot see why we need also look at limiting categories of people who are allowed to donate.</p>

The whole thing is quite absurd if looked at from the outside. It makes sense only if one goes down the route taken by the hon.

to those people, whom all political parties have recognised, who live abroad and have resided in this country within the past 10 years-the period has been varied, but it is currently 10 years-and who are entitled to vote? They ought also to be entitled to give a political donation, if they wish.</p>

 That is exactly my view, and the view shared, I think, by most Conservative Members. I recommend it to the Government, because they will have supporters in a similar position-supporters who will feel cut out by the unwillingness of the legislation to allow them to participate fully in the way that other legally registered British voters can by virtue of residence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o203"><a name="90713-0014.htm_para4"><a name="09071340000063">It is a dangerous principle to say that someone has to pay tax in a country to participate in its politics. There are all sorts of people in our country who, for good reasons, do not pay tax. Full participation cannot be linked to taxpaying. It is rather divisive to say otherwise, and I find it surprising that that view is taken by the Labour party, which normally stands up for people without much money who do not pay tax for that reason. It is strange to apply the argument in one direction but not in the other, when it comes to the issue of taxation. The American democracy may well have been based originally on the principle of no taxation without representation, but we do not want the principle that there can be full participation only with taxation. That would be a very odd principle indeed in a society where some people do not pay tax for good reasons.</p>

We know that they will think again, because their Front Benchers have promised that other amendments will be necessary to try to make sense of the inadequate amendments before us. I repeat what was said in an earlier exchange: it is quite wrong that something so important and fundamental to our democracy-issues relating to the participation rights of a wide range of British people-should be handled in such a way, at the last minute, without proper time for consideration of the amendments, without a further attempt to create consensus across the Chamber, and without proper discussion of the final amendments, which needs to take place.</p>

However, it is possible to be registered as an overseas voter, for which I fought hard at the time. Although we should protect the right of UK citizens who live abroad to vote in UK elections for a limited period, it was never intended that that should act as a loophole for people who go abroad to escape tax liabilities to continue to enjoy the right to bankroll British elections.</p>

If they do not pay our taxes, why should they have any part in determining those taxes? The right hon. Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood) cited the American slogan, "No taxation without representation," and said that the reverse would be unfair-no representation without taxation. We are not arguing for no representation without taxation, but we are arguing that if people do not pay the taxes of the country, there is no reason why they should seek to invest millions of pounds in trying to win the election.

 I wonder whether the hon.

Friend the Member for Pendle mentioned, the House of Lords Appointments Commission recently announced that it will not accept any new peers who are not resident for tax purposes. That test, being resident for tax purposes, should have been in the 2000 Act. It is now being introduced by the House of Lords Appointments Commission.</p>

 Of course somebody who goes abroad temporarily to work should retain the right to vote if they wish to retain it. They will also have the right to donate up to £7,500 to an election campaign. I do not think that that is any great infringement of their democratic rights.

Friend the Member for Pendle, to table an amendment to the Finance Bill that was originally tabled in the House of Lords with support from Conservative and Liberal Democrat peers. It was the subject of consensual all-party agreement, and it would help to put back into the political system the money that is being taken out.

 I am not entirely aware of the sums. Lord Ashcroft is the demon in the minds of Labour Members, who sit there nursing their marginal seats, knowing that the electorate is coming for them. It is that knowledge that drives them on. In their fevered imagination, they see Lord Ashcroft, like some great grey figure hanging over them, sentencing their seat to lose to the Conservatives. To help slay Labour Members' demons, I should say that Lord Ashcroft's donations are far less than those of Lord Sainsbury. We hear about corruption from the Labour party, but a man who was serving as a Minister in the Government gave millions of pounds to them. What about the conflict of interest there?

Do I feel embarrassed or am I squirming about that? Quite the contrary: I am delighted that Lord Ashcroft, somebody of such public spiritedness who set up Crimestoppers and has been such a great philanthropist, also recognises the damage that this Government have done to this country. That is why I am so proud to have him as one of our many supporters.

<p><a name="stpa_o219"><a name="90713-0015.htm_para0"><a name="09071340000097">I perfectly well understand the hon. Gentleman's argument for a cap, but what is entirely factitious is the use of the qualification to pay tax in this country as a preventive bar to donating. That does not seem to be rationally connected. On the question of multiple millionaires, who are largely situated abroad because they exploit looser tax regimes elsewhere, why should we not just say, "They shouldn't be allowed to donate large sums of money, but, in the same way, nor should other people who are perhaps so rich that it doesn't matter to them how much tax they pay in this country"? I do not understand the rational connection between the measure under discussion and the qualification or non-qualification to pay tax in this country.</p>

 The rational connection is money: the prospective overseas donor has deliberately distanced him or herself from the obligation to pay full tax in this country and, possibly, uses that money, which they have saved in tax, to influence the political system in this country. That seems to me to be a rational connection. It does not go far enough for me, but it is sufficient for the measure before us.</p>

<p><a name="st_o310"><a name="09071340000099"><a name="90713-0015.htm_spnew1"><a name="09071340000287"><b>Mr. Cox:</b>
 I should understand that, were it a reason for preventing somebody from voting, but the argument is that a British citizen has a sufficiently substantive connection with what is going on in this country to be allowed to vote and to stand in an election, but not to donate. The suggestion that there is somehow a moral or rational justification for the measure, based on the fact that somebody does not pay taxes in this country, does not fulfil the requirement that the hon. Gentleman knows the European Court of Human Rights would impose-namely, a rational justification for the intrusion into the right. We need a legitimate objective. The measure has to be rationally connected with the objective and to be no more than is necessary to achieve it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o220"><a name="90713-0015.htm_para1"><a name="09071340000101">We know that large numbers of people who are not in the Labour party's bête noire category, but are relatively modestly affluent, will be prevented from donating. The Secretary of State for Justice proposes a limit of £7,500, but that is an arbitrary figure, plucked from nowhere. Why not £15,000 or £20,000? Why not £30,000? The figures that the Labour party objects to are in the millions, but relatively modestly affluent people who feel strongly may wish to donate £7,500, £10,000, £15,000, £20,000 or £30,000.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o221"><a name="90713-0015.htm_para2"><a name="09071340000102">Frankly, if we allow somebody to vote and stand in an election, and if they are a British citizen who feels strongly about the fate and destiny of their country, how can it conceivably be rational to prevent them from supporting their own campaigns or those of the party that they support? It simply makes no sense to me at all, and I am fortified in that opinion by the fact that the opinion of the Secretary of State for Justice is the same.</p>

 My hon. Friend will forgive me if I do not stray down that particular avenue. I am trying to engage with the hon. Member for Cambridge, who gave a thoughtful and impressive speech.

<p><a name="st_o313"><a name="09071340000105"><a name="90713-0015.htm_spnew4"><a name="09071340000290"><b>Mr. Redwood:</b>
 If the Government are worried about the issue, should they not say that nobody who wishes to be a Labour peer should give the Labour party any money? On the Government's theory, it would be wrong to give a peerage to anybody who had given money, would it not?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o222"><a name="90713-0015.htm_para3"><a name="09071340000107">I want to concentrate on whether the proposed measure would have an impact within the context of the Human Rights Act and article 10, which is about freedom of expression. Unlike the hon. Member for Cambridge, I think that that is a real issue. The European Court of Human Rights has plainly considered that the right to donate, to put your money where your mouth is, is encompassed within article 10. One therefore has to answer this question: why single out those who live and are taxed abroad if we are allowing them to vote? The hon. Gentleman has given the reason; he says that tax exiles do not pay taxes in this country and that-I think this a little fanciful-the money that they save could be deployed for the purposes of donation. It is therefore, he says, perfectly legitimate to require that such people should be part of the tax system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o223"><a name="90713-0015.htm_para4"><a name="09071340000108">I say with respect to the hon. Gentleman that placing so invasive a restriction on an individual on so flimsy and artificial a footing is not consistent with the principles that he upholds as a liberal. I sympathise with those principles because personal, individual freedom is a fundamental principle about which all in the House, from whatever political tradition, should be concerned; I know that there are Labour Members who feel as passionately about that as I do and the hon. Gentleman does. In considering what principle and the freedom of the individual require, we should not give credence to the convenient and expedient arguments articulated with great elegance and some sophistication by the hon. Gentleman.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o224"><a name="90713-0015.htm_para5"><a name="09071340000109">The hon. Gentleman's position would have been far more principled, and would have had more of the integrity that he ordinarily evinces in the House, if he had said that the measure looks like what it is. It is, regrettably, a capitulation by the Secretary of State to pressures with which he does not agree; he has adopted a measure in which he has no confidence. He has put it before the House for reasons that the rest of us can only guess at. The principled approach would be to do precisely what the hon. Member for Cambridge said the Secretary of State should have done, and I completely agree: if a measure such as this is to be moved, it should be moved as part of a comprehensive settlement and on the basis of principle, not partisanship.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o225"><a name="90713-0015.htm_para6"><a name="09071340000110">I have great respect for the Secretary of State for Justice, who is an urbane and civilised member of the Government and for whom one can only have considerable respect.

 With the leave of the House, Mr. Deputy Speaker, I should like to respond to the debate. It has been characterised by two distinct kinds of speeches. The hon. Members for Huntingdon (Mr. Djanogly) and for Cambridge (David Howarth) and many-but not all-contributors from my side have sought to address the issues in a relatively measured way. There have also been some hyperbolic and partisan performances.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o226"><a name="90713-0015.htm_para7"><a name="09071340000112">I am only too well aware that if we scratch the surface, the issue of party funding arouses great tribal feelings. Whenever two or three Labour Members gather together, it does not take long for a peer's name beginning with "A" to fall from their lips; equally, a particular kind of Conservative Member will foam at the mouth at the very mention of trade unions. I understand that, which is why my general view has always been that we have to recognise the tribal nature of the issue and the fact that people feel strongly about it, and in a partisan way. However, we should also do our best to secure as close a consensus as possible on the issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o227"><a name="90713-0015.htm_para8"><a name="09071340000113">We have a great interest in the fortunes of our own parties, but we are also the trustees of our democracy. The ground rules for that democracy are set here, and we have to hold back a bit in case we descend to the position arrived at in parts of the United States. In those areas, even the setting of boundaries is the subject of the most extraordinary partisanship; how the boundaries are set would make even Mr. Gerry Mander blush. In general, we avoid that here but it is important that we should.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o228"><a name="90713-0015.htm_para9"><a name="09071340000114">To underline a point made by the Minister of State, Ministry of Justice, my right hon. Friend the Member for North Swindon (Mr. Wills), Conservative Members' hyperbole about the issue sits rather oddly with their behaviour-or rather lack of it-in the other place. The simple fact is that 80 per cent., or four out of five, of the peers who take the Conservative Whip-there are just over 200 of them-failed to vote against Lord Campbell-Savours' amendment when it was before that House in the middle of June; they could muster only 40 Members altogether. That leads me to feel that some of the opposition to this measure, particularly given the amendments that we are now introducing, is, to a high degree, quite synthetic.</p>

Indeed, they are a considerable modification-because they have to be-of what Lord Campbell-Savours put forward.</p>

included Lord Jay of Ewelme, a former head of the diplomatic service; Baroness D'Souza, the chair of the Cross-Bench peers; and, in particular, Lord Neill of Bladen, who has a very distinguished academic and judicial record, and who chaired, very well, the Committee on Standards in Public Life and produced the whopping great report in 1998 that laid the foundation of the party funding Bill that I introduced in 1999-2000. He made a very strident speech in favour of these changes. Of course-I put this on the record in answer to the hon. and learned Member for Torridge and West Devon (Mr. Cox)-I acknowledge what is patently true: that my position, and that of the Government, has shifted. However, as my right hon. Friend the Minister and I have made clear, that is because we judged that we needed to take account of the change in sentiment highlighted not least by the debate in the other place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o231"><a name="90713-0015.htm_para12"><a name="09071340000117">It would probably be helpful if I answered one or two of the detailed points that have been made. It is continually amusing these days to see how the world has turned upside down somewhat as regards the European convention on human rights. I often notice that the convention and the Human Rights Act 1998 have become so much part of the common currency of British public life that Conservative Members cannot help themselves in praying in aid articles 8, 10 or 11 when it suits them, forgetting that their party has pledged to repeal the Human Rights Act and all its works, and probably to denounce the convention as well.</p>

 The Secretary of State, almost certainly for reasons of forensic and rhetorical flourish, is misrepresenting and mischaracterising the policy of the party to which I belong. As he knows very well, our policy is to replace the schedule to the Human Rights Act with a new Bill of Rights based on British rights, devised and drafted here. There is nothing wrong with that, and many eminent people from many parts of the political spectrum support it.</p>

 I look forward to seeing further particulars of that proposal, especially as the other bit of the Conservatives' policy is that they apparently remain committed to the convention. How the devil one is able to draft a new schedule that is consistent with the convention without its ending up being the same as the convention defies me.</p>

Member for Ribble Valley (Mr. Evans)-he is not here, but it is important that I correct the record-asked whether aggregate donations would breach the limit. Although I did not say so in terms, I said that I thought that the current law was that donations were aggregated. However, that is not the case. At the moment, there is no requirement to aggregate multiple donations in one year. We are considering whether such a provision would be needed, and that will require a great deal of consultation down the track-not for this Bill. In any case, there are some practical problems as regards aggregating donations. That is an existing issue that is not affected directly one way or the other by the provisions in this group of amendments. I hope that that is helpful. I also hope that my note is correct; otherwise, I will end up having to correct the record again.</p>

Until November 2008, it was intended that the Electoral Commission would fulfil that role, and the Electoral Administration Act 2006 made provision for that.

The CORE scheme could provide that service. Such a role does not currently fit with the Electoral Commission's redefined regulatory role, but it is important that the public body taking on the role is demonstrably independent from Government.

Taking a power to create that corporation sole in secondary legislation is designed to provide appropriate flexibility so that the precise detail of the structure and operation of the body, and the timing of its creation, can be developed consistently with the CORE scheme order.

In particular, it amends section 1(10) of the 2006 Act to provide expressly that a person designated as the CORE keeper under the CORE scheme order must be a corporation sole established under the new power, or some other public authority. That will preserve the ability of another public authority to take on the role of CORE keeper if that is considered appropriate in future.</p>

can be made, the Electoral Commission and the Information Commissioner must be consulted. Those requirements are designed to ensure that the order will be subject to a high degree of scrutiny. I hope that the hon. Member for Cambridge (David Howarth) is reassured by that. We have to retain flexibility, but the House will have ample opportunity to scrutinise any implementation of that flexibility.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o243"><a name="90713-0016.htm_para1"><a name="09071340000143">I turn to the other amendments. CORE will create a new national database of electoral data, and therefore different security arrangements may be required. CORE will not make any new information available, nor will it supply electoral data to anyone not entitled to them. As the data it will hold will be available from a single point rather than through individual electoral registration officers, it will be easier to access the national data set.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o244"><a name="90713-0016.htm_para2"><a name="09071340000144">The effect of provisions in the 2006 Act is that regulations governing access to, and supply of, the electoral register by electoral registration officers will also apply to the CORE keeper, subject to any modifications that the Secretary of State considers appropriate. That means that bodies currently entitled to receive copies of the electoral register and related information from electoral registration officers will be entitled to receive the same information from the CORE keeper, subject to the same restrictions on access and use. In the light of that, Lords amendment 34 supplements the Secretary of State's existing power to modify the application of the regulations by enabling additional or different protections to be imposed on the supply of material by the CORE keeper.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o245"><a name="90713-0016.htm_para3"><a name="09071340000145">Lords amendment 35 relates to section 3 of the Juries Act 1974, which requires electoral registration officers to supply copies of the register for the purpose of jury summoning. Once the CORE system is operational, it may be more efficient and convenient for the registers to be supplied on a national scale by the CORE keeper rather than by each individual electoral registration officer. Accordingly, the amendment creates a power to amend section 3 of the 1974 Act to provide for that, but it will not allow anyone who is not already entitled to access the register from electoral registration officers to do so from the CORE keeper.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o246"><a name="90713-0016.htm_para4"><a name="09071340000146">Lords amendment 36 extends the Secretary of State's existing powers in relation to the CORE scheme order, so that it can authorise information sharing between the CORE keeper and the Electoral Commission. As I have detailed, the original intention was for the commission to be the CORE keeper. Now given that is not to be the case, however, it is important that the CORE keeper is able to furnish the commission with information that is relevant to its functions. It is envisaged that that power will enable the CORE keeper to provide the Electoral Commission with information on what checks have been made by political parties-for example, whether a particular person's entry was checked before a donation or loan was accepted from that person. CORE will also provide statistical information to support electoral registration officer performance standards, such as registration changes year on year. The power may also be used to enable the CORE keeper to inform the commission if an electoral registration officer has failed to report back to the CORE keeper on steps taken to investigate potential instances of fraud or other improprieties, as may be required in the CORE scheme order.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o247"><a name="90713-0016.htm_para5"><a name="09071340000147">I turn to Lords amendments 37 to 50, 96 to 98, 105 and 106, on individual registration. On 2 March, this House spent a considerable period discussing some of the general principles of that most important subject. In these amendments, the Government have set out their approach to the implementation of individual registration in Great Britain. It is an historic shift with a carefully phased timetable, designed to bolster and support both the accuracy and comprehensiveness of the electoral register. I believe that in our previous discussions, there has been agreement throughout the House about how important both those principles are.</p>

<p><a name="st_o330"><a name="09071340000148"><a name="90713-0016.htm_spnew0"><a name="09071340000307"><b>Mrs. Eleanor Laing (Epping Forest) (Con):</b>
 I intervene merely to reassure the Minister that we have agreement on those matters.</p>

<p><a name="st_o331"><a name="09071340000149"><a name="90713-0016.htm_spnew1"><a name="09071340000308"><b>Mr. Wills:</b>
 I am very grateful to the hon. Lady, and I look forward to her support for the amendments as a result.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o248"><a name="90713-0016.htm_para6"><a name="09071340000150">It is important that we take a phased approach, alongside extensive work to increase registration rates. That will enable us to uphold the integrity of our electoral registration processes as we prepare both the public and the system for this fundamental and historic change. It is vital that we put integrity at the heart of everything we do. Electoral registration is the gateway to democratic participation and without effective registration processes, individuals are denied the right to participate and democracy is undermined.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o249"><a name="90713-0016.htm_para7"><a name="09071340000151">We all know that the system is not perfect in that respect. On the best estimates, about 3 million or 3.5 million people are eligible to vote but are not on the register, and are therefore denied the right to exercise their vote. That damages our democracy, and we can be satisfied only when every eligible person is on the register. We need to do more to ensure that that is the case and that the historic shift to individual registration does not further damage the integrity of the register in that respect. I will say a little more about how we intend to do that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o250"><a name="90713-0016.htm_para8"><a name="09071340000152">Before I discuss in more detail the amendments that were tabled in another place, I would like briefly to talk about the benefits that individual registration will offer. The first is enhanced integrity. All the evidence shows that electoral fraud is not considered a major problem in this country, but there is never room for complacency about fraud. We have taken steps to reduce the risk of fraud under the Electoral Administration Act 2006-for example, by introducing a new offence of providing false information to an electoral registration officer when registering to vote. However, any amount of fraud is unacceptable, and the perception of fraud is equally dangerous. It undermines confidence in our democracy and the perceived legitimacy of our democratic processes. We must take steps to ensure that the registration system is as robust as possible in enabling us to detect and prevent electoral fraud.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o251"><a name="90713-0016.htm_para9"><a name="09071340000153">For that reason, a system of individual registration offers added security because it requires electors to provide identifying information to register to vote. It enables the system to verify entries against a third-party database and makes it more difficult to fabricate registration. Individual registration is an important step towards strengthening the integrity-and the perception of the integrity-of the electoral process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o252"><a name="90713-0016.htm_para10"><a name="09071340000154">Furthermore, individual registration has the potential to strengthen all citizens' engagement in the democratic process by giving them responsibility for their registration. It replaces an outdated household registration system, whereby one member of the household takes responsibility for registering all the others. That is antiquated and belongs to a different system of suffrage. We need a system that better reflects people's circumstances today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o253"><a name="90713-0016.htm_para11"><a name="09071340000155">Introducing individual registration is the most significant change in electoral administration for many years. It is the right thing to do, and it will bolster the security and accuracy of our registration. However, it will make registering to vote more complex for individuals, who will be required to provide additional identifying information to register to vote. We must recognise that some people will experience considerable difficulty in doing that. For example, we know that one in five adults are functionally illiterate. The Government are addressing that vigorously, but it is none the less a fact of which we must take account when we consider how to move to the new system of electoral registration.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o254"><a name="90713-0016.htm_para12"><a name="09071340000156">We have given careful consideration to the potential impact of the new requirement on the comprehensiveness of the register. The phased approach that we propose is designed to enable us to secure the benefits of enhanced accuracy and security, without damaging the comprehensiveness of the register.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o255"><a name="90713-0016.htm_para13"><a name="09071340000157">What will the amendments do? Our approach to individual registration is to move in two phases: a voluntary phase and a compulsory phase. During the voluntary phase, it will be compulsory for electoral registration officers to ask individuals to provide the relevant identifying information-national insurance number, date of birth and signature-but individuals will not be required to do that to be on the register.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o256"><a name="90713-0016.htm_para14"><a name="09071340000158">The voluntary phase will prepare the public for the changes ahead, in particular the new requirement to provide identifying information for the purposes of registration. It will allow electoral administrators to develop the processes and systems for collecting and storing the identifying information. During the voluntary phase, the Electoral Commission will be asked to draft annual progress reports on how the voluntary system is working; the overall health of the registration system, and whether any changes would be needed, were the collection of identifying information to be taken forward on a compulsory basis. That will provide us with invaluable information for our understanding of the effectiveness of the registration system and its readiness for the shift to individual registration.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o257"><a name="90713-0016.htm_para15"><a name="09071340000159">The voluntary phase will not commence before July 2010-in other words, it will not become entangled with the next general election, whenever that may be-and will not finish before 2014. That period will enable us to be fully confident that the system is ready before we move to the compulsory phase, when it will be obligatory for individuals to provide identifying information to electoral registration officers to be included on the register. It will enable us to prepare the public for the change, and to take steps to bolster registration rates in the meantime. That will be fundamental to protecting the system against the risk of a drop in the numbers registered.</p>

 It would be a rash politician who ever said "never", but when the hon. Lady has heard the rest of my remarks, I think she will agree that rushing the matter in the way she suggests would be unwise and risk tarnishing our whole electoral system. I will go through the details shortly, but I ask her to bear it in mind that we already have 3 million people who are eligible to vote but are not on the register. That represents a huge challenge to registration, which we must tackle. Some measures are already in train-we are doing everything we can to tackle the problem, and then move to a system of individual registration. As she will hear, that will create genuine problems and challenges to the registration system over and above the existing ones. To rush the matter and take the risk of even more people falling off the register as a result of undue haste would be unwise and damage the integrity, and the perception of the integrity, of the entire system. When she has heard what else I have to say, she may agree that it would be most unwise to proceed before 2014.</p>

 I do not disagree with the Minister.

<p><a name="stpa_o258"><a name="90713-0016.htm_para16"><a name="09071340000164">I shall now deal with the detail of the amendments. The new clause, which Lords amendment 37 would introduce, provides for the voluntary collection of personal identifiers-date of birth, signature and national insurance number-from electors alongside the existing process of household registration. It would make it obligatory for electoral registration officers to take steps to obtain that information from 1 July 2010, and it would set a minimum level for those steps.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o259"><a name="90713-0016.htm_para17"><a name="09071340000165">The new clause that Lords amendment 38 would introduce contains a power to make regulations to help enable the voluntary provision of identifying information to take place. The power to make regulations would include, by virtue of proposed subsection (1)(a) and (b), a power to amend the identifiers to be collected during the voluntary phase. That might become necessary if, for example, technological advances required a different type of identifying information to be used. That power would be subject to affirmative resolution, and the Electoral Commission would have to be consulted before it was used. It is potentially a significant power and that is why we believe that it is important to exercise such a high level of scrutiny before it is deployed.</p>

 As I said, our view is that the identifiers should be a national insurance number, a signature and date of birth. We believe that that is appropriate, but things change and it is important for the Government of the day to have a power to respond to, for example, technological changes. I hope that that gives the hon. Gentleman enough reassurance to support the Government on the amendments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o260"><a name="90713-0016.htm_para18"><a name="09071340000168">As I have said, the power to make regulations is potentially significant. Therefore, we have taken particular care to have regard to the comprehensiveness of the register and the effect that any change in the identifiers might have on it. Our view is that there are considerable challenges and we do not want to make them worse. Therefore, in consulting the commission, the Secretary of State must seek its view on the impact on the register of changes to identifiers in the event of the provision of identifiers becoming compulsory. That is intended to act as a safeguard, ensuring that any amendments to the identifying information provided would not have a negative impact on groups that are already under-represented.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o261"><a name="90713-0016.htm_para19"><a name="09071340000169">The new clause introduced by Lords amendment 38 would also provide a power to make consequential amendments to the provision inserted by Lords amendment 37. In addition, subsection (1)(c) of the new clause provides for regulations to make supplementary provision to enable the collection of identifiers on a voluntary basis. The specific matters that can be included in regulations made under that power are listed in subsection (2) of the new clause. Subsection (2) would provide for the Secretary of State to make provision for the kinds of forms that could be used to collect identifiers, what those forms should say, how they should be kept and how data held by the authority responsible for the national insurance number database could be shared with electoral registration officers or the CORE keeper, as well as the charging of fees for the provision of data. The new clause introduced by Lords amendment 38 would make it an offence for an electoral registration officer to share information other than for specified purposes.</p>

The reports must assess the progress of the voluntary phase against the tests set out in subsections (3) and (4) of the new clause introduced by Lords amendment 39.

That is essential if we are to build up a clear evidence base on the health of the registration system and its readiness to be subjected to such a significant change. In addition, it is important that those who represent hard-to-reach groups are given an adequate opportunity to contribute to the consideration relating to the move to individual registration. We would therefore expect the Electoral Commission to engage with such groups and organisations from the outset in considering the comprehensiveness and accuracy of the register and in making its recommendations.</p>

That report would have to be delivered on a specified date at least one year and not more than two years after that request was made. Again, the report must make a recommendation, and the same process as that described above will apply to that recommendation.

Lords amendment 40 applies the 2002 Northern Ireland model to the rest of the United Kingdom with a number of amendments. The purpose of the amendments is to enable a flexible approach to implementation, which will be appropriately tailored to the circumstances of Great Britain. For example, they will make it possible to insist on electoral registration officers using a prescribed canvass form in Great Britain, which will give added flexibility. They will amend the legislation so that the three-month residency requirement in Northern Ireland-which dates back 60 years to the Government of Ireland Act 1949-does not apply to the rest of the UK, where it is clearly not relevant. They will also provide for the Secretary of State to prescribe in regulations alternative evidence to be provided by those who do not have a national insurance number.

It also contains, at subsection (1), transitional provision for those already on the register in the autumn of 2015. From autumn 2015, it is proposed that all new registrations-people moving house and re-registering, or anyone entirely new to the register-would have to provide the identifiers to be put on to the register. However, subsection (1) allows that anyone already on the register in the autumn of 2015 may remain on the register-subject to their meeting the existing conditions for confirming their registration to the electoral registration officer-without providing their identifiers in the 2015 or 2016 canvass. From the autumn canvass, such individuals will have to provide their identifiers in order to remain on the register.

support the system and the public through the period of transition, and to prepare them as fully as possible for this radical and historic shift. If we do not get the process right, and the comprehensiveness of the register is compromised as a result, the consequences for our democracy will be serious. I know that there are those who argue that we should be moving more quickly. The hon. Member for Epping Forest (Mrs. Laing) has argued that consistently, and I want to spell out to her again why it is so important not to rush this process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o275"><a name="90713-0017.htm_para6"><a name="09071340000183">We know that the introduction of individual registration in Northern Ireland in 2002 led to a fall in numbers on the register. We must all learn the lessons of that experience. Under individual registration, many individuals will be responsible for their own registration for the first time, and, as I have said, that will pose considerable challenges. I want to quote briefly from the Electoral Commission report on the shift to individual registration in Northern Ireland. It stated:</p>
<a name="90713-0017.htm_brev0"><a name="09071340000223"><ul><p class="tabletext">"The new registration process disproportionately impacted on young people and students, people with learning disabilities, people with disabilities generally and those living in areas of high social deprivation."</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o276"><a name="90713-0017.htm_para7"><a name="09071340000184">We simply must not repeat that outcome when the system is introduced in Great Britain. That is why we are proposing, alongside the phased implementation of individual registration, to take a range of steps to bolster the accuracy and comprehensiveness of the register, and our understanding of registration across Great Britain.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o277"><a name="90713-0017.htm_para8"><a name="09071340000185">Before I come on to those steps, I shall outline the additional practical reasons why I am fundamentally opposed to making the shift before 2015. First, the implementation of full individual registration in 2015 would minimise as far as possible the risk of implementation directly ahead of a national or sub-national poll. A dip in the numbers registered-we run the risk of such a dip occurring-ahead of any such poll would have damaging consequences for the legitimacy of our electoral processes. Individual registration was able to be implemented swiftly in Northern Ireland not least because there was only one authority there to co-ordinate for electoral purposes. In Great Britain, there are more than 400 different registration officers, each with their own processes and registers, and co-ordination on such a scale will inevitably take time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o278"><a name="90713-0017.htm_para9"><a name="09071340000186">The move to individual registration will involve a very significant change in infrastructure and processes, including new IT systems and data sharing on a national scale. We cannot rush such implementation. The current timetable will, we believe, give us time to test what works before moving to full implementation on the basis of the best possible evidence that we can secure.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o279"><a name="90713-0017.htm_para10"><a name="09071340000187">Taken together in the round and given the real risk of a drop in registration rates, we need actively to move to bolster registration rates as far as possible in advance of implementation. To that end, we intend to pilot data-matching schemes with public authorities to enhance the accuracy and completeness of the register; to enable enhanced data sharing in two-tier local authorities via secondary legislation; to make it explicit in secondary legislation that the duty on electoral registration officers to register individuals applies all year round; and to consider whether more can be done to bolster the performance standards framework for EROs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o280"><a name="90713-0017.htm_para11"><a name="09071340000188">We will explore whether registration can be promoted at every point at which the individual interacts with public services. We have already started distributing leaflets and posters in citizens advice bureaux, making a training fact sheet available to CAB volunteers through their intranet system so they can better inform the public about registration. We are distributing posters throughout the network of courts across the country. We want to do more to provide people with opportunities to register to vote, and we are looking into the possibility of supplying rolling registration forms in post office branches to capture the details of eligible electors who, for whatever reason, are not on the register.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o281"><a name="90713-0017.htm_para12"><a name="09071340000189">Those initiatives will inevitably take time to bed in and take effect and there may, of course, be other initiatives. We are actively exploring at the moment moves to bolster the current registration system, such as by introducing a duty to register and possibly making other changes to the current framework. The current timetable will allow us to explore all feasible options before making the shift to individual registration.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o282"><a name="90713-0017.htm_para13"><a name="09071340000190">At the same time, the Electoral Commission will produce yearly reports on the health of the registration system and in 2012, crucially, we should have our clearest ever indication of registration rates, thanks to the data being collected as part of the national census. That is very important, as it will give us a crucial tool for assessing the robustness of the system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o283"><a name="90713-0017.htm_para14"><a name="09071340000191">Taken all in all, this is a massive programme of work. We are often criticised-all Governments have been criticised-for conducting major project in haste and then having to iron out the problems later, but we simply cannot afford to do that with something as important to our democracy as this historic shift. I hope that I have managed to persuade the House of the importance of the timetable. It is not a recipe for kicking the move into the long grass. What we are proposing is very clear and there is a clear end-date, subject to the tests being met-tests that I think the whole House will agree are necessary.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o284"><a name="90713-0017.htm_para15"><a name="09071340000192">Before I conclude, I wish to deal with issues raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Vale of Clwyd (Chris Ruane), who is sadly no longer in his place. He raised an important point about the willingness of electoral registration officers to pursue the comprehensiveness and accuracy of the register with all due diligence. I recognise the importance of my hon. Friend's allegation. He, of course, will understand that I cannot comment on individual cases, but I want to stress that the overwhelming majority of EROs-and I believe that the whole House would agree on this-and the chief executives of local authorities are dedicated public servants. They would never do anything to compromise their impartiality or the integrity of the electoral registration system, which is the foundation of our democracy. That has certainly been my experience of all the EROs I have met at the conferences I have mentioned that took place over the last two years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o285"><a name="90713-0017.htm_para16"><a name="09071340000193">I repeat that I am aware of the allegations that my hon.

I have looked into the issues and it is clear, on reflection, that the system of governance for electoral registration officers could be made more robust-no matter, as I have said, that the overwhelming majority of such officers and the chief executives of local authorities are dedicated public servants.</p>

Conservative Members are delighted that they are before us, even at this very, very late stage. We Conservatives have been calling for individual voter registration for four years and more. The Government have promised it on many occasions. This may be difficult to believe, but even on Third Reading of this Bill the Government were still only making promises and had proposed nothing substantial at all. We appreciate, however, that the full panoply of the amendments was brought forward in the House of Lords, and we are delighted to have them before our House now.</p>

 I accept that the hon. Lady has a long and honourable history of calling for individual voter registration, but I wonder whether she can recall that we always said that we were in favour of the principle of it but that there were implementation difficulties. She will correct me if I am wrong, but I do not recall any great clamour to improve the comprehensiveness of the register. I was aware of a lot of clamour for the measures for individual registration to be brought in, but I cannot remember her calling for the sort of measures we are now implementing to improve the comprehensiveness of the register. However, it is precisely the move towards individual registration in lock-step and coupled inextricably with measures to achieve the comprehensiveness of the register that we have now managed to secure that makes this historic move possible.</p>

 I appreciate the points the Minister is making-and I am grateful to him for giving us Conservatives credit for having pushed for many years for these necessary amendments. He brings up the issue of the comprehensiveness of the register, but I have to say that I have never considered that anyone in this House, or anyone concerned in any way in promoting and safeguarding democracy, wishes anything other than to have a register that is as comprehensive as possible. How could anybody possibly argue that the register should be anything but comprehensive? Of course it is a sine qua non of a proper democratic system that the register should be comprehensive. If I have not argued for that feature, that is because I took it as a foregone conclusion that we all want the register to be comprehensive.</p>

 The hon. Lady raises a very important issue because that is precisely the point: she takes it for granted, but actually we cannot take it for granted, because there are already 3 million people not on the register and all the evidence is that unless we move forward very carefully further hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of people would fall off the register. The move to individual registration must be conditional on the comprehensiveness of the register. We must not move first to individual registration and then hope that somehow through good luck we will get a comprehensive register. That is precisely the point.</p>

indeed, on any other party's Back Benches-have sought to suggest that Conservatives for some reason do not want a comprehensive register, but that is simply not true. I am very pleased to have the opportunity to put it on the record once and for all that we agree with the Government that the accuracy, comprehensiveness and integrity of the register and of the system is paramount. That is one of the reasons why we will not oppose the timetable the Minister has suggested this evening. I do not intend to vote against these Government amendments because I fully appreciate the Minister's argument. I always have appreciated it, and I believe that it is right to take this matter forward carefully and step by step. None of us wants to see a system introduced that would in any way undermine the integrity of our democratic system. I know that the Minister can get quite exercised on that point, usually when he is goaded by his Back Benchers, and I will reassure him-one more time-that I agree with him 100 per cent.</p>

 What a pleasure it is to have a Back Bencher intervene, and we all welcome my hon. Friend to his place. He makes an extremely good point. If a new system were being implemented for the first time in an emerging democracy, it would be surprising if the Government got away with saying, "Well, yes, but it will take us a good five years to implement this." My hon. Friend's point is well made, and it is one that I have made many times, as the Minister has just said. However, I balance that with the fact that the Electoral Commission, electoral registration officers and others who will be involved in the implementation of the Government's current plans are concerned that this should not be rushed, but taken step by step to ensure that the integrity of the system is protected-and not only protected, but seen to be protected, so that there is no perception of harm being done to the system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o293"><a name="90713-0017.htm_para24"><a name="09071340000208">Since the Minister and his colleagues started to take steps to implement the individual voter registration system for which we have been calling for many years, we have seen progress. What a pity it is that the Government had not started the process five years ago, because it would now have been implemented. I understand and share the Minister's concern for the comprehensiveness of the register, and that is one of the reasons why we have called for action on this matter for many years. It is a pity, as my hon. Friend will agree, that the Government had not commenced work on this project long ago. If they had done so, we would have a far better system in place for whenever the next general election may be.</p>

Unfortunately, that would mean making changes in primary legislation, but I am sure that a future Government, of whatever colour, could-if it turns out to be possible-bring implementation forward sooner than the Minister currently envisages.</p>

 I can assure the Minister and the House that any future Conservative Government would never take risks with the democratic process. They would take absolutely no risks with the integrity or comprehensiveness of the register or with its accuracy. I take the Minister's point about the 2012 census. At that point, when we have the results of that census, the Electoral Commission can consider those results and weigh up the work that it and electoral registration officers will have been doing by then and it might well be possible to make judgments. I also agree with the Minister that it would be difficult to introduce a new system shortly before a general election. There should be other ways of testing the system along the way to ensure that the accuracy, integrity and comprehensiveness of the register and the system are always utterly watertight.

Friends, we were able to examine that issue and ensure that the principles of individual voter registration were properly examined in this House. I see no dissent around me. We are all agreed that the current system is part of an antiquated electoral system that depended on the pater familias of each household determining who within that household should have a vote. That, along with many other aspects of our electoral system, is old-fashioned, outdated and no longer reflects the way in which Britain in the 21st century ought to be governed.

At a time when people are daily risking and losing their lives in the service of this country, it is simply not right that the Government's change to the rules on service registration has made it more difficult for people in the armed forces to register.

No other Government Back Bencher is present in the House. I would not like it to be thought that Conservative Members had done anything other than won the argument. If I were to be challenged on the point, I would say yet again that our top priority is the integrity of the system, and the accuracy and comprehensiveness of the register, and we will do all that we can to help the Government to introduce this vital new system, which we have supported for many years.</p>

 There are two sub-groups in this group of amendments. The first is about the CORE scheme and setting up a body to run that scheme, and the second is perhaps the politically more important problem of individual registration. I should say at the outset that in general terms I support what the Government are doing and have no intention of calling a Division on any of these matters. I am very pleased that the Government have made considerable progress on individual registration.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o304"><a name="90713-0018.htm_para9"><a name="09071344000021">On the matter of who is to run the CORE scheme, I suppose that it might be thought a little awkward that, at a time when all political parties are saying that there are too many quangos, we propose to set up another one. However, I understand the motive for doing so. It is agreed in all parts of the House that the Electoral Commission needs to focus its activities and certainly should not be taking on new ones. My only concern, which I mentioned in an intervention on the Minister, is that the proposal simply sets up the mechanism for transferring the function to a new body, and it does so in general terms, so that the new body could be almost anything-a corporation sole or another public authority. All the good things that the Minister rightly mentioned about the need for security and independence are not provided by the proposal; they are simply his intention. I have a slight worry that yet again what we are putting in statute is simply a mechanism and, in future, some other Government might use that in a way that the current Minister does not intend. I cannot see many sinister uses to which the provision might be put, but I want to put it on the record that the way in which the matter is being dealt with is not ideal.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o305"><a name="90713-0018.htm_para10"><a name="09071344000022">The point about the second, crucial matter of individual registration, which the hon. Member for Epping Forest (Mrs. Laing) made several times, is that if it is done properly it is not a threat to the comprehensiveness of the register. The Minister also made that point. It increases the integrity of the register and that of the elections themselves. The validity and credibility of democratic elections depend both on the register being comprehensive and on its having a great deal of integrity. If the register is not comprehensive, it is not the electorate who are making a choice but some subset of the electorate. If it is not secure and we cannot be sure that the people whose votes are being counted are electors, that people are not voting more than once or that there is not fraud going on, equally there is a threat to democratic credibility. We need both comprehensiveness and security, and I am pleased that the Minister intends the approach that he has chosen to produce both.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o306"><a name="90713-0018.htm_para11"><a name="09071344000023">I am delighted that the Government have moved such a long way from their starting point, which can be characterised as them saying, "Well, there are risks in doing this, so we shouldn't do it." There are always risks, but the point is to minimise them and move forward in a way that should produce a good result all round.</p>

Liberal Democrat council leader. It could have been any one of three people; he did not specify who it was. The hon. Gentleman said that that person somehow took the view, on behalf of my party, that it would be in our interest if the register were not comprehensive. A short reflection on the situation in my constituency should have made the hon. Gentleman realise that that could not possibly be so. The Minister listed the groups of people who, in an exercise of individual registration, are at risk of being removed from the register wrongly, or of not getting on to the register in time, and at the top of that list are students and young people. If Members think about the interests of my party, it will not take them long to realise that a change in the system that removed from the register large numbers of students and young people would not necessarily be to our advantage.</p>

<p><a name="st_o348"><a name="09071344000025"><a name="90713-0018.htm_spnew2"><a name="09071344000276"><b>Mrs. Laing:</b>

 All that I can say to the hon. Lady is that that is not our experience. The fundamental point-the point of fairness-is very clear. There needs to be a process of voluntary identifiers. It should be tested, and any distorting effects should be corrected. After that, the system should be made compulsory. That is what the Government are proposing. The only disagreement is about the time scale, and how long the process should take. I accept what the Minister says-that there are various important milestones, that we should not rush the process and that we should not take any risks-but as I understand it, in the House of Lords, the proposal was not that the timetable should definitely be shorter. It was simply that, if the Electoral Commission were of the opinion that the move to compulsory registration could take place earlier than 2014-15 without the risks that the Minister mentioned coming into play, there should be a power to allow that to happen.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o308"><a name="90713-0018.htm_para13"><a name="09071344000027">I do not think that anybody was suggesting that the timetable be artificially shortened, or that any risk be taken with the comprehensiveness of the register. All that was suggested was that there be a careful process by which the timetable could be shortened if that turned out to be a safe thing to do. One can imagine circumstances in which that would be the case. A system using the three identifiers that have been suggested-the signature, the national insurance number and the date of birth-might turn out to work well, and there might be no need to use any other identifiers. The problem of the reduction in numbers on the electoral register might turn out to be manageable in a shorter period, with the result that there was no need for any further experiment. At that point, one can imagine the Electoral Commission saying, "This is all working very well. We can take a year or 18 months off the timetable." That was all that was being proposed; nothing of the risky nature that the Minister suggested was put forward. When the move to compulsory registration is made, either through the Government's present scheme or through the scheme as it emerges under a future Government, I do not think that we will be in any danger of taking excessive risks.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o309"><a name="90713-0018.htm_para14"><a name="09071344000028">I have only one other point to make, and it could be made on a whole range of Lords amendments before us.

power allows the Government to vary the kinds of identifier that might be required-or asked for, in the voluntary part of the process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o310"><a name="90713-0018.htm_para15"><a name="09071344000029">The Minister said that there might be technological changes that bring in other opportunities. I am worried that those technological changes include ID cards. One of the problems with the ID card scheme is that Ministers say, "We have no intention of bringing it in compulsorily," but it turns out that their version of "voluntary" includes such things as getting a passport, as if the right to travel abroad were simply a matter of discretion or, as the proposal appears to allow, voting. I seek an assurance from the Minister that the Government do not see requiring the use of an ID card as part of a voluntary identifier scheme.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o311"><a name="90713-0018.htm_para16"><a name="09071344000030">With that caveat and with some disagreement with the Government on the absoluteness of their attachment to the 2014-15 timetable, I am content with the amendments proposed by the House of Lords.</p>

<p><a name="st_o350"><a name="09071344000031"><a name="90713-0018.htm_spnew4"><a name="09071344000278"><b>Mr. Chope:</b>
 I shall say a few words about the timetable relating to individual voter registration. I have taken an interest in the subject over the years, and have had conversations with the Electoral Commission. We all know that the Electoral Commission was extremely frustrated by the way in which the Government seemed to be blocking its suggestions that moves were needed towards individual voter registration.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o312"><a name="90713-0018.htm_para17"><a name="09071344000032">To put the matter in context, at the end of last month I was a monitor on behalf of the Council of Europe at the general election in Albania. One of the polling stations that I visited was in quite a large town-not Tirana, but probably the second or third largest town in Albania. While my colleague and I were making it clear that we were monitoring the voting process, a woman came up to us. She was hysterical-that is an accurate way to describe it-because she said that her son, who had died three or four years previously, had been put back on the register by the Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o313"><a name="90713-0018.htm_para18"><a name="09071344000033">That is the allegation that the woman made. For her, that was part of a conspiracy. She thought that it was the means by which the Government were putting people on the register and, knowing that they would not be able to vote, using their nominees to vote for them. This is a serious matter. That little cameo illustrates how seriously it is taken in an emerging democracy. In the course of monitoring that election, I said to some of our Albanians, I hope not too condescendingly, "Well, you are only a relatively young democracy." The response I got was, "No, we are a very old democracy. We've been going at it for over 18 years."</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o314"><a name="90713-0018.htm_para19"><a name="09071344000034">Given that the Electoral Commission had been requesting the move to individual voter registration for some time, and the fact that we have had experience of what can be achieved in Northern Ireland, I am not satisfied that we need to wait for two more general elections before we can implement the measure. That seems to be the effect of what the Minister is suggesting. I accept that it is too late to introduce individual voter registration for the next general election, which I hope will be even sooner than the Government fear it will be. However, I do not give up hope that we might be able to introduce individual voter registration in the general election after next.</p>

there's a will, there's a way, and that there is a strong will on the part of the British people and among most Members of the House of Commons to have a better system. That system will incorporate the principles embodied in individual voter registration. We may want to wait until the 2011 census, but is that absolutely essential?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o316"><a name="90713-0018.htm_para21"><a name="09071344000036">Individual voter registration could be linked to the issue of individual voter apathy. My 19-year-old daughter is now on the electoral register, but she did not put her name on it; I did. If the question of whether she wanted to place her name on the electoral register had been put to her, it would have raised her awareness and the issue of responsibility. We in this House often bemoan the low participation rate of relatively young voters in our electoral process, but that may be because we are too patronising. We say, "There's no need for you to register yourself, sonny; we'll deal with that." Then, we present them with the fait accompli close to the election and ask, "Are you going to go out and vote?"</p>

We would be promoting individual responsibility among young adults, so that they were more aware of the issues involved in participating in elections and in our democracy.</p>

Member for Epping Forest (Mrs. Laing) rightly raised the importance of data protection and data security in the CORE project, and, on that, I absolutely agree, which is why the Information Commissioner will be consulted on it. The hon. Lady asked about the timetable, and we are actively looking at that. Indeed, we need to ensure that it is the most appropriate way forward. It is an opportunity to ensure that we are ready when the time comes, but we are looking at it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o320"><a name="90713-0018.htm_para25"><a name="09071344000041">The hon. Lady mentioned the cost of the CORE system. To date, the figure is £3.7 million, and the great bulk of that money has been spent on grants to local authorities to standardise the format in which data are collected and stored. That work is important and it makes the data much easier to use generally, so, whatever happens to the CORE project, we believe that it will have been money well spent on improving the electoral system.</p>

She asked us to come back to the House regularly to report on its progress, and I am happy to give her that reassurance.

It is important that the whole process be scrutinised, and every Member will have important personal and constituency experience to contribute to the process. In the past and today, the  <br>

hon. Member for Cambridge (David Howarth) has given us his experience from his rather special constituency, but every constituency is special and there will be lessons that every Member can teach us as we move forward. This Government certainly want to learn those lessons. We welcome the scrutiny and transparency that the hon. Member for Epping Forest advocates, and we intend to have that.

Lady raised also the important question of service registration, and I agree with everything that she said about that. She will recall that we discussed the issue in Committee. As she mentioned, we have already agreed to raise from three to five years the service declaration period for members of the armed forces. We will introduce that as soon as possible, and we recognise its importance. Ministry of Justice officials will meet Ministry of Defence and Electoral Commission officials to review the information campaigns that have run since 2005. They have seen significant improvements in registration, but not enough, and I share her concerns about the matter. We need to do everything that we can, and we will continue to do so. I remind the hon. Lady that in Committee I said that hon. Members on both sides of the House who had significant garrisons in their constituencies could come to see me with their own suggestions. So far, not a single one has taken advantage of that opportunity. I repeat the invitation, and I am sure that she will do her best to publicise it.

He might be interested in the Electoral Commission's reports on recent elections in this country; the most recent was produced with the Association of Chief Police Officers. I think that he will be reassured by the commentary on the incidence of fraud in this country; the report says that it is declining. I strongly recommend that report to the hon. Gentleman.

 Exactly; that is precisely what the legislation prescribes. The Electoral Commission will make the recommendation, and Parliament in the end will decide.

The chief executive may designate a post in this way if he or she reasonably believes that such a restriction is necessary to maintain public confidence in the effectiveness of the commission in carrying out its functions. The length of the restriction must be determined by reference to the seniority of the post and the political sensitivity of the matters with which the postholder is likely to have to deal. The amendments are necessary to ensure that the small number of posts for which a one-year restriction may not be suitable owing to their seniority or the likelihood of dealing with politically sensitive matters can be designated as subject to a longer restriction. The amendments also place a requirement on the chief executive to consult the Speaker's Committee on the Electoral Commission  <br>

It is envisaged that under that Bill, a 10-year restriction will be retained along the lines of the one that is currently in place in the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000. The amendment will ensure that the level of political restriction on the appointment of boundary staff remains consistent in the intervening period between the commencement of clause 7 and the creation of the new boundary committee.</p>

That is necessary to support our intention that the Bill will extend the commission's powers so that it is a more effective regulator, but it will not do so unduly, particularly on the delicate issue of entry powers.</p>

 I agree that the Minister has attempted to achieve consensus.

obtained from a magistrate before the Electoral Commission can enter and inspect premises. The Electoral Commission has acted perfectly reasonably since it has had such powers under the 2000 Act. There is no reason to think that it would do anything other than that in future, but the amendments, with which we all agree, mean that it and the system will be better protected in future.</p>

 None of the matters that we are considering is now enormously contentious, but I want to make one or two comments, especially about clause 5 and Lords amendment 54.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o346"><a name="90713-0019.htm_para20"><a name="09071344000080">The hon. Member for Epping Forest (Mrs. Laing) is right that we have gone back and forth on clause 5 about political commissioners. It is a difficult and delicate subject, because introducing an expressly political element into the Electoral Commission will always be difficult when its tradition has been non-political and deliberately distanced from politics, for obvious reasons. However, we all agree that the commission could do with a more experienced, perhaps more down-to-earth element in its membership. That requires overcoming some difficulty in appointing the political commissioners.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o347"><a name="90713-0019.htm_para21"><a name="09071344000081">I remain slightly nervous of the party leader route for appointing political commissioners. It is obviously better for party leaders to propose three nominees rather than one because that means that we are not dealing with direct patronage, with which I have some difficulty. I am still unclear about exactly how the process will work from there. What will the precise procedure be for deciding which of the three is to be appointed? I would prefer a much more open procedure, similar to that for other public appointments, whereby something like open competition is introduced. In an ideal world, I would prefer more open competition for the posts. That is my first worry. Why have the Government rejected a rather more normal process of appointment in such cases?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o348"><a name="90713-0019.htm_para22"><a name="09071344000082">The second point is the one that the hon. Member for Perth and North Perthshire (Pete Wishart) is quite right to raise over and over. We now live in a multi-legislature, multi-political system polity-we have the Scottish Parliament, the Welsh Assembly, the Northern Ireland Assembly and the London assembly. Our political system is far more complex than it was 20 years ago. It seems odd, to say no more than that, that the ruling party in a very important part of this country-Scotland-will not be represented on the commission.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o349"><a name="90713-0019.htm_para23"><a name="09071344000083">I made the following point in Committee and I repeat it now-indeed, this fundamental problem would have been dealt with by a perfectly sensible amendment that the hon. Gentleman tabled on Report, but it was not voted on, even though other amendments that were not debated were voted on. Why should we not transfer responsibility for Scottish elections to Scotland? Should that not be part of the devolution settlement? Why is a UK body responsible for specifically Scottish elections? I do not understand why that should be the case, and I urge the Government to think about it further.</p>

However, how is it to be decided whether the refusal was unreasonable? The application appears to be for a warrant, which is issued ex parte, with only one of the parties present. Warrants are granted by magistrates in living rooms. My wife is a magistrate and she has granted warrants in our living room. Granting a warrant is not a formal court procedure, with both parties present. Without both parties present, how is it to be fairly decided that the refusal was unreasonable? I fear that the provisions have not been fully thought through. Nevertheless, I accept the need for safeguards-indeed, safeguards in this area are important-and I welcome all the other amendments.</p>

It is just not good enough to say that because we are a smaller party in this House we should not get a proper look-in when it comes to the arrangements for the Electoral Commission. The commission has responsibilities and obligations not just to this House, but to every devolved legislature across the United Kingdom, as the hon. Member for Cambridge (David Howarth) noted. We are in great danger of allowing the Electoral Commission to become the plaything of this House. However, it must properly reflect the new United Kingdom, with all its devolved institutions, and the reality of the Scottish Parliament and the Welsh and Northern Ireland Assemblies.</p>

He may refer to the smaller parties in this place, but let me remind him that we are the Government in Scotland, in one of the major legislatures in the United Kingdom. The Democratic Unionist party has a share in a coalition in Northern Ireland and Plaid Cymru, our colleagues on these Benches, has a share in power in a coalition in Wales. We are the Governments of the rest of the United Kingdom.</p>

Certainly, if the Scottish National party were the largest minority party and we did not secure that commissioner, I would be very disappointed.

The whole point of people with electoral experience going on to the Electoral Commission is that they should bring with them not partisan affiliations or party political considerations but their experience of the political process. There has to be a selection process, and the party leaders are clearly the best placed to have an overview about who the most appropriate people in their parties will be.

 With permission, I should like to make a short business statement. Given the situation in Afghanistan, I am sure all right hon. and hon. Members will agree that the subject is appropriate for a fuller debate than we had originally planned for this week. I announce the following business:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o368"><a name="90713-0020.htm_para14"><a name="09071344000109">The business for Thursday 16 July will now be-topical debate on the preparation for the Copenhagen climate change conference followed by general debate on Afghanistan.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o369"><a name="90713-0020.htm_para15"><a name="09071344000110">In addition, there has been a change to one of the subjects selected by the Official Opposition on Wednesday 15 July. The first part will now be a debate on US/UK extradition treaty followed by a debate on care for the elderly.</p>

<p><a name="st_o372"><a name="09071344000111"><a name="90713-0020.htm_spnew4"><a name="09071344000300"><b>Mr. Shailesh Vara (North-West Cambridgeshire) (Con):</b>
 May I thank the hon. Lady for her announcement and say that Conservative Members very much welcome her statement? The whole House, indeed the whole country, is concerned about the situation in Afghanistan, especially about the fate of our brave young men and women who daily put their lives on the line for Afghanistan's future and our continued freedom.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o370"><a name="90713-0020.htm_para16"><a name="09071344000112">It is regrettable, however, that this announcement has had to be forced from the Government-and only after a weekend of bad headlines and distressing news of casualties. The House will no doubt reflect on the Government's tendency to take action only when it is in their own political interests to do so. Will the Deputy Leader of the House give us an assurance that she will do her utmost to ensure that no Government statements are made on Thursday so that we have the maximum time to discuss this crucial issue? <i> [Interruption.] </i>I fail to see why the Government Chief Whip is laughing; given the seriousness of this issue, I think it is perfectly in order to ask for it to be accorded the importance it deserves-an importance that not only we but the whole country attaches to it.</p>

<p><a name="st_o373"><a name="09071344000113"><a name="90713-0020.htm_spnew5"><a name="09071344000301"><b>Barbara Keeley:</b>
 I do not believe that the announcement has been forced in any way. Even today we spent some on the issue at Defence questions, and a significant chunk of the Prime Minister's statement covered the situation in Afghanistan as well as the G8 summit. We have already spent a significant amount of today's time on the subject, and it is perfectly right to swap around the topical debate and have even more time for a general debate on Afghanistan on Thursday.</p>

<p><a name="st_o374"><a name="09071344000114"><a name="90713-0020.htm_spnew6"><a name="09071344000302"><b>Mr. David Heath (Somerton and Frome) (LD):</b>
 Given the very serious situation in Afghanistan and the dangers faced by our young men and women serving in the armed forces, it is absolutely right to have time to debate the subject this week. I applaud the decision to turn over Thursday's late business for a debate on Afghanistan. Will the Deputy Leader of the House clarify whether the Foreign Secretary, the Secretary of State for Defence or, preferably, the Prime Minister will lead that debate? There are clear interlocking defence and foreign affairs considerations in debating Afghanistan and it would be best to deal with both aspects of the case.</p>

Circumstances might change over the long summer recess, making it necessary that the House is informed. May I ask the hon. Lady to give some thought to how Members will be made aware of any change of circumstances, and the circumstances in which the House will be recalled if that becomes necessary because of matters of grave concern that we ought to be debating?</p>

 I thank the hon. Gentleman for his support for the announcement. I tried to contact him a number of times this afternoon to warn him of it.

 On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. The statement made by the Deputy Leader of the House refers to this Thursday. If I had been given an opportunity to conclude my remarks, I should have suggested the tabling of a business motion on Thursday to enable us to debate the motion to which I have referred.</p>

 I am sorry to have to explain to the hon. Gentleman a second time, but as it is obviously necessary, I am happy to do so.

 "The Spirit of Humanity" sailed from Larnaca, Cyprus at the end of June, attempting to get to Gaza seaport and sailing under a Greek flag. There were 21 passengers and crew on board, from 11 different countries, including six British people. One of these last was my constituent, Miss Alex Harrison, who lives on the Marquess estate. In the early hours of 30 June, while they were still in international waters, they were surrounded by Israeli gunboats and threatened with being fired on. Their radar and communications systems were jammed and they were warned hourly that they must change course because, "You are headed for a blockaded area. All force necessary will be used." Lights were flashed at them throughout the night and, when they were 24 miles from Gaza, Zodiac boats appeared and then left again.</p>

 As I have tried to say to hon. Members, we have sought clarification from the Israeli Government about where the ship was and what, in international law, was the appropriate course of action. We still seek that clarification, but it is absolutely clear from the point of view of the UK Government that the Israeli Government must act consistently with international law, and that must apply in terms of the laws of the sea. We have raised this matter with the Israeli Foreign Minister; we have sought clarification and we await further information. I am not able to give the House any further information on that particular incident this evening.</p>

 The information that the Israeli Government have given to me is that they intercepted the "Spirit of Humanity" in Gazan waters, not in international waters, so does Israel have the right to intercept vessels in that location?</p>

 As far as I am aware, although there may be a debate about whether that is appropriate, it is not in itself a breach of international law. The accusation that is being made about this intervention is that it in some way contravened international law. If the vessel was in Gazan waters, people may have a political debate about whether that action was appropriate, but it would not have breached international law.</p>

 There is an argument about whether the vessel was in international waters, and certainly my constituent has made it clear that, from his point of view, it was. Setting that aside, is it not bizarre as well as obnoxious that the Israelis should abduct all those on that ship into a country that they had no intention of visiting and then deport them from it?</p>

 I hear my right hon. Friend's view of the situation. We have sought to clarify with the Israeli Government why they felt the need to take this action and whether it was consistent with international law, taking account of not only their security concerns but the desire of people to get humanitarian assistance to the people of Gaza. That is the position of the UK Government. My right hon. Friend is entitled to his opinion, but the information that we have at our disposal means that, at this stage, we do not share it.</p>

way that is consistent with international law. We also respect the fact that the Israelis have a right to take reasonable measures to protect the security of their citizens and their border.</p>

 The Minister is giving the impression that Israel can act with impunity and that we are relying on Israel itself to give us the information on which we can make a judgment. I suggest that we need an independent investigation into this matter. British citizens were detained and, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Manchester, Gorton (Sir Gerald Kaufman) said, they were taken to a country that they did not wish to visit and then deported from it. In any other circumstances and with any other country we would be taking diplomatic action.</p>

 I do not agree with my hon. Friend. He claims that I have suggested from the Dispatch Box that Israel should be able to act with impunity when I have said throughout my contribution that Israel has a responsibility to act consistently with international law. We have sought clarification from the Israeli Government as to whether, on this occasion, they acted consistently with international law in where they intercepted the vessel. We shall continue to seek further information. How that implies impunity, I am not sure.</p>

 Whatever might be said about Israel's security arrangements-they are a matter for Israel-and given that the ship was unarmed, when the Minister gets a statement from the Israeli Government, what action will he propose that the British Government should take to ensure that, in future, unarmed vessels trying to deliver aid to Gaza are not impounded in such a way?</p>

 I have made it clear that we expect individuals and organisations who seek to get aid to Gaza to do so in consultation with the appropriate authorities. We advise that that is the best way to proceed if organisations and individuals genuinely want to get humanitarian aid through to the people of Gaza. I will not give a running commentary on what the United Kingdom may do in circumstances that may prevail at some stage in future; that would not be appropriate in this debate. I shall make some progress now.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o406"><a name="90713-0022.htm_para2"><a name="09071344000194">We are very concerned about the humanitarian situation in Gaza. We know that the conflict earlier this year intensified an already difficult situation. It is true that the pace of deterioration has slowed since the ceasefire in January, but it is evident that the humanitarian situation remains extremely serious. The strict border restrictions, including on legitimate aid, reconstruction materials, trade goods and the movement of people, are having a major impact on the lives of ordinary Gazans, who suffer serious hardship. Approximately 90 per cent. of Gazans depend partly on food aid. During May, according to the UN Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs, the number of truckloads of goods allowed entry into Gaza was approximately 2,960.  <br>

However, that is not enough; it represents less than a quarter of the monthly average of truckloads that entered Gaza in the first five months of 2007, before the tightening of the border restrictions in June of that year. We are concerned that those restrictions, and Hamas's control of the economy and the smuggling tunnels, mean that the people of Gaza are being denied hope, access to the means to rebuild their lives, and the chance of economic growth and education.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o407"><a name="90713-0022.htm_para3"><a name="09071344000195">Although there is no permanent, physical Israeli presence in Gaza, Israel retains significant control over Gaza's borders, airspace, and territorial waters. It therefore retains obligations under the fourth Geneva convention. The convention is clear that an occupying power must co-operate in allowing the passage and distribution of relief consignments. It is therefore essential that the Government of Israel ease the restrictions on the Gaza border and allow an immediate increase in the flow of essential aid and reconstruction materials into Gaza, as well as the legitimate flow of trade, goods and people. My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary raised the United Kingdom's concerns on that general issue in his meeting with the Israeli Defence Minister, Ehud Barak, on 6 July, and in his conversations with the Israeli Foreign Minister-I referred to one of those conversations-which took place on 13 May and 1 July. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o408"><a name="90713-0022.htm_para4"><a name="09071344000196">Together with the European Union, the United States, and the wider international community, we will continue to press the Israeli Government at the highest levels to reduce the restrictions, but Israel is not the only party that should move. Hamas must renounce violence, recognise Israel, accept previous agreements, and work with the Palestinian Authority towards a positive outcome in the current national dialogue negotiations presided over by Egypt. Hamas must also release Gilad Shalit, whom it kidnapped and has held illegally for more than three years without contact with his family, or access for the Red Cross. As my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary stated on the third anniversary of Gilad Shalit's abduction on 25 June, we call on Hamas for his immediate, unconditional and safe release. We share the Shalit family's dismay at Hamas's refusal to allow the International Committee of the Red Cross access to Gilad.</p>

I intend to develop my first-hand experience, as a Minister who is new in this role, of the challenges faced by both Israelis and Palestinians. I shall take the strong message that the United Kingdom intends to pursue a leadership role in securing a two-state solution in the middle east. The recent speech by President Obama in Cairo gives us a new sense of hope and a way forward. We welcome the fact that Prime Minister Netanyahu has for the first time acknowledged that the two-state solution was the objective. However, there is a long way to go, in terms of the Israelis' willingness to move on settlements. We also believe that the Arab peace initiative offers a promising basis for future negotiations.</p>
