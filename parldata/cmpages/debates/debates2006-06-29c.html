Our overall investment in adult learning will be broadly maintained at &#163;2.9 billion and will be focused increasingly on our priorities of providing support for those adults who lack basic skills or the level 2 platform of skills for employability, and of ensuring opportunities for developing skills at level 3.

 There is much to be applauded in the priorities that my right hon. Friend has just set out, but does he agree that community education is the basic building block that allows people to get back into education? Often, it is the glue that holds the whole system together. Will he look carefully at how his decisions are impacting on community education for adults?</p>

 My hon. Friend raises an important point. I do not think that he, or his Committee, would disagree that there is a need to reprioritise, but there is concern about the community support that he mentioned. We are maintaining funding at &#163;210 million for learning for personal enrichment. That is safeguarded and ring-fenced in the Learning and Skills Council budget.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o1"><a name="60629-0001.htm_para1"><a name="06062974000121">My hon. Friend asked about courses designed to introduce people onto the ladder of opportunity and skills, but the effectiveness of some courses has been questioned in the past. For example, with regard to entry into employment, the statistics do not show that the courses always lead to progression. That is why we are looking at the foundation learning tier, as we want to turn the current complex structure into a much more coherent set of units that is easier to understand and operate. My hon. Friend makes an important point about a matter that we will look at in the future.</p>

 The Secretary of State will know that the Leitch review of skills made it clear that, because of demographic change, it is vital that we reskill and upskill the existing work force to meet the challenges of a changing world economy. However, the National Institute of Adult Continuing Education has said that the Government&#146;s target culture has discouraged hard-to-reach groups from returning to learning. Will the right hon. Gentleman say why the number of people studying at further education colleges&#151;not just those with special needs, but including all those between 25 to 59&#151;has fallen by 9 per cent. in the past year?</p>

 I do not accept that comment from NIACE. The Leitch review, and the review that we have had from Andrew Foster, will be crucial in pointing us in the right direction, as will the further education White Paper that will subsequently become a Bill. The problems in FE were highlighted in Andrew Foster&#146;s report, which showed that the sector has put up with poor provision for too long. There are some very good FE colleges, but others still believe that employers should accept their thesis about the education that they require for their work force. There has been too little engagement with employers, but we are putting them at the heart of the matter and trying to do something about the alphabet soup of qualifications that currently exists. We are also working to sort out the units available in foundation learning to which I referred earlier, and I believe that we can tackle the problems in FE by adopting those approaches. Certainly, the FE sector is much more of a priority now than it ever has been for previous Governments.</p>

 I accept the merit of the reprioritisation policy, but will my right hon. Friend look at how the funding formula operates? Last year, for example, the better that learning and skills councils seemed to do in encouraging participation among 16 to 18-year-olds, the worse they seemed to do with the 19-plus allocations. That was especially true in north Yorkshire.</p>

 I will look at the point that my hon. Friend raises, but I am glad that he supports our reprioritisation policy. The problem with FE and adult skills is that to prioritise everything is to prioritise nothing. We are concentrating on longer courses for people with no level 2 qualifications whatsoever, whatever their income, and we will also introduce an entitlement to level 3 for 19 to 25-year-olds on a similar basis. That must be our priority, but I shall certainly look into whether provision for 16 to 18-year-olds is affecting adult participation rates, as described by my hon. Friend.</p>

 The Secretary of State will be aware of concern in Hull and the East Riding about the reduction in courses, particularly for older people. The Government&#146;s policy is a commitment to lifelong learning: education does not exist purely to increase skills to help people into the workplace and to aid the economy but is about broader issues. I am sure that he, like me, will have had concerns raised at his constituency surgeries. Will he respond to those concerns, perhaps giving reassurance to those who see courses that add to their quality of life being cut back? Will he give a message I can take back to those I represent?</p>

 The hon. Gentleman is right to say those problems have also been raised with me. There are problems across the country, and saying that we will reprioritise or that we will increase the level of fees in further education is not easy. There was always an implicit expectation that there would be a contribution of 25 per cent. from students, but very few colleges introduced that. We are gradually moving towards the expectation of a contribution of 50 per cent. by 2010. From constituents I have spoken to, and this is reflected in the MORI poll, I think that most people accept that if they can make a reasonable contribution to a course that they are pleased to be taking&#151;whether in languages, learning for recreation or learning just to increase knowledge&#151;they should make a contribution. When that is explained, along with our priorities for the country and the economy, people tend to accept what is, I accept, a sometimes difficult message.</p>

to talk to and somewhere to go, but they also need help with the underlying problems that cause them to run away in the first place. It is the responsibility of local children&#146;s services, working closely with the police and the voluntary and community organisations, to provide the help that young runaways need. The Government are supporting them strongly through the Every Child Matters programme, which is driving improvements for all children and young people but particularly for the most vulnerable.</p>

 The helpline is one of a number of important vehicles by which children and young people who run away can get some immediate advice, although I think it is worth bearing in mind that the vast majority of children who run away return home within 24 hours, which should be our primary objective. The helpline also gets considerable funding from the Home Office&#151;about &#163;900,000 this year, including &#163;600,000 core funding.

That is why the Government, across a number of Departments, are working hard to see what are the barriers to progress for looked-after children, including issues around why they might run away. We shall publish a Green Paper outlining a range of issues, including precisely the point that the hon.

Given that overall funding for drugs services in Stoke-on-Trent is around &#163;11 a head compared with &#163;23 a head in Nottingham, what extra resources are the Department prepared to direct towards tackling that curse on our young people in Stoke-on-Trent?</p>

 My hon. Friend makes his point about his constituency in his customary manner. I expect him to champion his constituency and its causes and he is doing that today. I reassure him that there is no postcode lottery for drug treatment, but a formula that was set up with the assistance of academics at the university of York. We specifically examined local demographics and the prevalence of misuse, and we ensure that the overall pooled budget&#151;the young people substance misuse grant&#151;is spread around the country by focusing on those elements through the formula. However, there are 30 high focus areas and another 18 will be announced shortly.</p>

From 1998 to now, the British crime survey figures show that, among 16 to 24-year-olds, the use of cannabis has reduced by 16 per cent., that of amphetamines is down by 66 per cent., that of LSD has decreased by 83 per cent. and that of glues has reduced by 66 per cent.

 In the 1990s, the total number of engineering students in our universities was falling. Since 2002-03, there has been a 6 per cent. increase. We are committed to continuing that trend.

 I thank my hon. Friend for that reply. Has he seen the report that the Royal Academy recently published, called &#147;Educating Engineers for the 21st Century: the Industry View&#148;? It concluded that university undergraduate engineering education needs to be completely overhauled. The academy has also asked for stronger collaboration between industry and universities as well as schools so that we can have engineers in the 21st century. I ask my hon. Friend to take those recommendations seriously and implement many of the ideas in the report.</p>

 I thank my hon. Friend for his detailed interest in these issues. The report is interesting; we are already responding to a number of the issues raised in the research and I know that the academy welcomes many of the steps we are taking. Links and collaboration between the education system and companies are important to ensure that the needs of industry are understood and reflected in the curriculum. In particular, the establishment of the sector skills councils, the move on specialised diplomas and the establishment of foundation degrees are helping us to change the situation.</p>

 But of course the number of first degrees in engineering has fallen from 21,000 in 1996-97 to only 19,500 last year. The Minister will be aware of his Department&#146;s report, &#147;An Assessment of Skill Needs in Engineering&#148;, which concluded that one of the main reasons for that reduction is the limited number studying maths and science subjects at school, where there has been a drop in entries for A-level maths, for example, from 56,000 in 1997 to just 46,000 last year. What steps are the Government taking to boost the uptake of maths and science at A-level? Will they allow the state sector to opt for the IGCSE in maths and the three sciences, which many schools in the independent sector are adopting because of their dissatisfaction with the new curriculum?</p>

 However the hon. Gentleman plays with the figures, it is a fact that since 2002-03 there has been a 6 per cent. increase in the number of students of engineering. That increase is on the record and it is important. Undoubtedly, we need to stimulate greater interest and demand at school in the stem subjects. A range of initiatives is in place to achieve that, and there is some evidence of improvement. However, we also have to enthuse young people about the importance of science, and some of the changes that we are developing in the curriculum to get young people to look at the processes of science rather than just learning by rote will be important. We need to get some practical issues across, too, such as the fact that in terms of the graduate earnings premium a person with a stem degree will earn a third more than someone with a non-stem degree. If we start getting those facts across to young people, I think we shall be able to shift the trend.</p>

 First, those who are employed are in a position of authority and trust vis-Ã -vis children and young people, which is not the case for those who may be students. I know that the hon. Gentleman is rightly concerned about the issue so I want to reassure him. Where an abuser is a child and the victim is a child there are many cases of a different nature: in some, the risk to other children will not be very great at all, because the abuse has arisen in a specific situation, but in others, there will be a more generalised risk to other children, which is why I stressed in the final part of my answer the need for agencies to look at each case individually and to make decisions on the basis of the risk posed by an individual young person to any other young people. Indeed, in some cases that will include the need to provide for education&#151;whether further education or education before the age of 16&#151;that is not in a mainstream education facility. That option is open to the agencies concerned.</p>

 I thank my hon. Friend. We should certainly do that. We should take some encouragement from the fact that the underlying trend in applications this year is upwards. We also need to continue with the joint communications campaign that we have established to get across the real benefits of the new student financial support system that is coming in this September. For example, students no longer have to pay before they go to university and only pay the money back when they are in work and earning more than &#163;15,000 a year. The repayment terms are very affordable and, crucially, for students from poorer backgrounds, we are bringing back non-repayable grants.

If that were the true situation, we would see a significant downturn in applications. I am sometimes challenged about the stance of the Liberal Democrats on this issue. In Scotland, under the Scottish Executive, where the Liberal Democrats are in a partnership Government, they are supporting a postgraduate repayment system that, in principle, is no different from the system that we are bringing in this year.</p>

 With 100,000 new houses planned for Northamptonshire over the next 15 years, there is growing local concern that the present strain on school places will be exacerbated. Will the Minister guarantee that there will be sufficient Government financial and other support to the local education authority and other agencies involved to ensure that there will be full and complete provision of school places for Northamptonshire&#146;s growing population?</p>

 We are confident about the level of capital support that we are giving Northamptonshire and, indeed, the country as a whole. Northamptonshire and its schools are receiving capital support of more than &#163;90 million over the current spending period. That includes more than &#163;8 million that is based on the new pupil places criteria. It is up to the Tory council in Northamptonshire to spend that money wisely. We must not try to learn any lessons from the Conservative party on capital funding. When it left office, it was spending &#163;600,000, but we are now spending 10 times that on capital.</p>

 There are many things that I could mention about the excellence of Derbyshire. I wanted to leave some things for my hon. Friend, who is an excellent advocate for his constituents and his county. As for whether there is an untried national framework, there is the Building Schools for the Future programme. It is an enormous capital programme; it is a huge injection of capital spend into our education system to replace or renovate all secondary schools by 2020. In doing so, we have to be conscious of how we manage the market in terms of construction and how we integrate information computer technology, construction and design to produce transformational education as part of the new buildings scheme. We must balance our national programme against any precedent that may be set by Derbyshire. My hon. Friend and his colleagues have made a strong case.</p>

 In that further discussion, will my hon.

 I am certainly aware of the timing of the two waves&#151;I think that there is a four or five-year gap between them. As my hon. Friend knows, there was a strong case for allowing the Derbyshire framework to proceed with that early wave, largely in Bolsover, before making a judgment about whether or not it worked. It is a strong argument, but as I said, I must weigh it against other arguments on precedent and project risk. </p>

 I thank the Leader of the House for giving us the business for the next two weeks. As he announced, on Monday 10 July there will be a debate on the BBC on a Government motion.

On Tuesday, 320 job cuts were announced at the United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust, on top of 300 cuts last year. Yesterday, 500 job cuts were announced by the East and North Hertfordshire NHS Trust, with the equivalent of two to three ward closures planned. Yesterday also saw the loss of 500 jobs at Southampton University Hospitals NHS Trust. The local union leader Karen Jennings said:</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o22"><a name="60629-0004.htm_para5"><a name="06062974000254">And that comes at a time when the service is being cut.

 I am sorry to disappoint the right hon. Lady, but as a matter of arithmetic, this Government have a couple of weeks less than four years to run. Let me just run through her points.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o28"><a name="60629-0004.htm_para11"><a name="06062974000261">The right hon. Lady&#146;s first point was about a debate on a Government motion. There has been no conspiracy, but I will ask my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport to ask the BBC whether its results can be made available earlier. In the case of quoted companies it is important for the times at which results are announced to be kept to exactly, but as the BBC is a public corporation with no share price to worry about, I see no particular reason why the information should not be available to the House in advance. I will do my best.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o29"><a name="60629-0004.htm_para12"><a name="06062974000262">The right hon. Lady&#146;s second point concerned the debate on armed forces personnel. First, there are, quite properly, five debates a year on different aspects of the armed forces. Secondly, a problem for the Chamber, with which we all have to deal, is the intensive activity of Select Committees, which means that their members are often abroad. I do not honestly think it is possible to programme debates to take account at all times of whether Select Committee members are abroad. I experienced the same problem with foreign affairs debates. I should have preferred members of the Foreign Affairs Committee to be present for those debates, but sometimes it simply was not possible.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o30"><a name="60629-0004.htm_para13"><a name="06062974000263">Let me say parenthetically that we shall have to do something about the fact that Select Committees are increasingly meeting exclusively on Tuesdays or Wednesdays. That is affecting attendance in the Chamber, and putting disproportionate pressure on the facilities of the House. I hope that the Chairman of the Liaison Committee will be prepared to talk to me about it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o31"><a name="60629-0004.htm_para14"><a name="06062974000264">As for job cuts in the national health service, the right hon. Lady knows that, in a context in which spending on the health service has more than doubled, there are some temporary difficulties in the management of budgets. I wish that she and her colleagues would stop scaring patients in their constituencies, and implying that a golden age existed when the Conservatives were in power. She knows that to be completely untrue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o32"><a name="60629-0004.htm_para15"><a name="06062974000265">The right hon. Lady mentioned the Windsor, Ascot and Maidenhead health forum. That is fine, but why  <br>

did she not mention that in her area, which is covered as a whole by Thames Valley strategic health authority, there has been an increase of 2,700&#151;22 per cent.&#151;in the number of nurses and a 40 per cent. increase in the number of doctors? There is no way in which marginal, temporary reductions in the overall level of spending will take away from patients in the right hon. Lady&#146;s area, and in every other area in the country, that dramatic increase in the number of doctors and nurses, and the huge increase in levels of health care for the right hon. Lady&#146;s constituents.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o33"><a name="60629-0004.htm_para16"><a name="06062974000266">The right hon. Lady went on to talk about rail fares. Although her comments were rather opaque, I understood her to be complaining, root and branch, about the consequences of rail privatisation. I know that she was not in the House when the Railways Act 1993 was passed, but I gather that she would have supported railway privatisation. <i> [Interruption.] </i>I can read too, and what the right hon.

<p><a name="stpa_o34"><a name="60629-0004.htm_para17"><a name="06062974000267">It is true that in the case of one or two privatisations we may not have got things entirely right, but we were absolutely right when it came to the method of railway privatisation. The fares have been changed as a result of decisions by the train operating companies, which the right hon. Lady and her colleagues set up under the rail privatisation deal. Let her explain that to her constituents, along with the fact that since 2001 we have more than doubled spending on the railways.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o35"><a name="60629-0004.htm_para18"><a name="06062974000268">The right hon. Lady&#146;s last point concerned the Human Rights Act and the decision on control orders.

All I will say is that I think that the right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke), a former Chancellor of the Exchequer who now chairs the Conservatives&#146; democracy group, was probably correct in describing the Leader of the Opposition&#146;s proposals in respect of the Human  Rights Act as &#147;xenophobic&#148; and wrong-headed. <i> [Interruption.] </i>What is the Government&#146;s view?

The great concern is that those closures are taking place on the basis not of strategic planning, but of short-term financial expediency.

Bermondsey (Simon Hughes) agrees. It would be good if the Liberal Democrats&#146; recognition of the improvement in services in the NHS were accepted, even ungraciously, by members of the Conservative party. I do not accept that the short-term financial difficulties are a result of privatisation, as the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath) alleges: they are the result of trying to get a grip on total spending in the NHS in the context of substantial rises. I appreciate that there is great anxiety in areas where community hospitals are to close. My right hon. Friend the Health Secretary is very alive to that, and there are many opportunities&#151;more than there used to be&#151;to raise such matters on the Floor of the House or in Westminster Hall.

 If the Leader of the House is lucky enough to come to Hemel Hempstead, he will see that there is a fantastic general and acute hospital, which I freely admit has received a great deal of investment in the last few years; it has a new cardiac unit, stroke unit and maternity birthing unit, and there has been a great deal of expenditure on new staff and facilities. Sadly however, that is now all wasted because the hospital is going to be knocked down as a consequence of Hertfordshire&#146;s deficit problem.

 With permission,  Mr Speaker, I should like to make an announcement about the Government&#146;s proposals for the second phase of the EU emissions trading scheme. Today, we are announcing the level of our cap. In due course, we will be presenting to the Commission our full and formal national allocation plan.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o56"><a name="60629-0006.htm_para3"><a name="06062974000354">The case for tackling climate change, and the human contribution to it, is overwhelming. The scientific consensus is wide and deep, and the political consensus is widening and deepening. The need for international and domestic action, across all aspects of economic and social life, is very strong.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o57"><a name="60629-0006.htm_para4"><a name="06062974000355">In the UK, we can take pride in the fact that we are projected to cut our emissions of greenhouses gases by 23 to 25 per cent. from 1990 levels over the Kyoto commitment period&#151;nearly double the Kyoto targets. However, UK emissions of carbon dioxide are rising. We remain on track to meet our Kyoto targets, but on current trends, we will fall short of our national goal of a 20 per cent. reduction in CO2 emissions by 2010. Our challenge is to take action now to avoid the environmental and the economic and social costs of inaction.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o58"><a name="60629-0006.htm_para5"><a name="06062974000356">The EU emissions trading scheme is the cornerstone of a Europe-wide drive to reduce emissions from highly energy-intensive sectors. It currently covers about 11,000 installations across Europe, and companies in the scheme in the UK account for some 45 per cent. of UK carbon dioxide emissions. The ETS gives a clear incentive to industry to invest in low-carbon technologies of the future, but achieves carbon reductions at lowest possible cost.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o59"><a name="60629-0006.htm_para6"><a name="06062974000357">We are in the second year of the first phase of the scheme. The results from year one have provided a first opportunity to judge allocation against emissions, and most member states' caps for phase 1 do not provide the scarcity that the scheme demands. The UK cap was 245 million tonnes, and our system has worked well. The Government imposed the shortfall in allowances on the electricity supply industry, and all other sectors were allocated according to need. As intended, all but the electricity supply sector are living within their allocations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o60"><a name="60629-0006.htm_para7"><a name="06062974000358">The Commission has used the information from the first phase to assess what member states&#146; caps should be for phase 2, and has set out indicative figures that require substantial cuts from member states. Phase 1 has been, and is, in many ways a trial period. Phase 2 coincides with the first Kyoto period&#151;2008 to 2012&#151;and states that do not take the measures necessary within that period to reach their Kyoto targets will either have to purchase Kyoto allowances and credits from other states or face penalties for missing targets.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o61"><a name="60629-0006.htm_para8"><a name="06062974000359">In March, in our consultation on the draft national allocation plan, we set out a range of UK reductions of emissions during phase 2, from 3 million tonnes of carbon to 8 million tonnes. At the time of consultation, that was equivalent to a cap of 234 to 252 million  <br>

allowances a year, which, for the sake of clarity, I should explain represents 234 to 252 million tonnes of carbon dioxide.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o62"><a name="60629-0006.htm_para9"><a name="06062974000360">I have to report to the House that there have been important changes since we published the draft national allocation plan. Our projections for emissions in 2010 have risen by 3 million tonnes of carbon for the UK as a whole&#151;significantly, because of changes in household numbers&#151;and by 1.1 million tonnes of carbon for the installations covered by the EU emissions trading scheme.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o63"><a name="60629-0006.htm_para10"><a name="06062974000361">In those circumstances, we believe it is essential to make the maximum effort consistent with the range on which we consulted. In other words, that means reductions of 8 million tonnes of carbon per year below business as usual, which is equivalent to a reduction of 29.3 million tonnes of carbon dioxide. It may help the House if I say that that is roughly equivalent to the carbon emissions of 4.5 million households. This is now, since the change in projections, equivalent to an annual total allocation of 238 million allowances to UK installations covered by the scheme in phase 1. The figures may change slightly to reflect the expansion of the scheme and removal of the installations that emit the smallest amounts of CO2.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o64"><a name="60629-0006.htm_para11"><a name="06062974000362">We looked carefully at the possible effects on business and consumers before making our final decision. Our intention is that for industrial sectors, including those most open to international competition, allocations should continue to be on the basis of need. In respect of electricity supply, however, the sector is mainly insulated from domestic competition, and is domestically liberalised. That sector's allowances could therefore be set lower and be subject to auctioning.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o65"><a name="60629-0006.htm_para12"><a name="06062974000363">Phase 2 of the EU ETS allows for a maximum level of auctioning of allowances of 10 per cent. We propose to set the level of auctioning in the UK at 7 per cent. Obviously, the final amount raised by the auction cannot be determined in advance&#151;it depends on the price of carbon&#151;but it will be substantial.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o66"><a name="60629-0006.htm_para13"><a name="06062974000364">We will build on the trading scheme agreement and go further. We believe there is a major opportunity for the UK not just to invest in renewable energy, other non-nuclear, low-carbon technologies, and energy efficiency, but to build successful businesses in these fields. We will establish a new environmental transformation fund, held jointly by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and the Department of Trade and Industry, administered by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry and myself, to grasp this opportunity. Final details of the scale and scope of the fund will be announced in the spending review for implementation, as in the ETS, in 2008.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o67"><a name="60629-0006.htm_para14"><a name="06062974000365">The EU emissions trading scheme is also linked to a global carbon market and has been a major driver in its development. Project credits, which are credits generated in developing countries through the clean development mechanism, or in other developed countries by joint implementation projects, may be used to help meet the caps set for operators. The use of these credits provides a further driver for sustainable energy projects in the developing world and for technology transfer. However, member states need to ensure a balance between domestic and international  <br>

effort. UK companies are already at the forefront of this market, and we want that to continue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o68"><a name="60629-0006.htm_para15"><a name="06062974000366">In the UK we are providing for the use of these credits to meet up to 66 per cent.&#151;two thirds&#151;of the effort in phase 2. In effect, that means that 5.3 million tonnes of carbon&#151;19.5 million tonnes of carbon dioxide&#151;from clean development and joint implementation projects can be used, which is equivalent to 8 per cent. of the total cap. All installations in the UK may use project credits to meet emissions up to 8 per cent. of their allocation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o69"><a name="60629-0006.htm_para16"><a name="06062974000367">The EU emissions trading scheme has an impact on electricity prices via the cost of carbon allowances, and we have looked at that carefully. It is very important to realise that the cost is driven by the cumulative effect of all member states' decisions, not by the decision of any individual member state for the citizens of that country. Many factors drive electricity prices, including global fuel prices and the weather, but our estimate is that the impact of the proposal, relative to the phase 1 cap, will be a one-off rise in industrial energy prices in the region of 1 per cent., and approximately half that for domestic users.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o70"><a name="60629-0006.htm_para17"><a name="06062974000368">Our decision to set the cap at the top end of the range of effort on which we consulted sends a clear message that the emissions trading scheme is here to stay; that the Government are committed to making it work, providing clear, progressive rewards for a shift to low-carbon technologies; and that the UK is determined to maintain its leadership role on this issue. Today's decision will set us on course to deliver a 16.2 per cent. reduction in emissions against 1990 levels by 2010. We said when we launched the climate change programme review in March that it was not the last word, and we will use further opportunities, including the energy review and the environmental transformation fund, to help us move progressively towards our 2010 target.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o71"><a name="60629-0006.htm_para18"><a name="06062974000369">EU member states are required to use emissions trading as a means to deliver their Kyoto protocol commitments. The level of ambition that individual member states set for the reductions to be made by the sectors covered by the emissions trading scheme will be an important element in the price of carbon. Now that member states will need to show that they are meeting their Kyoto targets, and with the Commission having phase 1 emissions data, the UK expects to see more stringent caps enforced in phase 2. We will therefore encourage and support the European Commission in its efforts to ensure, tough caps, to provide greater long-term certainty and to help smooth the running of the system to avoid potential competitive distortions. I spoke to Commissioner Dimas, the Environment Commissioner, this morning to emphasise that point.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o72"><a name="60629-0006.htm_para19"><a name="06062974000370">Phase 2 also forms an important element in the broader consideration of our long-term carbon policy framework. My right hon. Friend the Trade and Industry Secretary, who is in Geneva today as part of the World Trade Organisation negotiations, will next month be reporting the findings of the energy review in which the Government is reviewing the UK's progress against the medium and long-term Energy White Paper goals, including our 2050 carbon reduction goals, and the options for further steps to achieve them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o73"><a name="60629-0006.htm_para20"><a name="06062974000371">My right hon. Friend the Prime Minister has made it clear that climate change is a global problem that requires a global solution. This target for phase 2 will  <br>

support the development of a global carbon market, and we will therefore continue to work with our EU partners to ensure that negotiations for future commitments under the Kyoto protocol make clear and convincing progress. We will continue to work through the Gleneagles dialogue, launched during the UK presidency of the G8, to search for consensus on practical measures for tackling climate change. The case for taking action is overwhelming; the speed at which the world responds to that case will determine the effectiveness and positive economic impact of our response. Today's announcement takes another step towards our long-term objective of a 60 per cent. reduction in C02 emissions by 2050. I commend it to the House.</p>

 I thank the Secretary of State for his statement and for prior notice of what is undeniably its hideously complicated content. As he said, the case for tackling climate change is overwhelming. It is the biggest environmental threat that we face; indeed, I would go further and say that it may well be the biggest threat that we face in our generation of politicians.

That becomes even more difficult and complicated in the context of the European Union, where we need to ensure fair competition across all member states and a fair allocation system that is robust and does not distort competition, but which also reduces carbon emissions.</p>

In that context, the Secretary of State&#146;s announcement provides some evidence of welcome progress. We are pleased that the Government have opted for the target of cutting 8 million tonnes of carbon, which is at the higher end of the range that they set out earlier this year. However, I note that, since March, the base case projection for business as usual has been revised upward. Does not that suggest that the range of emission cuts should have been revised upward proportionately?</p>

Would it not have been possible to use one of those existing bodies to undertake the functions that the Secretary of State envisages for the new fund?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o83"><a name="60629-0007.htm_para0"><a name="06062974000383">Let me respond to the questions. The hon. Gentleman made an allegation about Germany, but he must be careful&#151;I think that his information came from the BBC website. He said that the German reduction was 0.6 per cent. That is wrong and it is important to correct it. The phase 1 cap in Germany was 499 million tonnes. The proposed second phase cap constitutes a reduction of 17 million tonnes and then a further reduction of 8 million tonnes arising  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="29 Jun 2006">

<notus-date day="29" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>29 Jun 2006 : Column 401</b><br>
from emissions in 2005. The Commission then said that the German Government will have to get down to 462 million tonnes. The Germans have already committed to a 3 per cent. to 5 per cent. cut and the Commission has suggested going further. I caution the hon. Gentleman to be careful about the 0.6 per cent. figure. New industries are included, but that does not invalidate the work being done. None the less, what I said in my statement holds true, and we are encouraging the Commission to take a robust approach with every single member state.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o84"><a name="60629-0007.htm_para1"><a name="06062974000384">The hon. Gentleman asked about auctioning, but I believe that he was a little confused. As I mentioned in my statement, the auctioning figure is 7 per cent. The hon. Gentleman rather churlishly said that it was some evidence of progress, but given that the maximum was 10 and that the current level is zero, 7 per cent. is a pretty good whack at making the auctioning system work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o85"><a name="60629-0007.htm_para2"><a name="06062974000385">The hon. Gentleman also asked where the benefits will go. As I said in my statement, I view the environmental transformation fund as critical for non-nuclear carbon technologies of a range of different kinds. He made a perfectly valid point about ensuring that it is properly integrated with the excellent work of the Carbon Trust and other organisations. As I said, we will set out the details in due course in the spending review and we will certainly ensure that there is proper integration.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o86"><a name="60629-0007.htm_para3"><a name="06062974000386">The hon. Gentleman then asked about compensation for the most internationally exposed sectors. As I tried to explain, our approach to the whole ETS system is that we allocate to internationally competing sectors on a business as usual basis. It is precisely because of the insulation of the electricity supply sector from international competition and the liberalised nature of the market, which is intended to drive down prices, that we have said that the burden of carbon reduction should be borne by that sector rather than by the internationally competitive sector. The compensation issue does not therefore arise.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o87"><a name="60629-0007.htm_para4"><a name="06062974000387">Annual reporting is another issue. As the hon. Gentleman knows, my predecessor made a commitment to start it next year and then carry it out annually, so I can confirm that point. He legitimately asked about aviation. I had thought that the issues were complicated enough without getting into that matter, but it is very much on the table and the Government are fully committed to including aviation in the scheme. The Commission has made it clear that it wants to come forward by the end of the year with proposals for how to include the aviation sector in the scheme. It certainly represents a good step forward.</p>

 Does my right hon. Friend agree that, although it is a hideously complex area, it must be translated for general public as very good news for the environment? For anyone deeply concerned about global warming, it is indeed good news. Does the Secretary of State agree that seeing evidence of the DTI and DEFRA working together is also good news?

 I can reassure my hon. Friend on all three points. It is good news for the environment and also for the economy. The opportunities for business development in renewables and other low carbon technologies are significant. We must not forget the importance of our manufacturing sector, but we also have a growing environmental technology sector. At the last count, I think that it was worth about 400,000 jobs. I certainly concur with my hon. Friend about that. As for co-operation with the DTI, I can assure him that we fully recognise how vital it is and that the whole Government are committed to it.

 I thank the Secretary of State for giving us prior notice of his statement. There is indeed a cross-party consensus on the principle of the emissions trading scheme, but it seems from today&#146;s statement that there is a danger that a good idea will be undermined by poor implementation&#151;not just here, I hasten to add, but in other EU countries, too. Only one EU country, Germany, seems likely to meet the legal deadline for the submission of its national allocation plan. Why is it that here in Britain, where the Government affect to believe that climate change is the greatest issue facing mankind&#151;I certainly believe that it is&#151;we are unable to meet the deadline for our own national allocation plan?</p>

Does not that raise the serious question of whether a more objective baseline in the past would have been more sensible than the business-as-usual projections, which have the disadvantage from country to country of being based on far-out projections, which are subject to considerable doubt about the assumptions.</p>

Are the reductions by business as great or greater than those implied for households and individuals by our Kyoto targets? Fairness, not only between our businesses and other businesses but between our businesses and households, is also important. The Secretary of State said that he had spoken this morning to Commissioner Dimas. Did he receive assurances about those matters?</p>

their energy use will save them a lot of money, especially at a time of high energy prices. The second aspect of my statement that is relevant to the hon. Gentleman&#146;s legitimate concern about the role of manufacturing industry is that our calculations show a 1 per cent. base case impact on electricity prices of the decision, over the existing cap. One can live on 1 per cent. so one must not dismiss it as being the same as nothing, but given that it is 1 per cent. over the five-year period and not an annual increase, I think that we have struck the right balance both to grow the economy and protect the environment.</p>

 My hon. Friend raises a really important point about the difference between phases 1 and 2, which relates to a question put by the hon. Member for Eastleigh (Chris Huhne) that I forgot to answer. Phase 1 was characterised by much uncertainty about existing emission levels in different countries. We now have figures for emissions in every country and the European Commission has said that no country will be allowed to set a cap higher than its current emissions level. For starters, we are in a much, much stronger position. Secondly, my hon. Friend makes an important point about independent monitoring and reporting. Our strong view, which we are discussing with the Commissioner, is that we must do everything we can to strengthen the integrity of the monitoring and other systems.</p>

 The amendment repeals section 68 of the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000&#151;the CROW Act&#151;in line with the discussion in Committee. Amendment 111 is consequential; the long title of the Bill must itself be amended because section 68 applies to some land other than common land and town or village greens, so its repeal falls outside the scope of the present long title. Section 68 was enacted during the passage of the CROW Act. It was designed to deal with a problem that had arisen through case law for householders who accessed their homes by vehicle over areas such as commons or greens. Section 68 has now become redundant for legal reasons, and repealing it will avoid any mistaken impression that the section has a residual role. We consulted publicly about doing this and will publish a report in due course on the findings of that consultation.</p>

Not impossibly, a householder might actually prefer, notwithstanding having made a payment, to have the grant of a statutory easement under section 68 than to have it prescribed under common law, because of the problems of producing evidence of the use and of getting his title right. To remove that possibility is also unhelpful to householders.</p>

It is important to remember that section 68 was enacted precisely to address that sort of situation by providing that there should be no vehicular easement to drive over common land, except as provided by section 68. That is an important protection for common land. Why does the Minister want to abolish section 68?

I do not think that anything has occurred to alter Parliament&#146;s view. Following that logic, section 68 is not redundant. The House of Lords does not have the power under the constitution to abrogate a statute. Section 68 of the CROW Act was, in any case, not a pleaded issue in Bakewell Management <i> v. </i>Brandwood. It was not even part of the case. The observations of the House of Lords in that reported judgment, as far as section 68 and the CROW Act are concerned, did not form part of the ratio decidendi&#151;the argument at the end of the case. The contention is that section 68 is not therefore redundant. In fact, it constitutes the only means that the House has provided whereby an easement can be acquired to drive over a common. I hope that the Minister will come back with some more information as to why he believes that what he wants to do is necessary. We all agree with what we were originally trying to achieve, but I am unclear about why it is necessary to abolish section 68 to try to do that. By abolishing section 68, the Minister might be creating more problems than he thinks.</p>

 I am glad to have the opportunity to respond to the hon. Gentleman&#146;s questions, because it is important that these matters are clarified. The section and the regulations made under it were enacted because of the impact of the 1993 judgment known as Hanning <i> v. </i>Top Deck Travel. Before that case, it had  <br>

been thought that home owners who had, for a sufficiently long period, driven across land such as common or green to gain access to their property had acquired a legal right to continue doing so by virtue of prescription or long use. The Hanning case held that that was not the position, on the ground that a legal right to continue doing something cannot be acquired by virtue of actions that involve committing an offence, and road traffic legislation makes it an offence to drive without lawful authority on land that is not a road. In the wake of that case, a significant number of householders around the country were asked to pay large sums of money to continue to drive to their own property over areas such as commons or greens.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o106"><a name="60629-0008.htm_para6"><a name="06062974000460">Section 68 was brought about, late in the passage of the CROW Bill, to provide a means by which the payments necessary to secure easements for this purpose could be capped. I want to stress that. Section 68 was not enacted to prevent prescriptive claims of rights of way. It was enacted to cap any payments that, under previous case law, were required to establish an easement. The subsequent House of Lords ruling in the Bakewell Management case in 2004 overruled the Hanning judgment. It confirmed that in circumstances in which the owner of a common or green could, by granting permission to a householder, have made their use of the land for vehicular access lawful, there is no bar on the householder relying on their actual use, without such express permission, to establish the prescriptive right of access.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o107"><a name="60629-0008.htm_para7"><a name="06062974000461">The reason for enacting section 68, therefore, has disappeared. Where long-standing vehicular use has taken place on land, it is usually the case that the landowner could have given permission for the use so as to prevent its constituting an offence. In such a case, the use would equally be sufficient to create a prescriptive right independently of section 68. If in a particular case, because of some other legislation, it would be an absolute offence to drive across a common or green or to do so in a particular way and the owner has no power under the legislation to grant permission for that use so as to disapply the offence, a right of vehicular use cannot be created at all. We believe that such cases are exceptional, but, where they arise, section 68 has never assisted a householder who has unlawfully been using the common or green for vehicular access and therefore its repeal will not make any difference to that position.</p>

If the particular driving does not cause injury to the green and the owner of the land could lawfully give permission to drive over the land in the way that the householder has done in past, such use will have been capable of creating a prescriptive right under the Bakewell principle. We do not consider that any special provisions are needed for greens. Section 12 of the Inclosure Act 1857 and section 29 of the Commons Act 1876 are both concerned with injury to the green. In our view, whether or not driving across a green in a particular way contravenes those provisions would be a  <br>

matter of fact and of degree to be decided on the circumstances of individual cases. If driving does cause injury to the green, section 68 does not reduce the strict protection greens enjoy, which would prevent an easement from being granted at all. I hope that that clarifies the matter and satisfies the hon. Gentleman.</p>

There is some case law to support that, including a case involving a lady who had a cottage and garden that adjoined a common. Stock entered the garden from the common, causing some damage, but it was found that the owner of the livestock was not responsible for the damage because the lady should have erected a stock-proof fence and maintained it in good enough condition.

 The hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire (Mr. Williams) has detailed the concerns that are prevalent in many parts of Wales&#151;and, indeed, beyond. However, the problem is perhaps more obvious in Wales because it has many urban commons. Such commons, in valley areas at least, immediately abut large population areas.</p>

This point will be of no conceivable political use because voting is taking place today, but I feel obliged to mention what I was told and will do so, albeit with your permission, Mr. Deputy Speaker. The group farms the upland common; with valleys being valleys, people tend to live on the bottom part. People&#151;young people in the main&#151;go up the hills with little 4x4 tractors and scrambling bikes. They pull down fences to gain access, and that is the root cause of the problem because it obviously allows sheep to stray. However hard the farmers try to maintain stock-proof fences, they are unable to do so because as soon as they carry out work, another unauthorised gap appears further down. The farmers face a terrible situation. Some of them told me that they now send far fewer sheep up the hill than before, which is to their own detriment, because of the vast number of problems that occur. However, the public see the situation as a nuisance because straying sheep are a nuisance.</p>

More and more stands of trees are being sold on by the Forestry Commission. The commission had a responsible attitude to fencing in, but some of the commercial concerns to which the trees are sold do not quite have the same feeling about their responsibility to fence. As the hon.

farmers would be brought before the court to testify that they and their forebears had always considered it to be the practice to fence against the common. Indeed, nearly all our upland commons are surrounded by stone walls, some of which are of a considerable vintage, that have long been maintained by the owners of the adjoining land.</p>

I acknowledge, too, as he suggested, that in recent years, some landowners, especially the owners of land that is no longer in agricultural use, tend to presume the contrary view and believe that it is the responsibility of commoners to stop their stock from straying off the common and on to adjacent land. That can sometimes give rise to ill-feeling in local communities when sheep get into householders&#146; gardens. Such problems are especially acute in parts of south Wales and the valleys where the adjoining land is, or was, in industrial use and the old customs are difficult to enforce.</p>

As I understand it, that partly relates to a minority of farmers allowing fences to deteriorate where there is a question over the ownership or responsibility for the fencing. There is also the matter of the fencing being cut by illegal motor cyclists who are trying to get access to open spaces. There is a lack of clarity about the extent to which off-roaders and farmers are therefore responsible for straying animals.</p>

The council is not legally obliged to do this, and it is a financial burden. With this in mind the council is proposing a byelaw to deal with straying sheep. I understand that no definite measures have been decided upon to date. Nor are we clear what powers would be used to make the byelaw or, indeed, whether it would be ultra vires.</p>

 Government amendment No. 1 is a consequential change that is necessary because of amendments that we are making to schedule 2, which we shall come to shortly. The amendment ensures that part 1 of the Bill will apply to land exempted from registration by order under section 11 of the Commons Registration Act 1965. The amendment will have no immediate effect on the excepted commons, which cover about 1,000 hectares and which are listed in the annex to the explanatory notes. However, it will ensure that excepted commons may be brought on to the registers under amendment No. 95. and so help to ensure that the registers are properly comprehensive on what is and what is not common land.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o137"><a name="60629-0009.htm_para29"><a name="06062974000504">Government amendments Nos. 2 to 4 and No. 11 make some minor amendments to clarify references to land in part 1. They ensure that in each place where an amendment is made&#151;clauses 7, 15 and 16&#151;a reference to land is taken to mean the land in England and Wales other than in the New forest, Epping forest and the forest of Dean. This approach is consistent with similar references elsewhere in the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o138"><a name="60629-0009.htm_para30"><a name="06062974000505">Without the amendments, there was a small risk that an application to register a green under clause 15, to vary a right of common under clause 6, or for exchange under clause 16, could cause land to be put forward for registration which was actually already unregistered common land in the areas exempted from registration under clause 5. These amendments resolve that risk.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o139"><a name="60629-0009.htm_para31"><a name="06062974000506">Government amendment No. 12 is a minor and technical provision that secures greater consistency. It removes a redundant reference to part 1 of the Commons Act 1899, which is a form of words not used elsewhere in the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o140"><a name="60629-0009.htm_para32"><a name="06062974000507">Government amendment No. 13 clarifies that the powers to correct mistakes in the register under clause 19 extend to mistakes made under the Commons Registration Act 1965. Given the many mistakes which occurred under that Act, it seems sensible to put the matter beyond doubt.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o141"><a name="60629-0009.htm_para33"><a name="06062974000508">Government amendment No. 15 clarifies that an application duly made under various provisions in part 1, which otherwise complies with any requirements imposed in the Bill or under regulations, must be granted. It makes it clear that registration authorities do not have a discretion to refuse an application other than on the criteria set out in the Bill or in regulations. The amendment does not apply to schedule 2 because the provisions in the schedule already put the requirement beyond doubt.</p>

We have debated the issue in Committee. However, it is pertinent at this stage because there is an issue whereby the nature and character of land could be changed by consequent and subsequent exchanges or releases.</p>

 I welcome the Government amendments, but I would be grateful if the Minister clarified something. In the helpful letter that he sent to most hon. Members&#151;and certainly Committee members&#151;he referred to the changes necessary to deal with the point I made in Committee about common land that was not registered but was common land by virtue of another enactment. Parcels of land have been classified as commons since the 13th century, but for one reason or another, some of them were not registered after the Commons Registration Act was passed in 1965. In Committee, we debated the fact that, as the law stands, they cannot be registered subsequently. Will the Minister confirm that when the Bill receives Royal Assent, all those commons, with the exception of the three that he named, can be registered under the 1965 Act as commons, so there is no doubt about their legal status in future?</p>

 Government amendment No. 95, which we will debate later, addresses the point made  by the hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire (Mr. Paice). Turning to amendment No. 116, clause 16 enables a common or green to be removed from the register on application, usually with the provision of replacement land to take its place. That procedure will replace the current statutory exchange process under section 147 of the Inclosure Act 1845. When the national authority determines such applications, subsection (6) requires that it have regard to the interests of the legal interests in the land, the interests of the neighbourhood, the public interest, and any other matter considered relevant. The amendment would add a requirement for the authority to have regard to the cumulative effect of the proposed release or exchange, taken in conjunction with any release or exchange that has previously been consented to.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o143"><a name="60629-0010.htm_para1"><a name="06062974000513">We would resist the amendment, simply because it is unnecessary.

Member for South-East Cambridgeshire that such matters will be fully taken into account when an application is considered. I hope that with that explanation, the hon.

 These amendments deal with commons that have been partially developed, and I tabled them for two reasons. First, we were concerned that there was a drafting error, but people who know far more about legal jargon than I do agree that there is no such error. Secondly, there is a point of principle. In Committee, in a debate on the apportionment of rights, we discussed carefully what happens when a dominant tenement is sold or split and is partially developed. Indeed, we discussed an example in which one piece of land is developed and lots of individual houses are built on it. The legislation, as drafted, would give all those houses an apportionment of the rights.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o148"><a name="60629-0010.htm_para6"><a name="06062974000521">On reflection, I question whether that is right, so the principal purpose of the amendments is to challenge the Government to explain why the right of common should endure if part of the dominant tenement is no longer used for an agricultural purpose. Commons rights were originally attached to agricultural land, as we discussed in Committee&#151;I shall not repeat all those debates today. Former agricultural land could be completely developed and the rights apportioned so that, for example, there is one sheep per house in a new housing estate. Is that logical?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o149"><a name="60629-0010.htm_para7"><a name="06062974000522">The Minister may well respond that those people will clearly not exercise their right to own a single sheep, and I accept that that may be so, given all the bureaucracy that the Government have imposed on sheep owners. Rights can be transferred under schedule 1&#151;we will come on to that later&#151;but if the owner develops the dominant tenement and decides not to transfer the rights but to apportion them among the properties, difficulties could arise. As the Minister said, we will come on to discuss the establishment of statutory associations&#151;I agree that they should become councils&#151;which brings the issue of rights into play. The logic of the Bill is that all those individual  <br>

owners, with perhaps one or two rights each, will all have a voice even though, in reality, they do not have any agricultural interest.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o150"><a name="60629-0010.htm_para8"><a name="06062974000523">We have discussed many times in the House&#151;indeed, the Minister referred to it himself a few minutes ago&#151;the issue of people who move into a rural area without understanding anything about it. In the example that I gave, however, they could have a significant voice, as they would have to be consulted on the establishment of an association and, indeed, they would become part of it. A welcome later amendment would give preferential treatment to people who utilise their rights but, nevertheless, the occupants of all those houses in the example that I gave would have a say in the establishment of the association, its running and, of course, the management of the commons. I question whether that is right, which is why, despite clarification of the drafting, I tabled the amendments. It is a little late to ask the Minister to go away and think about the issue again, but I urge him at least to reflect on it, and tell the House how he will address the problem that I have identified. When rights are fragmented and many rights owners involved, how can that be dealt with by the management systems and the associations established by the latter part of the Bill? It would have been far better to use a de minimis arrangement to extinguish rights of common in those circumstances.</p>

<p><a name="st_o242"><a name="06062974000524"><a name="60629-0010.htm_spnew5"><a name="06062974001443"><b>Mr. Atkinson:</b>
 I was baffled when we first debated the issue, because those 50 houses might not simply have the right of grazing but other rights, such as rights of turbary. Instead of one commoner having access to peat on the land, 50 of them would have access, which would substantially change the physical appearance of the common.</p>

<p><a name="st_o243"><a name="06062974000525"><a name="60629-0010.htm_spnew6"><a name="06062974001444"><b>Mr. Paice:</b>
 My hon. Friend is right. Our debates in Committee and on Report have inevitably dwelt on grazing rights on commons, but there are many other rights. If, for example, everybody had rights of turbary to cut peat, a whole common could be destroyed by householders digging.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o151"><a name="60629-0010.htm_para9"><a name="06062974000526">The situation is unfair for graziers, because in theory they must individually approach all the house owners to lease back their unused grazing rights that would otherwise revert to them automatically by the operation of the common law extinguishment. That is not in the interests of the commons or of the normal users of the rights of common.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o152"><a name="60629-0010.htm_para10"><a name="06062974000527">The Minister needs to reflect on the matter. I hope that he will accept the amendment, but if he is not minded to do so, will he think through what can be done by regulation to deal with the situation that I have described?</p>

 The amendments relate to clause 13, which abolishes the principle by which rights of common may be extinguished at common law, except where rights of common are surrendered in accordance with the prescribed procedure. They are intended to ensure that the abolition of that principle is confined only to an unlawful attempt to sever rights of common attached to land.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o153"><a name="60629-0010.htm_para11"><a name="06062974000529">The hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire (Mr. Paice) has raised the question how rights of  <br>

common could be apportioned between numerous houses developed on a dominant tenement. It is certainly conceivable that a right of common may be apportioned between numerous dwellings. For example, the commons register may show that farm A has the right to graze 50 sheep. If farm A were sold to a developer, who in turn sold off 50 plots, each of which had a house built on it, each of those house owners would have the right to graze one sheep. We see nothing improper about that outcome. Certainly the owners of those houses are unlikely to exercise those rights, and the constitution of any statutory commons council established under part 2&#151;this important point goes some way to answering the concern raised by the hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire&#151;may well give preference to active commoners against inactive householders. So long as the householders are entitled to the right to graze to one or more animals, they will be entitled to exercise it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o154"><a name="60629-0010.htm_para12"><a name="06062974000530">The hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire has also raised the issue of ensuring that rights of common cease to apply where the dominant tenement is developed. In our view, it is correct to say that the development of the dominant tenement so that it can no longer be used for agriculture would at common law extinguish the rights attached to the land.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o155"><a name="60629-0010.htm_para13"><a name="06062974000531">Clause 13(3) abolishes that principle, and we believe that that approach is both fair and consistent with present practice. The approach is fair, because it would be invidious for registration authorities to decide whether a dominant tenement had ceased to have an agricultural use. Would a house with a grazing paddock qualify to retain the rights? And what if a large garden could be converted back to grazing? The approach is consistent, because the effect of registration under the Commons Registration Act 1965 was inadvertently to break the link between the number of animals which could be grazed on the common and the capacity of the dominant tenement to over-winter the same animals&#151;the principles of levancy and couchancy. It would be absurd to provide that a 1 hectare smallholding could have any number of rights attached to it, but that the same dwelling with only a small garden could have none.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o156"><a name="60629-0010.htm_para14"><a name="06062974000532">I do not accept that that change disadvantages the owner of the common. The common will remain subject to registered rights of common, irrespective of changes affecting the dominant tenements to which rights are attached, which is a perfectly reasonable outcome. Of course, if the dominant tenement is developed for housing, it is most unlikely that the rights will continue to be exercised, which will often be to the common owner&#146;s profit. With many lowland commons now under-grazed, the preservation of such rights will also help to ensure the retention of mechanisms through which grazing could be introduced if required.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o157"><a name="60629-0010.htm_para15"><a name="06062974000533">One of the merits of the registration of rights of common under the Bill is to deliver certainty on the existence of those rights. In our view, it is not helpful if a registered right can be challenged on the grounds of some event happening off register, which means that the right has ceased to exist, although it may remain on the register. I hope that that explanation encourages the hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire not to press the amendment to the vote.</p>

Members will recall that in Committee, in response to a point raised by Conservative peers, we introduced clause 15(4)(d) to rule out registration of land as a green if the land had already been built on at 18 April 2006&#151;the date of the amendment&#151;despite a previous long period of use &#147;as of right&#148; by local people.</p>

Member for South-East Cambridgeshire (Mr. Paice) suggested that the scope of our amendment might be too narrow. He pointed out that a situation might arise whereby a significant construction project had begun on the specified date, so that the parts of the development constructed after that date would not be exempted from registration and might be rendered unlawful if the land became registered. My ministerial predecessor, who is now the Minister for Schools, asked for some real-life examples of such a situation, but to date none has been produced. Nevertheless, we agree that it is probably best to avoid any possibility of such an outcome arising, so wherever construction works had begun on land by the date of tabling the new amendments&#151;23 June 2006&#151;that will rule out registration of any land that is, or will become, permanently unusable for public recreation because of works carried out under the same planning permission. That will prevent registration of the land as a green regardless of whether the initial construction works were on or off the alleged green, because planning permission might cover both the alleged green, and adjoining land that no-one claims is a green.</p>

I regret that the Minister has not been given the concrete examples that he and the hon. Member for South Dorset (Jim Knight) asked for. I have spoken to the individuals and businesses who originally made representations to me, who said that notwithstanding the assurances given by the Minister and his hon. Friend, they were concerned about commercial confidentiality and therefore felt unable to provide examples. I do not necessarily endorse that stance, but that is why it did not happen.</p>

They deal with situations such as those that I described in Committee, whereby a development may have been started but not completed. There could be serious financial consequences for the developer if it was unable to complete a project that was a complete package, particularly if it had laid infrastructure or designed an estate, for example. I do not know whether the Minister has taken advice on this, but I suspect that the amendments will relieve him of the risk of claims for substantial damages from such developers if that had happened. That may have been another factor in persuading him to table them, but whatever his reasons, they are welcome.</p>

Friend the Member for North Shropshire (Mr. Paterson), the precise meaning of the word &#147;construction&#148;. In Committee, we had a discussion about the meaning of the word &#147;building&#148;. Although amendment No. 10 initially refers to &#147;construction works&#148;, paragraph (c) refers to &#147;works&#148;. Most of us can understand what &#147;works&#148; means, but some people might argue that &#147;construction works&#148; can mean physical walls, steel uprights, and so on. Would it include ground works such as digging foundations, the laying of drains, or the construction of security fencing around a site, which is, sadly, an essential precursor to developing a site nowadays? It might cover a whole raft of things. The Minister is conscious of the Pepper <i> v.</i> Hart dictum, which at this stage in the proceedings of a Bill is about all that we can rely on. I hope that he will explain exactly what he means by &#147;construction works&#148; and how restrictive that might be in the interpretation of the wider group of amendments, which in principle I wholly support.</p>

Local people in Calverton made an application for registration of that new green at the back end of last year. The commons registration authority, Nottinghamshire county council, decided not to pursue the registration at that stage as it was awaiting the outcome of the Trap Grounds judgment.  <br>

That judgment is helpful, as is clause 15(4), which suggests that local inhabitants have a claim if they have used the land lawfully for sports and pastimes for more than 20 years. That condition is met. I know Keenwell extremely well; it is a site of some value bordered by an ancient village track.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o173"><a name="60629-0011.htm_para3"><a name="06062974000556">Within the last month, the registration application has been made, and it is a case of &#147;so far, so good&#148;. However, the owner of the land, Langridge Homes, recently said that it had an outstanding planning permission that has lain dormant since 1972&#151;so dormant that the planning authority, Gedling borough council, was unable to find it. A struggle has been going on in Calverton between the local people who made the application to the registration authority and Langridge Homes. That may be the kind of example that the hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire was looking for. Langridge Homes now wants to start developing that land to block the application.</p>

 I am puzzled as to how a planning consent that old is still extant&#151;I should have thought that it would have expired. I was not thinking of that sort of example but of what the word &#147;construction&#148; means in the context of people having already started a development.</p>

 The planning permission is still relevant precisely because it is so old&#151;new legislation that has been passed since then would mean that nowadays such an application would fall. As it is, there is an understanding that there is an existing planning application. It seems to me that clause 15(4), which allows an application where there has been 20 years&#146; usage, is ineffective because planning permission in respect of this land was granted before 23 June 2006. There is real tension and conflict between local people who feel that they have a just claim and a developer that has come along with a planning consent going back 30 years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o174"><a name="60629-0011.htm_para4"><a name="06062974000559">There is a subplot to this. Although at the moment the story is &#147;so far, so good&#148;, it is thought that the developer, Langridge Homes, does not really want to build houses on the site. It really wants to drive a road through the site, across the ancient track, Dark lane, to gain access to a more valuable piece of land, where it hopes to get a large planning consent for housing.</p>

If amendment No. 10 is accepted, those people&#146;s aspiration to establish it as a village green for all time falls. I think that that is disappointing.

Member for South Dorset (Jim Knight), and sending quite a lot of information, I think, to the Minister. I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for South-East Cambridgeshire (Mr. Paice), who has put my point of view. I am pleased by his amendment (a) to Government amendment No. 10, which I nearly welcome entirely&#151;my only worry is that it does not go far enough.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o176"><a name="60629-0011.htm_para6"><a name="06062974000562">If you will permit me, Madam Deputy Speaker, I shall go into some detail on the case of the town of Oswestry, which has major implications for brownfield sites across the country. Oswestry&#146;s population is 37,308, which has grown dramatically by about 11 per cent. in the past 15 years. It has four wards with the highest population density in the whole of Shropshire. On several criteria in the deprivation indicators index, they do not do well. For children&#146;s income deprivation, Carreg Llwyd and Gatacre are in the bottom 30 per cent. in Shropshire. For older people&#146;s income deprivation, Cambrian, Gatacre, Castle and Carreg Llwyd are in the bottom 30 per cent. Carreg Llwyd falls into the lowest 20 per cent. nationally for education, skills and training. I do not want to paint a terribly black picture of Oswestry, but there are opportunities for land development to have a major impact, particularly with regard to health.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o177"><a name="60629-0011.htm_para7"><a name="06062974000563">As I said, I nearly welcome entirely amendment No. 10, but there is one project that it could jeopardise completely. There used to be an Oswestry and district hospital, which was built by benefactors in the 1930s and sadly closed, and many of the promises made about the services carrying on were not met. The primary care trust, when it was formed, had a meeting with me, and set up an inquiry into Oswestry&#146;s health needs, which was widely welcomed. A most ambitious project emerged to build an enhanced primary care centre, which received overwhelming support by a show of hands at a packed public meeting organised by the then leader of the council, Councillor Betty Gull. The centre would collect together all the basic NHS services offered in Oswestry, but additional services would be provided. At the time, there was controversy about a maternity unit closure, but that would be brought into the town. There was also a proposal, which I called phase 3, to build a 60-bed nursing home, which would also benefit the town hugely.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o178"><a name="60629-0011.htm_para8"><a name="06062974000564">The site involved is known as the Five Acre site, right in the middle of Oswestry, which used to be the shunting sidings and approach to Oswestry station. Oswestry had been the headquarters of the Cambrian railway, which closed in the 1960s. It had had substantial workshops, and it was one of the town&#146;s major employers. The site has been a ghastly derelict eyesore ever since. It is on the main approach to Oswestry, and there are a lot of self-seeded willows and elders, as well as a large amount of scruffy rose bay, willow herb and substantial amounts of rubbish, litter and supermarket bags blowing around. Since the railway closed, however, the site has been used by the inhabitants of Oswestry as a place to walk. The issue of what should happen to the land has been one of real controversy.</p>

spent &#163;2.4 million regenerating the station building, and intends to spend about &#163;2 million on remedial work on the Five Acre site, with a further &#163;1.3 million of transport works attached to the site. The primary care centre would cost &#163;5 million, and the nursing home, which would also have free-at-the-point-of-use maternity and community beds would cost about &#163;8 million. Extra housing costing about &#163;3 million would be provided,  as well as live-and-work units worth &#163;1 million. The cream on the cake is a plan to revive the old Cambrian railway as a heritage railway, which would cost about &#163;11 million. That brings the total to nearly &#163;34 million without even trying. If the railway took off, bringing in a conservative estimate of 60,000 visitors, it would involve spending of about &#163;2 million a year. Bridgnorth, for instance, brings in &#163;8 million a year, and Minehead apparently brings in &#163;6 million.</p>

 I was wondering when I might test your patience, Madam Deputy Speaker, but I thought that it would be helpful for the Minister to have the maximum amount of information.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o180"><a name="60629-0011.htm_para10"><a name="06062974000568">The point is that the whole project, which would be of enormous significance to the town of Oswestry and the surrounding area, depends on the status of the Five Acre site. It was the subject of a village green application in August 2004, which went to a public inquiry last October. The inspector rejected the application based on current law. That whole exercise involved more than &#163;100,000 in legal costs. Clearly, until we clarify exactly how clause 15 will emerge from our deliberations, and what effect amendment No. 10 will have on it, there is some uncertainty. I cannot help adding that the people who put in the application are splendid&#151;they are some of the greatest campaigners for health services, who have been out in wet, filthy weather collecting petitions. On this issue, sadly, they have been terribly misguided. However, we have a wonderful iron age fort called Old Oswestry to go and walk on.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o181"><a name="60629-0011.htm_para11"><a name="06062974000569">If the project is stalled, the worry is that the primary care trust will be under tremendous pressure from other parts of Shropshire, including parts of my constituency, and that the money will go elsewhere, a chain reaction will set in, and all the projects will fall. Advantage West Midlands is seriously concerned that a precedent could be set for other brownfield sites across the country. It makes a good point that such sites are often in areas of heavy contamination and deprivation, which are often the last to be developed. Therefore, they are also the ones with the longest record of use by local residents for casual recreation, dog walking and so on. The problem is that those sites cost tens of thousands of pounds to investigate, and remedial work such as removing contaminants and preparing sites for construction can cost hundreds of thousands of pounds.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o182"><a name="60629-0011.htm_para12"><a name="06062974000570">In that regard, I would really like to hear the Minister&#146;s definition of what is meant by &#147;construction works&#148; in amendment No. 10, paragraph (b). I would also like an explanation of why we cannot revert to the wording of sub-paragraphs (i) and (ii), under paragraph (c), which would be the effect of my hon.  <br>

Friend&#146;s amendment (a) in removing the word &#147;construction&#148;. Do remedial works and clearing trees, rubbish and detritus of 50 years count as the beginning of construction? Does building a security fence, which is the prerequisite of any construction site, count as the beginning of construction works? Does carrying out an archaeological survey count? In some parts of the country, it would be unconscionable to start developing a site without carrying out serious archaeological investigations. Surely, those are an integral part of the whole construction process. If clause 15 does not allow those processes, bluntly, it will make development of those sites across the country considerably more risky and unlikely to happen.</p>

</ul><a name="60629-0011.htm_brev2"><a name="06062974001116"><ul><p class="tabletext">It has the backing of the public who are frustrated by the delay caused by a handful of people who are opposed to the project.</p>
</ul><a name="60629-0011.htm_brev3"><a name="06062974001117"><ul><p class="tabletext">New residential development for which planning has already been given plus a modern health village together with the former Station Building refurbished at a cost of more than &#163;2 million would provide an attractive gateway to the town rather than the eyesore that exists at present and which has meant that some businesses bring clients into the town via an alternative route.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o184"><a name="60629-0011.htm_para14"><a name="06062974000572">Councillor Lloyd was referring to himself at that point. I know that when he takes potential investors into Oswestry he does not take them past that site because it is so off-putting&#151;or was, until a large wooden fence was built around it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o185"><a name="60629-0011.htm_para15"><a name="06062974000573">Similarly, Oswestry borough council&#146;s regeneration officer has said:</p>

In fact since it has been cleared the vandalism in that area has decreased enormously and personally I feel if the area was regenerated, it would boost civic pride, improve the main artery into the town from the North which currently such a would be investor would come along, just promotes an area of misery and poverty not one of vibrancy and vitality.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o186"><a name="60629-0011.htm_para16"><a name="06062974000574">I should like the Minister to explain why the word &#147;construction&#148; is necessary. It makes the definition unnecessarily narrow, unless preliminary work of the kind that I have described&#151;clearing a site, building a security fence and carrying out environmental tests and preparatory work&#151;counts as part of the construction process. Most people would interpret construction in the same way as my hon. Friend the Member for South-East Cambridgeshire: starting with bricks and mortar, and laying foundations. In this instance, that is the easy bit. By far the most difficult part of the project has been getting all the interested parties together.

 The hon. Member for North Shropshire (Mr. Paterson) and my hon. Friend the Member for Sherwood (Paddy Tipping) have given textbook examples of the difficulties that Ministers experience in having to reach decisions of this kind.</p>

I was grateful for his clear acceptance of the progress that has been made since Committee, and of the two development-related concessions that are already in clause 15 in response to proposals of his. Each has addressed the specific problems raised. His amendment (a) seeks a third concession in relation to development interests.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o190"><a name="60629-0011.htm_para20"><a name="06062974000581">Our starting point is that clause 15 strikes a carefully crafted balance between development interests and the interests of local people who have used land for recreation &#147;as of right&#148; over a long period. Having acted to protect construction works that have already begun by 23 June, we are now asked to weaken the requirement still further so that if works of any description have been carried out by that date, the land cannot be registered.</p>

He spoke of the word &#147;construction&#148; and the use of the word &#147;works&#148;. If the construction has begun by 23 June, any subsequent works&#151;not necessarily construction works; they could be repair or remedial works&#151;in pursuance of the planning consent would exempt the land in question if incompatible with recreational use. &#147;Construction&#148; carries its everyday meaning here in relation to building works. &#147;Construction works&#148; is intended to signify that something must have started to be built as part of the  <br>

development, but it would exclude mere preparatory work such as excavating a trench for foundations or ancillary works such as putting up a security fence around the site. That answers a specific question from the hon. Member for North Shropshire.</p>

 I realise that the Minister is working from several different sets of notes&#151;I know how it is; been there, done that&#151;but can he clarify exactly what is within and what is outside the definition of &#147;construction&#148; as he understands it? It might be helpful for the record if he could give any examples of cases in which the word &#147;construction&#148; has been defined in law.</p>

 I shall be as clear and precise as I can, because the hon. Gentleman is right: this is crucial. I wanted to reinforce the difference between the use of the words &#147;construction works&#148; and the use of the word &#147;works&#148; on its own. &#147;Works&#148; would apply, under a later provision in the Bill, to repairs and maintenance rather than specific construction.</p>

I hope that this goes some way towards answering the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Sherwood. They are simply intended to ensure that registration does not constitute an effort to turn back the clock when construction works have already begun. There is a big difference between those two approaches.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o193"><a name="60629-0011.htm_para23"><a name="06062974000586">It would be quite wrong for us to change clause 15 in a way that gave developers carte blanche to build houses on existing greens. That would be throwing the baby out with the bathwater. Land is only registrable in the first place under the clause if local people have genuinely used it for their recreation without permission, without force and without secrecy for at least 20 years. That is the kind of land that our ancient law of custom treats as a town or village green. It would be wrong for planning consent automatically to override that customary arrangement. That is not something changed by provisions in the Bill; it is something that is already part of the law of the land. Whether land has become a green in this way is outside the scope of the planning consideration, and is purely a matter of law.</p>

sweetness and light in North Shropshire. I assure the hon. Member for North Shropshire that I understand the seriousness of his concerns about the way in which major infrastructure developments, affecting many people, could be delayed, or put off altogether, by this situation. I understand that emotions run high&#151;</p>

 I wish that the Minister could give me the same satisfaction as he has given the hon. Member for Sherwood (Paddy Tipping). In my case, the vast majority of local inhabitants regard the land as wasteland, which has been used by custom. Outline planning permission has been granted for the project by the relevant planning authority and substantial works have been carried out. All the surface has been cleared down to clinker, and a large security fence has been built. Substantial legal fees have been paid and archaeological and environmental tests have been carried out. I would have thought that that would mean that construction had begun, because all those activities are prerequisites of the construction process. Putting the foundations and the bricks and mortar in is the easy bit. The difficult bit is what has been done so far. Can the Minister confirm that what I have described is indeed the beginning of the construction process?</p>

 I am genuinely sorry to disappoint the hon. Gentleman, because I understand the concerns of his constituents which he has explained so well this afternoon. Were he from another party I might have accused him of putting together material for a &#147;Focus&#148; leaflet, but it is clear that he has worked hard on the issue in pursuit of his constituents&#146; interests. However, the Bill will not change the legislative landscape in that area and to do what he is asking would be to go too far.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o194"><a name="60629-0012.htm_para0"><a name="06062974000593">The change would mean, for example, that a developer who had dug an exploratory hole in the middle of the land by the date could press the registration authority to reject any future application for registration out of hand, on the basis that at some point in the future the planning consent over the land might be implemented. Even if local recreational use appeared to meet all the tests in clause 15, there could be no viable application to register the land because that single hole had been dug. We do not think that that can be right. Nor did we feel when we looked at this issue that we could exempt land from registration only if the pre-construction works had been substantial. We did consider including an indicator such as &#147;substantial&#148;, &#147;significant&#148; or some such wording. However, using such language would clearly reduce the clarity of the clause, and we have not had drawn to our attention any real-life cases where substantial pre-construction works have in fact been undertaken on land that is likely to be eligible for registration as a green based on past use.</p>

 We have made it clear that we are not prepared to countenance an unrestricted reopening of the registers under the Bill. We had an interesting discussion in Committee, and subsequently, on whether there should be a review of inflated rights registered under the Commons Registration Act 1965. Schedule 2 makes limited provision both to add land to the registers and to remove land; that is a careful balance, which the new Government amendments maintain.</p>

Gentleman was concerned that land could have been omitted from registration under the 1965 Act, even though, by virtue of some statutory provision, it was beyond doubt common land or green.

Friend the Member for Sherwood (Paddy Tipping) and his correspondent, Mrs. June Perry. For example, in cases where an earlier statute may have defined the extent of a common in a plan deposited with the House authorities during the passage of the corresponding Bill through Parliament, part, or all, of the lands defined in the plan were overlooked and not registered under the 1965 Act. I believe that just such a case&#151;at Monken Hadley common, in Hertfordshire&#151;was identified by Mr. William Pumfrey in correspondence with the hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire.

That approach is consistent with the way things are dealt with elsewhere in part 1.

Amendment No. 95 is especially important, as it applies to the common in which Mr. Pumfrey has a particular interest. I apologise to the Minister for my earlier, slightly senile moment, when I discussed that amendment in connection with an earlier group.

 I rise to support the amendments, but I want to press the Minister about the need in due course to produce regulations dealing with submitting notification of transfers and keeping the registers up to date.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o217"><a name="60629-0012.htm_para23"><a name="06062974000686">At present, the registers record the existence of common rights, but not who owns them. If the rights were not registered in 1965, they have ceased to exist. The problem is that there is no register of who owns common rights. The registers reflected the position in 1965 but they have not been updated since, and numerous transfers and sales of rights have taken place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o218"><a name="60629-0012.htm_para24"><a name="06062974000687">The Bill does not really improve the situation. After reflecting and consulting widely on the matter, I entirely accept that we cannot reopen the registers. Like his predecessor in Committee, the Minister is right about that. Although there are many injustices because the registers were not reopened, I am now convinced that as many new injustices would arise if we reopened them and tried to correct the mistakes. Too much time has passed, and it is no longer possible to do anything about it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o219"><a name="60629-0012.htm_para25"><a name="06062974000688">However, in respect of notification, the Government assert that, if information on ownership is required, it is a simple matter to search the dominant tenement, as detailed in the registers of common rights. That search can be carried out at the Land Registry, but I stress to the Minister&#151;I think that his officials know this already&#151;that that is a very cumbersome process for several reasons. First, the field numbers detailed in the commons registers are no longer used, so it is difficult to identify the dominant tenement without considerable research. Secondly, numerous searches of the Land Registry would have to be made, one for each entry on the commons registers with rights attached to land. Thirdly, searches of the Land Registry would have to be repeated every time that a list of owners was required, as there is no process for keeping the &#147;live&#148; register updated. Finally, the costs of collating information would be burdensome on the party that needed it. Sometimes, that would be the Minister&#146;s Department, but on other occasions it would be English Nature when it was undertaking conservation work, or commoners wishing to enter agri-environment schemes or form commons associations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o220"><a name="60629-0012.htm_para26"><a name="06062974000689">The Government argue that there can be only one definitive record of ownership. If there were more than one record of that, they ask, which would take priority if there were inconsistencies between the Land Registry and the commons register entries? Their reasoning is undoubtedly correct, but that should not prevent them from making it a requirement that transfers of rights must be notified to the relevant local authority, perhaps accompanied by a certificate from the Land Registry. The commons registers would not be proof of ownership&#151;only the Land Registry documents could provide that&#151;but they would at least be worthwhile, because they would contain useful documents about where ownership truly lay.</p>


<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060629/debtext/60629-0013.htm"/>



<p><a name="stpa_o221"><a name="60629-0013.htm_para0"><a name="06062974000690">The problem is that, without up-to-date records of the ownership of rights, the proper management of commons is very difficult. Owners cannot be consulted on entry to agri-environment schemes, breaches of rules cannot be identified easily, and consultation on works such as construction or fencing cannot be undertaken  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="29 Jun 2006">

properly. Moreover, the lack of up-to-date records makes consultation on the formation of statutory commons councils or associations very difficult.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o222"><a name="60629-0013.htm_para1"><a name="06062974000691">In conclusion, I want to make the following suggestion&#151;that the regulations that I hope that the Minister will make will encourage the notification of transfers. The Land Registry will continue to be the bible of who owns what, but I hope that the Minister will assure the House that he will bring in regulations providing for some sort of notification system when rights are transferred. That notification could then be placed in the commons registers, so that we would have a more up-to-date record of who owns the land. That would make consultation, and all the other things that I have mentioned, much easier.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o223"><a name="60629-0013.htm_para2"><a name="06062974000692">I hope that the Minister will be minded to do what I suggest. I am not looking for firm guarantees today, but I also hope that he does not give me a firm put-down. I accept that this matter is not the top priority, and that he may have other regulations to make first, but I hope that he will say that he at least sees the merit of my proposal and considers that it could be worthwhile. I should like a guarantee that he will consult about it in the next year to see whether it has legs. If he finds that it does have legs, I shall give him my full backing&#151;even though he can run a lot faster than I can these days.</p>

Member for Penrith and The Border (David Maclean) has worked hard on this issue, and I fully support what he said. There would be a problem if we reopened, wholesale, previous bad registrations but I should like to detail one burning issue, a matter I raise not just now, having done so on Second Reading and, with others, in Committee.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o225"><a name="60629-0013.htm_para4"><a name="06062974000695">Like the hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire (Mr. Paice), I support the Bill. There is much to commend it. But I think it misses one or two points.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o226"><a name="60629-0013.htm_para5"><a name="06062974000696">One bad example of a situation that the Bill cannot rectify&#151;the Minister will correct me if I am wrong on this&#151;is the case of common land CL 79, relating to Melinbarhedyn, near Machynlleth in mid-Wales, an example given to me by the National Farmers Union of Wales. Because of the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000, the Countryside Council for Wales was responsible for mapping common land and open-access land. The CCW took the information held by Powys county council on the common land register. The mapping exercise, when completed, allowed the divisional office in Llandrindod Wells to overlay the common land maps on the integrated administration and control scheme&#151;IACS&#151;information that it held for subsidy purposes for farmland.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o227"><a name="60629-0013.htm_para6"><a name="06062974000697">As a result, farmland that had been bought and sold as freehold land for hundreds of years is now showing up as registered common land. That land is enclosed and has been improved by the owners. Over the years, many farmers have received agricultural grants to improve it, grants that were not available for use on common land. The farmers concerned hold title deeds, of course, and official searches were carried out showing when  <br>

ownership had changed. None referred to common land. They did refer to &#147;open sheepwalk&#148; and &#147;open sheepwalk, now fenced&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o228"><a name="60629-0013.htm_para7"><a name="06062974000698">In the 1960s, when the commons register was reviewed, it appears that the Ramblers Association registered the area as common land, and as no one objected the registration stood and remains on the register today. I understand that the Ramblers Association registered a lot of land in this way, and if the claim was challenged, the association withdrew the registration without opposition. I know that to be true because I was in practice when the Commons Registration Act 1965 was having its impact in mid, north and south Wales and in Shropshire. The question is why the landowners did not object to registration. The common-sense answer is that they had no reason to do so, because their title deeds gave them absolute, unfettered ownership without encumbrance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o229"><a name="60629-0013.htm_para8"><a name="06062974000699">In 1987, some landowners, by now aware of the registration, appealed to the commons commissioners to establish their ownership, and that was granted on 6 February 1987. It appears that they did not then apply&#151;if they could have done so&#151;to have the land removed from the commons land register. The farmers concerned have seen their financial assets devalued, and under the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 the public now has full access to the land. In future, no doubt, boundary walls&#151;dry-stone walls&#151;will have to come down to allow as much access as is necessary.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o230"><a name="60629-0013.htm_para9"><a name="06062974000700">The important point is that as agricultural subsidies move to hectarage payments, as we know they are, the loss of that farmland is affecting payments. The farmers have no rights registered in the land, so no headage is attributed and no payments are offset by the divisional office on the land. Yet the farmers ask why they should register rights for commons in the circumstances that I have described. The divisional office required sight of the deeds; it has been done and there has been no change.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o231"><a name="60629-0013.htm_para10"><a name="06062974000701">I understand, incidentally, that Powys county council has used the term &#147;sheepwalk&#148; as an indicator of &#147;waste of the manor&#148;, which it uses to determine common land. The farms concerned were all part of the same estate and had grazing on the same part of the sheepwalk, which was an open upland area. As I have already said, it was enclosed prior to the current ownership. One farm has more than 46 hectares. It follows from what I have said that the current arrangement is a great problem, conundrum and a matter of great concern to the relevant landowners. It appears that the land was incorrectly registered and unless there is an opportunity to deregister, the land itself will be undervalued and, more importantly, there will be a massive loss of subsidy in the future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o232"><a name="60629-0013.htm_para11"><a name="06062974000702">Four families are involved in this particular case: Mrs. Jones of Barhedyn, Mr. Morris of Ty Coch, Melinbarhedyn, Mr. Lewis of Cefnbarhedyn and  Ms Jones of Rhiwgreafol. <i> Hansard </i>will no doubt enjoy that. I should not really say it, but I see that there is a Welsh speaker taking notation for <i> Hansard</i>, which, in the circumstances, is a jolly good thing! It is a serious matter, however. I have to say that both the Minister and his predecessor have been very helpful with the Bill. It was useful to serve in Committee because reasonable arguments were put on both sides, and I believe that people listened to them.</p>

I am not saying that it goes on everywhere, but there are many other examples. The farmers are not in a position to go to the High Court; in these circumstances, it would not be the right avenue to follow. I am not sure, though, what possible avenue they have. In other circumstances, there is the option of going to the High Court for some form of rectification, but it is not appropriate in this case. I urge the Minister to reflect on whether anything in the Bill will assist these people, who are desperately worried&#151;and understandably so. I am sure that in due course the Minister will provide his reasoned response to my plea.</p>

 First, I wholeheartedly agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Sherwood (Paddy Tipping) when he thanked my officials for the way in which they have dealt with all matters relating to the Bill. His words were greatly appreciated by me and, I am sure, by them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o234"><a name="60629-0013.htm_para13"><a name="06062974000705">At risk of placing my own position in peril, may I say that I often see merit in the words of the former Opposition Chief Whip, the right hon. Member for Penrith and The Border (David Maclean) and that I am not averse to seeing merit in what he said on this occasion? I do not know whether the right hon. Gentleman has seen the briefing on the Commons Bill, which identifies the ownership of rights of common. I hope that it explains, to some extent at least, why we cannot adopt wholesale and simply the approach that he has commended this afternoon.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o235"><a name="60629-0013.htm_para14"><a name="06062974000706">The issue of the register failing to show who can exercise rights of common is an important one. Traditionally, rights of common are attached to land, typically a farm, and those rights may be exercised by the landowner. That means that most commoners have strong connections with the common, because they occupy farms that neighbour it. The Bill preserves and reinforces that connection by banning severance and by providing that the registers are conclusive evidence of the attachment of the rights to land.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o236"><a name="60629-0013.htm_para15"><a name="06062974000707">The Bill does not enable owners of such land to register their personal entitlement to exercise rights, because that entitlement is the inevitable consequence of their owning the land.

However, we acknowledge that it would be helpful if the register showed who is entitled to exercise rights.</p>

Perhaps he cannot make it compulsory or insist on it in every case, but if the matter is left so that a commoner may attach the information if he feels like it, it will not happen.

 I recognise the strength of the right hon. Gentleman&#146;s argument. I was trying to explain that we are considering whether to provide in regulations that the commoner need not be consulted on a matter affecting the common if personal rights have not been registered. That is a powerful incentive. It is not simply asking people to register, but providing a carrot. I am not committing the Government to that now but we are considering it. We shall give it further consideration when we frame the regulations. I hope that that goes a long way to answering the right hon. Gentleman&#146;s points.</p>

Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy (Mr. Llwyd) spoke with great passion and knowledge about the case of many of his constituents and the errors resulting from the Commons Registration Act 1965. As he acknowledged, it is impossible to say how many errors the registers contain, not least because there is currently no legal mechanism to deal with them and therefore no obligation on the registration authority to record them systematically.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o239"><a name="60629-0013.htm_para18"><a name="06062974000712">However, the mapping of open country and registered common land for the purposes of the statutory right of access under the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000, which the hon. Gentleman mentioned, has brought into the open hundreds of alleged errors, some of which have been taken to appeal under the Act, although it is not possible for appeals to deal with wrongful registration. That is why schedule 2 provides for deregistration of some wrongly registered commonly land. I cannot say whether those provisions will apply in the specific cases that he has described&#151;that would be for a tribunal to judge in due course. It would be imprudent and wrong of me to try to make a judgment. However, if he wishes to write to me with details of those cases, I shall try to be as helpful as possible.</p>

 I welcome this group of amendments unreservedly. As the Minister knows, I proposed them in Committee so I am delighted that the Government have come round to that way of thinking, especially because, as the hon. Gentleman rightly says, it is also the view of the stakeholders. The purpose was to get rid of the confusion that would have occurred between statutory and voluntary associations, and although a variety of terminology was bandied about, the obvious word was councils. A commoners council already works successfully on Dartmoor, so I welcome the proposal.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o244"><a name="60629-0013.htm_para23"><a name="06062974000724">One of the Government&#146;s reservations about my proposal was that it would require the large number of amendments to which you referred, Madam Deputy Speaker, and that the Opposition might at a later date use that to accuse the Government of not getting their legislation in order. I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for Romford (Andrew Rosindell), the Opposition Whip, will record that on this occasion I promise not to chide the Government for tabling such a large number of amendments, because they concur entirely with those I tabled in Committee and I welcome them.</p>

 I, too, welcome the amendments. As the hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire (Mr. Paice) said, they get rid of the confusion that could arise between the statutory bodies to be set up under the Bill and the voluntary associations that the Minister&#146;s predecessor anticipated would continue to have purposes and functions in the future. The amendments will be an excellent resolution of that problem; they will give people greater clarity about what is a statutory and what is a voluntary body, which can be only to the good and will simplify the management of commons.</p>

Commons councils will have functions relating only to the management of agricultural activities, vegetation and common rights. The views of those actively exercising rights of common are extremely important as they are the persons able to influence the management of the common. Our amendment will require the Secretary of State, or the National Assembly in Wales, to attach more weight to the views of active commoners when considering representations from those with common rights.</p>

Amendment No. 23 is extremely sensible. It shifts the balance, as the Minister said.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o255"><a name="60629-0014.htm_para0"><a name="06062974000741">It might help, however, if the Minister would say precisely how he envisages the provision operating. I do not think that he intended those using the rights to have a right of veto, but has he had any discussions about how he would apportion more weight to them, particularly&#151;I shall not reopen an earlier debate&#151;given that non-users but holders of rights may vastly outnumber those who exercise their rights? There may only be two or three people who exercise their rights; there could be dozens or&#151;as in the example of development that I used earlier&#151;tens if not hundreds of people who hold rights but do not exercise them. It would be useful if the Minister explained in more detail how he envisages that balance working out, bearing in mind what could be a considerable numerical imbalance.</p>

<p><a name="st_o298"><a name="06062974000742"><a name="60629-0014.htm_spnew1"><a name="06062974001522"><b>Mr. Atkinson:</b>
 Now that we are on the right amendment I shall ask the Minister a few questions, although my right hon. Friend the Member for Penrith and The Border (David Maclean) has shot most of my foxes. Like my right hon. Friend, I would like an idea of how the Minister or the Government will interpret this provision. I raise this particularly because in my constituency I have a large number of grazed commons, and at the moment they are extremely well organised. One of the biggest, Allandale common, has a stintholders&#151;people with common rights&#151;committee, and they run the common extremely efficiently, despite some difficulties that Natural England or English Nature have been presenting them with recently over the issue of fencing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o256"><a name="60629-0014.htm_para1"><a name="06062974000743">The stintholders are anxious to know whether their stintholders committee would simply be seen to continue to exist in its current form as a committee, or whether it would be preferable for it to translate itself into a council; and whether, if it translated itself into a council, people other than the stintholders&#151;those who have direct common rights&#151;would have a right to be involved in the management of that council--that is, other local organisations, or ramblers, who might consider that they have a right to access that common. A fuller explanation of how the Government intend to work this would be appreciated.</p>

 Amendment No. 23 is an important amendment and I congratulate the Minister on listening to the representations made in Committee. It is important that those who earn a living from the land should have more say on how the commons are managed than those who are just living in the area. There is an increasing tendency these days, as farming declines and particularly some of the small farms at the foot of the hills decline, for them to be bought out by offcomers like myself, as they would say in Cumbria&#151;a large number of people who do not earn a living from the land but are buying up farmhouses or farms; and suddenly, one discovers that one has some extraordinary rights of common.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o257"><a name="60629-0014.htm_para2"><a name="06062974000745">I think&#151;I can only say &#147;think&#148; because I am not certain; it is my negligence&#151;that for the past 10 years I owned some rights to cut peat on Mungrisdale common. I did not exercise them and I have sold that house now, so I shall not be exercising them, but it is not too far-fetched to imagine a situation where so many of us who are not practising farmers buy houses  <br>

or land&#151;we buy our quaint little bit of old England&#151;and then we want to freeze things in aspic. We do not want to let modern farming practices continue and we do not want to see sheep around, breaking into the garden. We do not want grazing. We do not want this or that. It is important that the minority, in some cases, who may be actually carrying on the practice of farming the commons, and managing them and keeping them in their current condition, have a much greater say in how they are run than those people who just buy a bit of land and suddenly find that they have a grazing right, a peat-cutting right or a heather-burning right and do not intend to do anything with it. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o258"><a name="60629-0014.htm_para3"><a name="06062974000746">Again, I know that the Minister cannot be specific about what weight he will attach to five representations from one side and 10 from the other. He cannot be formulaic about it, but we need assurances on the mechanics of how he will listen more to the views of practising commoners, rather than those who have merely acquired a piece of land. That is probably going to be an increasing problem that we face in rural England in the management of commons over the next few years.</p>

 I also agree that the amendment is important. It redresses the balance that appeared to be out of kilter in the initial wording&#151;according to one view, at least. Many people will welcome the amendment. As the right hon. Gentleman said, it is vital that the voice of people who make a living from the common be heard clearly. Of course, it is a balancing exercise, because many other interests are involved. The amendment redresses what was perceived to be an imbalance at the beginning. I would be interested to hear the Minister&#146;s response to the various points that have been raised, but I welcome the Government&#146;s amendment.</p>

 First, I would like to address  the remarks from the hon. Member for Hexham (Mr. Atkinson), who raised the issue of voluntary associations. The Bill has no effect on existing voluntary associations. Where such a body is working well, there is no need for any change. However, where a commons council is established on a single common or a small number of commons, we would expect that the council might replace any existing voluntary association. That would be a decision for those running the voluntary association and not one that would be taken by the national authority.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o259"><a name="60629-0014.htm_para4"><a name="06062974000749">Where a larger commons council is established&#151;for example, covering several commons in an area&#151;it is entirely possible that voluntary associations might continue to exist and to have a role in the day-to-day work on an individual common. Rules about management would be made by the statutory body and the voluntary association would have to abide by those rules in carrying out its operations. Dartmoor is a good example. Voluntary commoners associations exist on many of the commons, but management of the commons is governed by rules made by the Dartmoor commoners council. I envisage that as the sort of relationship that could and should develop.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o260"><a name="60629-0014.htm_para5"><a name="06062974000750">The wider questions were about trying to give a feel to how one would arrive at the judgments and the relative weight that would be given to the active and inactive commoners. Primarily, I am here as Minister for biodiversity. The Bill is about land management and the improvement of our common lands. When considering whether to establish a commons council, the national authority will consider the local circumstances. Where there are numerous inactive commoners, with no interest in the common, the national authority will pay greater regard to any active commoners. Similarly, the inactive commoners would be given few&#151;or fewer&#151;voting rights, compared with the active commoners.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o261"><a name="60629-0014.htm_para6"><a name="06062974000751">We need to retain the flexibility to respond to local circumstances. On an agriculturally active common, it would not make sense for inactive commoners to be given an equal say in whether a council should be established, or equal voting rights if one were. However, where there is no agricultural activity on a common, it may be right for inactive commoners to have a stronger representation. The amendment will retain that flexibility, which I believe is inevitable and right, but will ensure that, where they exist, active commoners will have a greater role and that the national authority will be able to look to the essential purpose&#151;</p>

 Would I be right in presuming that the actual framework will be subject to regulation? The Minister refers to a differential in voting rights. Will there be some guidance on that in regulations? I will not press the point at this immediate moment, so if he cannot give me an answer now, no doubt he can do so in writing at a later date. I do not want to put him on the spot, but how will the process that he is describing be rolled out, to use a modern term?</p>

councils, as the Minister has said. In Committee, the then Minister, the hon. Member for South Dorset (Jim Knight), was reasonable and said that voluntary associations will be able to carry out their functions very much as they do today, in the sense that they will be able to enter into agreements on management that would attract funds and subsidies to allow them to fulfil their potential for biodiversity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o286"><a name="60629-0014.htm_para31"><a name="06062974000781">Some commons will want to remain as voluntary associations, while others will want to set up statutory councils. Sometimes, voluntary associations might even want to come together to form a council that would thus encompass more than just one association. In such a case, the powers in the Bill will give such councils a worthwhile way of ensuring that the management of agriculture is of a high standard, that there is a high standard of conservation of nature and archaeological features, and that promoting access is of a high standard. However, it might be more convenient if the associations that formed the council could interpret those principles locally, because one common might require different management from another to achieve the same goals. Amendment No. 122 thus explores the possibility of ensuring that smaller and more local associations would able to carry out such management within the statutory council that encompassed them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o287"><a name="60629-0014.htm_para32"><a name="06062974000782">Amendment No. 117 addresses the situation that arises when there is no known owner of a registered common. The Bill will give local authorities the power to act when someone commits an offence on such a common. The amendment would give local authorities the power to act more positively to promote better management, rather than merely preventing or dealing with offences that may occur. The amendments are probing, but I will be interested to hear the Minister&#146;s response to them because they reflect matters that cause people concern.</p>

 I am rather nervous about amendment No. 117. It may be giving powers to local authorities to exercise functions for which they are not fully up to speed. My local authorities are skilled in many things and they perform the functions currently conferred upon them reasonably well. The idea that they would be able to manage commons, even ones that are not claimed and are not currently identified, and perform some of the functions of the commons associations, with the proper skills and knowledge that some of those associations must have, is rather stretching the point. If the councils in my constituency had to undertake the function and had to get up to speed, I shudder to think of the cost involved in employing the experts that they would no doubt bring in, along with hundreds of consultants, to run a common.</p>

 I reflect upon the point that the right hon. Gentleman is making. The amendment refers to where there is no owner or commons council or association that is in existence. The threat that a local authority might come in and start to manage a common might trigger the formation of an association or council. I do not think that the graziers would want that intervention to take place. The point of the amendment is to provide a safeguard rather than a continuing process.</p>

 I accept the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point. This could be an ultimate longstop. The threat of a local council running a common might produce an order double quick. I do not think that we can build that into legislation. I do not have a strong view on this point; I wish to hear what the Minister says. The amendment may be a step too far at this stage. There are many excellent provisions in the Bill. I am worried about the extent of the briefing that we have received from English Nature. It seems to think that it will be fully in charge of things.

 I am reluctant to break the consensus on the commons. I confess that I have some sympathy with the mover of amendment No. 117, the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire (Mr. Williams). As he rightly said, the amendment is a back-stop. There are pieces of land throughout the country&#151;commons&#151;where there is no known ownership. Commons are an important part of our environment and our landscape. Many of them are sites of special scientific interest. It seems that if no known owner exists, there is a case for management to come in. That management could be provided by the local authority.</p>

Member for Hexham  (Mr. Atkinson) a few moments ago. For example, they may co-ordinate the activities of graziers in managing their livestock to comply with rules made by the commons council. Voluntary associations cannot, and should not, be given free-standing statutory functions. A commons council will be given statutory functions only after following an establishment procedure and consulting interests in the common to ensure that there is substantial support for its proposals.

I should clarify the fact that voluntary associations will not have a formal role within a commons council. Membership of the council will typically be established by democratic election, and it would not be right automatically to appoint a voluntary association to serve on the council, because it will not necessarily represent all commoners. Of course, there is no reason why members of the voluntary association could not put themselves forward for election to the council. While we expect that there will be situations in which commons councils work alongside voluntary associations, they will not automatically consist of voluntary associations, as the amendment proposes. I therefore urge the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire (Mr. Williams) to withdraw his amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o293"><a name="60629-0015.htm_para2"><a name="06062974000793">Amendment No. 117 would enable a local authority actively to manage an unclaimed common. Under section 9 of the Commons Registration Act 1965, which is re-enacted in clause 45, local authorities already have powers to protect unclaimed common land. In that context, protection means taking action against unlawful interference&#151;for example, seeking a court order against caravans drawn onto the common, or dealing with an encroachment. The amendment, however would enable an authority to go further, so that it could manage the land as if it were itself the owner. On the face of it, that seems a sensible step.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o294"><a name="60629-0015.htm_para3"><a name="06062974000794">We support the aim of enabling local authorities to manage unclaimed common land, which is why clause 50 amends part I of the Commons Act 1899 to update existing powers to make a scheme of management for common land and allow management to be vested in the local authority. That is the best approach to managing unclaimed common land. A scheme of management ensures that the authority has clear powers to administer the common in the interests of the local community, but it ensures, too, that the authority has clear responsibilities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o295"><a name="60629-0015.htm_para4"><a name="06062974000795">Making a scheme is straightforward and relatively cheap&#151;a scheme recently made by Forest of Dean district council cost less than &#163;700. Alternatively, it would be open to the local community to seek to establish a commons council for the land, and the local authority could help to facilitate that. The management of the common would be in the hands of the commons council, rather than the authority. A commons council will have all the powers needed to manage common land, even when the owner cannot be identified, and thus ensure that the objective of better management, which I share with the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire, can be achieved.</p>

waste? What would happen if the commoners objected to what the authority had done, or if the owner turned up and wanted the authority to remove the trees that it had planted the previous year? Those difficulties are resolved by schemes of management, but not by the hon. Gentleman&#146;s proposals. I can appreciate his indifference to such schemes, as he may fear that local authorities will not take the initiative to make new schemes. However, we are already committed to advising local authorities on their new powers under the Bill in a circular, which we intend to publish as part of the implementation programme following Royal Assent.</p>

However, we cannot advise local authorities, and we do not think that it would be right to, to dip in and out of the process of commons management, as the amendment suggests, because it must be a case of all or nothing. It is right that authorities can step in, when required, to protect common land, but that does not imply that they have wider responsibilities for that land. If a local authority wants to go further than that, it should make a scheme of management so that everyone is clear about its role and responsibilities.</p>

 I welcome the Government amendments that deal with the issue of the National Trust. Again, we referred to that matter in Committee, where I tabled those amendments. In Committee, the Minister said that the amendments were not necessary, so I am glad that this Minister has acceded to them. Ministers often say, &#147;It is not necessary to include such and such provision, because it is implicit somewhere else&#148;, which usually leads Opposition Members to argue, &#147;If it is not going to do any harm, why don&#146;t you put it in the Bill for clarity?&#148; Ministers usually resist such moves, but this Minister has not done so on this occasion, which is welcome.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o331"><a name="60629-0015.htm_para40"><a name="06062974000835">Amendment No. 114 concerns works on commons, which we debated at some length in Committee and about which the Minister and I have had further discussions. I suspect that the Minister will argue that clause 38 is similar to existing legislation, so there is not a problem. However, I suggest that we should take this opportunity to make sure that there is not a problem in the future. There are obviously far more users of commons than there used to be, including not only graziers, but pedestrians and dog walkers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o332"><a name="60629-0015.htm_para41"><a name="06062974000836">The amendment is straightforward. It is designed to eliminate the problem of people, organisations and commons councils having to apply to the national authority for permission to do temporary or urgent works. The three purposes for which it would be possible to carry out such works are human safety, animal welfare and conservation. However, those purposes would not be sufficient in themselves, because the second part of the amendment adds two further provisos&#151;first, that the works must be urgent, and, secondly, that they must be temporary.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o333"><a name="60629-0015.htm_para42"><a name="06062974000837">We debated temporary works in Committee. The hon. Member for Sherwood (Paddy Tipping) will recall that we discussed electric fencing to keep livestock off roads during the grazing season, and there was some debate about how long is &#147;temporary&#148;. I have not tried  <br>

to specify the period of time and suggest that the matter could be dealt with by regulation, which would allow the Minister to consult before drawing a conclusion. The circumstances in which I envisage the issue of urgency arising involve, for example, floodwater rendering part of a common dangerous for children. There are town commons in my constituency where people roam, and much of my constituency is fenland, which, because it is close to sea level, is prone to flooding. It might be sensible to erect emergency fencing, even if it is that dreadful orange plastic stuff that is used around roadworks, to keep children out of deep water.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o334"><a name="60629-0015.htm_para43"><a name="06062974000838">Other commons may have old pit shafts where ground could suddenly collapse as a result of torrential rain, again creating a need for emergency safety provisions for children and livestock. It is by no means unknown for sheep to fall down into such places. In terms of conservation, there may be a wild plant that is flowering and should be protected until it has set its seed, or a wild bird such as a hen harrier or other bird of prey that is nesting on the ground and needs to be protected for a short period.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o335"><a name="60629-0015.htm_para44"><a name="06062974000839">I find it incredible that in all the examples that I have cited it should be necessary to apply to the national authority&#151;in England, the Secretary of State&#151;for permission to act. I would be very surprised if someone was able to get that permission in a matter of hours, yet a situation involving floodwater or the collapse of old mine workings is certainly an emergency, and there should be an ability to erect something very quickly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o336"><a name="60629-0015.htm_para45"><a name="06062974000840">I cannot pretend that I am standing here in huge anticipation that the Minister will welcome and accept my amendment with open arms, but it concerns a genuine issue. I have bent over backwards in devising it to make it as minimal as possible in addressing the concerns that his predecessor expressed in Committee. It is limited to specific examples but would reduce the need for councils or landowners to seek consent from the national authority without good cause. It defies belief that a council should have to go through this procedure in an emergency, thereby creating a period of risk for perhaps several weeks while the relevant authorities carry out all the necessary deliberations and consultations before a decision is reached. I am not trying to circumvent the need to apply for consent, but merely to allow for a temporary arrangement in an emergency while it is being sought.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o337"><a name="60629-0015.htm_para46"><a name="06062974000841">This requires a sense of proportion and common sense. The Government rightly and understandably want to protect the rights of commons users other than graziers, such as walkers and people using the open access provisions, but I am trying to protect them as well. They could be at risk from some of the situations that I described, and it should be possible to protect them as soon as that is necessary. The same applies to the conservation of flora or fauna.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o338"><a name="60629-0015.htm_para47"><a name="06062974000842">There is no need for me to speak at any greater length. I think that the case is clear, and I hope that I have made it so. I tried to devise an amendment that the Minister would find acceptable and that is relatively minimal while addressing the fundamental problem. It has received support from outside organisations such as the National Farmers Union. I hope that the Minister will understand its importance and be prepared to accept it.</p>

 I am pleased to follow the hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire (Mr. Paice), who stressed the importance of managing the different interests, needs and conflicts in the countryside. I want to press that line of thinking with the Minister.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o339"><a name="60629-0015.htm_para48"><a name="06062974000844">Government amendments Nos. 77 and 78 provide a discretionary power to ensure that clause 38 does not revive controls that ceased under section 194 of the Law of Property Act 1925. The Minister wrote helpfully to all members of the Committee on 23 June 2006. He said that he felt that the amendments were necessary because of one example&#151;Warcop military training estate in Cumbria, in the constituency of the right hon. Member for Penrith and The Border (David Maclean). I know Warcop common, which is an attractive, exciting piece of countryside, and he will know that the MOD manages it well, but there is potential conflict between the MOD&#146;s purposes and the desires of walkers and ramblers in the north Pennines. I ask the Minister to put on record what he put in his letter&#151;that if this discretionary power is used, there will be full consultation by MOD estates. The conflict of interest can be resolved and it is important to do that.</p>

Members will be familiar with the issue, which has run throughout the course of the Bill. When the Bill was first published, 28 June 2005 was not mentioned&#151;the date was inserted in the other place in Grand Committee. The purpose of this part of the Bill is to give people the right to argue that unlawful works should be removed. That is important in the context of the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000, which has been mentioned today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o341"><a name="60629-0016.htm_para1"><a name="06062974000846">One of the Government&#146;s achievements has been the gift to working people of the right to roam freely over open country. All over the country, however, there is unlawful fencing. As I understand the present position, people can make an application for unlawful works and fencing erected after 28 June 2005 to be removed. I know from my direct experience, however, that there is fencing all over the country that precedes that date. For the life of me, although I know why the date of 28 June 2005 has been inserted, I do not understand the principle behind it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o342"><a name="60629-0016.htm_para2"><a name="06062974000847">It is important that the Government are clear about their intent. It has taken landmark legislation to allow people to walk freely in the countryside. That access is being restricted by unlawful works. It cannot be right that people such as me can apply for those unlawful works, which prevent access to parts of the country, to come down if they were erected after 28 June 2005, but not if they were erected prior to that. The Bill has been improved, and its balance is generally right. On that aspect, however, the Government have got it wrong&#151;badly wrong.</p>

so on, I know that the best places for wildlife protection in my constituency are on the live firing ranges at Warcop, with tanks blasting off 120 mm shells a few yards away from where wildlife is happily existing. I am happy to put that on record.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o344"><a name="60629-0016.htm_para4"><a name="06062974000850">There is no great issue of principle between us on what we are seeking to achieve. I pay great tribute to the hon. Member for Sherwood (Paddy Tipping), and when we discussed the matter in Committee, I could not help but conclude that when he thinks of commons it is of the Wimbledon commons of this world and smaller village greens, where it would be absolutely atrocious for people to put up miles of barbed wire fencing. I, however, tend to think of 10,000 acres of moorland in Cumbria, where we sometimes need a wee bit of fencing.</p>

<p><a name="st_o318"><a name="06062974000851"><a name="60629-0016.htm_spnew1"><a name="06062974001542"><b>Paddy Tipping:</b>
 I think of those wild open spaces in the north Pennines. That is why I praise the Government for what they have done to allow people like me, from ordinary backgrounds, to experience it after a century of campaigning. I want that to continue; I do not want unlawful fencing to stand in its way.</p>

 I entirely agree. We do not want unlawful fencing. We do not want those wild open spaces to be cordoned off so that people cannot use them, we do not want miles of barbed wire so that people get tangled up in it&#151;but we do not want people to fall down holes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o345"><a name="60629-0016.htm_para5"><a name="06062974000853">The simple examples that I shall give the Minister are not original; I gave them in Committee. But if the Bill were already law, by this time of the year the Minister would probably have 1,000 applications on his desk from Cumbria alone. Why? If I read the law correctly, at this time of year the bulk of those applications would be for permission to put up a few gates for a few days&#151;a few weeks at most&#151;to separate the sheep from the lambs. Sheep may now be out on the fells with the lambs. They may be nearer to the in-bye land. Farmers will not drive them all into the sheds to separate them; what they will do, at times, is take out a few gates, wooden or steel, put up a temporary pen, and then do some separation work. They will do it when they are doing the lug-tagging&#151;putting the ear tags on. They will find a corner where two stone walls come together, and put up a temporary pen there. That happens every day of every week of the year in Cumbria, and no doubt in other sheep areas.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o346"><a name="60629-0016.htm_para6"><a name="06062974000854">Those pens do not stay up permanently. The common is not fenced off. The pen provides a little sheep fank in which a farmer can work with his sheep for a day, or a couple of days. Then he will take the pen down and move on. That is happening all over Cumbria.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o347"><a name="60629-0016.htm_para7"><a name="06062974000855">We have thousands of miles of stone walls in Cumbria, all built in the 19th century. Some of them look splendid, but most are teetering and a great many have fallen down. Every day of the year a bit of stone wall falls down on some Cumbrian common. If the commoners&#151;the farmers&#151;do not have time to fix the wall immediately, they will stick 10 ft of sheep netting or electric fencing around it. Over a period of two or three weeks they will rebuild the wall, a bit at a time, each day when they are checking the sheep. Those farmers are law-abiding people, but there is no way  <br>

they are going to write to a national authority saying &#147;A bit of my wall has fallen down; may I please have permission to stick up 6 ft of electric fencing?&#148; That is just not going to happen, and those people will be breaking the law.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o348"><a name="60629-0016.htm_para8"><a name="06062974000856">A wet hole may suddenly appear on a common. Again, we are not talking about a village green; we are talking about tens of thousands of acres of moorland and rough fell&#151;some of the wildest, roughest land in the country. There are little bogs and hollows. Sheep fall in, so a farmer will try to fence off a circle around the hole, perhaps 10 or 20 ft in diameter. Given the right-to-roam provisions&#151;which we all welcome&#151;what is the legal obligation? If a farmer goes out one morning and finds a dead sheep in a little hole in a boggy bit of land, does he do nothing to fence it off? Some of the stone walls are very high, particularly when the banking beneath them has been undermined. If a farmer suddenly finds that a stone wall is about to fall down, does he do nothing about it? Or does he go to the farm office, eat his morning snack and start applying to the Minister for permission to fence off the bit of wall for a period? That ain&#146;t going to happen.</p>

 The right hon. Gentleman is presenting a powerful argument. If a stone wall is known to be dangerous and a passer-by is injured, the farmer&#146;s insurance policy will be worthless if he has not taken steps to do something about it.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right. In the management of thousands of acres of common, hazards are posed daily to the farmer, to his animals and to walkers every day. Anyone who walks on the Cumbrian commons will find little pockets in which fencing has been put up around hazardous areas. That is the way in which the land is managed, and, with the best will in the world, those who manage it are not going to apply for notification from the Minister.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o349"><a name="60629-0016.htm_para9"><a name="06062974000859">We do not want whole swathes of common to be fenced off. We do not want to hear the excuse &#147;The whole common is boggy: we had better fence off 1,000 acres in case someone gets stuck in it.&#148; Of course that will not wash. But we do need a de minimis requirement. We cannot invent the details&#151;as Opposition Members, we do not have access to all the lawyers&#151;but I think the Minister should draw up regulations that would permit fencing for human safety purposes, animal welfare purposes and conservation purposes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o350"><a name="60629-0016.htm_para10"><a name="06062974000860">If there is a fire on the heather, it will need reseeding, and a farmer will fence off a few hundred yards for the spring, until the grass grows in the summer. That keeps the sheep off the area and gives it a chance to recover. Those are all day-to-day management practices, and they will continue whatever we say here. I just do not want those simple everyday tasks to be a crime or illegal, because farmers will not apply for licences to do what has been done for hundreds of years.</p>

amendment on this point, and I hope that there is scope in the Bill somewhere for de minimis regulations to set a threshold so that farmers can carry out such tasks without having to apply for permission or a licence to do so. Otherwise, the Minister will be a very busy man.</p>

<p><a name="st_o322"><a name="06062974000862"><a name="60629-0016.htm_spnew5"><a name="06062974001546"><b>Mr. Atkinson:</b>
 I echo the remarks made by my neighbour and right hon. Friend the Member for Penrith and The Border (David Maclean). Our constituencies are very similar in landscape and share a military training area. I can also vouch for how well Defence Estates manages the Otterburn training ranges. They are a first class example of good conservation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o352"><a name="60629-0016.htm_para12"><a name="06062974000863">The Minister may have an escape route, which he will need, because clause 38 is very prescriptive and could cause problems. Clause 40, however, will allow the introduction of regulations, and I hope that he will introduce regulations that will advise on this point. As my right hon. Friend has just said, the everyday activities of hill farmers would put them in breach of some of the restrictions in clause 38. As the hon. Member for Sherwood (Paddy Tipping) knows, the north Pennines are riddled with underground shafts, left by the lead mines. Indeed, one can still travel four or five miles underground in old tunnels, if one knows the way, that were carved in the rock by the lead miners. Sometimes the old shafts open up and are clearly a danger both to livestock and to people who have the right to roam in the area. It is reasonable for a farmer, therefore, to put up some fencing around it. Similarly, there is often bad weather at lambing time, so people put up temporary lambing sheds, either polytunnels, which are not very attractive, or old containers, which are even less attractive&#151;that is farming in the hillsides. It is nonsense to suggest farmers would be in breach of this legislation if they were to do that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o353"><a name="60629-0016.htm_para13"><a name="06062974000864">The question also arises in connection with the maintenance of paths and roads. The north Pennines have a wide network of tracks, some of which get very boggy. On the more heavily used tracks, such as the Pennine way, people divert around the boggy patch and spread the path wider and wider. A farmer may dump some spare stone at that point to create some hard standing and stop the widening of the path, which damages the surrounding landscape, and protect the delicate turf.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o354"><a name="60629-0016.htm_para14"><a name="06062974000865">All the examples that the House has heard today are important to day-to-day management of the land. At the moment, local farmers have to get consent if they want to put up some fencing, and the procedure is extremely cumbersome. In one case, an application to put up permanent fencing to stop animals straying on to an increasingly busy road went through the whole planning procedure and was eventually determined by a planning inspector in Bristol. That sort of thing takes months. I hope that the Minister will be able to frame regulations under clause 40 to introduce a de minimis criterion so that farmers who do sensible things in the normal course of their activities are not impeded or placed on the wrong side of the law.</p>

will pose several problematic legal conundrums. I referred to one in an intervention in the remarks by the right hon. Member for Penrith and The Border (David Maclean). Clearly, no farmer could with any confidence rely on an insurance policy if there was an imminent danger that he knew of and did nothing about. The example given was to do with a stone wall that might be on the verge of collapse, but there are many others, such as to do with disused mine shafts or holes that appear in bogs, all of which are daily occurrences on the uplands.</p>

The point raised is important. In debate in Committee with the Minister&#146;s predecessor&#151;who, I might be so bold as to say, was also a reasonable man&#151;he would not accede on this, which I could not understand because just using the words de minimis without some force behind them does not take us very far. What was said was that the offender could be investigated and taken to court and then the case would be thrown out. That is all well and good, but what about all the time, money and effort that are put into bringing that person to court before it was thrown out because it was de minimis? That is a scandalous way of looking at things. We are making law here; we are making law that will probably last for the next 50, 60 or more years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o356"><a name="60629-0016.htm_para16"><a name="06062974000868">I urge the Minister to consider the good sense of the arguments in this case. He has to do something&#151;through regulation, or however else he might do it. Otherwise, there is a potential problem in this part of the Bill, which, as I have said, would bring it into disrepute. That would be a great shame, because I, along with other Members in all parts of the House, commend much of the Bill, but this is a flaw that we will all come to regret, as with the dangerous dogs legislation.</p>

 This group of amendments has certainly provoked much very interesting debate and raised important questions that we must grapple with.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o357"><a name="60629-0016.htm_para17"><a name="06062974000870">Amendment No. 114, tabled by the hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire (Mr. Paice), would exempt works on common land from the part 3 consent requirement if they are for the purposes of user safety, animal welfare or conservation, and are either urgent and necessary while a consent application is under consideration or will be on the land for not more than a limited period to be prescribed by regulations. Although I fully understand the aim behind the amendment, it would pre-empt the thorough consideration we wish to give to whether any particular types of works on common land, over and above those already described in clause 38(6), should be exempted from the normal requirement for consent under the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o358"><a name="60629-0016.htm_para18"><a name="06062974000871">Clause 43 allows us&#151;subject to the negative resolution procedure&#151;to make such exemptions by order for a range of specific purposes; essentially, they are use of the land for access, recreation or sporting purposes, exercise of rights of common, nature conservation or heritage preservation. These grounds would between them be likely to embrace most of the practical scenarios that amendment No. 114 would address. In addition, we will have power under clause 40 to prescribe fast-track procedures for certain types of works or particular circumstances, if we conclude that that makes sense.  <br>

During animal health crises, there are also emergency powers that may in any event override the need for consent under the Bill, and there may be other statutory powers to act in emergencies that would exempt necessary works from the consent requirement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o359"><a name="60629-0016.htm_para19"><a name="06062974000872">We intend to consult fully&#151;I take on board the point of the hon. Member for Hexham (Mr. Atkinson)&#151;about our approach to the use of the exemption power. It is important to be able to draw on a full range of views and experience before we make decisions on this important issue. We have already indicated that any exemptions we make by order under clause 43(1) are likely to relate to works of a minor or temporary character. Beyond that, we do not want to prejudge the issue by including further provision in the Bill about what is to be exempt.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o360"><a name="60629-0016.htm_para20"><a name="06062974000873">May I just correct an impression that might have been given by the right hon. Member for Penrith and The Border (David Maclean)? There is no question that crimes would be committed. The breach of clause 38 is not an offence; it is a matter for civil enforcement through the civil courts. In the 80-odd years since the enactment of section 194 of the Law of Property Act 1925, there have been no problems with sheep fences&#151;an issue to which one Member referred earlier. Having made those points, I hope that the hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire will withdraw his amendment.</p>

Friends and I have been discussing this afternoon? The examples of what are to be exempted are highly specific, rather than general. It is obviously impossible to say who should erect an emergency fence to protect children from falling into a mineshaft, for example, or to specify particular works. If one tried to list the circumstances in which an emergency might arise, one would be bound to miss some because, by their very nature, such circumstances are unforeseeable. My concern is whether the Minister has sufficient flexibility in clause 43 to do what he suggests he could do.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman puts a question that is absolutely to the point, and the answer is yes, we do believe that clause 43 will give us the flexibility that we require.

So this amendment and the existing clause 43(5) merely give us the option to preserve the exemptions that are already in place, and we see that as entirely proper.</p>

Where all rights of common have since been acquired under any statutory power, such as a power of compulsory purchase, section 194 will cease to apply to that land. It is in those circumstances that we would have the discretion to make an order under this amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o365"><a name="60629-0016.htm_para25"><a name="06062974000880">It will not surprise Members to learn that we have in mind a particular case: Warcop military training area, which is a firing range in Cumbria. The rights of common there were acquired in 2003 following a public inquiry, and the controls on works under section 194 therefore ceased to apply at the same time. There is uncertainty about Warcop&#146;s status, and I share the concern of the Under-Secretary of State for Defence, my hon. Friend the Member for West Bromwich, East (Mr. Watson), that clause 38 could re-impose those controls. Government amendment No. 76 will enable us to address the issue at Warcop. My hon. Friend and I are committed to consulting at a later date&#151;I give that commitment, as my hon. Friend the Member for Sherwood (Paddy Tipping) asked me to do&#151;on how best to address the problem in the light of this amendment, so that there is no interference with the delivery of our armed forces&#146; training needs. It might help if I add that my Department is not aware of any other site where the circumstances would enable an order to be made using the powers conferred by this amendment.</p>

The House will recall from earlier debates that the trust was concerned about the impact of the Bill on the National Trust Acts. I have since met Fiona Reynolds, the trust&#146;s chief executive, and am pleased to say that we have been able to reassure the trust that the arrangements for improved management of commons set out in part 2 of the Bill do not represent any practical threat to its excellent management of its very extensive common land holdings.</p>

amendment does this for both the current subsections (2) and (4) of clause 44, and obviates the need for subsection (5). Government amendments Nos. 79 and 80 are consequential.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o370"><a name="60629-0017.htm_para1"><a name="06062974000885">As I understand it, the National Trust supports the generality of the Bill&#146;s provisions, and the tabling of Government amendment No. 78 leaves it content that the Bill will not prejudice its interests.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o371"><a name="60629-0017.htm_para2"><a name="06062974000886">Amendment No. 121, tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Sherwood, stems from an amendment that we made to the Bill on Third Reading in another place. That Government amendment concerned section 194 of the Law of Property Act 1925 which, as I have already said, is the current statutory provision about consent for works on commons. The Bill will repeal section 194 in due course, but paragraph 6 of schedule 4 makes transitional provision about enforcement under the section until it is repealed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o372"><a name="60629-0017.htm_para3"><a name="06062974000887">Originally, paragraph 6 of schedule 4 provided for any person or organisation to seek enforcement action, in the county court, against works undertaken without authority under section 194 of the 1925 Act. Our amendment in the other place said, in effect, that that did not apply to works undertaken before the Bill was introduced into the House of Lords last June&#151;hence the date. In such cases, the status quo would prevail: that is, that only the district, county or unitary council&#151;in Wales, the county borough&#151;the lord of the manor, the owner or others with a legal interest in the land should be able to seek an enforcement order from the county court. Amendment No. 121 would reverse that change, so that any person could seek enforcement, even against &#147;old&#148; works.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o373"><a name="60629-0017.htm_para4"><a name="06062974000888">We are committed to the principle that, if works are unlawfully undertaken on common land after the introduction of this Bill, anyone should be able to ask the court to take action. I think that that is common currency between me and my hon. Friend the Member for Sherwood. Everyone now has a direct interest in keeping commons open and unspoilt, thanks to the Government&#146;s historic achievement in giving people legal access rights over commons throughout the country. So for the first time, the Bill extends the power to seek enforcement action against unlawful works to any person or organisation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o374"><a name="60629-0017.htm_para5"><a name="06062974000889">My hon. Friend the Member for Sherwood has a distinguished record of personal interest in open space protection and public access, and I fully understand why he has proposed amendment No. 121, but it is about the past, not the future. The issue that it raises really boils down to this question: should any person or organisation be able to go to the court and ask it to enforce against unlawful works that were undertaken before the Bill even began its passage through another place?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o375"><a name="60629-0017.htm_para6"><a name="06062974000890">In practice, the question is not that simple. The Limitation Act 1980 rules out enforcement against works undertaken more than 12 years ago. Moreover, as I am sure my hon. Friend the Member for Sherwood is aware, the effective window for action tends in fact to be much narrower than that, because the courts look very critically at any suggestion that they should make any type of order against works that are more than a few years old.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o376"><a name="60629-0017.htm_para7"><a name="06062974000891">In reality, there is likely to be a limited number of cases in which the amendments would make a practical  <br>

difference to the enforcement position. Our view is that where works were undertaken within the narrow time window and without consent it would not be right for us to open the scope for anyone to seek enforcement action. In the end, those responsible for such works did what they did on the basis of the more limited enforcement regime that then applied. Paragraph 6 as it stands strikes the right balance, and we do not think that it would be just to allow any person to apply to the county court for enforcement action in pre-Bill cases. The situation may, however, be different for future changes to unlawful old works. I hope that that gives my hon. Friend the Member for Sherwood a glimmer of hope.</p>

 In our view, unless national authority consent is obtained, any person will be able to seek enforcement action against the maintenance or extension of unlawful old works. If the practical effect of the new work would be further to impede access, compared with the position before the new work was undertaken, the situation is as set out in the letter I wrote on 11 May to members of the Standing Committee. The letter is in the Library, but I might helpfully quote from it on maintenance of works:</p>

Works of any description will require consent only if they take place on the common, not if they stand on land adjoining the common, for example on neighbouring farmland. The physical boundaries separating the common for adjoining land, for example the wall between the common and the in-by or enclosed land, is customarily the responsibility of the occupier of that land and not part of the common.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o377"><a name="60629-0017.htm_para8"><a name="06062974000894">So, works of maintenance could not require consent.</p>

Firstly, if they remain unlawful nothing in the Bill will change that and maintaining them will require consent as for any other works which restrict or impede access. Indeed the original works themselves will continue to require consent. We have clarified the fact that the appropriate national authority will be able to entertain a &#145;restrospective&#146; application and this is set out in clause 39(7) of the Bill.</p>
</ul><a name="60629-0017.htm_brev4"><a name="06062974000897"><ul><p class="tabletext">If the original works are no longer unlawful (because the time in which enforcement action could have been taken under the Limitation Act 1980 has expired) consent will be needed for maintaining them in the same way that it would be needed for other lawful works.

I have not yet answered it. It has been evident today that the Government have changed a great deal since the Bill was introduced. On the whole, I believe that the changes have improved it. We have had to reflect on the balance of arguments presented to us both in Committee and in the other place.

 I am grateful for the Minister&#146;s remarks on amendment No. 114. It was clear from the comments of all hon. Members that they supported my aim. If I may put words into the Minister&#146;s mouth, I do not think that he entirely disagreed either, but he thought that he could achieve that aim in other ways. Ministers always say things like that. The principle remains that we do not want, and it would be unwise were it to happen, the national authority&#151;in this case, the Minister&#151;to be besieged by thousands of very minor requests to create works that could be dealt with more simply.</p>

I was proposing not just fast-tracking, but no tracking, in that people should be allowed to use their initiative where appropriate in cases of emergency.

I suspect that even the most rabid enthusiast for open access would accept that there are times when common sense dictates that measures must be taken. What is important is that the common sense extends to not having to go through all the ramifications of applying to the Secretary of State for consent to do something. If the Minister accepts that argument and his regulations achieve that aim, I shall be happy. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

 The previous group of amendments dealt with unauthorised works on the commons and the current group covers unauthorised activities, which the Bill defines as unauthorised agricultural activities. For consistency, there should be another amendment to remove &#147;agricultural&#148; from the clause heading. It is interesting that subsection (8) on page 27, which defines unauthorised activities, does not include the word &#147;agricultural&#148;. That is the point that the amendments try to make.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o390"><a name="60629-0017.htm_para21"><a name="06062974000913">Activities, which are not necessarily agricultural, that are detrimental to the qualities that we want to conserve sometimes take place on the common or the village green. If unauthorised or unwise agricultural activities take place, of course the national authority should have the power to intervene. However, activities that are not agricultural could be equally detrimental.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o391"><a name="60629-0017.htm_para22"><a name="06062974000914">When we entered into those discussions previously, the Under-Secretary&#146;s predecessor said, &#147;Oh well, those activities are illegal anyway.&#148; I have tried to find examples of activities that might be detrimental to people&#146;s enjoyment of access or biodiversity that are not illegal but will not be helpful in managing the commons or village greens. They include informal dog racing and other informal sports and activities, which might be acceptable but, if they expanded or their frequency increased, would be unacceptable to people who want to enjoy other informal activities or wish to use commons for grazing and agricultural purposes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o392"><a name="60629-0017.htm_para23"><a name="06062974000915">The amendments would therefore remove the word &#147;agricultural&#148; and thus cover more than simply activities that are associated with agriculture. I believe that the farming community would welcome them because, if they were accepted, the Bill would be perceived to deal even-handedly with everyone who has the interests and well-being of commons at heart. I look forward to the Under-Secretary&#146;s response to those simple amendments, which would add something to the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="st_o333"><a name="06062974000916"><a name="60629-0017.htm_spnew6"><a name="06062974001557"><b>Mr. Atkinson:</b>
 I am suspicious of the amendment because it may extend the clause&#146;s scope and intention far too widely. My ears pricked up when the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire (Mr. Williams) mentioned unauthorised dog racing. In our part of the world, we have an old activity called hound trailing, which is popular in the Lake district and in my constituency. Indeed, we had an international&#151;because somebody came from Cork&#151;hound trail meeting the other Saturday, which was a good occasion. The amendment would catch that because the event takes place across a common.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o393"><a name="60629-0017.htm_para24"><a name="06062974000917">I can envisage problems with informal, sensible activities on the village green that could be caught by the amendment. What about an impromptu football kick-about? What about flying a model aircraft or simply having a party? The amendments risk being far too draconian. As I understand it, authorised activities are a matter for the slightly sinister organisation referred to in the Bill as the &#147;appropriate national authority&#148;&#151;a Kafka-esque sounding body. If something is not authorised by the appropriate national authority, the activities that I mentioned could be caught by the amendment. It could have an unintended consequence of stopping people&#146;s legitimate enjoyment of village greens.</p>

 The amendments would considerably broaden the existing power in the Bill for the national authority to deal with unauthorised agricultural activities, extending it to cover all unauthorised activities. The power in the clause is intended as a power of last resort to deal with difficult agricultural problems that are damaging the common and cannot be resolved by other means. It is deliberately focused to address problems such as rights&#146; holders who may exceed the number of animals that they are allowed to depasture on a common, who are engaging in unauthorised cutting or removal of vegetation or are not removing animals during periods when the common should be cleared of livestock. We do not want to expand the power to encompass a large number of non-agricultural activities that can already be more effectively tackled locally.</p>

References in the Bill to Natural England are to be taken as references to English Nature until that body is formally dissolved. The amendment ensures that the provisions function effectively in relation to the commencement of section 1 of the Natural Environment and Rural Communities Act 2006, because, at present, clause 57 refers to the commencement of section 1. However, that gives rise to some uncertainty, because section 1 has already been commenced to the extent of establishing Natural England as a skeleton body. The amendment makes it clear that the transitional provision has effect until English Nature is abolished on the commencement of subsection (4) of section 1, which we expect to take place on 2 October this year.</p>

In his response of 24 May 2006, Sir Martin highlighted the considerable importance of Common Land for a wide range of public interests, justifying significant involvement for Natural England within and beyond the confines of the new legislation. He agreed that Natural England should assume a central responsibility for the management and protection of common land, and of town and village greens, and expressed confidence that this role of &#145;public sector champion&#146; could be achieved without any requirement for a specific statutory duty.&#148;</p>

They should be promoted to the bananas directorate, which I understand involves a nice bit of foreign travel. They cannot go to the Wine Standards Board; that is another good number, but the Department is giving it away to the Food Standards Agency.</p>

It is not just a technical one, and it is not an amendment in the style of my late right hon. Friend Eric Forth MP, who would have always moved amendments of this nature. The federation says that it is strongly in favour of this amendment because it ensures that there is flexibility as to whether or not owners&#146; consent will be required if an order is issued allowing local severance.</p>

In Committee I strongly took the view that this part of the clause should be deleted, that there should be no circumstances where the Government should have this power, and that owners' consent should never, ever be required.

Their concern is to make sure that an order works if and when it is made. Without the amendment, there is a risk that it will not. As the Bill stands, an order allowing local severance is of little value, because it requires the owner of the soil of the common to consent to the transfer and it will rarely be in the owner&#146;s interest to give that consent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o422"><a name="60629-0018.htm_para23"><a name="06062974000954">In Cumbria, severance has been commonplace  for many decades without owner&#146;s consent.

They both have freehold interests. Having one person restricting the property rights of another is quite different from the state licensing the exercise of property rights&#151;for example, through planning laws. It may even be a breach of human rights legislation to give one person the right to interfere with the rights of ownership of another.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o424"><a name="60629-0018.htm_para25"><a name="06062974000956">The Government have tabled an amendment that would deem that consent has been given if it is considered to have been unreasonably withheld by the owner. That is not adequate by itself. In many cases, the cost of fighting an owner&#146;s veto will exceed the value of the transaction to the commoner. From the perspective of the Cumbrian commoners, the absolute requirement for consent in effect turns the clock back to a feudal era. It is inappropriate for the 21st century.</p>

 In many cases, those common rights have considerable financial value in the sense that, if a farm is sold, the common rights are sometimes sold separately. If the Bill is not amended, it will mean that somebody who paid additionally for those common rights could lose a substantial amount of that value when they came to sell them again.</p>

 That is absolutely right. The rights would have little value then. I perfectly respect those who manage our countryside and have shooting rights, but their interests are different from the interests of small farmers and commoners. Quite simply, if I were the lord of the manor and I had the shooting rights, I would be the nasty sort who would veto every single transfer. The rights then become valueless and I buy them up cheaply and improve my own shooting rights. That is a legitimate thing for the person with the shooting rights to seek to do, but the House of Commons should not make it easier for that person by devaluing the value of the rights. If someone wants to buy up the rights of grazing to improve his shooting, let him do so, but let him, or her, do so at full market value. The amendment permits an even playing field. People can buy up the rights if they want to and the owner can sell them at the commercial rate.</p>

 Unusually, I am going to cross swords slightly with my right hon. Friend the Member for Penrith and The Border (David Maclean).

that was not helpful overall. There was a lot of discussion in the other place and that is how the current words came to be included. I fully recognise&#151;as I am sure that he will acknowledge that I did in Committee&#151;that to give the landowner the absolute right of veto is wrong. That is why, in Committee, I proposed moving forward on the basis that, if the landowner unreasonably withheld consent, the Minister should be able to override that. I remain of that view, so I welcome Government amendments Nos. 92 to 94. The question is whether we need to go a step further, as my right hon. Friend proposes.</p>

I should point out to my right hon. Friend that we will be considering few such cases in the future because the Bill is designed to end the principle of severance, rather than to allow severance. The Minister would be required to issue an order before severance could take place. Under the Government amendments, he would then have to consider whether consent had been unreasonably withheld.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o427"><a name="60629-0018.htm_para28"><a name="06062974000962">The Bill already requires the Minister to consult everyone, including the owners of the land or their representatives. My right hon. Friend&#146;s amendment relates to the measure that says that the Minister &#147;must&#148; make provision for whether the landowner has given consent. I am not sure whether the extra step of changing the word &#147;must&#148; to &#147;may&#148; is really necessary. I take the view&#151;this is in some ways where my right hon. Friend and I slightly disagree&#151;that a landowner is a property owner with certain rights. Yes, he would get consulted, but he should have a bit more say than that. I was happy with the compromise that was agreed among the different views in another place, which is represented by the Government amendments, but I am not entirely convinced that the Government would be right to accept the word &#147;may&#148; instead of &#147;must&#148;.</p>

He would also take account of whether the location was an area such as Cumbria, where the landowner&#146;s consent would not be especially relevant, an area on the other side of the Pennines, or a place such as the constituency of my hon.

However, his amendment would give the Minister even more discretion, not less. It is for that reason that I have yet to be convinced of it. I am sure that the Minister will make his views clear. I do not for a moment suggest that we will divide the House if he wishes to accept the amendment, but I am certainly not convinced that everyone in the other place will be happy with it. If the amendment goes forward to the other place, we will have to see what it decides. It would be a pity if the huge degree of consensus on the Bill overall, to which we will refer on   <br>

Third Reading, was lost on this matter, but I fear that that could be the case. I look forward to hearing what the Minister has to say and finding out how he will respond to a tricky situation.</p>

<p><a name="st_o345"><a name="06062974000965"><a name="60629-0018.htm_spnew9"><a name="06062974001569"><b>Mr. Atkinson:</b>
 I speak in support of my right hon. Friend the Member for Penrith and The Border (David Maclean). It was said earlier that everyone has a slightly different vision of what a common is. Some see a common as an urban common, while others would think of a large upland common. My right hon. Friend and I share an identical type of common: large upland commons covering tens of thousands of acres. The situation for such commons is different from that in other parts of the country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o430"><a name="60629-0018.htm_para31"><a name="06062974000966">I agreed with what my right hon. Friend said about the way in which officials have worked hard to try to solve difficult problems, given that every common in various parts of the country has a different culture. There is no doubt that our upland commons in the north have a culture different from others. The difference for those in the north is this business of value with severance, and that is crucial. In normal circumstances, there is a value for a farm with attached common rights, but the value often increases if common rights can be sold separately from the dominant farm. Sometimes the value of the dominant farm will be different. In some circumstances it may be greater now without the commons. In other instances, people may wish to acquire the rights of the common to increase their grazing rights. It is a complicated matter and one where there is monetary value. If we do not accept the amendments, we will be devaluing the assets of farmers who have bought common rights separately as a separate transaction. That is wrong. I do not want to end the sense of compromise that we have, but this is a difficult issue. I would give some support to the amendment.</p>

 Government amendments Nos. 92 to 94 revisit the provision in paragraph 3 of schedule 1 about the permanent severance of rights of common. My starting point is that most grazing rights would never have been severable were it not for the unintended effect of registration under the Commons Registration Act 1965. Clause 9 reinstates the general prohibition on severance. Schedule 1 gives effect to some exceptions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o431"><a name="60629-0018.htm_para32"><a name="06062974000968">On Third Reading in another place, we responded to calls from Lord Inglewood and others to introduce a power for the national authority to enable permanent severance on a designated common by order. In moving an amendment, my noble friend Lord Bach said that the powers were &#147;a reserve power only&#148;. He added that that did not mean that we intended to use them, and said that there were no plans to do so. However, in Committee, the hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire (Mr. Paice) and the right hon. Member for Penrith and The Border (David Maclean), when they were agreeing with each other, sought to temper the requirement that the owner of a common must consent to any individual act of severance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o432"><a name="60629-0018.htm_para33"><a name="06062974000969">We accept the argument advanced in Committee that an owner might exercise a veto for the wrong reasons&#151;for example, to secure a financial inducement&#151;and the amendment enables us to provide in the order that consents must not be unreasonably withheld.</p>

I trust that I will be forgiven if I savour this moment and this amendment and what is going on over on the Opposition Benches. As of this morning, I have had two separate speeches ready for the amendment: one to accept it and one to reject it. I left Opposition Members to struggle out the issue between themselves, to see who could vie most for my attention.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o434"><a name="60629-0019.htm_para1"><a name="06062974000971">The amendment tabled by the right hon. Member for Penrith and The Border would go rather further than the Government amendment. It would give the national authority discretion about whether to include a requirement for the owner&#146;s consent in any particular order. I have listened with care to the arguments advanced by the right hon. Gentleman. He represents the interests of his constituents with great tenacity. He has written to me twice on these matters. The way in which he has presented his case, both in correspondence and orally today, does him great credit.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o435"><a name="60629-0019.htm_para2"><a name="06062974000972">The right hon. Gentleman has made the trenchant point that severance of common rights in the hills of Cumbria is not a recent innovation. As is often the case in those parts, the rights have always been quantified. The law has always recognised that those rights may be severed. Were we to contemplate an order to permit continued severance in such areas, we would certainly want to have a discretion not to require the consent of the owner. That discretion is not available to us as the Bill stands.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o436"><a name="60629-0019.htm_para3"><a name="06062974000973">We remain of the view that there should be a general prohibition on severance. Indeed, the right hon. Gentleman has accepted that we are talking of exceptional circumstances. Should we be minded to make an order under paragraph (3) permitting severance in any locality, we should have a power to impose a condition requiring the consent of the owner to any particular act of severance. That will ensure that severance does not interfere with the proper management of common where the owner continues to take an active interest.</p>

Suffice it to say, whatever the conclusion of the Government and another place, that we all accept that there is an important role for the landowner, but it is right that there should be a power to ensure that it is not an absolute veto. There is not a great deal to be achieved either way.</p>

place for, I hope and trust, their Lordships&#146; final blessing on a complex but extremely valuable piece of legislation that will protect and enhance our common land for years to come. Although my time as Minister responsible for the Bill has been brief, I can now profess to understand the intricacies of hefting and the significance of levancy and couchancy, as well as ancient rights of common such as blacksmut, hedgebote and whitestump. Blacksmut, I hasten to add, is the collection of charred root mould for fuel.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o463"><a name="60629-0020.htm_para1"><a name="06062974001004">The Bill will protect some of our most treasured land in England and Wales for many years to come. Commons are an ancient institution that predate the Norman conquest. Today they remain important in the agricultural economy of upland areas in England and Wales, in providing a vital resource for biodiversity and recreation, and in forming a key part of our landscape. Many of our commons need help, and that is why the Bill is important. It will encourage more and better local management of commons through commons councils, and it will provide new powers to enforce against unlawful agricultural activities. It will allow us, too, to modernise the consent regime for works proposed on common land. It will drastically improve the system for registering commons and greens by bringing the registers up to date and keeping them so. We have even reached consensus on the thorny issue of severance of common rights&#151;a Herculean achievement in its own right.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o464"><a name="60629-0020.htm_para2"><a name="06062974001005">We are proud of the Bill, which has benefited from the close scrutiny it has received, and the changes that have been made to improve it. I have read the debates in another place and this House, which were productive, constructive, at times amusing and, most importantly, well intentioned. Today I have gained a first-hand appreciation for the genuine determination of hon. Members on both sides of the House to do the best job that they can. I pay tribute to the commitment shown by hon. Members and to the detailed knowledge and experience that many of them have brought to our deliberations from their years of interest in the subject. I also thank the Deputy Speakers and Chairmen who have chaired our discussions on Report and in Committee.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o465"><a name="60629-0020.htm_para3"><a name="06062974001006">I acknowledge the support of the members of my team in the Department. They have worked long and hard to bring the Bill to this stage, and they have worked tirelessly with everyone who has shown an interest in the Bill to establish consensus on all the main issues. I am grateful to hon. Members for the individual tributes that they have paid to them in the course of our deliberations this afternoon&#151;my team put that in my speech, no doubt expecting a drink at the end of this.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o466"><a name="60629-0020.htm_para4"><a name="06062974001007">Finally, I thank my hon. Friend the Minister for Schools, who was responsible for managing the Bill in its earlier stages in this House. His open and consensual approach in Standing Committee has ensured that the Bill has the broad support of all parties, and I have tried to continue that approach.</p>

boundary fence cordoning off a development or the digging of a trench for foundations to be construction works. I have listened carefully to the hon.

 I shall start by picking up the Minister&#146;s comments to my hon. Friend the Member for North Shropshire (Mr. Paterson). We were unable to conclude the discussion in which the hon. Member for Sherwood (Paddy Tipping) discussed long-standing planning consents. We were not trying to allow someone with planning consent to circumvent the basic import of being able to apply to register a village green. The Minister has suggested that I was asking for a third concession, which was not the case. I was asking for a clarification of the word, &#147;construction&#148;, which the Minister has just provided for my hon. Friend the Member for North Shropshire&#151;although as we all know, it will be for the courts to decide. It would be a shame if anybody who had begun a development&#151;the moot point is what constitutes &#147;beginning development&#148;&#151;finds that the opportunity is taken away from them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o468"><a name="60629-0020.htm_para6"><a name="06062974001012">This is an extremely important Bill. It is a great pleasure in many ways&#151;I know that other Members find this&#151;to deliberate on a matter without party division or point scoring. We had a little contretemps during the debate on the last group of amendments when it was suggested that my party was divided. That is not so; I merely wanted to ensure that the other side of the debate was properly aired because I knew what the Minister was going to say. There are two points of view, and it was right that they should both be put.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o469"><a name="60629-0020.htm_para7"><a name="06062974001013">It is also unusual to debate a Bill dealing with legislation that is in many cases hundreds of years old. I think that the earliest piece of legislation that we mentioned dated from the 1270s. We have some ancient commons in my constituency, some with their own statute, and I have learned a great deal about that law. I hope that that will enable me to understand local problems better, if not to resolve them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o470"><a name="60629-0020.htm_para8"><a name="06062974001014">As the Minister said, his predecessor, who is now the Minister for Schools, led us through Second Reading and Committee in the extremely constructive way that those of us who have worked with him for some time have come to expect. I congratulate him on his promotion, which was well deserved. He was a good Minister at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, and I hope that he takes that skill forward in his new role. The current Minister has carried on the style adopted by his predecessor and has been extremely helpful in discussions outside the Chamber, as well as in his responses today. I thank him for that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o471"><a name="60629-0020.htm_para9"><a name="06062974001015">I also thank the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire (Mr. Williams), who has adopted an equally constructive approach, bringing his experience  <br>

as a Welsh hill farmer to bear, and the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy (Mr. Llwyd), who brought to our debates his tremendous experience as a rural lawyer dealing with common law, among other things. He has contributed considerably. Many outside interests and organisations have put forward their thoughts and views, and were involved in the long discussions and consultations that the Government held prior to publishing the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o472"><a name="60629-0020.htm_para10"><a name="06062974001016">It would be remiss of me not to say that one or two concerns remain, including on development and minor but necessary works. I look forward to the regulations that the Minister will publish as a result. I am sorry that it has not been possible for us to deal with incorrect registrations. We considered several options, including the concept of reintroducing the principle of levancy and couchancy. The Minister and I discussed that, and I accept that it would be difficult. However, it is a pity that we have not been able to find a solution to the glaring examples of people on the register who have rights that they should never have registered, but are difficult to shift.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o473"><a name="60629-0020.htm_para11"><a name="06062974001017">Nevertheless, we have dramatically improved the common law of this land as it applies to commons. I hope that what we have done will prove durable and flexible for a very long time. I hope, too, that it will help not only landowners but owners of the ancient rights that we have discussed and owners of newer rights such as open access. The only group that I hope that it does not help are lawyers. I hope that we have created a Bill that is clear enough, so that the common man can understand it and the lawyer is the poorer for it. I wish it well.</p>

 It was a great pleasure and a fantastic learning opportunity to serve on the Standing Committee on the Commons Bill [Lords]. I hope that it will shortly be followed by the Lords Bill [Commons].</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o474"><a name="60629-0020.htm_para12"><a name="06062974001019">My constituency has 10,000 hectares of commons, the largest of which are Bowes moor, Cotherstone pasture, Barningham moor, Eggleston common, Cockfield fell and Hamsterley common. There are 39 commons in all. Among other things, it emerged from the discussion that half the commons in this country are sites of special scientific interest, which many people found surprising at first. As we considered the Bill in more detail, however, I realised that that was not an accident: the reason why commons are so environmentally important is that landowners have not historically had the same rights or financial incentives to sell or develop the land.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o475"><a name="60629-0020.htm_para13"><a name="06062974001020">There is a general lesson for us, in all our work on protecting the environment, in the great value of taking collective responsibility. This Bill shows that it is important to continue managing commons in the interests of all stakeholders&#151;landowners, tenant farmers and those with interests in sport and walking. In my constituency, that is especially important for the hill farmers and the environment, as part of it is an area of outstanding natural beauty. I especially welcome the democratisation process with the new commons councils being set up and the measures to protect village greens for shared use.</p>

Before we repeal the Commons Act 1285, from the reign of Edward I, I want to share something with hon. Members about it. It is a very short piece of legislation&#151;less than one column long&#151;and begins:</p>
<a name="60629-0020.htm_brev0"><a name="06062974001141"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Whereas in a Statute made at Merton, it was granted that Lords of Wastes, Woods, and Pastures, might approve the said Wastes, Woods and Pastures, notwithstanding the Contradiction of their Tenants, so that the Tenants had sufficient Pasture to their Tenements with free...the same&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o477"><a name="60629-0020.htm_para15"><a name="06062974001022">It is interesting that the problems in 1285 were similar to those that we have been addressing. The Act goes on to say:</p>
<a name="60629-0020.htm_brev1"><a name="06062974001142"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;If any do claim Common by special Feoffment or Grant for a certain Number of Beasts, or otherwise...he ought to have of common Right....By occasion of a Windmill, Sheepcote Deyry, inlarging of a Court necessary, or Courtelage, from henceforth no Man shall be grieved by Assise...And where sometime it chanceth that one having Right to approve, a Dyke or an Hedge, and some by Night...do overthrow the Hedge or Dyke, and it cannot be known by Verdict of the Assise or Jury, who did overthrow the Hedge or Dyke, and Men...will not indict such as be guilty of the Fact...shall be distrained to levy the Hedge or Dyke at their own Cost&#148;.</p>

The 1285 Act, however, has had a good run. We know how it is operated, and we are in a position to repeal it as part of this Bill. I am very happy to support the Bill.</p>

 I, too, have been privileged to take part in the consideration of this legislation, the roots of which go back to feudal times. The wasteland of the manor has survived intact over a very long period, and given the diverse expectations of different people and different parts of the community about the common land, I am always amazed by the fact that people generally seem to get on well and ensure that it is managed to the best purpose. Obviously, some aspects needed improving, and the Bill will do that and ensure that such land exists for a long time into the future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o480"><a name="60629-0020.htm_para18"><a name="06062974001026">Commons will face threats and challenges in the future. As we see more and more of our agricultural land used for energy production, and less available for food production, common land might have to meet challenges that have not been met in the recent past. That will be a test of the legislation. The changes in the common agricultural policy and the different ways in which rightholders use their rights will be very interesting. Now that all the support has gone from production and there is no direct pressure on farmers to graze as much stock as they did in the past, it is possible that biodiversity will vastly improve.</p>

 It is an honour and a privilege to have secured the debate&#151;although, given its nature, I sincerely wish that I had not had to initiate it. I also congratulate my hon. Friend the Minister on his relatively recent appointment to the Home Office. It is very well deserved, and I know that in his own constituency of Gedling he has worked hard on the issue of antisocial behaviour.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o491"><a name="60629-0020.htm_para29"><a name="06062974001039">There has been real success in Hartlepool in bringing down crime rates in recent years. As a result of sustained funding and investment by the Government, and a degree of determination on the part of a variety of organisations and the community in the town to work together in partnership, there has been significant improvement. In 1999-2000, house burglaries were occurring at a rate of 39.4 in every 1,000 households, double the national rate. In 2004-05, the rate was down to 22.2. We had about 250 burglaries a month in the town a few years ago; now there are about 35 a month. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o492"><a name="60629-0020.htm_para30"><a name="06062974001040">As for vehicle crime, Hartlepool was well above the national average, with 21.6 offences per 1,000 of the population in 1999-2000. The figure fell to 14.6 per 1,000 in 2004-05, below the national average, and indicators for this year show a 46 per cent. reduction in theft from a motor vehicle year on year. Although robbery rates increased slightly in England as a whole between 1999-2000 and 2004-05, in Hartlepool they fell. This year, robbery is down by almost a quarter year on year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o493"><a name="60629-0020.htm_para31"><a name="06062974001041">The Hartlepool basic command unit, led by Steve Ashman, is the only BCU in the country that figured in the top lists for both crime reduction and detection rates in the past year. Reassuringly for residents, in April 2006 Hartlepool became the pilot area for neighbourhood policing in the Cleveland police force area. An additional 21 police community support officers, paid for by the Home Office and the Hartlepool partnership&#151;which I chair&#151;mean that a total of 74 police officers are now part of the neighbourhood policing team in each of the communities in the town, patrolling all 17 wards, with neighbourhood police stations located in such places as Dyke House school, the Fens shops and a community centre in Greatham, providing real community reassurance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o494"><a name="60629-0020.htm_para32"><a name="06062974001042">Given those successes, why am I taking up the House&#146;s time? Criminal and antisocial behaviour are still blighting the lives of far too many of my constituents.</p>

 Does my hon. Friend agree that one blight on people&#146;s lives is the incidence of airgun attacks, which is an aspect of antisocial behaviour that I am sure his constituents, like mine, have suffered. Given the great success of the recent knives amnesty, will he support my call for an amnesty for airguns, so that some of the attacks can be prevented? The more we can get those dangerous and deadly weapons off the streets, the safer life will be for many people.</p>

of the decent majority and, without prompt early intervention, that attracts further elements of antisocial behaviour. Those people tend to be housed in properties owned by private landlords, who often have no connection with the local community, or even with the town, and who do not really care as long as they continue to receive payment. Tenants move around, often from private landlord to private landlord, very often in the same street, with no definite action carried out either to deal with the underlying problems or to provide some degree of respite to the decent people in the street who are suffering from their mindless and yobbish behaviour. Complaints to agencies by residents are not backed up with swift, decisive and tangible action, which makes people in the local area even more disillusioned and depressed. There is a vague awareness from residents that this Labour Government have put in place extra powers to tackle such criminal and antisocial behaviour, but they are not seeing them being used on in their community.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o498"><a name="60629-0021.htm_para2"><a name="06062974001048">Only this week, the person who runs my constituency office in South road, Samantha Mowbray, was working late in the office&#151;at about 7.45 pm&#151;when the back window of her car, which was parked outside, was smashed by a group of kids. The police came to the scene quickly, but the gang that did it was defiant, and instead of fleeing from the area, stood firm and said, &#147;We know our rights&#151;prove which one did it&#148;. Such people are fully aware of their rights, but utterly ignorant of their responsibilities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o499"><a name="60629-0021.htm_para3"><a name="06062974001049">The criminal justice system is in danger of failing in Hartlepool, not only because decent people are losing faith in its ability to administer justice, but&#151;perhaps most disturbingly&#151;because people who commit crime and behave antisocially do not fear or respect it. A central purpose of a criminal justice system should surely be not necessarily to punish&#151;although I think that that is an important aspect&#151;but to ensure that the prospect of reoffending is reduced. But that is not happening.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o500"><a name="60629-0021.htm_para4"><a name="06062974001050">Let us consider a recent example that was brought to my attention. A man was arrested in Hartlepool town centre for disorderly behaviour and received an &#163;80 penalty notice. He was arrested for the same crime within a few weeks, and was sent back to court. That time, he received a &#163;40 fine. There is no consistency, and no regard for, or recognition of, the fact that that individual took up the court&#146;s time a matter of weeks earlier for the same offence. The revolving door policy in Hartlepool magistrates court is all too common, and I am keen for the Minister to suggest how that can be stopped.</p>

In fact, the reverse is true. Home Office figures show that 86 ASBOs were issued in the Cleveland police area in the period between 1 April 1999 and 30 April 2005.

area, with 22 issued in Middlesbrough in 2005 alone. Hartlepool had only 10 ASBOs issued in that six-year period, and three were in 2005&#151;well below the figure for our neighbours not only in Middlesbrough, but in Stockton, Redcar and Cleveland. We should not issue ASBOs as if we are in a competition to see who can issue the most; equally, I do not think that 10 ASBOs issued in six years accurately reflects the level of antisocial behaviour that residents in my constituency have endured.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o503"><a name="60629-0021.htm_para7"><a name="06062974001053">Agencies in Hartlepool are far too reluctant to use the powers provided in a swift and efficient manner, which is having a detrimental effect on the lives of ordinary and decent residents. The district commander of Hartlepool basic command unit recently informed me that the process in my town is like, in his words, &#147;running in treacle&#148;. He cited a case in which he is trying to get an ASBO through the courts. It is not a particularly exceptional or unusual case, but the police have been requested by the council&#146;s legal team to make more than 100 changes to the original case. The first meeting to discuss proceedings in that case took place in January. Such situations, which are not unusual, have an adverse effect on the morale and determination of police officers, let alone the residents. Can the Minister suggest anything that could be done in Hartlepool to speed up this process? Neighbouring areas can do it, so why cannot my town?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o504"><a name="60629-0021.htm_para8"><a name="06062974001054">I have asked the Minister for some solutions, but I am keen to explore one in particular at this stage. I am a massive supporter of the Government&#146;s policy to provide services for people, rather than &#147;at&#148; them&#151;to consult, and then devolve and design public services that are most appropriate to their local needs. That has been successfully done in health, and it has been seen in regeneration in my town through the new deal for communities. It is also being seen in neighbourhood policing. Why can it not be developed in community justice?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o505"><a name="60629-0021.htm_para9"><a name="06062974001055">I am not suggesting that mob rule should be put in place, but Hartlepool has a sophisticated and developed residents&#146; association network, reflecting the strong community and civic-minded ethos of most of its citizens. Will the Minister consider putting a measure in place that allows formally constituted and properly-governed residents&#146; groups, in conjunction with local councillors and other agencies, to administer and monitor community-based sentences? Such an approach seems to be working in the Red Hook community justice centre in Brooklyn, New York, and&#151;a little closer to home&#151;in the community justice centre in north Liverpool. I think that that approach&#151;focusing on the underlying problem and working to prevent offenders from coming back, rather than just seeing a case as something to be got through the court process as quickly as possible, regardless of whether the offender might return the following week&#151;would work in Hartlepool. It would reassure the public about justice and sentencing, just as neighbourhood policing does. I therefore ask my hon. Friend the Minister to consider establishing one or more of those community justice centres in my constituency.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o506"><a name="60629-0021.htm_para10"><a name="06062974001056">Residents have identified the fact that many of the problems stem from irresponsible private landlords, who do not seem to care about the state of the neighbourhood where they have investment, because  <br>

they are often physically removed from the trouble. Often, they continue to be paid, regardless of the antisocial behaviour of their tenants.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o507"><a name="60629-0021.htm_para11"><a name="06062974001057">The Housing Act 2004 provides some hope, in that I understand that it will introduce mandatory licensing and give local authorities the ability to designate that an area with an antisocial behaviour problem can be more centrally managed. The recent announcement that the Government are considering housing benefit sanctions for those problem families who fail to take up offers of help is welcome, but I want more. The Government have increased powers to close down crack houses, and I believe that properties where antisocial behaviour originates should be closed down in a similar way. The respect action plan is welcome in that regard, but I should like to see it go much further. For private landlords whose properties have antisocial tenants, a closure may initially be temporary, so that some sort of agreement can be reached. However, a second complaint should result in the permanent closure of a property, or its confiscation. That would allow some respite, and its use for the good of the community.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o508"><a name="60629-0021.htm_para12"><a name="06062974001058">Changes to the licensing laws and the role of directly-elected councillors in granting liquor licenses have been a success, and that approach should be extended to people who want to be private landlords. We need a licence to drive a car, and vehicles require an MOT certificate to ensure that they are not a risk on the road. Something similar should be in place for landlords, with the community&#151;perhaps through the auspices of a community justice centre&#151;playing some part in granting licences.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o509"><a name="60629-0021.htm_para13"><a name="06062974001059">Such powers would be welcome, but I am concerned that Hartlepool borough council will not give tackling housing problems and bad private landlords the priority that it deserves. At the moment, the council's landlord accreditation scheme has only one full-time member of staff, Ken Natt. He does a great job and has some support from other departments, but the fact remains that he is essentially on his own. That level of resource is neither sufficient nor adequate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o510"><a name="60629-0021.htm_para14"><a name="06062974001060">As well as being Hartlepool&#146;s MP, I also chair the local strategic partnership. I am frustrated at the current state of affairs, and I know that my frustration is shared by residents and ward councillors in the areas affected. Given the executive mayoral system that we have, what steps can my hon. Friend the Minister suggest that we should take so that we can convince the local authority of the importance of this matter?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o511"><a name="60629-0021.htm_para15"><a name="06062974001061">As I said, I believe that swift intervention and action helps to prevent antisocial behaviour problems from escalating. Issues such as poverty, low educational attainment and poor parenting skills are being tackled through economic prosperity. The amount of money spent per pupil has doubled since 1997, and Government initiatives such as Sure Start have had real success in my constituency, but more could and should be done.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o512"><a name="60629-0021.htm_para16"><a name="06062974001062">Swift intervention as soon as antisocial behaviour begins is important. The 101 project, for example&#151;formerly known as the Dundee project&#151;shows that very early intervention, and support to address specific and individual problems, can produce real success. That has worked in Scotland: will the Minister consider piloting something similar in Hartlepool?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o513"><a name="60629-0021.htm_para17"><a name="06062974001063">I am in favour of a multi-agency, partnership approach, providing clear and simple lines of accountability and  <br>

responsibility. That approach has worked in Hartlepool before on a whole range of problems, including crime, but it needs a much bigger push. In response to a Parliamentary question from me this week, my hon. Friend the Minister for Local Government stated that the local strategic partnership was the overarching body that would bring all relevant service deliverers together. He said that it would provide scrutiny of the performance of all those agencies, including the ones charged with tackling criminal and antisocial behaviour. As chair of the Hartlepool partnership, I am personally keen to do a lot more to take that approach further, for the good of Hartlepool&#146;s residents.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o514"><a name="60629-0021.htm_para18"><a name="06062974001064">A lot of good work has been done in Hartlepool, on a range of issues, but I am really ambitious for the town and want to do a lot more. My hon. Friend the Minister is a good constituency Member of Parliament, and he will be acutely aware that decent residents deserve better. I should be grateful for some guidance from him as to how that can be achieved.</p>

 I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Hartlepool  (Mr. Wright) on securing the debate and on a speech that showed his dedication to his work and to the people of Hartlepool. He made a number of interesting points, and I shall try to answer them as well as making some general comments about the Government&#146;s attitude to tackling antisocial behaviour in Hartlepool and across the country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o515"><a name="60629-0021.htm_para19"><a name="06062974001066">Antisocial behaviour affects too many people. The great majority behave in a way that does not cause alarm, harassment or distress to others, but a small number&#146;s normal behaviour is to intimidate those around them. People from all generations and all backgrounds in Hartlepool are united in wanting antisocial behaviour to be tackled head on as it has such an effect on their quality of life. There has been a huge response from practitioners including the police, local authorities and local communities in taking a stand against such behaviour.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o516"><a name="60629-0021.htm_para20"><a name="06062974001067">I am glad to say that the Government have provided the tools and powers, through Acts such as the Anti-Social Behaviour Act 2003, to tackle antisocial behaviour. In many cases, those powers are being used widely and wisely. It may help the House if I remind it of the powers available to practitioners: crack house closure, housing injunctions, parenting contracts, parenting orders, fixed penalty notices, acceptable behaviour contracts, antisocial behaviour orders, dispersal orders and curfew orders. As my hon. Friend said, quite powerfully, it is all very well to have such powers on the statute book and available, but we all want to see more of them being used in more areas of our communities. The Government, too, are very keen to see that happen.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o517"><a name="60629-0021.htm_para21"><a name="06062974001068">The 2003 Act also contained increased powers on and greater penalties for the misuse of air weapons. My hon. Friend the Member for Houghton and Washington, East (Mr. Kemp) has spent a long time campaigning on air weapons in his constituency, where he has tried to have antisocial behaviour tackled, and  <br>

has put pressure on the Government to do something, too. There was a firearms amnesty in 2003. We keep such things under review, and air weapons are part of that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o518"><a name="60629-0021.htm_para22"><a name="06062974001069">My hon. Friend the Member for Hartlepool mentioned that 86 antisocial behaviour orders were issued in the Cleveland police force area, and 10 in Hartlepool, between April 1999 and September 2005. Additionally, 24 acceptable behaviour contracts were agreed in the Hartlepool crime and disorder reduction partnership area between October 2004 and September 2005. It is clear, however, that more are needed, and the Government call on all the responsible agencies to consider more use of ASBOs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o519"><a name="60629-0021.htm_para23"><a name="06062974001070">My hon. Friend spoke about the need to speed up the process. I can give him some information that he might want to share with people in Hartlepool, such as the independent mayor. The Government have taken a range of measures under the Police Reform Act 2002, the Anti-Social Behaviour Act 2003 and the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005 to improve the effectiveness of ASBOs, enabling the courts to protect communities more quickly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o520"><a name="60629-0021.htm_para24"><a name="06062974001071">If my hon. Friend looks across the country, it is clear that some councils and agencies use antisocial behaviour orders much more than others and find no problem with the existing system. We need to spread that best practice so that all local authorities in all areas of the country use ASBOs much more quickly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o521"><a name="60629-0021.htm_para25"><a name="06062974001072">Interim orders can be made at the same time as an ASBO application. Orders on conviction and county court orders can avoid the need for a separate court hearing. In addition, the Home Office is currently updating its ASBO guidance to practitioners to spread best practice. That is due to be published in the near future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o522"><a name="60629-0021.htm_para26"><a name="06062974001073">The Crown Prosecution Service has established a team of specialist antisocial behaviour prosecutors, again to try to speed up the process. There is also a network of specialist antisocial behaviour response courts, which are better able to respond to antisocial behaviour.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o523"><a name="60629-0021.htm_para27"><a name="06062974001074">We are taking action throughout the country to tell the responsible agencies that they can do more and to encourage them to use the powers to protect the communities at and the individuals who want to see the powers used. My hon. Friend&#146;s example of the two e-mails that he had received show exactly the sort of behaviour that we want to be tackled. Some of the activities are criminal and deserve criminal prosecution as well as ASBOs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o524"><a name="60629-0021.htm_para28"><a name="06062974001075">Since penalty notices for disorder were introduced in 2004, Cleveland has issued a total of 4,353, of which 834 have been issued in Hartlepool. Penalty notices for disorder can be given for a range of behaviour, including dropping litter, being drunk and disorderly or throwing fireworks. We are encouraging agencies and local communities to break down barriers and to tackle, not tolerate antisocial behaviour.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o525"><a name="60629-0021.htm_para29"><a name="06062974001076">For example, the Cool Football project has been successful in my hon. Friend&#146;s constituency. It was set up to deal with children playing football in residential streets. I know that it involves making various school football pitches available during the evenings and weekends so that children have somewhere to play, and I commend such projects. Again, we want more of them to be set up.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o526"><a name="60629-0022.htm_para0"><a name="06062974001077">I also know about the ASBO 13 project that has been introduced in my hon. Friend&#146;s constituency to tackle the problem of young people hanging around with nothing to do. If a young person comes to the attention of the police, they are given a &#147;ticket&#148;, and asked why they are hanging about and what they would like to do instead. Many young people said that they wanted to play football. Football teams have now been set up to cater for them, and there is even a football league consisting of those teams. When the agencies fail to act, we need to tell them loudly and clearly that we expect them to do so. I believe that that is my hon. Friend&#146;s point. The powers are there and the agencies should use them. They should support young people through projects such as those that I mentioned but let us see the powers used, too.</p>

<p><a name="st_o361"><a name="06062974001078"><a name="60629-0022.htm_spnew0"><a name="06062974001585"><b>Mr. Kemp:</b>
 The point about powers is important. I attended a State of the City debate last Thursday in Sunderland. Canon Stephen Taylor, the chair of the partnership, reported to people there that, as a result of using the powers, Sunderland is now the safest city in the north. Agencies have worked in partnership and used the tools with which the Government have provided them. That has been a great success and there has been a great reduction in antisocial behaviour. That is a tribute to the police and other agencies on Wearside. A neighbouring city to Hartlepool has thus experienced great success in recent years.</p>

<p><a name="st_o362"><a name="06062974001079"><a name="60629-0022.htm_spnew1"><a name="06062974001586"><b>Mr. Coaker:</b>
 I thank my hon. Friend for that intervention. It shows that, when the police, local authorities, voluntary organisations, residents&#146; groups, faith groups and others come together, they can make a difference because we have given them the tools, the powers and the laws to make a difference in their community. We often hear the plea in all our constituencies: &#147;Why aren&#146;t the laws used more often?&#148; The challenge for us is to demand that the laws be used. My hon. Friend&#146;s example of what happens in Sunderland shows that, when people work and act together, it makes a difference and we can reclaim the streets for the decent, law-abiding majority. That is what we want.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o527"><a name="60629-0022.htm_para1"><a name="06062974001080">I know that Hartlepool borough council plans to introduce a selective licensing scheme from October. My hon. Friend the Member for Hartlepool referred to that. Selective licensing is a tool introduced by part 3 of the Housing Act 2004 to assist local authorities, together with other appropriate measures, to tackle problems in the private rented sector. A designation comes into force three months after it has been made or approved and all PRS properties, with certain exemptions, in the designated area are required to be licensed by the local authority. A landlord who fails to apply for a licence commits a criminal offence and can be fined up to &#163;20,000. Before granting a licence, a local authority must satisfy itself that the landlord is a fit and proper person to manage the property and that there are, or can be put in place, adequate arrangements for its effective and proper management. In addition, the authority can impose such other conditions as it considers appropriate to secure the proper management of the property, including conditions for preventing or reducing antisocial behaviour by the tenant or his visitors.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o528"><a name="60629-0022.htm_para2"><a name="06062974001081">For local people to have confidence in local agencies, those agencies need to communicate the actions they are taking to let the public know what they are doing. Local radio, newspapers, leaflets and newsletters all provide opportunities to send out the message that antisocial behaviour will not be tolerated, and let the public know the part they can play. For example, publicity of ASBO proceedings is often an integral part of local agencies&#146; efforts to tackle antisocial behaviour for two reasons: first, to help the community and the victims of antisocial behaviour know that something positive has been done to stop the abuse; and, secondly, to publicise the prohibitions so that the community can help enforce the order. Such publicity is not intended to punish or shame the individual, but to show that the law is being enforced.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o529"><a name="60629-0022.htm_para3"><a name="06062974001082">I know that my hon. Friend the Member for Hartlepool has advocated the use of publicity when ASBOs are granted, and I am aware that the issue of publicity has been a concern in Hartlepool. However, I have been informed that the local agencies are now taking a collective decision as to whether publicity is appropriate when they attend the consultation meeting before an application for an ASBO is made. It is to be hoped that such collective decision making will improve the process. I agree with my hon. Friend that people need to see that the law is being enforced&#151;a plea that is often made in my constituency. Sometimes people say that even when the law is enforced by the police and local authorities they do not know about it, so publicity for the consequences of poor behaviour can be an important confidence-building measure. I know that my hon. Friend is particularly keen on such measures.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o530"><a name="60629-0022.htm_para4"><a name="06062974001083">More widely, a range of existing Home Office developments can be brought to bear in helping practitioners to tackle antisocial behaviour. The House will be interested to learn that a national survey of crime and disorder partnerships showed that between October 2003 and September 2005 we issued 13,000 acceptable behaviour contracts; 500 crack house closure orders; more than 1,500 housing injunctions; more than 1,700 parenting orders and contracts; and more than 800 dispersal orders. Figures from the police show that since 2004 more than 200,000 penalty notices for disorder have been issued. I want those powers to continue to be used widely and wisely across the country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o531"><a name="60629-0022.htm_para5"><a name="06062974001084">There are record levels of police officers to tackle antisocial behaviour. Nationally, there were 141,270 police officers on 30 September 2005&#151;an increase of more than 1,100 since September 2004, and 14,112 more than in March 1997. Cleveland had 1,640 police officers on 30 September 2005, which is an increase of 181, or 12 per cent., since March 1997. We are committed to increasing the number of police community support officers to 24,000 by March 2008. As my hon. Friend mentioned, there were 86 PCSOs in Hartlepool on 30 September 2005, and we expect the number to increase. PCSOs are already being used in Hartlepool and they will be the eyes and ears on the street. They have been one of the best reforms the Government have introduced and I am pleased that they are working with police officers on the streets of Hartlepool to try to tackle antisocial behaviour.</p>

recorded crime fell by 21 per cent. in Hartlepool and by 8 per cent. in the Cleveland police force area as a whole between 2003-04 and 2004-05. Criminal damage fell by 9 per cent. in the Hartlepool area in the same period.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o533"><a name="60629-0022.htm_para7"><a name="06062974001086">It is worth keeping in mind that criminal damage and vandalism include incidents such as graffiti and broken windows, which blight local communities. I know that my hon. Friend is keen to see that all aspects of antisocial behaviour are tackled, including broken windows and vandalised telephone boxes and bus shelters. It is particularly important that we tackle the vandalism associated with street furniture.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o534"><a name="60629-0022.htm_para8"><a name="06062974001087">We are running a yearlong &#147;tackling vandalism&#148; programme with ENCAMS, which runs the &#147;Keep Britain Tidy&#148; campaign.

Friend raised another major point about communities being able to call for action and the presence of community justice centres. I remind him that the Police and Justice Bill, currently progressing through Parliament, contains a measure called the community call for action. It will give those local communities who feel that there is a need for more action to tackle problems in their area a trigger by which they can demand that. That is a particularly important reform, because it empowers local communities to try to influence those who take decisions.</p>

It is probably the issue on which MPs get more correspondence and more individuals coming to see them than any other. That is why my hon. Friend has secured this important debate. His debate refers to Hartlepool, but I think that all Members would agree that his comments could be applied to many of our constituencies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o541"><a name="60629-0022.htm_para15"><a name="06062974001094">But the debate has also shown that where people stand together, where people act with the local council, the local police and voluntary organisations, and where people use the powers that are available to them, given by this Government on a range of issues, we can make a difference. There is no need for any street in this country not to be reclaimed by its community. We can do that by working together. We can do that by using the laws that are available to us and we can do that by having hope and optimism for the future. I congratulate my hon. Friend again on the debate that he has initiated and my hon. Friend the Member for Houghton and Washington, East on his comments. I would say to everyone: stand together, because by doing that we can make a difference.</p>
