Ashfield (Mr. Hoon), was not allowed to answer questions on
Europe. On 18 May, my hon. Friend the Member for North-West
Cambridgeshire (Mr. Vara), whom I welcome to his new post as
shadow Deputy Leader of the House, asked the Foreign Secretary if any
changes had been made to the role of the Minister for Europe. Six

escaped your notice, Mr. Speaker, that the new James Bond
film goes on general release today. May we have a debate on the impact
of popular culture on our political life? That would enable us to learn
from characters in the Bond films. For example, I think that the Health
Secretary, who is constantly refusing petitions to keep wards and
hospitals open, is none other than Dr. No. Jaws? I suspect that that
can only be the Chancellor, particularly after the Prime Minister's
comment yesterday about the &#147;big clunking fist&#148;. As for

antisocial behaviour. When I was sitting on the Opposition Benches as
shadow Home Secretary, I put forward proposals for antisocial behaviour
orders, for what later became dispersal orders, for greater powers for
the police to deal with disorder, and for reform of the juvenile
justice system. Each of those was dismissed as a gimmick by the then
Home Secretary, the right hon. and learned Member for Folkestone and
Hythe (Mr. Howard), and it was the Conservative party that
was unquestionably running out of ideas, ignoring the scale of the
problems of antisocial behaviour afflicting our communities.</p><p><a name="stpa_o29"><a name="61116-0001.htm_para29"><a name="06111632000054">I hope that the right hon. Lady

the Labour party that is to blame for the antisocial behaviour of young
people, from reasonable homes, who are out of control. She must look to
those parents and to her own local authority. <i> [Interruption.]</i>
Oh, it is the Liberal Democrats; that explains everything. But the
truth is that in her area, as in every other area, the powers available
to the police and local communities better to control antisocial
behaviour have been dramatically improved, and that is why, in my area
as across the country, the incidence of antisocial behaviour has
greatly reduced.</p><p><a name="stpa_o30"><a name="61116-0001.htm_para30"><a name="06111632000055">The

&#147;Too much legislation.&#148;] The Conservatives say that, but
they have welcomed all but two of the proposed Bills, so they need to
be clear about this.</p><p><a name="stpa_o38"><a name="61116-0001.htm_para38"><a name="06111632000071">It is also time for the Liberal
Democrats to spell out which pieces of legislation they do not like.
Did they object to the National Health Service Act 1946 or to many of
the other major social changes that were encapsulated in very large
Acts? Are they saying that we should get rid of those? Are they saying
that we should get rid of the minimum wage legislation or the other
major improvements that have followed as a result of
legislation?</p><p><a name="stpa_o39"><a name="61116-0001.htm_para39"><a name="06111632000072">The
Liberal Democrats say that they would repeal some legislation, but the
total volume proposed would fill a tiny amount of shelf space as they
are proposing to repeal not whole Acts, but sections. For example, they
are proposing to repeal 10 sections of the Criminal Justice and Police
Act 2001 and sections 9 and 10 of the Criminal Justice Act
2003.</p><p><a name="stpa_o40"><a name="61116-0001.htm_para40"><a name="06111632000073">I hope that

receive a leaflet through their door explaining the terrible
consequences that would arise from the Liberal Democrat commitment to
remove the power to hold DNA samples taken at the time of arrest. That
power has led to the conviction of dangerous criminals, including
rapists. The consequence of the Liberal Democrat proposal would be that
such people would end up going free.</p><p><a name="stpa_o41"><a name="61116-0001.htm_para41"><a name="06111632000074">On the Department for

appears that Farepak and its directors, including Clive Thompson, were
well aware of the difficulties that the company faced at precisely the

the poorest in the land, to continue to pay their contributions towards

that 28 days is satisfactory, not withstanding our original desire for

changes. Indeed, we have provided more than &#163;2 billion of
subsidy to support post offices, and much of that has gone to rural
post offices. Notwithstanding that support,800 post offices in
the most rural areas have fewer than 20 customers a week, which is
extraordinary. The reason for the change, which, in many ways, is
regrettable, given the role that post offices have played, is the
advent of the internet and the fact that people choose to perform their
financial transactions differently, thus bypassing the post office.
That is something with which we all have to deal, and which any
Government would have to
face.</p><p><a name="st_o46"><a name="06111632000115"><b><a name="61116-0002.htm_spnew30"><a name="06111632000766">Mr.

to wait more than 18 months, then more than 12 months and then more
than six months for their operations, almost nobody now waits more than
six months for an operation. I readily acknowledge that much more
remains to be done. There are new challenges to face and
people&#146;s expectations are rising. People want public services to
give them more personal services. Education and health services should
be built on the needs of different individuals instead of people having

Secretary of State has just said. Is she not in danger of falsely
raising public expectations by using the language of taking waiting out
of the NHS? Even by her own terms, it will be more than two years
before she believes that she can deliver an 18-week wait. Is it not
misleading to raise expectations more than two years in advance and to
get that vocabulary, as new Labour always does, in currency now? Do not
her own figures this week show that more than 40,000 people are waiting
more than a year just for diagnosis? Are we not an awfully long way
from the period when the Secretary of State should start using those

number of people who are still waiting too long for diagnostic tests.
Last year, we introduced choice in respect of where people can go for
CT scans or MRI scans, for example, if the NHS could not treat them
within six months. That has already helped to bring down the waiting
times for diagnostics, but what I want to know from the hon. Gentleman
is whether he supports us in trying to get rid of the excessive waiting
times. We promised in the manifesto on which we were elected last year
to move from an 18-month wait for an operation to just 18 weeks from GP
referral to the operation. That means making further changes and
improvements to the NHS to ensure that people do not have those
unacceptable waits for diagnostic
tests.</p><p><a name="st_o84"><a name="06111632000168"><b><a name="61116-0004.htm_spnew2"><a name="06111632000804">Mr.

boundaries? Can she promise a period of calm in the period ahead, as it
is still a source of great disturbance, even among the best-run health

much bigger share of a far bigger budget. There has been an increase of
almost &#163;1 billion in the past five years alone. Again, we are
talking about investment matched by reform. In almost every part of the
country, when I meet mental health staff and the users of their
services, I hear about a transformation in the way in which those
services work. Fewer people are cared for in acute hospital wards and
far more people are looked after in the community. Painfully vulnerable
people and their families are benefiting, with suicide rates at their
lowest since records began in Victorian

Government and PCTs have underestimated the amount of activity that

When we were in government, we made it clear that we wanted a system in
which the money follows the patient. If a hospital does the work, it
should be paid for it, but in any rational system one would combine the
implementation of payment by results in the hospital sector with a
process of demand management in primary care. Of course, when we were

a previous report that PCT reorganisation would be a costly distraction

London PCTs top-sliced not just once but twice, in order to deal with a

the rule. Ministers appear not to take responsibility for that, but it
was they who established PCTs. Just last month, the Healthcare
Commission told us its view of PCTs&#146; financial resource

through the hands of PCTs. What about the effectiveness of PCTs? How
many PCTs did the commission regard as &#147;excellent&#148; in
their use of financial resources? None&#151;not one out of 303. How
many were regarded as weak, with immediate action needed to remedy
failures? The answer is 124. That is outrageous, and a condemnation of

Lansley:</b> First, it would make a difference if we knew what
the clinical arguments were. At present, financial and staffing issues
are meshed together with clinical service issues. It is not a
coincidence that Ministers and the NHS chief executive say that 60
accident and emergency departments and maternity units across the
country must be downgraded, just at the moment when they have deficits
worth &#163;1.3 billion. That is cause and effect: if the service
redesign were based on clinical reasons, such changes would be
happening locally and on a planned basis, not as a result of financial
crisis.</p><p><a name="stpa_o94"><a name="61116-0005.htm_para10"><a name="06111632000236">The Secretary
of State mentioned the working time directive. Two and half years ago,
the Government never suggested that the previous Conservative
Government had failed in the negotiations on the directive. We had an
opt-out on the social chapter, and the new deal for junior doctors
meant that their hours were being reduced anyway. The working time
directive was not going to interfere with that, as Ministers made
clear. Indeed, in mid-2004, the present Secretary of State for Work and
Pensions&#151;then a Minister of State at the Department of
Health&#151;said that no adverse service consequences would arise
from the directive&#146;s implementation. The Government said that
they would renegotiate the directive to remove any adverse effects, but
they did not do so. They have continued to fail in that respect, so we
need to hear no more nonsense from the right hon. Lady about
that.</p><p><a name="stpa_o95"><a name="61116-0005.htm_para11"><a name="06111632000237">It is time to

has been in spite of the Government, not because of them. It has come
about in spite of nine organisational upheavals in nine years, and in
spite of bureaucracy that eats up all the extra money. The Secretary of
State talks about the extra staff in the NHS, but she does not admit
that, although there are 25 per cent. more nurses, there are also 54
per cent. more administrators and 75 per cent. more managers and senior
managers. The rate of increase in the number of administrators is
double that in the number of nurses, and the number of managers is
rising at three times the nurses&#146; rate.</p><p><a name="stpa_o96"><a name="61116-0005.htm_para12"><a name="06111632000240">We do not argue that the NHS is
not improving, nor that the staff are not delivering those
improvements. What we say is that the rate of improvement is far lower
than it ought to be, given that two and a half times as much money is
being put in and that the Government have had nine years of opportunity
to get things right. What about major hospital projects? Even with the
private finance initiative, there have been only five additional major
new hospital projects a year since 1997&#151;the same rate as
before.</p><p><a name="stpa_o97"><a name="61116-0005.htm_para13"><a name="06111632000241">The Prime
Minister talks about cancer death rates as though the Labour Government
were personally responsible for saving people from the threat of
cancer. Let us look at the figures. In the seven years up to 1997, the
rate of improvement in mortality for people with cancer aged under 75
fell by 19.6 points per 100,000 of the population; in the seven years
since 1997, the rate fell by 17.3 points per 100,000. The rate of
improvement in cancer mortality for the under-75s was higher before
1997. The comparable figures for coronary heart disease show that the
reduction before 1997 was 42.7 and that since then it has been 44.3.
Those are long-term trends, not just in the UK but in other countries.
They are not the result of Government investment; even less are they
the result of Government
targets.</p><p><a name="stpa_o98"><a name="61116-0005.htm_para14"><a name="06111632000242">I have

average waiting times: in 1997, according to hospital episode

12 weeks. That does not say much for the improvements under the

is at the heart of the issue. If public services are not improved
through greater efficiency, the service cannot be delivered for
patients. That relates to the structure of reform. In the run-up to
1997, we were reducing the average length of stay by 9 per cent. a
year. The Secretary of State is always telling people in the NHS that
they must reduce length of stay, because that is a means of delivering
efficiency, yet since 1997 the time has been going down at the rate of
3.25 per cent. a year&#151;about a third of the rate before 1997. If
the productivity achieved in the run-up to 1997 had been maintained
since then, 1.4 million more operations would have been carried out in
the NHS this year. Waiting lists could indeed have been a thing of the
past if the Government had remotely delivered on the productivity that
we achieved before 1997 and allied to it the investment that they have
been making in the health service. That will be our job in the
future.</p><p><a name="stpa_o102"><a name="61116-0005.htm_para18"><a name="06111632000248">Where is the
legislation that we thought would be included in the Queen&#146;s
Speech? The Secretary of State talks about looking for an early
legislative opportunity to reform patient and public engagement, but
first she will have to convince people that the Government have any
idea about what they are doing on that subject. They abolished
community health councils, and they are planning to abolish the
Commission for Patient and Public Involvement in Health, and patients
forums. There is little understanding or support for the new local
involvement networks that the Government propose. However, as we are
already discovering, there is far more support for a more independent

matter of legislation, although there is a case for its review; it is
needed to deal with rising health inequalities, to combat the fact that
in his annual report in July the chief medical officer had to say that
far from achieving the fully engaged scenario that was at the heart of
his hopes for the NHS, we are now in the worst-case scenario. There are
rising public health problems due to obesity, drug and alcohol abuse

evidence given to the Select Committee on Health by academics, which

between, on the one hand, money for the public health service, which
needs to be allocated on the basis of health inequalities and future
need, and, on the other hand, the genuine burden of disease in an area.
Such a distinction would ensure the availability both of equitable
access to services through the NHS and of resources for public health
support and intervention. That distinction needs to be made, but at

take note of how the Conservative Government made it clear at the

that we are involved with.</p><p><a name="stpa_o123"><a name="61116-0006.htm_para14"><a name="06111632000272">Once I knew the distances that
people travel, the impossibility of those children going to school and
the difficulties that they have, I realised how difficult it is for us
to get the programmes that we are committed to in that country up and
running. We gave a lift to one woman who was heavily pregnant; we must
have taken her 30 km. The people who walked to the polling stations
covered long distances. How can children get an education? There are
all the street children who have been chucked out of their houses
because of allegations of sorcery and witchcraft, because of a lack of
finance, or because they have been abducted to be child
soldiers.</p><p><a name="stpa_o124"><a name="61116-0006.htm_para15"><a name="06111632000273">I am
excited by the immunisation programme and by what we are talking about
in relation to primary education. However, just as with problems in
this country, it will work only if there is good governance. One of my
reasons for raising the matter today is that I want to make sure that
we focus on it. We can be proud of what we have done. We are the
largest European bilateral donor to the Congo. With the international
community, we have put a great deal into the elections. We have given a
lot of help with civic education and development, but we have to keep
on the ball in trying to assist people as they experience the difficult
situation that they are in at the moment, after the elections, and as
they go forward into the future.</p><p><a name="stpa_o125"><a name="61116-0006.htm_para16"><a name="06111632000274">A number of the themes in the
Queen&#146;s Speech&#151;education, health, security, dealing with
terrorism and climate change, which I will come on to&#151;are
international. They are not themes that can be considered only in
relation to this country. The Congo is a country that should be able to
feed itself&#151;if we did not dump our food on it. It is a country
that can provide electricity for the whole of Africa and that has huge
resources in diamonds, gold, and coltan, which is used for mobile
phones. It has massive resources to be able to do things, which is
precisely why it has been plundered and pillaged by the Belgian
colonisers, by Mobutu, the dictator, and by the rebel armies that have
plagued it.</p><p><a name="stpa_o126"><a name="61116-0006.htm_para17"><a name="06111632000275">Why have
the neighbouring countries got involved? They have had an incentive to
try to get some of the mining contracts through the international
mining companies. It will be hugely difficult to put that right, but we
must consider the potential for stability in Africa if we can get
stability in that country. Of the neighbouring countries, half a dozen
have civil wars and internal conflicts, and their troops have bases in
the Congo, or have had. The potential for stability if we can get that
country moving is incredible.</p><p><a name="stpa_o127"><a name="61116-0006.htm_para18"><a name="06111632000276">It is important to mention the
matter today because the important provisional results of the election
were announced yesterday. Joseph Kabila got 58 per cent. of the votes

have met representatives of both the candidates. The results are being
contested. There is a danger of continuing

pressure for peace and for them to accept those results. Because of the
way in which the results have gone, the losing candidate will have
fantastic power and influence in the country. Within a large part of
it, he will have a great deal of support through the provincial and
parliamentary elections. He will be able to have great influence in
that context.</p><p><a name="stpa_o128"><a name="61116-0006.htm_para19"><a name="06111632000277">I was
in one part of the country where Kabila was the clear favourite and in
another part, last time, where Bemba was the clear favourite. I was
astonished that in that massive country&#151;there are 55 million

road&#151;the elections were run as well as they were. They were more
transparent that some other elections that I have heard of recently.
Every ballot paper was held up for people to see. The forms were
allowed to be copied and given to the witnesses of the political
parties, so they can be checked. Any complaints about things going
wrong in the election have to be followed through to make sure that
people have confidence in the outcome. However, I hope that the
presidential contenders do not go back to conflicts, arguments and
deaths. We cannot afford
that.</p><p><a name="stpa_o129"><a name="61116-0006.htm_para20"><a name="06111632000278">We can be proud
of our country&#146;s contribution and what we have done to try to
assist, but we have to keep a forward-looking perspective. We have to
carry on putting effort and work into making sure that the Congo gets
through this period and starts to tackle some of the fundamental
problems. I and others will seek an Adjournment debate when the results
of the election have been confirmed. The issues that we want to raise
and that we want to keep our Ministers&#146; continuing attention on
include security sector reform. We clearly need a single body to
co-ordinate security sector reform. There are problems. If people in
the army do not get paid, it is hardly surprising that they pillage,
rape and live off the countryside. If the country has not got one
co-ordinated security force, if each of the contenders has his own
forces, and if there are still the remnants of rebel armies, it is not
surprising that there is a problem with peace and stability.</p><p><a name="stpa_o130"><a name="61116-0006.htm_para21"><a name="06111632000279">We also have to look at the
issue of natural resources, which have been hugely exploited. Reports
have shown that the contracts have been given out in a way that has not
been fair and reasonable. That will have to be tackled, but it will be
difficult because there are too many interests involved. That needs to
be taken on board. It is estimated that the resources are worth perhaps
$300 billion over the next 25 years.</p><p><a name="st_o128"><a name="06111632000280"><b><a name="61116-0006.htm_spnew1"><a name="06111632000848">Norman

taken up the issue of company transparency and has been working with
some of the companies in relation to that. There has been an
International Development Committee report quite recently on that
subject. There has also been a parliamentary report of the old
Parliament in the Congo. One difficulty is all the vested interests of
those who have been involved in giving out the contracts. The potential
wealth is there, and as that wealth increases again and people start
getting things out of the mines again, one of the dangers will relate
to where that money will go. If it is available and goes in the wrong

find a way of using those resources&#151;I agree that that means
putting pressure on the companies, making sure that we take the issue

realise that they can put pressure on and demand things. That is
important. I am pleased that the Department for International

polling stations that we visited was in a tropical rainforest clearing,
where we were told that 513 out of 517 potential voters had voted in
the first ballot. I am envious of those turnout figures, although I am
not sure what lessons we could learn. We could try to make our
elections more interesting; special material was provided for everyone
to wear for the Congolese elections and the returning officers were
kitted out in election robes, so perhaps we should add a bit more
entertainment and life to our elections, as that might encourage more
people to participate.</p><p><a name="stpa_o135"><a name="61116-0006.htm_para26"><a name="06111632000288">The Queen&#146;s Speech

Congolese rainforest is thus important. There are not many roads in the
country, so it is not easy for the logging companies to get to such
areas. As soon as there are more roads, that will become easier. It is
essential that we put pressure on people and give support to stop

cut that enables one to meet that target most quickly, rather than
making the best cut, the most rational long-term decision, or even the
cut that delivers the best service improvements or avoids damaging
services. Such instability in services damages the morale of people in
the NHS. Many of us will have met NHS employees during the recent mass
lobby of Parliament. They gave me the clear message that the Government
are doing damage to the goodwill and morale of people working in the
NHS, who are its greatest resource. If we undermine their goodwill and
willingness to go the extra mile&#151;there is often no financial or
professional reward for doing so, given that innovation is regularly
stifled&#151;we damage the NHS. Such regular top-slicing cannot go

tough call. Ministers set the legislative framework. Within that
framework, Alzheimer&#146;s drugs and drugs such as Velcade raise
similar issues, such as what benefits to take into account. However, we
should also consider whether the independent body in question should
have to take the drug price as a given. In my view, it should not. It

society on how to use taxpayer&#146;s money most
efficiently&#151;is the best example today of exactly that. The

Valley was talking about slightly dubious elections, I wondered whether
she was thinking of foundation trust board elections, which we have
been examining. If that is the governance structure of the future
health service&#151;we must remember that every trust will be a
foundation trust&#151;I have grave concerns about the existence of
proper local democratic accountability in the health service. Let me
give a few
examples.</p><p><a name="stpa_o155"><a name="61116-0007.htm_para16"><a name="06111632000321">In February
2006, the snappily named Basildon and Thurrock University Hospitals NHS
Foundation Trust held elections for 13 governors: nine were elected
unopposed, as were four staff governors. Rather than getting people
engaged in the cut and thrust of vibrant democracy in which competing
views on local health services are aired, the trust could barely get
enough people to stand, so it held more elections. A few months later,
in April, the trust issued 4,000 voting papers of which 1,000 were
returned&#151;1,000, from a population of 310,000. I calculate that
one third of 1 per cent. of the people of Basildon chose the governors
of their local trust, yet that is what the Government mean by local
democratic accountability. I know that local government turnouts are
not great, but when we get to one third of 1 per cent., we have
problems.</p><p><a name="stpa_o156"><a name="61116-0007.htm_para17"><a name="06111632000322">Were that
the only such example, we might say, &#147;Well, that&#146;s only
Basildon,&#148; but it is not. In Gloucestershire in April 2005, 18
of the 20 positions were filled unopposed. In Homerton in September
2006&#151;only a couple of months ago&#151;half of the eight
positions were filled unopposed. In August, there was no competition
for seven of 10 posts at the Liverpool Women's Hospital NHS Foundation
Trust. At the Royal Berkshire NHS Foundation Trust, eight positions
were uncontested. In the 2006 elections to the Rotherham NHS Foundation
Trust, 12 of the 14 posts were uncontested. The story is the same
elsewhere. That is the revolution of democratic accountability in the
national health service&#151;the way in which every hospital will be
run.</p><p><a name="stpa_o157"><a name="61116-0007.htm_para18"><a name="06111632000323">When people are
elected, what do they do? They are not being elected to the board; they
are being elected as governors, but the governors are not the people
who make the decisions. The board makes the decisions. I have come
across trusts that are saying that now they have local people elected
as governors, they do not need local authority representatives on the
board.The end result might be less local democratic
accountability, rather than more. The national health service&#146;s
direction of travel should be toward real local democratic
accountability, not sham accountability, which is what we find in too
many foundation trusts.</p><p><a name="stpa_o158"><a name="61116-0007.htm_para19"><a name="06111632000324">Local democratic accountability
is different from patient and public involvement. I was slightly
confused when the Secretary of State intimated that the Department was
seeking legislative time to legislate on patient and public
involvement. Do I infer from that that she has not been successful in
getting that time? I would be grateful for clarification. From the fact
that

infer that she failed to get legislative time? Does she hope to get it,
but is not sure of doing so?</p><p><a name="stpa_o159"><a name="61116-0007.htm_para20"><a name="06111632000325">It is indicative of the
importance that the Government attach to patient and public involvement
that they abolished first the community health councils, and then the
newly created patient and public involvement forums&#151;a putative
new scheme, but the Government cannot even find time for the
legislation that might put it in place. There has been a complete
failure of local democratic accountability, and a failure to find
parliamentary time for patient and public involvement, and the reason
is that the Government think that they know best. They have decided
what they want done with the health service, but the public have an
inconvenient way of saying something different. That is the problem,
and that is why we need greater democratic accountability.</p><p><a name="stpa_o160"><a name="61116-0007.htm_para21"><a name="06111632000326">Another area in which we would
like to change the direction of travel is health and social care; we
want those two services to work together much more closely. The
Under-Secretary of State for Health, the hon. Member for Bury, South
(Mr. Lewis), who has responsibility for social care, today
made a statement headed &#147;Dignity in Care&#148;, which says
that there is to be extra money for care homes next year, which is
obviously welcome. The money will &#147;further the dignity
agenda&#148;, and there will be &#147;dignity tests&#148; and
&#147;champions of dignity&#148;. Who could be against any of that?
However, the reality is that, in social services departments across the
land, people&#146;s serious home-care needs are not being met,
because local authorities are up against it and have to restrict the
availability of social care. The Secretary of State, in her
&#147;It&#146;s nothing to do with me, guv,&#148; mode, would
say, &#147;Well, that&#146;s down to councils.&#148; Does she
accept any responsibility for the fact that growing numbers of elderly
and frail people cannot get the care that they need? That is clearly
happening, and the restriction is getting
tighter.</p><p><a name="st_o145"><a name="06111632000327"><b><a name="61116-0007.htm_spnew13"><a name="06111632000865">Sarah

problem is that, in an effort to make cost savings, many primary care

another reason why budget pooling, and greater co-ordination between
health and social care, would mean that money was not shunted from one
pot to another, and people were not shunted from one part of the system
to another. Instead, the system would be seen as an integrated whole,
and the service would be delivered in the way that was best for the
individual, not in a way that enabled one organisation to balance its
books at the expense of another, as that is not the way to run
services. That has to be the direction of
travel.</p><p><a name="stpa_o161"><a name="61116-0007.htm_para22"><a name="06111632000329">Two pieces of

substantially, because now that they can be named, donors realise that,

children, one donation of sperm can generate a maximum of 20 children
and, in principle, all 20 could turn up on the donor&#146;s doorstep

consequences? The theory behind getting rid of anonymity is that
children have a right to know who their parents are, but the reality is
that people are buying sperm off the internet, or are going abroad to
get donated sperm, and in those circumstances they have no idea who the
donors are.</p><p><a name="stpa_o164"><a name="61116-0007.htm_para25"><a name="06111632000334">I
understand that there is a good flow of trade from Bristol

have repeatedly written on the subject to the Minister of State,
Department of Health, the hon. Member for Don Valley (Caroline Flint),

there is no problem, and that there should just be more effort made on

will take it seriously and will think again about the consequences of
legislation that was well-meaning, but that is causing practical
problems.</p>

much of the work that the Government have already begun, and which
addresses critical problems that we must face, such as climate change,
organised crime and the security of our people. A number of my remarks
will be about security, because despite our economic successes, we all
know that there is a feeling of insecurity in society. One of the great
paradoxes of our time is that although prosperity has risen, and
although many people have more material goods than was imaginable just
a couple of generations ago, they still feel under threat. That threat
may be real, as the terrorist threat is, or it may be a matter of
perception. Those kids at the end of the street may be up to no good,

for us politicians is that it is often hard to get people to believe in
the real threats, such as the terrorist threat that everyone in the

and secure community, that they are not safe in their own homes. Much
of the legislation in the Queen&#146;s Speech aims to deal with
external threats, such as organised crime, antisocial behaviour and so
on, but I want to consider some of the other reasons why people may
feel insecure, and how we can deal with them. Although that insecurity
often manifests itself expressly in a fear of crime, the roots of
people&#146;s insecurity go much deeper. They relate to the profound
changes that society has undergone.</p><p><a name="stpa_o169"><a name="61116-0008.htm_para4"><a name="06111632000340">The world that my parents knew

grandparents, aunties and cousins all lived around us. My family, like
many others, is scattered around the country, and the sense of security
that derived from having one&#146;s extended family nearby has gone.
People often have to work irregular hours to cope with the demands of a
24/7 society. Having grown up in a household where my father worked

It is no use politicians lamenting those changes&#151;they have taken
place, and we have to cope with them. The question for us is how we
build a society that is sufficiently secure in its beliefs and
confident of its values to be able to cope with change and regard it as
an opportunity, not a threat. An insecure society, like people who feel
insecure, cannot cope with change. Security has an economic foundation,
and the Government have achieved a great deal in that regard. In 1997,
families in some parts of my constituency were suffering from
third-generation unemployment. Children were growing up not knowing
what it was like for someone in the family to go out to work. Now,
however, the number of people in employment is greater than the
proportion in Beveridge&#146;s definition of full employment, and we
expect another 12,000 jobs to be generated once the biggest industrial
development in the region comes on stream. However, people not only
need to believe that they are doing well now to feel secure but that
they will continue to do so in future. Many people who are in work grew
up in a period of recession, and they worry about what will happen to
their jobs in future. Some people who are in work suffer as a result of

education seriously, but may I point out to the Secretary of State for
Education and Skills that many of our efforts, for understandable
reasons, have been directed at young people? We must think about
adults, too, because over the next 20 years, the economy will need an

learning reps scheme, which is one of the Government&#146;s great
unsung successes. We must learn from that success, and pay attention to
a sector that enables people to learn things that may not be directly
relevant to their employment. The question for us is how we build on
that engagement with the education system so that they can move on. We
must remember, however, that without that system, those people would
never go through the door of a college. We must work with them where
they are.</p><p><a name="stpa_o173"><a name="61116-0008.htm_para8"><a name="06111632000344">Another
problem is to upskill our existing work force. I hope that the
Government will look carefully at the pilots in the north-west and the
midlands to allow people to achieve level 3 skills in work. As the
number of unskilled jobs declines we will require the work force to
have a much higher level of skill, so people&#146;s future economic
security will depend on such skills. Economic security is not an end in
itself&#151;it is a means to an end. Unless we enable people to use
that economic security to build good lives for themselves in decent,
stable communities, we will fail. As politicians, we face two problems.
First, how do we reconcile the needs of the community with growing
individualism in society? Secondly, on a related point, how do we build
and promote a system of values by which we can all
abide?</p><p><a name="stpa_o174"><a name="61116-0008.htm_para9"><a name="06111632000345">Politicians are
very good at talking about individuals. We all fight election campaigns
on the platform, &#147;What we can do for you and what will happen to
you in future&#148;. Life, however, is more complicated. The rise of
individualism has many benefits, because it allows people to live as
they wish and to defy convention, but we need to find a language to
talk about the meshing of the individual and the community. Our lives
do not proceed along parallel lines&#151;it is not a question of me
and everyone else&#151;as our paths cross or merge for a time. Unless
I as an individual or anyone else live in a secure community, my life
will not be as secure, safe and prosperous as it could be. It used to
be easy to explain such things when there were many big institutions,
but those institutions have declined, so we must find a new language to
talk to people about the things that we need to do for the benefit of
all.</p><p><a name="stpa_o175"><a name="61116-0008.htm_para10"><a name="06111632000346">The Government
have made several efforts in that direction, but I want to touch on a
few issues that need to be addressed if people are to feel secure.
First, in the inner cities and areas such as mine where house prices
are much higher than in surrounding areas, it is difficult for young
people to get a foot on the housing ladder. There is not enough rented
accommodation, and the available housing is often of poor quality. I
admit that we are schizophrenic about that&#151;we all want our
children to have access to good, affordable housing, but we do not want
it to be built near us. We must address that problem, because many
families fear that their children will not be able to do as well as
they did, and they will not get their foot on the ladder because of
housing problems. I commend the Government on encouraging more forms of
home ownership and on their investment to bring housing up to a decent
standard. However, those new forms of home ownership must be spread
more widely if we are to tackle the problem.</p><br>

provision of affordable housing. Quite simply, developers often wriggle
out of their obligation to provide affordable housing on developments,
but they should not be allowed to do so. We must consider, too, the
development of housing tenure, as it has split communities. I grew up
on a council estate with mixed communities, but that is no longer the
case in many areas, where social housing has become the preserve of the
old and the poor. That is a recipe for problems further down the line.
We need many more mixed developments of houses for sale and for rent,
whether through social landlords, housing associations, private
developers or, dare I tell Ministers, local authorities.</p><p><a name="stpa_o177"><a name="61116-0008.htm_para12"><a name="06111632000348">A local government Bill was

changing the structure of local authorities that we will reinvigorate
local government. What matters is what they are able to do. When I grew
up, the local authority built housing for sale, as well as for rent,
and built it where I lived. There is no reason why local authorities
should not do that in
future.</p><p><a name="st_o150"><a name="06111632000349"><b><a name="61116-0008.htm_spnew1"><a name="06111632000870">Mr.

issue that we need to face is the environment in which many people
live. We talk a lot about the environment in general terms, but what
people see is what is outside their front door every day. Although the
Government have done a great deal through the single regeneration
budget, there are still areas, particularly in authorities like mine,
where not enough effort has been put into improving the general
environment in which people live. Authorities like mine, which include
very prosperous areas and very deprived areas, do not come high on the
scale of deprivation when they are measured overall. We need to get
much more realistic and much cleverer about how we target funding for
these
matters.</p><p><a name="stpa_o179"><a name="61116-0008.htm_para14"><a name="06111632000352">Environmental

to be sorted out, it is often not enforced locally. That is what we
need to focus on&#151;not just on environmental factors, but on
antisocial behaviour in general.</p><p><a name="stpa_o180"><a name="61116-0008.htm_para15"><a name="06111632000353">I fully support the

legislation in the House which is not being used. I have seen examples
of people who have waited two years to get anything done about their
antisocial neighbours. I have seen people who have filled in nuisance
neighbour diaries, which have been lost. I have seen people who had

Government have made huge advances in education, but if I have one
comment to make, it is this: we should not talk about education only in
economic terms. Of course, a good education system must equip people to
earn their own living. If it does not do that, it has failed, but it
has to do much more than that. It must equip our young people to
behave, to learn, to live in a society that encapsulates respect for
those values. There are things that money cannot buy, such as respect
for other people, a commitment to the service of others, the ability to
discuss the great issues of the day, the ability to use
leisure.</p><p><a name="st_o152"><a name="06111632000358"><b><a name="61116-0008.htm_spnew3"><a name="06111632000872">Mr.

We have a great opportunity to do that now through the

value-free. The Select Committee on Education and Skills is undertaking
an inquiry into citizenship education. I do not want to pre-empt that

and nurture the good, positive qualities in our youngsters. That is our
job as adults, and if we fail in it, we will be failing for the future.
I hope those young people will grow up to be active citizens engaged in
their communities, as I hope many more adults now will be. But the one
thing that is necessary in order to be engaged in the community is
time, and that too we must consider. We need time for our families and
to volunteer to be a parish councillor or whatever. The Government have
done wonders in family legislation, with improvements to maternity
leave, the introduction of paternity and adoption leave, and the right
in some circumstances to request flexible working, but in future we
will have to look at our long hours culture. Longer hours do not
necessarily mean greater efficiency. In future, if we want a society

certainly welcome two particular measures, limited though they are. The
first is the measure to deal with long-term pensions. I obviously
welcome the legislation to start implementing the recommendations of

what I understand, the Government do not intend to deal with the
central issue of equity to put existing as well as new members of

their 60s, not least to restore the damage done by the
Chancellor&#146;s attack on pension funds, while those in the public
sector schemes will still be able to claim their fully indexed rights
so much earlier. That cannot be right, and if we are to have long-term
pensions reform, we will need to return to the issue of equity between
the public and the private
sides.</p><p><a name="stpa_o194"><a name="61116-0009.htm_para1"><a name="06111632000370">Secondly on
pensions, I hope that the legislation will also give us the opportunity
to see what we can do to put the longer-term pensions issue on to a
more permanent basis. I am struck how in the United States the future
of pensions policy is not a partisan matter. There is widespread
agreement between the parties in the United States, and it is not an
election issue or a major party-political issue. The Turner commission
suggested that it might be given some kind of permanence, and that it
might become some kindof standing commission. The Governor of
the Bank of England has asked us to reflect on how the new successful
arrangements for monetary policy might be replicated in other areas of
public policy, and long-term pensions policy might well be one of
those. It might well be better if we were able to turn to some more
independent figure, other than the Secretary of State of either
party&#151;perhaps the Government Actuary relabelled as the public
actuary, perhaps the pension regulator. I do not know how it might be
structured, but when we are considering pensions overall, we need some
more independent source of advice. The Government Actuary&#146;s
Department advises on the various public sector schemes, but that
advice is not always published, so does not contribute to the public
debate in the way that I would like to see.</p><p><a name="stpa_o195"><a name="61116-0009.htm_para2"><a name="06111632000371">Secondly there is the Bill to
legislate for the independence of statistics. That is welcome, though
it has been a long time in coming. The Government first promised to
introduce an independent national statistical service in their 1997
manifesto. The Green Paper was published back in 1998. It was entitled
&#147;Statistics: A Matter of Trust&#148;. It might better have
been entitled &#147;Statistics: A Matter of Time&#148;, because we
have had to wait some eight years for the legislation. However, it is
welcome, and I will not go into great detail on it, not least because I
spoke on this subject at a conference with the Financial Secretary
yesterday because I had the honour to be in the Chair for the Treasury
Sub-Committee report into independence for statistics, one of the main

three specific issues, which are touched on in the Queen&#146;s
Speech, but which I think need more attention: public service reform,
competitiveness and localism. I begin with public service reform. As
many of my hon. Friends have said, so much money has been spent and so
many new bodies have been created, yet with so little result. In the
national health service, trusts are still not free to set their own
pay. Through the power of the royal colleges on the one hand, and the
power of the trade unions on the other, we still have national rates,
terms and conditions and working practices that do not enable the best
trusts to vary, differentiate and experiment with different ways of
working in the delivery of health care. Community hospitals are back in
vogue and, properly, supported by the Government in a welcome White
Paper, but that is not properly thought through.

trusts that want to establish community hospitals find that they first
have to sort out how the new trust that has just come into existence
wants to take account of the overall pattern of community hospitals in
the wider area, as well as having to compete for attention with the
&#147;fit for purpose&#148; exercise that is examining almost
everything else. Furthermore, the growing inflexibility of the private
finance initiative means that acute hospitals are in danger not only
from the purchasing and commissioning power of PCTs, which can change
from year to year, but from the costs of longer leases whereby rental
payments have to be paid for 25, 30 or 35 years to come.</p><p><a name="stpa_o202"><a name="61116-0009.htm_para9"><a name="06111632000378">As the hon. Member for
Northavon (Steve Webb) rightly reminded us, we have an increasingly
demoralised NHS work force&#151;people who were, rightly, encouraged
by the Government to train for and to join the NHS. We have all had in
our constituencies cases of physiotherapists, midwives and health
visitors who cannot find the post that they were originally promised
and are denied the jobs for which they trained. Trusts are under such
financial pressure that they are tempted to cut out what may be too
cheaply labelled as the softer end of the NHS&#151;vital services

refers to a stable economy, but that is not quite the same thing. A
stable economy is a necessary condition of our future prosperity, but
not a sufficient condition. We need to be more competitive. I am
worried that we are slipping down the various competitiveness league
tables. Of course, Front-Benchers can bandy about league tables from
different sources to prove whether we are fourth, fifth or 11th, and
whether our position has worsened. Nevertheless, I want to share with
the House the results of an exercise that I ask the Library to do every
three or four years&#151;to measure gross domestic product per head,
on a purchasing power parity basis to eliminate the differences in

us per head. Much more interesting, however, is the comparison of GDP
per head when the UK is ranked with each of the 50 states of the US,
which shows that we would come 44th. Only Mississippi, West Virginia,
Arkansas, Montana and Oklahoma are poorer than the UK in those terms,

reversing that trend, but this Government have certainly made things
worse by increasing the burdens of taxation and of regulation. At
first, the Prime Minister wanted to place us at the heart of Europe,
but then he signed the social chapter. The Government are bending every
sinew in Brussels to get out of the impact of the working time
directive, which will not only hit businesses and make us less
competitive but, as the Government know full well, hit our public
services, not least the NHS. It will affect the social and caring

has added immeasurably to the burden of regulation on British business.

achieving that agenda. Three times he had the majority to do that, and
he had a successful economy in which to introduce the necessary
reforms. However, 10 years later, it all appears to have been frittered
away. Of 25,000 schools, 50 are interested in trust status. Of 250 NHS

impossible to create financial discipline in the NHS if we do not ask

is brought back into balance to achieve a fairer funding settlement for
our constituents. In the past, overspending organisations had no
incentive to improve because they knew that they would be bailed out by
underspending parts of the NHS. That is unfair. When we examine the
matter carefully, it becomes clear that the overspenders are mostly in

problems will understandably take some time to do that, and the

of the reconfiguration of health care in his region, but I do know that
in the south-east or south-central areas there are very few compulsory
redundancies in comparison with the numbers claimed in the Conservative
party&#146;s press releases. That is a fact also, even if the hon.
Gentleman does not like it.</p><p><a name="stpa_o239"><a name="61116-0010.htm_para8"><a name="06111632000424">A small number of jobs have
been lost, but nowhere near as many as the number suggested by the
figures that the shadow Health Secretary quoted. Strategic health
authorities have reported 903 compulsory redundancies between April and
September this year, but eight out of every 10 of those redundancies
will have been among non-clinical staff. In the north-west, there were
only four compulsory redundancies among clinical staff during that
period. Change can be difficult, but when society changes, in both age
and expectation, that change is vital.</p><p><a name="stpa_o240"><a name="61116-0010.htm_para9"><a name="06111632000425">The NHS continues to improve
for patients and staff. It is important not to see every job loss as a
sign of failure. No hon. Member likes to see redundancies, but the
number of jobs that have been lost in the NHS is small when compared
with the increase in overall manpower since 1997. The hard work and
dedication of NHS staff, backed by Labour&#146;s investment and
reform, are transforming patient care year on year. Let us be clear:
without the staff, none of what has been achieved by the NHS would have
been possible.</p><br>

Speech declared that a new mental health Bill would be introduced in
this Session. That was a Labour party manifesto commitment and I very
much welcome the news. New legislation will do much substantially to
bolster the Government&#146;s commitment to patients&#146; rights
and public safety. The mental health Bill will address concerns about
public safety and keep pace with the growth of community-based
treatments. Increased supervised treatment in the community will ensure
that treatment regimes are kept to and will help prevent deterioration
in patients&#146; health. I very much welcome the Bill. If the
community is the best place to treat an individual&#146;s mental
illness, it is vital both to ensure that the patient receives the care
that they require and to build confidence among the public that the
individual will be properly supervised.</p><p><a name="stpa_o242"><a name="61116-0010.htm_para11"><a name="06111632000427">The Bill is in addition to the
massive improvements that have affected my constituency, along with the
whole country. New reforms will ensure that improvements on the same
scale continue in the future. Virtually no one waits more than six
months for an operation now, with the average wait for an operation
being only 7.6 weeks. Patients can now expect a maximum 13-week wait
for an out-patient appointment, with the average wait being only eight
weeks. More than 99 per cent. of people with suspected cancer are seen
by a specialist within two weeks of being referred urgently by their
GP. Nearly 99 per cent. of people with cancer are treated within 31
days of diagnosis and more than 91 per cent. of people are treated
within 62 days of being urgently referred by their GP. Some 19 out of
20 patients are seen, treated and discharged from accident and
emergency within four hours. More lives are being saved. Deaths from
the big killers, such as cancer and coronary heart disease, are now
falling ahead of target.</p><p><a name="stpa_o243"><a name="61116-0010.htm_para12"><a name="06111632000428">Reform will bring even more
improvement to NHS care. The Government are working towards their goal
of 18 weeks between GP referral and operation. Choice will be a major
driver to deliver that radical improvement. My constituents want more
choice about when and where they receive treatments. They want more
care in their local communities and at home. The choices that they will
make will demonstrate that our collective public services can meet
their personal needs and aspirations.</p><p><a name="stpa_o244"><a name="61116-0010.htm_para13"><a name="06111632000429">Choice and reform are integral
to improvement, whether we are discussing the hard-working single
parent who wants to be treated in a fast and efficient way in a
treatment centre near their work, rather than at home, or diabetes
patients who want to access their medical records online in order to
take them to a different GP, as the patients of Haughton Green medical
centre in my constituency now can. Choice and freedom will lead to
improvement. If we give patients the medical services that they want,
rather than the ones that Whitehall thinks that they want, money will
be saved, fewer appointments will be missed and my busy and
hard-working constituents will receive the treatments that they need,
when and where it is convenient for them.</p><p><a name="stpa_o245"><a name="61116-0010.htm_para14"><a name="06111632000430">Our goal must be to deliver the

Government give a commitment in the Queen&#146;s Speech to introduce
legislation to provide a better framework for those suffering from
mental illness. The recent history of attempts to introduce legislation
to update, modernise and make more relevant the Mental
HealthAct 1983&#151;which was the last major piece of
legislation governing the way in which we treat and look after people
suffering from mental illness&#151;has been long and chequered. The
proposals have received pre-legislative scrutiny and there has been a
draft Bill, which has aroused a considerable amount of controversy in
certain quarters. The Government have considered the legislation and
Opposition parties of all complexions have voiced their concerns and
support where appropriate.</p><p><a name="stpa_o248"><a name="61116-0010.htm_para17"><a name="06111632000434">I am delighted that the

wish to devote my speech to the ins and outs of the Bill, which is
published today, except to say that the overriding desire must be to
help to provide the finest treatment possible to those suffering from
mental illness, rather than getting the balance wrong and looking at
the issue too much in the context of the criminal justice system.
However, I accept that there are aspects of mental health care and
treatment that will inevitably involve the criminal justice system. We
must not lose sight of that.</p><p><a name="stpa_o249"><a name="61116-0010.htm_para18"><a name="06111632000435">The theme on which I want to
concentrate initially is in some ways a by-product of the legislation,
but to me it is just as important: the way in which society regards
those people who are unfortunate enough to suffer from mental illness,
and the stigma and fear in society associated with those medical
conditions. It was Enoch Powell, back in 1963, who introduced the
concept of care in the community, rather than having people locked up
in long-stay hospitals, out of mind and out of sight, where their
conditions, quality of life and environment were horrendous. The basic
ethos of the policy since then has been to integrate people into the
community, where they can receive their treatment and

absolutely the right philosophy and guidance to adopt in a civilised
society.</p><p><a name="stpa_o250"><a name="61116-0010.htm_para19"><a name="06111632000436">There must of
course be safeguards, as the Minister would be one of the first to
accept. I, too, was a Minister for mental health many years ago and
that duty was uppermost in our minds then. There are still flaws in the
system, and they need to be addressed, but that does not mean that we
must abandon and compromise the basic principle of care and decide that
just because an individual suffers from mental illness, they must be
isolated and treated differently from those suffering from
appendicitis, flu or cancer. There must be equality, and there must
also be protection for those individuals who are a threat to other
citizens, but that is a different issue. We must ensure that we have in
place a system that can recognise and identify those people who are
safe and who should be treated in the community and those people who
are a threat to themselves or others and who need a more secure form of
residence and treatment. That requirement is not an overriding problem
that invalidates the concept of appropriate mental health
care.</p><p><a name="stpa_o251"><a name="61116-0010.htm_para20"><a name="06111632000437">If we accept
that basic premise of a civilised society, we must consider how to
change the public&#146;s perception. The public&#146;s attitude
towards people with mental illness is radically different from their
attitude to other acute illnesses. If one suffers, sadly, from cancer
or one has flu, there is tremendous sympathy, concern and interest
among family and friends&#151;we have all have come across that
throughout our lives&#151;but if one suffers from mental illness,
however mild, there is fear and a stigma attached, and that starts with
the patients themselves. They are fearful of telling
people&#151;sometimes, even members of their own
families&#151;about their illness because they are frightened of the
reaction and the raw prejudice to which they may be exposed. Beyond
one&#146;s family and friends, members of the public in general may
be frightened. They always assume the worst, because they do not
understand the complexities and conditions of mental illness.</p><p><a name="stpa_o252"><a name="61116-0010.htm_para21"><a name="06111632000438">Sufferers become the butt of
jokes, prejudice and may be shunned and subject to associated ill
treatment. Although that has gone on for generations, significant
attempts have been made not only by the voluntary and charity sector,
which does a fantastic job in providing help, support and practical
assistance to the sufferers of mental illnesses, but by Governments to
minimise such negative reaction. In the 1990s, my own Government
started the process to try to reduce the stigma of mental illness and
to break down the barriers. To their credit, this Government have done
so, too. It would be stupid to suggest that, on 1 May 1997, all the
good work that was being done before then stopped and that this
Government have done nothing. It would be equally stupid to claim that
everything that this Government have done in that respect from 1 May
1997 has been wonderful and that the previous Government did nothing.
We may have started too late&#151;society may have started the
process too late&#151;but we made that start in the 1990s, and to
their credit, this Government have carried on with that and built upon
it.</p><br>

important parts of the mental health Bill relates to the ability to
undertake supervised treatment in the community. I am sure that, too
often, he met the carers of people with mental health problems who felt
that the stigma and discrimination was increased because, under the
previous legislation, people always had to be detained in hospital.
When people were no longer in hospital receiving treatment, they would
deteriorate and carers had no ability to help them in the recovery

relevant authorities, such as the police, social workers, the health
service and the voluntary sector, were concerned about an individual.
Although everyone was convinced it was only a matter of time before

that it halved the salary bill for chief executives. However, it was
inevitable that, once the election was over, PCTs were going to merge
into more viable, realistically sized PCTs. We have probably reached
that stage now. Certainly in Essex we have, where fortunately the
Minister's Department listened to the lobbying of Members of Parliament
and others and the number of PCTs went down from 13 to five, rather
than the two that the health community proposed in Essex. That number

that that is a particularly clever idea. Earlier this year, the Home
Office backed away from doing it with the police, which I welcomed. It
is a mistake and a pity that the ambulance services were merged into
one very large east of England regional service, but time will tell.
The jury is out and we will have to wait and see.</p><p><a name="stpa_o262"><a name="61116-0011.htm_para6"><a name="06111632000457">The hon. Member for Denton and

invested in them both financially and in time and in training. They are
now trained, have experience and are all ready to put something back
into the health service, but a significant proportion of them cannot
get any jobs in local hospitals; my local hospital announced six weeks
ago that it is losing 245 jobs. We have invested in skills and in
training people for an essential vocation&#151;nursing&#151;yet,
ironically, they have the frustration of not being able to go into the

provided funding to set up the wards, which were to relieve the
problems of delayed discharges at Broomfield hospital andSt.
John&#146;s hospital, so that we did not have beds being wasted by
people remaining in them whose medical condition did not warrant that.
The three intermediate care wards were established. We saw a
significant drop in the problems of delayed discharges at the acute
hospital and the wards were extremely good, but because of the
&#163;13 million deficit at Chelmsford PCT, now all three wards have
closed, solely as a money-saving exercise, not because there was no

say that I welcome the central thrust of yesterday&#146;s legislative
package, which is to tackle the big issues of today&#151;the changing
nature of crime, the causes and effects of climate change and the need
for pension reform. Each of those issues is of great concern to my
constituents, and I look forward to helping to progress the new
legislation through this House, and&#151;possibly more important, and
as has been remarked on more than one occasion today&#151;to ensuring
that it is put into effect once it is
enacted.</p><p><a name="stpa_o267"><a name="61116-0011.htm_para11"><a name="06111632000463">I wish
however mainly to confine my brief remarks to the mental health Bill.
It is interesting&#151;and perhaps a little regrettable&#151;that
the mental health Bill has been introduced in an atmosphere that
emphasises the need for security. It might have been better to have
reassured the many people&#151;some estimate the figure to be as high
as one in four of the population&#151;who at some time in their lives
will suffer from a mental illness. Incidentally, the great majority of
them pose no threat to anyone&#151;save, on occasion, to themselves.
It would have been better to have reassured such people that the
outdated laws&#151;they date back to 1983&#151;will be replaced by
modern legislation that will uphold the human rights of patients,
provide easy access to care for people with mental illnesses and allow
the use of compulsory treatment only as a last resort. The words used
by Her Majesty yesterday reflect
that:</p><a name="61116-0011.htm_brev1"><a name="06111632000694"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;A Bill
will be introduced to provide a better framework for treating people
with mental disorders.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="stpa_o268"><a name="61116-0011.htm_para12"><a name="06111632000464">I
hope that that will be the main focus of the Bill as it passes through
both Houses of
Parliament.</p><p><a name="stpa_o269"><a name="61116-0011.htm_para13"><a name="06111632000465">I spent
much of the parliamentary Session of 2004-05 as a member of the Joint
Committee on the then draft Mental Health Bill. That was an interesting
and rewarding experience. We took a great deal of evidence, deliberated
long and hard, and eventually produced a fairly lengthy, but well
targeted, report. It was well received by most of those best placed to
understand the issues. But unfortunately, not long after it was
published, the Government thanked us for our work and told us that they
had decided that they would not proceed with a draft Bill in that
form.</p><p><a name="stpa_o270"><a name="61116-0011.htm_para14"><a name="06111632000466">In our report,
we recognised that the current legislation was clearly out of date, and
that its replacement&#146;s</p><a name="61116-0011.htm_brev2"><a name="06111632000695"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;primary purpose...must be to

and the other place were disappointed that there was to be further
delay in replacing the outdated legislation. So the new proposals for a
mental health Bill that were put forward yesterday are most welcome,
and it is pleasing that some of them clearly reflect a number of the
points highlighted in our report: in particular, the increase in
availability and appropriateness of treatment, which the Minister has
emphasised; the emphasis on patients&#146; human rights; the
introduction of limited supervised treatment in the community, but only
after a period of treatment and assessment in hospital; the attempt to
agree a single definition of mental disorder; and expanding the skill

been addressed in the information provided about the proposed Bill.
They include conditions to ensure that legislation cannot be used
inappropriately. There is also no mention of the recommendation that
the threshold of risk for harm to others should be raised, or that
compulsion should be used only where a treatment is available which
would be of therapeutic benefit to the
patient.</p><p><a name="stpa_o273"><a name="61116-0011.htm_para17"><a name="06111632000469">A number of
other questions will be asked of the new Bill. Where a person&#146;s
decision-making is unimpaired, will they be allowed to refuse
treatment, as recommended in the report? Could there be separate
criteria, or different legislation, for dangerous people with severe
personality disorder, also as recommended in the report? Will the Bill
introduce new national training standards and monitoring, as
recommended in the
report?</p><p><a name="stpa_o274"><a name="61116-0011.htm_para18"><a name="06111632000470">Our report
also expressed serious concern in respect of the resources needed to
implement the proposals in the previous draft Bill, particularly in
relation to adequate staffing and funding for mental health tribunals.
Some of the evidence we took clearly demonstrated that, even under
current legislation, there are frequently difficulties in this area. If
there is to be expansion in the role of tribunals&#151;and even if
there is not&#151;it is essential that this matter be
addressed.</p><p><a name="stpa_o275"><a name="61116-0011.htm_para19"><a name="06111632000471">There have
been great improvements in mental health services over the past nine
years. There has been record spending on the service, and there are
thousands more nurses, psychiatrists and clinical psychologists, as
well as new early intervention services for young people, new outreach
teams improving access to mental health services, and crisis teams
providing care in patients&#146; homes. Against this background of
improving services, it is crucial that we have updated legislation, not
only to address concerns about public safety, but to keep pace with the
growth of modern community-based patient services and to be compatible
with the European convention on human rights, as well as to provide
properly for the Bournewood judgment, which will have a big
influence.</p><p><a name="stpa_o276"><a name="61116-0011.htm_para20"><a name="06111632000472">Before I
finish, I wish to refer to sperm donation, which was mentioned by my
constituency neighbour, the hon. Member for Northavon (Steve Webb). I
suspect that we have been briefed by the same consultant at the same
hospital in the Bristol area. Something of a crisis seems to have
developed since the recent legislation outlawing anonymity. There are
now apparently only two centres operating fully in terms of sperm
donation for the whole of the United Kingdom, as opposed to certainly
more than a dozen, and probably almost 20, before the new legislation
began to take effect. That must be addressed, and I trust that the
Minister will make sure that that message is relayed back to
headquarters.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="ordayhd_10"><a name="61116-0011.htm_ordayhd1"><a name="06111632000712">2.48

is perhaps no surprise that I will confine most of my remarks to

issue. Colleagues in all parts of the House have commented on the
primary care trust crisis and the problems arising from reorganisation;
indeed, my hon. Friend the Member for West Chelmsford (Mr.
Burns) made some valuable points in that respect. The number of primary
care trusts in Leicestershire is being reduced, which is affecting
Hinckley, in my constituency. The proposed improvements to the new
community hospital on the old Sunnyside hospital site were put on hold
for re-evaluation. Why? In my view, it was because the hospital is on
the fringe of the area. We see the same thing with policing. In cases
where the organisation in question is large, it is the police
stations&#151;or hospitals&#151;on the perimeter that tend to
suffer first. More generally, the health service is having massive
problems with procurement, which takes far too long, and there has been
a very poor review of contracts, but I will leave that issue to my hon.
Friends on the Front Bench, who will doubtless want to comment on
it.</p><p><a name="stpa_o279"><a name="61116-0011.htm_para23"><a name="06111632000476">In turning to the
importance of integrated health care in the health service, I want to
point out to the Minister that since the 1987 Parliament, which is when
I first entered the House, there has been a gradual and relentless
movement toward improved integration of alternative and complementary
medicine into the health service. During that Parliament, we introduced
as a private Bill&#151;I did not do so myself, but I sat on the
Committee that considered it&#151;the legislation regulating
osteopaths, who were seen as being outside the health service. In the
1992 Parliament, chiropractors came forward with a Bill, which was
passed successfully. As a result, osteopathy and chiropractic, which
used to be seen as out on the wings of medicine in Britain, are
increasingly part of its structure and
fabric.</p><p><a name="stpa_o280"><a name="61116-0011.htm_para24"><a name="06111632000477">I pay tribute

for consideration is integrated health care. Such an approach would fit
in with the Government&#146;s stated intention of increased patient
choice and more innovation. This is surely a great opportunity for the
Government to look carefully and seriously at existing therapies, of
which there are 60,000 practitioners. There are a lot of conditions
that doctors find very difficult to treat. For example, back pain: 91
per cent. of doctors surveyed said that musculo-skeletal problems were
among the most difficult to treat. After that, 45 per cent. of doctors
listed depression, 36 per cent. eczema and 32 per cent. chronic pain.
All those problems can be treated by complementary therapists, of whom
there are 60,000 in this country. They can alleviate the symptoms of

cost of drugs and other services offered by the NHS, they offer very
good value. The parliamentary integrated health care group met last
night, and Committee Room 8 was full. One of the homeopathic doctors
present said that his prescriptions often cost only 16p each.
Osteopaths and chiropractors use only their hands, and acupuncturists
use sterilised needles, with no big drugs bill attached. Healers just

threat.</p><p><a name="stpa_o290"><a name="61116-0012.htm_para1"><a name="06111632000495">Why are
complementary services and hospitals threatened with cuts? First, they
are often the easiest to cut; they are soft services on the edge of the
primary care trust vision. Secondly, when financial advisers are sent
in they do not really understand the provision of complementary
services; and thirdly, there is sometimes hostility from general
practitioners.</p><p><a name="stpa_o291"><a name="61116-0012.htm_para2"><a name="06111632000496">What
needs to be done? The Government need to do two things, which should
perhaps have been included in the Queen&#146;s Speech. I shall be
raising them when I visit the Minister, so she will be well briefed in
advance. First, the Government need a proper CAM delivery framework,
which does not exist at present. The development of such a framework
was intimated in the 2003 White Paper, &#147;Building on the Best:
Choice, Responsiveness and Equity in the NHS&#148;&#151;I do not
think that title was a joke. Secondly, there is a need for guidance
from the centre, which is completely lacking. When I talk to people in
the field in Leicestershire, they tell me that they receive nothing
from the centre, which is amazing because Richmond house is like the
Berlin bunker in some respects. Missives, orders and directives are
sent out and counters are moved around on the board; regulation of even
the tiniest surgery comes directly from Richmond house&#151;Josef
Stalin would have been happy with the way it is run. However, it is a
great sadness that there is no central guidance for PCTs about how
innovative service re-design could involve CAM, as suggested in the
latest White Paper, &#147;Our Health, Our Care, Our Say&#148;,
published in February 2006. The Minister can see that there is work to
be done.</p><p><a name="stpa_o292"><a name="61116-0012.htm_para3"><a name="06111632000497">I want to
give some brief examples of what a good complementary and alternative
medical practice can do. I have chosen the Impact integrated medicine
partnership, a Nottingham-based social enterprise, which provides free
acupuncture, chiropractic and homeopathy to patients with long-term
conditions in a primary care setting. There is practice-based evidence
of effectiveness in treating mental health conditions, musculo-skeletal
disorders, back pain, chronic pain and gynaecological and menstrual
disorders. As I have already noted, three of
those&#151;musculo-skeletal disorders, back pain and chronic
pain&#151;are conditions that doctors find difficult to treat and
where they perceive a 91 per cent. effectiveness
gap.</p><p><a name="stpa_o293"><a name="61116-0012.htm_para4"><a name="06111632000498">I shall not do a

three to show the effect

<notus-date day="16" month="11" year="2006" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><b>16 Nov 2006 : Column 206</b><br>on primary care. On completion of treatment at Impact, 87 per cent. of
patients reported that they either stopped or reduced their medication
on completion of treatment, which represents a saving of both
doctors&#146; time and NHS medicine bills. Three quarters of patients
reported that they visited their GP less often and some patients no
longer required secondary care. The Nottingham case is particularly
interesting because 48 per cent. of the patients&#151;nearly
half&#151;are from black and minority ethnic communities, in an area
where they comprise about 30 per cent. of the population overall.
Furthermore, 40 per cent. of the patients are men, which is very
unusual because usually one gets a much higher proportion of women,
which tends to indicate that there is a very high acceptance of the way
this practice is treating patients. Furthermore, a third of the
patients consider themselves to have a disability. So that service in
Nottingham provides a free service to the ethnic minorities&#151;to
those who are most disadvantaged&#151;and it is also treating others.
That is a very interesting role model for the Minister to consider; I
can provide her with the details if she wishes.</p><p><a name="stpa_o294"><a name="61116-0012.htm_para5"><a name="06111632000499">I shall discuss two other
issues. One is the general problem facing the homeopathic hospital
community, and I should like to give a couple of illustrations of cost
comparisons. There are in the United Kingdom five homeopathic
hospitals. They are Royal London, which has just been refurbished,
Glasgow, which is brand new&#151;I went to the opening two years
ago&#151;Bristol, Tunbridge Wells and Liverpool. All are threatened.
Tunbridge Wells came within three weeks of closure in September but it
is still going. Those hospitals have a total budget of &#163;6
million per annum. The total NHS budget is &#163;742 billion per
year. So the homeopathic hospitals&#146; budget is just under 1 per
cent. of the total. I will say straight away to the Minister that I
think they are incredibly good value for that small sum of
money.</p><p><a name="stpa_o295"><a name="61116-0012.htm_para6"><a name="06111632000500">Surveys have
been done to see whether the treatments are effective. The Bristol
homeopathic hospital did an outcomes study, not just of a percentage of
its patients, but of the lot. It surveyed 6,544 consecutive follow-up
patients, and the outcomes scores were as follows. They had all taken
homeopathic medicine, and they were asked whether it worked.
Seventy-one per cent.&#151;three quarters&#151;said that they had
improved, half said that they were better or much better, and
homeopathy was associated with positive health changes to a substantial
proportion of a large number of patients with a wide range of chronic
diseases. In other words, cutting out the jargon, the hospital was
treating lots of different people for lots of different
things&#151;lots of serious problems.</p><p><a name="stpa_o296"><a name="61116-0012.htm_para7"><a name="06111632000501">In the press recently there has
been much rubbishing of homeopathy generally. There have been some
front pages in the newspapers claiming that it does not work. But I
have looked into this carefully. Up to the end of 2005 there have been
119 randomised, peer-reviewed clinical trials&#151;randomised,
controlled trials of homeopathy, using placebo or active comparators.
Of those, half showed that homeopathy had a positive outcome, only 3
per cent. were negative and just under 50 per cent.&#151;48 per
cent.&#151;were inconclusive. So that shows a very positive outcome
indeed.</p><br>

some cost comparisons. I am indebted to the Royal London homeopathic
hospital for this information. I want to focus on two medical problems:
irritable bowel syndrome and intractable nerve back pain. With
irritable bowel syndrome, using conventional therapy&#151;referral to
gastroenterologist/endoscopy/colonoscopy/radiology &#151;would cost
approximately &#163;5,000 to &#163;15,000 per patient. If a patient
is treated at the out-patient department of the Royal London
homeopathic hospital&#151;that is one new treatment plus two to three
follow-ups and investigations&#151;the total cost is approximately
&#163;500 to &#163;1,000 a patient. So that is a fraction of the
other figure, with the same outcome. That itself, I say to the
Minister, needs investigating,</p><p><a name="stpa_o298"><a name="61116-0012.htm_para9"><a name="06111632000503">I have already said that
intractable low back pain is the most difficult problem for doctors to
treat; 91 per cent. of those doctors surveyed said that it was the most
difficult issue for them. For conventional therapy&#151;that is,
referral to orthopaedic/ rheumatology/pain relief/ongoing drugs costs
including MRI and CAT scans&#151;the total cost is between
&#163;5,000 and &#163;10,000 per patient. However, at Royal London
homeopathic, for one new out-patient appointment plus two to three
follow-ups, investigations and treatments, the total cost is
&#163;500 to &#163;1,500 per patient. We are talking about
phenomenal reductions in costs. If only the Government were able to see
a way of linking in those therapists, or boosting the hospitals that we
already have&#151;perhaps I should not be saying this. Perhaps we
should save this information for the incoming Conservative Government.

talk about the modernisation of healthcare, I must join the
argument about job losses and staff reductions. Like my eminent
predecessor,A. P. Herbert, I sometimes see myself as a referee
between the warring factions on either side. What we need in the case
of job losses, or staff reductions&#151;whatever we call
them&#151;is the truth. The Conservative Front-Bench health
spokesman, the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire (Mr.
Lansley), began to try to unravel the patterns. We have to separate
compulsory redundancies, voluntary redundancies, retirements when
people are not replaced, promotions when people are not replaced, the
vacancy freeze, and natural turnover. My acute trust has a natural
turnover of approximately 10 per cent., which is 450 jobs. If those are
not replaced, that means 450 fewer people doing the work. We need a
list of the 300,000 new posts, which the Government cite and which I do
not dispute, broken down into clinical staff and administrative
staff&#151;we need the detail&#151;and they should then be matched
with all the categories that are being reduced because of the various
sorts of staff reduction.</p><p><a name="stpa_o302"><a name="61116-0012.htm_para13"><a name="06111632000508">I want to talk about two
aspects of the modernisation of health care in particular: the National
Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence and hospital
reconfigurations. NICE has been much maligned recently, particularly
because it appears to be stopping extraordinarily useful drugs getting
to patients, and appears to be impeding innovation. It is partly
responsible for the UK&#146;s slow uptake of new drugs, which is not
half a bad thing when one considers the speed with which Vioxx was
taken up, and the problems that that caused.</p><p><a name="stpa_o303"><a name="61116-0012.htm_para14"><a name="06111632000509">I strongly support NICE, but
several criticisms of it can be made. Does it do everything right? Does
it get the selection of expert advisers right? The technology appraisal
committees are all generalist in nature, so they must depend on expert
advisers; the system must be absolutely right. Is the NICE process as
fast as it should be? Is the method of selecting the therapies that it
examines appropriate? Somehow we must allow it to approve more drugs
for use, which means lowering the cost-benefit ratio so that drugs to
combat diseases such as Alzheimer&#146;s become affordable.</p><p><a name="stpa_o304"><a name="61116-0012.htm_para15"><a name="06111632000510">There is a great deal of
discussion about drugs for wet age-related macular degeneration. I
believe that they will cost about &#163;6,000 a course, per patient.

swayed by that sort of pressure. There are ways in which NICE could
have a lower cost-effectiveness ratio and thus be able to recommend
much more in the way of treatment. This all comes down to the terrible
phrase that we are not allowed to use, &#147;health care
rationing&#148;. It is better to use the euphemism &#147;resource

on. Such resource management initiatives should be nationwide, and

doing, not because we can influence what doctors prescribe, but so that
we can ask PCTs why they are not saving &#163;2 million or
&#163;500,000 or whatever, when they can do so by simply increasing
the proportion of low-cost statins to 69 per cent., as the top 25 per
cent. of PCTs have done. That will not interfere with medical freedom,
because it will give doctors the scope to prescribe some of the
proprietary brands, if they feel that they have to. That is one way in
which more money could be made available for the drugs that we really
need. I hope that the Government will widen the initiative. I would
love them to consider Viagra, for example. It costs about &#163;5 per

practice and health service deficits, not all acute hospitals can keep
all services, particularly when they are close to other acute
hospitals. In the past fortnight, I have been lucky enough to have a
meeting with the Health Secretary and the chief executive of the NHS,
because I regard myself as one of the few people who know absolutely
how not to undertake a hospital reconfiguration. I told them that the
sort of thing that happened in my area&#151;the loss of all acute
in-patient services, and the total loss of accident and emergency
services and any practical emergency facilities&#151;would never be

likely to be acceptable. At my meeting with the chief executive of the
NHS I learned something amazing about a tiny hospital in Yorkshire.
When he was chief executive of the Doncaster Royal Infirmary NHS trust
he oversaw the merger of the tiny Montagu hospital at Mexborough with
Doncaster royal infirmary, but he made sure that the Montagu retained
medical admissions. In 2000, however, we were told that it was quite
impossible for our hospital to do so. The tiny Montagu hospital has 115
beds, including 56 for medical admissions and 16 for rehabilitation,
three physicians and five senior house officers&#151;so it is
possible to offer such services. The chief executive of

merger that did not rob a tiny hospital of everything, and kept various
services that we all want. Indeed, far more was kept than was kept at
Kidderminster. The bulk of emergencies are medical emergencies, so if a
hospital accepts such admissions it sees most people who would
otherwise go to a full accident and emergency centre. Reconfigurations
and mergers can be managed so that they work and are more acceptable
than those that took place in my

provision is particularly important. It is right that we do not have
the sort of Victorian institutions that I grew up around. The Runwell
hospital in Essex, which was close to my home and where many of my
friends used to work, was an appalling institution where people were
sent for reasons that had nothing to do with mental health. It was
right and proper that care in the community was introduced.</p><p><a name="stpa_o320"><a name="61116-0013.htm_para6"><a name="06111632000537">However, I have raised with the
Minister previously my grave concern that at times people need help
which cannot be delivered in their homes or in the community by their
local GPs and other experts. Very often, people want to admit
themselves to a ward, not only to get the help that they need, but so
that their carers can get the help that they might need at times.
Sadly, some of those wards are under threat as a result of the deficits
in some mental health trusts&#151;not least St. Julian&#146;s ward
in St. Albans in south-west Hertfordshire.</p><p><a name="stpa_o321"><a name="61116-0013.htm_para7"><a name="06111632000538">So many of the patients and
carers to whom I have spoken need such wards as a safety net. The wards
need not be full every day or every weekend, but they should exist as a
facility so that when care in the community cannot quite cope with
individual cases, patients can be admitted to a ward. In the vast
majority of cases, those are self-admissions. There is a great deal of
fear out there that we pushed too hard down the avenue of care in the
community, believing that everything could be done outside a
ward&#151;often outside a secure ward.</p><p><a name="stpa_o322"><a name="61116-0013.htm_para8"><a name="06111632000539">There is also
fear&#151;ill-founded in many cases&#151;that people who go into a
ward are a danger to the public. Very often, they are admitted because
they are a danger to themselves, and they know it. That is a difficult
mental health issue, as I know the Minister recognises. Although I
praise the work that has been done and look forward to the Bill, the
contraction in secure wards must not go too far, or we will have even
more problems in the community. I am pleased to see the Minister
nodding, indicating that that will be looked
at.</p><p><a name="stpa_o323"><a name="61116-0013.htm_para9"><a name="06111632000540">Before I go on to
speak about the circumstances in my constituency, I shall deal with
another aspect of health that worries me greatly: health in the armed
forces. I have the honour of participating in the armed forces
parliamentary scheme, and I also had the honour of serving in the Army
when I was much, much younger. I recently visited the Army recruiting
centre down on Salisbury plain. A matter of grave concern is the
shortfall of about 7,500 servicemen, especially in the infantry and the
Royal Artillery. Furthermore, almost 10,000 servicemen and women are
sick and unable to be deployed on operational duties. That is a huge
figure for a standing Army of fewer than 100,000. Together, those
numbers mean that about 17,500 servicemen and women are unavailable for
operational duties.</p><p><a name="stpa_o324"><a name="61116-0013.htm_para10"><a name="06111632000541">If the contraction of medical
services in the armed forces continues, that will place an increasing
burden on the health service. I asked the senior generals in charge:

generals whether so many people were unavailable for operational duties
mainly because of injuries resulting from conflict, and the answer was
no. In most cases, sickness notes are signed by civilian
doctors&#151;GPs&#151;who do not necessarily understand the ethos
of the armed forces quite as well as they should. Many of the ladies
and gentlemen who serve in the armed forces may not be operationally
available to serve in Iraq, Afghanistan, Sierra Leone or elsewhere
around the world, but they may be able to do a desk job or something
while they are recovering from their
injuries.</p><p><a name="stpa_o326"><a name="61116-0013.htm_para12"><a name="06111632000545">I was most
grateful to General Viggers when he said that many servicemen who have
had amputations as a result of injuries sustained in Afghanistan and
Iraq would not automatically be discharged from the armed forces, as
would have been the case when I served in the Army, when those with a
serious injury would have been thrown out on to the dustcart. These

has said in the House previously is that he will consider giving the
armed forces only a dedicated wing of the hospital in Selly Oak,
whereas on the continent many countries have a specific hospital in
their capital city that is purely for their armed forces and their
relatives, who, in the event of the deaths of their partners obviously
need that special care as well. Does my hon. Friend agree that our
country, which has the best armed forces in the world, should also have
a dedicated hospital for our armed
forces?</p><p><a name="st_o199"><a name="06111632000547"><b><a name="61116-0013.htm_spnew4"><a name="06111632000919">Mike

establishment.</p><p><a name="stpa_o327"><a name="61116-0013.htm_para13"><a name="06111632000548">I ask
the Minister to look carefully at health care for our armed forces,
which in most cases these days because of the closure of military
hospitals is provided by civilian GPs and surgeons. It is important to
look after our servicemen and women when they are in desperate need.
Will the Minister also look into why so many of our armed forces are
sick or unavailable for operational duties? Ten per cent. of the
standing Army seems a huge amount; a figure that we probably would not
accept on the civilian

closure, sackings, or however one wishes to describe what is going on
at this moment at a board meeting of West Hertfordshire Hospitals NHS
Trust, which is deciding what to do about local medical provision in
south-west Hertfordshire. For some months now a consultation has been
under way. Earlier the Secretary of State went on and on about local
involvement, democracy or consultation in the way in which the health
service is provided within our communities. I was fascinated to hear
how she wants more and more people to be involved. I have the honour of
representing a constituency that could not be more involved in the
future of its general hospital. It has been campaigning for 30 years to
try to keep it open, under successive Governments. I freely admit that
there were pressures in the &#146;90s to close Hemel Hempstead
hospital, but a decision was made long before 1997 that that general
hospital&#151;with full A and E and maternity services, and built for
the community as a new town&#151;must stay open because of the
services that it provides to 250,000 to 300,000 people.</p><p><a name="stpa_o329"><a name="61116-0013.htm_para15"><a name="06111632000552">Investment from the previous

made and massive rebuilding took place. New buildings opened and
everybody seemed happy. Then, in 1997, this Government came to power.
Within weeks, they closed the consultant-led maternity unit at Hemel
Hempstead hospital and moved it to Watford. Since then, there have been
continual closures at the

visit Hemel to explain why she wants to close the local general
hospital. Hon. Members may be interested to know that she turned up a
couple of weeks ago. She did not go anywhere near the hospital, of
course; she went to the local social services department. There was a
small demonstration outside comprising ladies with pushchairs, people
in wheelchairs, elderly people on walking sticks&#151;oh, and a
Member of Parliament, namely myself. The Secretary of State did not
come past to look at their banners and try to understand the local
community&#146;s concerns. Instead, the police were called and three
patrol cars arrived, at huge expense to my constituents. At the same
time, she was hopping over a back fence to try to get through the back
door and run away from my constituents and the local media. That is the
kind of listening process that she has been undertaking in my

I should add that Watford is one of the few places left in

declaration of interest of sorts: I chair an umbrella co-ordinating

the difficulty for children who are taken into care. That was
reinforced by the recent National Consumer Council report, which showed
that children in foster care are moved too frequently. For example, a
recently born baby about whom I heard has been with five carers in his

that, on average, being taken into care is not a positive step for
children. We must therefore be certain that it is the right thing to
do. One of the difficulties in obtaining information about the child
protection system is the secrecy of social services. It is claimed that
that secrecy exists to protect the child, but it is clear that it is
maintained mainly to protect any professionals involved from
allegations of misconduct. The intentions of the majority of the people
involved are clearly good and many hard-working people care a lot about
their clients, but a much smaller number cause great problems. However,
the system as a whole is at fault and Ministers need to consider what
should be done.</p><br>

express will of the parents. I have, however, published at their
request the names of four of the families, who are Janet and Lawrence
Alexander, Sharon and Hannah Bozier, Janet Davies, and Davina and Ben
McLean.</p><p><a name="stpa_o339"><a name="61116-0014.htm_para1"><a name="06111632000571">The case of
15-year-old Heidi Frost in Essex is a good example of the secrecy of
the family courts protecting social services, not the child. She is not
allowed to answer her friends&#146; questions about what happened.
Social workers and paediatricians were shown to be in the wrong, but
she is not allowed to tell people. As a result, she does not have a
doctor. She believes that her experiences would be useful for any other
children who were falsely accused. The system works against the
interests of the children concerned, who remain its victims. There is
an element of hypocrisy in adoption, with local authorities actively
advertising children for adoption and providing their details, while
their birth families are not allowed to talk about things.</p><p><a name="stpa_o340"><a name="61116-0014.htm_para2"><a name="06111632000572">It is good that the Government
are reviewing secrecy in the family courts. The recent cases of Clayton
<i> v.</i> Clayton and the judgment of Justice Mumby in respect of
Nicola and Mark Webster have opened up more than a chink in the armour
surrounding the family courts. It may be that people like Heidi can now
speak out, but the law is not clear, and checking it costs tens of
thousands of
pounds.</p><p><a name="stpa_o341"><a name="61116-0014.htm_para3"><a name="06111632000573">Professionals
have avoided scrutiny through secrecy and continually made errors that
would have been picked up had matters been considered in public. It is
very clear that too many children are taken into care and there are a
number of reasons for it. There is the simple failure of the system
where the system gets the facts wrong. In the case of the Williams
family in Newport, which was recently in the news, a local
paediatrician diagnosed &#147;chronic sexual abuse&#148; and split
up a family for more than two years, when a more properly handled
diagnosis at a later stage found no signs of sexual abuse. In that
case, international evidence showed</p><a name="61116-0014.htm_brev0"><a name="06111632000700"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;that the UK took a wrong turn
after the Cleveland Enquiry and has been overtaken by other western
nations&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="stpa_o342"><a name="61116-0014.htm_para4"><a name="06111632000574">That evidence
also showed that there was</p><a name="61116-0014.htm_brev1"><a name="06111632000701"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;a tendency in the UK for
paediatricians to
over-diagnose&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="stpa_o343"><a name="61116-0014.htm_para5"><a name="06111632000575">sexual
abuse.</p><p><a name="stpa_o344"><a name="61116-0014.htm_para6"><a name="06111632000576">Another
worrying case is that of the Webster family in Norfolk. A radiologist
diagnosed child abuse based on metaphyseal fractures and the children
were taken away from the family. Metaphyseal fractures sound very
worrying to a lay person, but they are not the same as a broken limb.
Indeed, metaphyseal fractures can be caused by being born or by various
bone diseases. It is clearly wrong to claim child abuse merely because
of the presence of metaphyseal fractures. The good news is that the
Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health and the College of
Radiologists are looking into the matter of non-accidental injury.
However, we also need to look into the conflict of interests caused by
the way in which payment is received for reports. If people get paid
only for diagnosing child abuse, more child abuse will be
diagnosed.</p><br>

the actions of almost certainly well motivated physicians. The

resulted in the person who was responsible for the care of her

that of Ben Hollisey McLean, in which the threat of child protection
proceedings was used to force him into dangerous medical research. I
have evidence of the threat of child protection proceedings being used
to silence parents. Indeed, parents have been forced to admit that they
harmed their children&#151;when they did not&#151;simply to keep
them. When parents are caught in the Catch-22 world of social services
it is one of the most pernicious and invidious aspects of the system,
and it provides a reason why it is difficult to get clear understanding
from the research.</p><p><a name="stpa_o347"><a name="61116-0014.htm_para9"><a name="06111632000579">Roy
Meadow, who followed in the tradition of Matthew Hopkins, and David
Southall, who shared that ancestry and that of Joseph Mengele combined,
should have to account for the misery that they caused. Even if their
motivations were good, the consequences will hang over many
people&#146;s lives for decades. The witch hunts, where mothers are
alleged to have killed their children and are then required to prove
their innocence against unfounded medical opinion, need to stop now.
That does not require a change to the law, but it does require a change
to procedure.</p><p><a name="stpa_o348"><a name="61116-0014.htm_para10"><a name="06111632000580">Apart
from where the system basically gets things factually wrong, there are
issues when the system gets the facts right but takes the wrong action.
I know of a woman in Birmingham with epilepsy, whose children are
continually taken off her at birth. I think that she has now had five.
She has expressed the desire to continue to have babies until social
services allow her to keep one because they run out of money. We really
need to look at such cases and see why she cannot be supported to keep
at least one child.</p><p><a name="stpa_o349"><a name="61116-0014.htm_para11"><a name="06111632000581">We
also need to look at how issues of domestic violence are handled. It is
wrong for a mother who is a victim of domestic violence to find that
social services try to remove her children from her without trying
alternative approaches. I am aware of a case in Sunderland and a second
in Devon where that is happening at the moment. The underlying issue is
fear of missing a child at risk, which means that people tend to play
safe and treat a normal situation as one where a child is at risk. In
cases like that of Victoria Climbi&#233;, abuse is obvious and should
not haunt the system, driving people to treat normal situations as
abusive. Common sense is needed to bring balance back into the system.
One key point about the Climbi&#233; inquiry was that it showed how
social workers were busy chasing up the chimera of a few
Munchausen&#146;s syndrome by proxy cases and did not have the time
to focus on a serious case of abuse, which was ignored.</p><p><a name="stpa_o350"><a name="61116-0014.htm_para12"><a name="06111632000582">We clearly need to separate out

complicated things. Human relationships based mainly on affection
rather than contractual arrangements may not seem a reliable system
from a legalistic perspective. The evidence, however, is that on
average they provide far more security for children than being formally
looked after.</p><p><a name="stpa_o351"><a name="61116-0014.htm_para13"><a name="06111632000583">The
words used in the system cause me some concern as well. I have seen
reports in which the phrase &#147;looked-after children&#148;
becomes the noun &#147;LAC&#148; with a plural of
&#147;LACs&#148;. I have heard of the phrase &#147;trans-racial
adoptable commodity&#148;, which means a mixed-race child whom social
services think they can easily get adopted. Such phrases demonstrate
dehumanising attitudes.</p><p><a name="stpa_o352"><a name="61116-0014.htm_para14"><a name="06111632000584">The system&#146;s attitude is
that parents do not matter. Case conferences are held at times and
places that are inconvenient for parents, who are not given copies of
the papers before the meeting, while other professionals are bullied
into agreeing with social services as the lead agency. The system ends
up careering towards disaster and its attitude is
wrong.</p><p><a name="stpa_o353"><a name="61116-0014.htm_para15"><a name="06111632000585">Contested
adoptions are another area with hazard. Currently, a secret case heard
on the balance of probabilities and frequently based on flawed
evidence, and in which parents are required to prove their innocence,
results in the destruction of a family. That stores up problems for the
future, as the case of Yvonne Coulter and her daughter Tammy shows. We
must not forget the impact on the adopting family, who believe what
they are told, only to find that the errors of the system cause
breakdown during adolescence, which is a difficult time for many
families. The process for contested adoptions must be changed. A life
sentence should require cases to be held in public with a jury, and the
evidence to prove them beyond reasonable doubt.</p><p><a name="stpa_o354"><a name="61116-0014.htm_para16"><a name="06111632000586">The current General Medical
Council hearing over the allegations against David Southall shows how
the system tends to maltreat families. It is not clear that the GMC
wants to enforce the rules. I am particularly worried that it is not
considering the decades of dangerous research on babies that David
Southall has managed. The GMC tried to dismiss even the milder
allegations currently being considered, and has tried to gag the
parents and forced legal and medical advisors on them whom they do not
want. The prosecution in that case is acting on behalf of the GMC, not
on behalf of the victims of that
doctor.</p><p><a name="stpa_o355"><a name="61116-0014.htm_para17"><a name="06111632000587">In the
meantime, thousands of secret medical files&#151;estimated to be more
than 2,000&#151;are being held by the University hospital of North
Staffordshire. Many of the parents of the babies who were choked, given
carbon monoxide and had their breathing damaged in other ways did not
give consent to the experiments. The parents should be told if there
are secret files on their
children.</p><p><a name="stpa_o356"><a name="61116-0014.htm_para18"><a name="06111632000588">Given the
regulatory system&#146;s failure to deal with such research, it is
worrying that the Department of Health is proposing a further
deregulation of research. On a side note, I was contacted by a doctor
who was concerned about medical ethics and who believed that those
changes could lead to more situations such as that which arose at a
hospital in Norwich, where a drug experiment went badly
wrong.</p><br>

report that was highly critical of the existing policy on special needs
education. In my constituency, Leas school in Clacton was shut as a
result of the enforced inclusion policy. That closure meant that a lot
of pupils who might otherwise have chosen to be in a special school
were forced into mainstream schools. That policy, which has caused much
hardship to parents in my constituency and to those in Clacton, is also
causing hardship to children with special educational needs and their
parents up and down the country. The work that we have done has helped
to achieve a new consensus among parents, charities and the voluntary
sector that the policy of enforced inclusion has gone too far. In the
Westminster Hall debate we had on the subject the other day, pretty
much everyone, apart from the Minister, agreed about that. Yet
confusion remains about what is the Government&#146;s policy. Is
there still a policy of enforced inclusion? Are the guidelines and the
statutory guidance, as the Select Committee found, still pushing local
education authorities towards a policy of inclusion? There is a need
for clarity. The Queen's Speech is a missed opportunity to introduce

a White Paper on education reform to set schools free. I supported the

observation about the way it is drafted and about the way this

not written by the Queen, yet I suspect that elected MPs made no

said in hushed whispers, &#147;We&#146;re going to have maternity
beds cut. You can see how busy we are, Mr. Kawczynski, and

The figure for the United Kingdom as a whole is 1.6 days, so they have
latched on to the fact that women in Shropshire stay in hospital for
longer than is normal, compared with the rest of the country. That is
why they want to cut beds&#151;to get the women out quicker. However,
that is totally wrong, because the help that the mother&#151;and the
father&#151;get after the birth and while at hospital is absolutely
invaluable and very necessary. They are taught how to bathe, feed and
generally look after the baby; indeed, the help that they receive from

was amazed that my hospital managed to find crutches that were big

at the hospital about returning them, I was met with surprise. They
were extremely grateful that I wanted to return them, but said that

Hertfordshire have been the victim of enthusiastic electioneering. In
February 2005, Chase Farm hospital, which although not in Hertfordshire
serves many of my constituents, received a visit from the then
Secretary of State for Health, now the Home Secretary. We were told
that there were great plans to renew Chase Farm, with new services and

the hospital will be run down until it is no longer viable to keep it
open.</p><p><a name="stpa_o391"><a name="61116-0015.htm_para15"><a name="06111632000628">There was also
some enthusiastic electioneering in Welwyn Hatfield in the run-up to
the last general election. Hatfield was promised a brand new, shiny
hospital straight out of the wrapper, costing about &#163;500
million. Of course, we looked forward to that new hospital because we
felt that it was much needed in Hertfordshire. As the site also
happened to be in the constituency of a then Labour Health Minister we
thought that the two might be linked, but we put such thoughts behind
us as uncharitable. However, after the general election there was a new
Member for Welwyn Hatfield and we have been told that the hospital will
not happen. First, we thought the project would be downgraded to a
smaller hospital, but last week we discovered that there will be no
hospital at all on the

to provide those drugs. It is incumbent on the great brains on the

on help with off-peak travel being given to pensioners and disabled

youngsters, especially in rural areas such as Ribble Valley, have faced
a huge hike in their bus fares to go from where they live to school. If
such journeys are free, that is fine, but not everyone lives within the
designated three-mile distance. Such fare hikes, which are particularly
felt by rural parents, force people to re-examine how they get their
youngsters to school. Many parents are being forced to transport their

are huge.</p><p><a name="stpa_o404"><a name="61116-0015.htm_para28"><a name="06111632000652">The

Clitheroe royal grammar school, which is a fine school. I hope that the

When sexually transmitted diseases are spreading as they are in this

as agency nurses will be brought in at a much greater cost, so the
Government are not saving any money. We know why primary care trusts
are acting in the way that they do: it is because they have amassed
huge debts and are looking for front-line services to cut, but clearly
that is not right. We are talking about the national health service,

she will have to wait many months while the NHS finds one, because the
reality is that there are none. The Government have been in power for
almost 10 years, and in that time they should have ensured that
sufficient numbers of dentists were trained, so that dentistry could
remain part of the national health service. In effect, it has been
privatised through the back door, by stealth. If only the Government

for drugs, because those drugs have not been passed by NICE. The truth
is that trusts could offer drugs that have not been passed by NICE, but
many of them, because they want to save money, hide behind
NICE&#146;s decision as a way of explaining why they are not giving
those drugs. I have at least two constituents who need Velcade but who
have been told that they cannot have it. That drug is made available in

cigarettes&#151;which are proven to be effective in slowing down the
onslaught of Alzheimer&#146;s? What about the effect on
sufferers&#146; families, as the drugs are available for a relatively
small amount of money, but their loved ones cannot obtain them? That is
appalling, especially when we juxtapose it with the news this week that
the Government have come to a settlement with some prisoners who were
forced to go cold turkey because they could not obtain access to drugs
in prison. At the same time, people who are ill through no fault of
their own cannot obtain access to drugs on the national health service
because of cost, which is quite scandalous. I hope that that
topsy-turvy, Alice in Wonderland situation can be corrected, so that
drugs are given to people who desperately need
them.</p><p><a name="stpa_o413"><a name="61116-0016.htm_para7"><a name="06111632000669">I shall conclude
on the subject of primary care trusts, which has been mentioned time
and again. There have been alterations in Ribble Valley, too. It is
important to listen, and my hon. Friend the Member for Hemel Hempstead
talked about the public saying, &#147;This is the sort of health
service that we want. We are paying for it; this is how we would like
to be treated.&#148; The same thing happened in a town in my
constituency, Longbridge, which was taken out of one primary care trust
and put into another. It is completely insane for some bureaucrat to
decide to do that on the basis of a geographical nicety, or for the
sake of tidiness, without listening to all the doctors and patients who
said that they wished to remain where they were, and to be treated in
the Preston area, as opposed to east Lancashire. I know that the
Minister is going to look into the issue again, to see whether any
changes can be made so that the people of Longbridge can once again be
covered by the primary care trust for the Preston area, and I hope that
that can be done. It is not easy, particularly given the nature of the
bus services in rural areas, to travel from Longbridge to parts of
Burnley, Accrington or Blackburn, where my constituents may have to go
to obtain part of their treatment. As I say, the move may have made
sense from the point of view of bureaucratic tidiness, but it is a
crying shame that people who live in a town should be told that they
cannot receive their treatment there, and must go somewhere
else.</p><p><a name="stpa_o414"><a name="61116-0016.htm_para8"><a name="06111632000670">Finally, we
should pay tribute to all the nurses, doctors and ancillary staff, and
to our teachers and their ancillary staff. They are the investment in
both of those wonderful services that we have in the United Kingdom. My
hon. Friend the Member for Shrewsbury and Atcham (Daniel Kawczynski)
mentioned car parking charges. Imagine what would happen if we tried to
charge teachers for parking in our schools. It is nonsense. None of us
would tolerate it, so why do we tolerate our nurses and doctors having
to pay car parking charges when they go to work in hospitals? It is an
outrage and ought to be corrected.</p><br>

gain an incentive to take those students because they would come with a
little extra money attached. Thirdly, if the extra help is there for

that there will be nothing dramatic in the Leitch review that is worth

could collaborate on a fair footing, not one whereby college students
find themselves short-changed by about &#163;400 each. The Government
have asked for healthy cooking courses to be implemented in all

funding.</p><p><a name="stpa_o428"><a name="61116-0016.htm_para22"><a name="06111633000017">We expect the
Bill to have one eye-catching proposal&#151;to allow colleges to
award foundation degrees. That appears to have come from nowhere. It
was not in the White Paper or in the Foster review, and nobody appears
to have been consulted about it. It recognises that for many students
of all agents, the route into higher education is through further
education. I am grateful to the Government for that However, would not
it be more meaningful if on the back of that recognition, we had a
flexible system that encouraged students to move between those
institutions? That would recognise the reality for many students who,
because of family responsibilities or caring responsibilities, or
because they need to work part-time, find that they need to begin their
education in their local area at a local college, but may then wish to
move and do other parts of their course at another institution?
Followed up by a sensible and radical funding system, that would be the
beginning of a truly radical policy.</p><br>

a long time&#151;many police hours and a great deal of a local

particular problem because the victims of the antisocial behaviour are
reluctant to provide it, for fear of recrimination. We therefore need

antisocial behaviour to give evidence so that the police or the local

obtain ASBOs more quickly.</p><p><a name="stpa_o437"><a name="61116-0017.htm_para3"><a name="06111633000027">We also need to ensure that

It is important that whatever is done is effective and that probation

did not understand why they should be brought home, because they
thought that they were all right. Those children do not have the
benefit of parents who supervise and devote their time to them, and a
good standard of behaviour is not set at home. That makes it all the

very happy lives, fulfilled with a whole range of activities, many of
which are associated with our schools. Schools in the London borough of
Havering are particularly good. We have a flagship service, which is

children involved in that sort of thing before they enter formal
education, they can learn social and interpersonal skills, how to
accept one another, how to accept authority and how to conform. They
can learn through play how to get on with one another so that by the
time they go to school, they are self-confident, well adjusted and
ready for teaching and learning. Half the battle is already
won.</p><p><a name="stpa_o443"><a name="61116-0017.htm_para9"><a name="06111633000033">Most of my local

young children, who often want to know first how much I earn, and then
all sorts of other questions follow about what Parliament does, how to
become an MP and so forth. They probably know more than many adults in
the community about what the council does, what Parliament does and how
laws are made. I was very impressed. They also have their own
anti-bullying policy, and debate problems in school. I have observed
school councils in operation: the meeting skills are excellent, with
one person speaking and everyone else listening. It helps to build up

behaviour. Pupils move about the school unsupervised and in a sensible
way. We can see that they are well adjusted, that they are enjoying
their education and that they behave perfectly. One of the schools is a
Roman Catholic girls secondary school, where the pupils gain the
benefit of having an ethos in school that is the same as the ethos that
they experience at home. That is an amazing advantage and there is a
high level of parental interest in what goes on in the school. That
support, and the link between what goes on at school and what goes on
at home, enables those pupils to fulfil their full potential
academically, not to mention all the other skills that schools have to
offer. I am very pleased that the Government will, because of the
overwhelming wish of the public and hon. Members on both sides of the

lecturers run a life skills course for children with learning

supported employment. Those students are assigned a job tutor who finds
local jobs for them, with huge support from local employers, through
their corporate responsibility. The job tutor will take the student to
work from their home, stay all day to settle them in and ensure that
the other employees are happy and understand them, and then take them
home again. The support that the job tutors give is gradually withdrawn
inch by inch, so that at the end of, say, a six-month period, the
student with learning difficulties is independent and working. That

was made in the other place that there will be an investigation into
making it possible for kids in state schools to sit exams such as the
IGCSE&#151;the international general certificate of secondary
education. The Government have talked a lot about raising standards in
state schools so that they match independent schools. One basic way in
which we could show that we are committed to that principle would be by
making it possible for students in state schools to sit the same exams
as are now available to students in independent schools. It is wrong
that we have two nations in education, with exams for which pupils at
independent schools can study but for which those attending state
schools are not permitted to do so. I hope that we will hear from the
Secretary of State what the time scale is for the consultation that was
promised on that subject in another

struck by the following recent newspaper headline&#151;from <i> The

academies to seal legacy&#148;. Apparently, the Prime Minister was a
bit worried about his legacy and was very keen to get as many academies
as possible in place before he left office. Let me assure the Secretary
of State that the Prime Minister need have no worries about his academy

also had statements recently from the Secretary of State about 16 to
18-year-olds. He is reported to have said that he expects them to stay
on in education or to go into training. It will be very interesting to
hear from him exactly what he meant by that. Within 48 hours of his
making that statement, the Chancellor of the Exchequer made it clear
that in his view nobody is suggesting that children who do not want to
do so should stay on at school full-time until 18. So exactly what kite
was the Secretary of State flying? Will he explain what his commitment
was? <i> [Interruption.] </i>Labour Members say, &#147;It&#146;s not
about schools&#148;, but if it is about training, what form will it
take?</p><p><a name="stpa_o467"><a name="61116-0017.htm_para33"><a name="06111636000022">Will the
Secretary of State also confirm one of the most scandalous statistics
of this Government&#146;s time in office? When we left office in
1997, there were 157,000 16 to 18-year-olds not in education,
employment or training&#151;the so-called NEETs: the people whom the
education and training system has let down. That figure that was
already far too high. Will the Secretary of State confirm that
according to the latest figures there are now 220,000 such people?
Despite all the Government&#146;s efforts, there has been a 40 per
cent. increase in the number of 16 to 18-year-olds who are not getting
started in the basics of further education or training. So of course we
need some initiatives on that. What do the Government propose to do
about it?</p><p><a name="stpa_o468"><a name="61116-0017.htm_para34"><a name="06111636000023">We
Conservatives know what needs to be done. We understand that those
young people have become detached from education. They have lost
contact with, and faith in, training because, sadly, many of them have
been let down by an education system that has not provided them with
the basics. Almost half of all 11-year-olds still leave primary school
unable to read, write and add up. What they need is synthetic
phonics&#151;an issue so powerfully pressed by my hon. Friend the
Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton (Mr.
Gibb)&#151;as the basis of reading, so that they can remain engaged
with and attached to what is happening in the classroom. Far too many
classes are still not put into sets, yet setting often enables
teenagers to learn and to participate in lessons that are conducted at
a speed that is right for
them.</p>

not reach the target by doing anything that improves the opportunities

Yes, it was. Conservative Members shake their heads, but I can read the

between 1989 and 1997. The Dearing committee was set up by the
Conservative party on the basis that Dearing must, under the
instructions of the then Chancellor, find a further reduction of 6 per
cent. in real terms. Dearing reported that the most that the higher
education sector could stand was 1 per cent. However, we get comments
about the threat to universities and the problems with medical

Benches have asked an important question. The Leitch review is
imminent. What we believe, coming on from Foster, to the White Paper,
to the Bill, is that the further education infrastructure needs to be
in place to meet the challenges that we know from the interim report
that Leitch is going to raise. We do not see a need to wait for Leitch
before the Bill. Indeed, we think that Leitch&#146;s report will make
such radical proposals that there will need to be a further period of
consultation. I doubt very much whether there is anything in Leitch
that will necessitate our changing the Bill, to answer the question
raised by the hon. Member for Brent, East (Sarah Teather). However,
unless we have the infrastructure in place in our FE colleges and our
skills sector, we will not be able to cope with the kind of issues that
Leitch will draw attention to.</p><p><a name="stpa_o498"><a name="61116-0018.htm_para29"><a name="06111636000060">I was asked by the hon. Member
for Havant about the situation with 16 to 18-year-olds. The statement
that I made and the statement that the Chancellor of the Exchequer made
were absolutely consistent. The argument is this: we need to find ways
to inspire youngsters to stay on in education or training. We have
expanded apprenticeships. There were only 75,000 when we came into
government; now there are 260,000. We have reduced the drop-out rate at
age 16 and 17 by introducing the education maintenance allowance and by
other methods. As people found in Ontario and in the Netherlands, and
as they do already in Germany and Belgium, when all those systems are
in place we need to send a clear message to our youngsters&#151;not
an ambiguous message&#151;that they should not be in employment
unless there is some kind of skills training attached. All of the
problems that we face, in relation to demography and globalisation,
suggest that, at some stage, we will have to grasp that nettle. We need
to look at that idea. Before we went down that route, we would need to
have the widest consultation. However, I do not think that that is
inconsistent with what we are trying to do in relation to FE and
skills.</p><p><a name="stpa_o499"><a name="61116-0018.htm_para30"><a name="06111636000061">The further

Graham Stuart (Beverley and Holderness) (Con):</b> I am
pleased to be able to bring to the attention of the House the subject
of sexual and mental heath services in the East Riding of Yorkshire. As
hon. Members will be aware, the services are Cinderella services that
are too easily ignored in the national health service. They do not
carry the political clout of other matters. The Minister will be aware
of my work on fighting for community hospitals, which has been backed
by many hon. Members. When compared with the situation for sexual and
mental health services, it is easier to organise public support for,
and demonstrations on, institutions such as community hospitals so that
local and national authorities can be persuaded of the need for change.
Unfortunately, sexual and mental health services are easier targets for
cuts.</p><p><a name="stpa_o509"><a name="61116-0019.htm_para4"><a name="06111636000074">On a
business-as-usual basis, the new primary care trust for the East Riding
of Yorkshire would have been heading for a &#163;20 million deficit
this year. A turnaround team had to go in to effect changes. Before
that team arrived, Ministers were wont to tell us that any overspending
or deficits were due to poor local financial management. When cuts took
place, their typical response was, &#147;It&#146;s nothing to do
with me, guv.&#148; However, as the Minister will be aware, the
accountants who came in to East Riding of Yorkshire PCT&#151;or
Yorkshire Wolds and Coast PCT, as it was&#151;found that there had
been no financial mismanagement. They found that the PCT had done a
good job in trying to steward its resources, but that a combination of
centralised targets and the funding that came with them put the PCT in
the position in which it found
itself.</p><p><a name="stpa_o510"><a name="61116-0019.htm_para5"><a name="06111636000075">As our ably
managed primary care trust has tried to tackle its existing deficits,
it has found&#151;again, thanks to invention by central
Government&#151;that &#163;8 million has been top-sliced and
removed from the local area. That has had a further impact on the
organisation&#146;s financial balance. The situation might become
worse in the future because funding often seems to be gerrymandered to
Labour areas and taken away from Conservative areas. Given the meetings
attended by the chairman of the Labour party involving the famous heat
maps, we know that health funding is too often used to address
political needs, rather than health needs. The most deprived people in
the community that I represent are the ones who pay the price of that
twisting away from recognition of real health needs.</p><p><a name="stpa_o511"><a name="61116-0019.htm_para6"><a name="06111636000076">Mental health services in the
East Riding of Yorkshire are the 13th lowest funded in the country. The
mental health trust is a three-star trust that does an excellent job
with the resources that it receives, but there has been an historical
failure of service provision because of the way in which the trust is
funded. That position was worsened further this year by an additional
&#163;700,000 cut imposed on mental health services by the PCT
because of its financial difficulties.

acceptable. The work of Lord Layard, whose report helped to bring the
need for counselling therapies to the Government&#146;s attention, is
being ignored, and people in my area are unable to access the services
they need. Dr Foster, the health care information company, has
conducted a survey of mental health charities and reports that
cash-strapped trusts are diverting funds away from mental health
services, and are instead using the money to plug gaps in other
services. That story is heard all too
frequently.</p><p><a name="stpa_o514"><a name="61116-0019.htm_para9"><a name="06111636000079">That
brings me to sexual health services in my area. As the Minister will
know, the Department for Health announced that &#163;315 million
would be allocated to improve sexual health services across the
country. All too often, however, that money has not reached the
providers of sexual health services. Because of the financial
mismanagement occurring throughout Labour&#146;s NHS, the money is
being diverted away from sexual health services.</p><p><a name="stpa_o515"><a name="61116-0019.htm_para10"><a name="06111636000080">The impact of that is strongly
felt, and it is worth acquainting the House and the Minister with the
statistics on sexually transmitted infections in Yorkshire and the
Humber region. Between 1996 and 2005, there was a 216 per cent.
increase in cases of genital chlamydia. Chlamydia is easily cured, but
if it is not found by screening, it can lead to infertility and
additional expense later, and it creates great misery for those
affected. The figures also show an increase of128 per cent. in
cases of gonorrhoea between 1996 and 2005. The incidence of syphilis
has increased by1,650 per cent., albeit from a low base: the
number of cases increased from 6 in 1996 to 105 in 2005. To continue
the sad recitation, the number of cases of genital herpes has increased
from 457 in 1996 to 556 in 2005&#151;a 22 per cent. increase in
incidence&#151;and there has been a 28 per cent. increase in the
incidence of genital warts in the same period. We have a serious and
growing problem of sexually transmitted infections in our local area,
yet moneys that the Government have put aside to tackle that problem
are failing to reach the front line, despite assurances from Ministers
that they would try to ensure that that did not
happen.</p><p><a name="stpa_o516"><a name="61116-0019.htm_para11"><a name="06111636000081">No doubt the
Minister will mention the announcement in the past few days of a new
sexual health campaign. That campaign is to be welcomed&#151;indeed,
Nick Partridge, chief executive of the Terrence Higgins Trust, did
welcome it as a belated effort to raise the profile of such issues.
Following that announcement, he said that, of the &#163;315

services are currently being reconfigured, and between January and
April next year, six sexual health clinics will close across the East
Riding of Yorkshire, so that new, integrated clinics can be created. In
its meeting of 12 September, East Riding of Yorkshire council&#146;s
overview and scrutiny committee expressed concern about the large
distances that many service users would have to travel to integrated
clinics. It recognised that some services would be provided in GP
surgeries, but said
that</p><a name="61116-0019.htm_brev9"><a name="06111636000139"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;many people may not
feel comfortable accessing those services from their GPs and may prefer

Minister will be aware, when the GP contract was negotiated, sexual
health services were given too low a priority under the points system
that rewards GPs, so there is no incentive for them to take a
continuing interest in this growing problem, which is a cause of real
local concern.</p><p><a name="stpa_o521"><a name="61116-0019.htm_para16"><a name="06111636000086">The
local primary care trust prepared a report for the board meeting of 28
September this year. Under the heading of finance, there is a short
statement that goes to the heart of the failure to increase local
sexual health services. It says that the proposals to reconfigure
family planning clinics will result in &#163;51,000 in part-year
savings in 2006-07, and that &#163;102,000 will be the full-year
effect. Rates of sexually transmitted infections are exploding in the
area, but the amount being spent by the local primary care trust is
being cut, despite Government promises to the contrary. The Minister
may hope that, when the director of public health spoke at that board
meeting on 28 September, he suggested some reason why the services were
not needed, but in fact, he said:</p><a name="61116-0019.htm_brev10"><a name="06111636000140"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;If we were having a

Perhaps he could pick up on one particular point. My constituents, and

Government, to their credit, listened, and they put the money
in&#151;but our constituents want to know where it has gone. Under

Lewis:</b> In the East Riding of Yorkshire waiting lists are
down, waiting times are down to record low levels and success in
treating cancer and heart conditions is up to unprecedented levels. It
is our ambition that by 2008 there will be the monumental achievement
in the health service of a maximum 18-week wait from the moment a
patient visits the GP to the door of the operating theatre. Without
targets focusing on matters such as cancer and heart care&#151;this
applies to the community in Beverley and Holderness, as to other parts
of the country&#151;we would not have achieved much of the progress
that has been achieved. The hon. Gentleman implies that the policy of
the Opposition is to abolish all targets in the health service. In
future, there would be no targets identifying priorities for the use of
finite resources. Is it the policy of the Conservative party that there
will be no targets in future? That would be a
disaster.</p><p><a name="stpa_o540"><a name="61116-0020.htm_para0"><a name="06111636000113">The right
targets are needed as incentives within the system, but if we had not
had the heart and cancer targets, and the waiting list and waiting time
targets, and if we did not have our present target of an 18-week wait,
we would not have seen many of the performance improvements that have
happened in the national health service since
1997.</p><p><a name="stpa_o541"><a name="61116-0020.htm_para1"><a name="06111636000114">The hon.
Gentleman raised the issue of mental health. When one inherits as a
baseline a service that is in such a dreadful state, it takes a
significant amount of time to get that Cinderella service fit for
purpose. Since 1997, we have 50 per cent. more consultant
psychiatrists, 75 per cent. more clinical psychologists, and at least
20 per cent. more mental health nurses. We have more than 700 new
mental health teams working in the community&#151;assertive outreach,
early intervention and crisis resolution teams. None of them are
managers or bureaucrats. All are front-line staff providing mental
health services.</p><p><a name="stpa_o542"><a name="61116-0020.htm_para2"><a name="06111636000115">The
progress that has been made on sexual health is clear. The latest data

11.1 per cent. and the under-16 rate by 15.2 per cent.&#151;both

significant review of family planning and sexual health services across
the region, and it has an explicit and clear intention to replace
family planning clinics with locally based sexual health services that

against any change to services, even if that change is in the clinical

judgment has been made in the locality that to provide a more
integrated and effective service, reorganisation is necessary, the hon.

it is wrong that we are the first Government who have looked the health
service in the eye and said that, as in any other organisation in the
public or private sector, we will no longer tolerate a situation where
budgets are allowed to be out of control, and that it has a duty and
responsibility to bring those budgets back within reasonable control.
We are the first Government to be brave enough to do that. Historically
in the health service, the overspenders have been bailed out by the
well-managed underspenders. It is in no one&#146;s interests to allow
such a situation to continue. For the first time the Secretary of State
has looked the health service in the eye, has not blinked, and has said
that it must put its house in order. The minority of health
organisations that have not been managed properly and have a long
history of overspending are now required to bring their budgets into
balance. Surely a party that always claims to believe in good
