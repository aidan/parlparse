 (Con): If he will make a statement on the <i>(a)</i> incidence and <i>(b)</i> cost to the NHS of hospital-acquired infection in the last period for which figures are available.  [194999]
</p>



<p><a name="st_0"><a name="41102-01_spmin0"><b>The Secretary of State for Health  (Dr. John Reid): </b> 
 Because we were the first Government to introduce mandatory surveillance of the incidence of hospital-acquired infections, previous data are not as robust as we would wish. However, previous surveys and estimates indicate that the proportion of patients who acquire an infection in hospital is around 9 per cent., which is largely unchanged from a survey conducted 24 years ago in 1980. The rates of infection in most other European countries range between 6 and 10 per cent. The best available estimate is that hospital-acquired infections cost the NHS &#163;1 billion a year.
</p>








<p><a name="st_1"><a name="41102-01_spnew0"><b> Ann Winterton: </b> 
 Hospital-acquired infection is currently a massive problem in this country, and the Government&#039;s solution is to reintroduce the matron. Will the Secretary of State confirm that matrons will be taken from experienced nursing staff, will be properly trained and will therefore have the authority and professional standing to close wards for thorough cleaning, to recruit additional infection-control nursing staff and to train others in infection control? Does he agree that if those safeguards are not introduced, the matron&#039;s charter will be yet another piece of meaningless spin, which will be costly for patients?
</p>








<p><a name="st_2"><a name="41102-01_spnew1"><b> Dr. Reid: </b> 
 I regret the hon. Lady&#039;s choice of last sentence. I accept that hospital-acquired infections are a major challenge for the NHS and for all of us. I do not regard the matter as a party-political issue, which is why I invited the Conservative spokesman, who has accepted the invitation, to discuss the matter and share ideas and proposals. I confirm that we will examine all proposals.

<a name="41102-01_para0">

<br>&nbsp;<br>international as well as domestic reasons. However, we are passing power to front-line staff and the chief nursing officer has been put in charge. We want to make sure that nurses and matrons are in control of not only hygiene, but hospital cleaning, and that they are involved in writing up contracts. Hospital-acquired infections are a long-standing, complex issue, and I hope that all hon. Members share my determination to tackle them.

<p><a name="st_3"><a name="41102-01_spnew2"><b> Joan Ruddock  (Lewisham, Deptford)</b> 
 (Lab): Last week, I visited three wards in Lewisham hospital, each of which contained two patients with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Those patients had entered the hospital with the condition. Has my right hon. Friend any advice on community action to try to reduce the incidence of that condition and, in particular, for nursing homes, where far too many elderly people may unfortunately be subject to that infection?
</p>








<p><a name="st_4"><a name="41102-01_spnew3"><b> Dr. Reid: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is right. Staphylococci are present outside hospitals, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus is, of course, the most difficult Staphylococci to tackle. MRSA is dangerous in hospitals because the people there are, by definition, ill, weak and, in many cases, elderly, and it is so dangerous for vulnerable patients. We will examine all ways in which to tackle MRSA, and those areas of hospitals where people are vulnerable, critical or elderly are key.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-01_para1">
<a name="stpa_1">There are many reasons why it is difficult to overcome MRSA. We must tackle issues such as shortages of trained staff, old buildings with single rooms, high capacity, an emphasis on cost rather than cleaning and the bacteria&#039;s immunity. New hospitals, more staff, single rooms and hospital design are important, as well as hygiene training, infection-control nurses on the ground and control by front-line staff. All those measures are available, along with scientific research. We are tackling all those issues, and I hope that all hon. Members who have any ideas about how to put those measures into practice&#151;in some ways, MRSA is the biggest challenge that we face in our hospitals&#151;will join us. I welcome all ideas from all quarters.
</p>








<p><a name="st_5"><a name="41102-01_spnew4"><b> Sir Michael Spicer  (West Worcestershire)</b> 
 (Con): Why has the incidence of MRSA increased so quickly in recent years?
</p>








<p><a name="st_6"><a name="41102-01_spnew5"><b> Dr. Reid: </b> 
 We estimate that the rate has risen by about 5 per cent. over the past couple of years, so the increase is about 2.5 per cent. a year. <i>[Interruption.]</i> We have collected data on bloodstream bacteria MRSA only for the past couple of years. The data are limited, but we have never collected them before.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-01_para2">
<a name="stpa_2">As far as we can see, the incidence of MRSA is rising, and it is a major problem for us, but I issue two pleas to hon. Members to put this in proportion. First, it is not rising at 100 per cent. per annum, as some newspapers are suggesting. Secondly, the overall rate of hospital-acquired infections, which is estimated to be about 9 per cent., is roughly the same as 25 years ago, and probably 50 years ago, although we do not have the empirical data to verify that. There is no internationally-classifiable coding for deaths caused specifically by bacteria-led MRSA. Another reason why our data collection is less adequate than I would 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>2 Nov 2004 : Column 151</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>like is that MRSA is normally a contributory factor and is often not cited on death certificates. We want to see improvements in that respect, as well.
</p>








<p><a name="st_7"><a name="41102-01_spnew6"><b> Mr. Andrew Lansley  (South Cambridgeshire)</b> 
 (Con): Last August, hospital cleanliness scores were published. This year they have not been published. Why not?
</p>








<p><a name="st_8"><a name="41102-01_spnew7"><b> Dr. Reid: </b> 
 That matter has been passed to the Healthcare Commission and the scores will feature as part of the star ratings.
</p>








<p><a name="st_9"><a name="41102-01_spnew8"><b> Mr. Lansley: </b> 
 More talk from the Secretary of State, but no action. Perhaps he would like to admit that the reason is that last year the hospital cleanliness scores suggested that no hospital in the whole national health service had an unacceptable level of cleanliness. That did not accord at all with patient experience and illustrated the fact that the system is discredited, as the Healthcare Commission subsequently found.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-01_para3">
<a name="stpa_3">Let me try the Secretary of State with another one. Last December, the chief medical officer said that there should be a rapid review process to consider new products and processes, 50 of which have been presented to the Department. A meeting took place on 24 August. On 11 August, the Minister in the other place said that reports on just six would be published by mid-October, but that has not happened&#151;why not?
</p>








<p><a name="st_10"><a name="41102-01_spnew9"><b> Dr. Reid: </b> 
 Since the hon. Gentleman said at the time that we were not independent when assessing hospital cleanliness and suggested today that the reports are discredited&#151;I do not accept that, but it is his view&#151; I should have thought that he would welcome the fact that we have asked the independent Healthcare Commission to estimate cleanliness in hospitals. It seems that if we do it, it is wrong, and if we ask an independent body to do it, it is wrong. That is a sign of bias rather than objectivity on the hon. Gentleman&#039;s part; he is so much better when he puts party politics aside.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-01_para4">
<a name="stpa_4">On his other question, let me say in my normal balanced fashion that I would have liked the study of these materials and treatments against MRSA to have started more quickly than it did. He is right about that. The organisation has met only once and is meeting again this month. The list of six that it has considered is scheduled to be published, and that will happen very soon. It is running a couple of weeks late, but I hope that it will not be much more than that.
</p>








<p><a name="st_11"><a name="41102-01_spnew10"><b> Mr. Lansley: </b> 
 I am afraid that, as we have demonstrated many times in this House, the Government&#039;s response is one of a lack of urgency and delay. The data from the patient environment action teams are not being published. When we asked why not, we were told that it was because they were awaiting ministerial approval. That has nothing to do with the independence of the Healthcare Commission.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-01_para5">
<a name="stpa_5">Let me return to the point at which the Secretary of State started&#151;that we need more data. More than four years ago, the National Audit Office said that the mandatory scheme should be extended to include all parts of the voluntary surveillance scheme that predated it and should be done on the basis of clinical specialty; 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>2 Nov 2004 : Column 152</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>but Ministers said no. Where is the National Audit Office&#039;s recommended national infection control manual, on which the Department started work in 2001? Even the matron&#039;s charter, which was mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Congleton (Ann Winterton), said that people would be able to refer to a model cleaning contract, yet that does not exist. Why are the Government all talk and no action? Why cannot people see the action that needs to be taken to deliver cleaner hospitals and a safe environment for patients?
</p>








<p><a name="st_12"><a name="41102-01_spnew11"><b> Dr. Reid: </b> 
 Over the past few years the Government have been acting to deal with some of the very issues that the hon. Gentleman raises. He says that we are not putting out data. In fact, in July we issued data on bloodstream MRSA infections. I have to say, again in a balanced spirit, that an objective observer would recognise that during the 20 years in which they were in power the previous Government refused to publish any data. We are the first Government to have mandatory surveillance, the first Government to collect and publish the data, and the first Government to ensure that hospitals are judged on their cleanliness.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-01_para6">
<a name="stpa_6">Earlier, we discussed the potential contributory causes of MRSA. On old hospitals, we have the biggest building programme in history. On lack of staff, we have brought in 100,000 more doctors and nurses. On the immunity of the bug, within a month we are bringing the best international minds to this country to tackle the problem. We are putting nurses back in charge. We have just issued the matron&#039;s charter, and the chief nursing officer is taking this over. On cleanliness, above all, I am the Secretary of State who said&#151;
</p>

 Order. Perhaps I can make an appeal to the Front Benches. It is now quarter to the hour, and we are still on Question 1. I need sharper answers and sharper questions. Perhaps Paul Burstow can help us.
</p>








<p><a name="st_14"><a name="41102-01_spnew13"><b> Mr. Paul Burstow  (Sutton and Cheam)</b> 
 (LD): Thank you for that instruction, Mr. Speaker. The Secretary of State says that this Government are the first to do anything about MRSA. Surely that does not absolve them, however, if they are not doing enough to tackle the problem and there is still more to do. I certainly want to take him up on his offer of a meeting to discuss that issue. In July, he published a report promising cleaner, safer hospitals and action to deal with that. I have asked questions about that report, because it came just two days before a very critical report by the National Audit Office about the Government&#039;s performance in relation to hospital infections. The answer that the Minister gave me was that the report was a hastily cobbled together report on work in progress and contained nothing about new policies. Is that the case&#151;
</p>








<p><a name="st_15"><a name="41102-01_spnew14"><b> Mr. Speaker: </b> 
 Order. It would be helpful if the Secretary of State could provide a sharp reply. At this rate, we shall only get four questions into the hour.
</p>








<p><a name="st_16"><a name="41102-01_spnew15"><b> Dr. Reid: </b> 
 The answer to the first part of the hon. Gentleman&#039;s question is yes; the answer to the last part is no. The answer to the middle part is that I look forward to seeing him at the meeting.

 I thank my hon. Friend for that reply. Does she accept, however, that we have particular problems with the new development, especially at the Pontefract general infirmary&#151;the PGI? In a local press statement on 12 August, the chairman promised that there would be a review of the proposed bed reductions at Pontefract, because he was concerned about that. On 3 September, at a meeting of the health and social partnership, a promise of 100 beds at the PGI was made, but it was withdrawn in October. Patients who have received major surgery at the PGI are now being told that they might have to go to Dewsbury to complete their treatment, which would be a great imposition on their families, who might have to catch three or four buses to get there.

<p><a name="st_22"><a name="41102-02_spmin1"><b>The Secretary of State for Health  (Dr. John Reid): </b> 
 We are committed to giving patients greater choice within the national health service. We are already offering a choice of hospital to patients facing long waits for surgery, and we are extending choice to patients in regard to how they access treatment, advice and care within primary care, all of which is free at the point of need.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>2 Nov 2004 : Column 154</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br></p>








<p><a name="st_23"><a name="41102-02_spnew4"><b> Hugh Bayley: </b> 
 I am glad to hear what the Secretary of State says about primary care, because 80 per cent. of doctor/patient consultations in the NHS involve general practitioners rather than hospital doctors. Does he accept, however, that not all GPs are the same? They have different specialist interests and training, and they perform to different qualities of care. Meaningful choice for patients depends on the patient having reliable information about the clinical practice and quality of care of individual doctors. What steps are the Government taking to provide better information to patients about primary care, so that they can have real power and a real choice about which doctor treats them?
</p>








<p><a name="st_24"><a name="41102-02_spnew5"><b> Dr. Reid: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is absolutely right: if we are to give more power, information and choice to patients, we cannot restrict that to the secondary sector. Of course, we are now getting greater capacity in primary care: some 4,200 more doctors than previously; more specialisms, with some 1,300 doctors now specialising; new walk-in centres, which do not require an appointment; new commuter centres placed conveniently next to where people travel; and new roles for nurses, nurse practitioners, specialists and consultants. All of that opens up capacity, and therefore choice, in primary care.
</p>








<p><a name="st_25"><a name="41102-02_spnew6"><b> Mr. Peter Lilley  (Hitchin and Harpenden)</b> 
 (Con): Does the Secretary of State recall that one of the first acts of the incoming Labour Government was to abolish the last vestiges of the right to choose which NHS hospital one wanted to go to, which had existed since 1948? Does he now propose to rescind the regulation introduced in 1999, which stopped the funding of a person&#039;s choice to go to a hospital other than the one chosen for them by the bureaucracy? Does he recognise that the current talk about choice is a welcome whiff of a U-turn on his part, but unless the Government are prepared to allow genuine choice, rather than a limited choice among hospitals selected by the bureaucracy, there will be no real choice and no return to the choice that was endemic in the health service when it was set up?
</p>








<p><a name="st_26"><a name="41102-02_spnew7"><b> Dr. Reid: </b> 
 There is no legislative bar to extending choice, and as from next December, patients will be able to choose from a range of five shortlisted by the primary care trust. Increasingly, as we put in capacity, that will be extended so that by 2008, as the right hon. Gentleman said, any patient in England will be able to choose from any hospital in England, whether in the independent, charitable or NHS sectors, provided that it meets NHS standards and prices. I merely make one point: that can be achieved only because of our investment in capacity. It is a cruel deceit to promise people that capacity will be taken out of the NHS and that a greater degree of choice will still be given. We have heard for centuries that we are all free to dine at the Ritz, and only the lack of money prevents us from doing it. It is the same in the NHS&#151;his party taking money out of the NHS will reduce choice, not extend it.

<br>&nbsp;<br>he also agree that if people cannot afford to travel to hospitals, or there is no public transport infrastructure, they cannot have that choice?
</p>








<p><a name="st_28"><a name="41102-02_spnew9"><b> Dr. Reid: </b> 
 Yes on both counts, which is why we provide both capacity and travel facilities. The truth is that most people want easy and quick access to quality services as locally as possible. But the fact is that after 60 years, that is not available to everyone, so we must extend it so that people can go where they choose. I merely say one thing: we do not extend choice by saying that it will be available only to those who can pay half of the cost of their operation. The charges for operations that the Conservative party would introduce represent the cruellest deceit ever perpetrated on people in this country, especially the old and most vulnerable.

 (LD): Does the Secretary of State agree that patient choice would be enhanced if patients held their own records? Patient-held records would remove the need for complicated IT systems, because the doctors whom the patient had chosen would always have access to the information that they needed about that patient.
</p>








<p><a name="st_30"><a name="41102-02_spnew11"><b> Dr. Reid: </b> 
 In theory, that sounds like an advance from the current position, in which big files often get lost. Were we all asked to keep such big files, I suspect that the same thing might happen. Now that this country is at the forefront of information technology, surely the answer is to reduce such large files to a format that can be transferred easily between providers, so that when a patient decides to go to that hospital rather than this hospital, or that doctor rather than this doctor, there are no excuses and no physical bars to that transfer. Information technology will therefore become a source of information, power and choice to patients in a modern national health service.

 My hon. Friend is right. People feel strongly that, when training is provided out of the public purse, there should be a commitment to the NHS. As I am sure she is aware, there are difficulties in doing that because dentists are independent contractors and there are issues around restraint of trade, but we have tried to look at other ways, for example, golden handshakes, to organise commitment to the NHS. As we move towards local commissioning, there is the ability within the new contracts to specify longer time limits for dentists who work for the NHS to remain within it.

 More than 19,300 dentists currently work in general dental services and personal dental services, but not all have a full-time commitment to the NHS.

 I thank the Minister for that reply.

 I certainly sympathise with my hon. Friend&#039;s point. Sometimes a PCT&#039;s ability to communicate with patients can depend on the amount of notice given by the dentist, and dentists do not always stick to giving the amount of notice that should be given. I am sorry that the practice has decided to leave the NHS, particularly when we are putting significant new investment into the service. I also understand, however, that the PCT has made arrangements for other dentists across the east Leeds area to take on additional patients.

 My hon. Friend is absolutely right on the first point. When we move towards local commissioning, we are able to increase the number of salaried dentists because local PCTs will be able to make a judgment about what is most appropriate for their area. On the second point, I know that my hon. Friend feels passionately about fluoridation. He is right that, where water fluoridation is introduced, we expect the number of children with no dental decay to increase by about 15 per cent. within five to 10 years.

 (Con): In my constituency, there are two enterprising sets of GPs&#151; in Ellesmere and in Oswestry&#151;who want to take advantage of competitive local wage rates and expand the service and the number of people they employ, but they also depend on allocations of funds from central Government to the primary care trust. The Minister&#039;s colleague, an Under-Secretary of State for Health, wrote to me on 15 June saying that those allocations to PCTs would be made &quot;in the autumn&quot;. Today is 2 November. When in NHS terms does autumn end and winter begin? When will we know about those figures?
</p>








<p><a name="st_91"><a name="41102-04_spnew16"><b> Mr. Hutton: </b> 
 We hope to make allocations to primary care trusts very soon, but we are waiting for figures from the Office for National Statistics on population growth. Given the representations that Ministers have received, it is important that we base the allocations on the most up-to-date information about population growth, because they are capitation payments. We hope to be able to do that in January.

On the market forces factor, I thank him for the discussions that he has held with me since I raised that matter in March.

<p><a name="st_95"><a name="41102-05_spmin0"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health  (Dr. Stephen Ladyman): </b> 
 Mental health services throughout England are going through a radical programme of modernisation to improve access to effective treatment and care, reduce unfair variation and raise standards. National standards for mental health have been set through the mental health national service framework and the standard of care for mothers in the children&#039;s national service framework.
</p>








<p><a name="st_96"><a name="41102-05_spnew0"><b> Sir Nicholas Winterton: </b> 
 Will the Minister give some indication of what assessment he has made of the effect on patients and their families of the proposed closure of the mother and baby unit in the mental health unit of Leighton hospital, which serves the Macclesfield constituency? With the closure of that facility, will he confirm what specialised provision there would be for mentally ill mothers with babies in Cheshire, Wirral, Merseyside, north Wales, Shropshire and the north Staffordshire area? That matter is very important to my constituents.
</p>








<p><a name="st_97"><a name="41102-05_spnew1"><b> Dr. Ladyman: </b> 
 I am sure it is, but it is also very important that mothers with such problems in the hon. Gentleman&#039;s constituency receive the right sort of care, and usually that is best provided at home. The decisions that have to be taken are local and my understanding is that the local trusts are increasing provision at home, which means that there has been decreasing demand for those beds, so trusts have to take a view as to how best to provide in-patient services. That is what they are doing and I encourage the hon. Gentleman to engage in that consultation.

<p><a name="st_98"><a name="41102-05_spmin1"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health  (Dr. Stephen Ladyman): </b> 
 It is the responsibility of Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire strategic health authority to analyse the local situation regarding GP numbers and vacancies and to develop plans to provide the best possible primary care services for its residents. That process began in April 2004. Currently, there are 957 GPs in the SHA area, an increase of 74 since 1997.
</p>








<p><a name="st_99"><a name="41102-05_spnew2"><b> Alistair Burt: </b> 
 The Minister&#039;s brief may also tell him that an internal paper from the Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire strategic health authority states that the number of vacant GP posts in the area, currently 72, is expected to rise to 139 within three years and to 233 by 2011, and that over the next three years the SHA needs to recruit and retain the equivalent of 332 full-time GPs. That is long before the completion of the 160,000 new houses anticipated for the area by 2031. Where will those GPs come from, and is not the pressure to build new houses in the area so great that it is stretching precious infrastructure&#151;physical and human&#151;just too far?

<p><a name="st_100"><a name="41102-05_spnew3"><b> Dr. Ladyman: </b> 
 If the hon. Gentleman had bothered to read the report to which he referred a little further, he would have seen that there are detailed plans on where the GPs will come from. The plan was produced because the local primary care trust was doing its job and forward planning to ensure that it could meet the challenges in his constituency.

<p><a name="st_101"><a name="41102-05_spnew4"><b> Barbara Follett  (Stevenage)</b>

</p>








<p><a name="st_102"><a name="41102-05_spnew5"><b> Dr. Ladyman: </b> 
 The payments have been agreed and about 80 per cent. of GPs voted for the new contract. The financing of the specific provision in the contract is being fully resourced and an extra &#163;1.8 billion is being provided from the centre to ensure that quality requirements can be met with the contract fully funded. The local primary care trust is predicting the challenges that it will face in the years ahead and ensuring that it can respond to them, and I am delighted that my hon.

 I beg to move,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0">That leave be given to bring in a Bill to amend the procedures for collecting pensions and benefits from Post Offices.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-05_para0">
<a name="stpa_0">The Bill would provide for a simpler process for opening a Post Office card account, prohibit pressure from being put on those who opt for such an account to switch to using a high street bank and ensure that all applicants clearly understand that an exceptions service is available.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-05_para1">
<a name="stpa_1">These are times of great change not only in terms of the way in which our constituents receive their pensions and benefits, but for the Post Office, because the changes introduced by the Government have an impact on our post offices&#039; economics and how they operate. Traditionally, our constituents have been able to use girobooks to collect their pensions and benefits from a post office, but the Government are withdrawing that system in favour of direct payment. The method of direct payment according to which people may go directly to a post office to access payments is the Post Office card account, which is a substitute for the girobook, but the Government are encouraging people to switch to using bank accounts, although they offer an exceptions service for those who cannot cope with either service.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-05_para2">
<a name="stpa_2">The Government are forcing the pace of change because, as we know, people had the option to use their bank accounts prior to the Government&#039;s encouragement of that method, but they chose not to exercise it. We should respect the way in which our constituents wish to receive their pensions and benefits. We should understand that they have their own ways of budgeting and running their lives instead of forcing the pace of change for ministerial convenience. It is important to legislate on the matter to allow choice given the many other ways in which we have tried to persuade the Government to see the error of their ways and understand our constituents&#039; need for genuine choice, rather than forcing choice on them.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-05_para3">
<a name="stpa_3">There are consequences of a system that forces people to switch the way in which they handle their cash and finances from that with which they grew up. It is extremely dangerous for the Government to push people who are used to weekly budgeting with cash into using bank accounts against their wishes. Many people who currently collect cash from a post office have a bank account, but use it only for saving or to draw rainy-day amounts, rather than for day-to-day budgeting. If such people prematurely switch to receiving their pensions in their bank accounts, owing to the way in which the Department for Work and Pensions handles those people, and try to manage all their weekly budgeting through those accounts, they could get into any kind of muddle. That could lead to an overdraft, and they would thus be faced with letters from banks costing &#163;20 or &#163;30. A Post Office card account, however, cannot be overdrawn. It is a simple replacement for the girobook. People who use the account may still use their post offices and budget with cash.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-05_para4">
<a name="stpa_4">The changes to the system also have consequences for our post offices&#151;both rural and urban. The Government have had to recognise the additional 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>2 Nov 2004 : Column 170</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>pressures on rural post offices as they lose their traditional business of handling girobooks and they have had to come up with a subsidy of &#163;150 million a year. That will continue until 2008 as an attempt to protect the rural post office network.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-05_para5">
<a name="stpa_5">The Post Office has also had to undergo a major reorganisation of its urban branches. Only this week we have learned that Crown post offices are to face reorganisation. It is concerning to our constituents that the urban reinvention programme&#151;the re-planning of the urban network of sub-post offices&#151;went ahead without including the Crown reorganisation, as many will have assumed that, having lost their traditional urban post office, a Crown post office would provide the safety net.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-05_para6">
<a name="stpa_6">For many communities, the post office is the last vital link with public services. It is the last meeting point and the last shop in many a rural village. People collecting their pensions also give such shops business. Using the post office sustains any other economic enterprise in the branch. The Government have promised that people will be able to continue to use their post office to collect pensions and benefits, but that will be a hollow promise if the post office is no longer there to use. It is therefore extremely important that we maintain the economic viability of post offices.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-05_para7">
<a name="stpa_7">Primarily, my Bill aims to protect individuals. Following an inquiry last year by the Trade and Industry Committee into the way in which the Government handled the transition to direct payment, I am extremely worried about the way in which our constituents appear to be pressurised into switching to the use of bank accounts&#151;the Government&#039;s preferred method&#151;to receive their pensions or benefits. I seek to redress the balance.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-05_para8">
<a name="stpa_8">The danger of switching to a bank account is not only that people might become overdrawn but the fact that many bank accounts cannot be accessed at a post office. HSBC, Halifax Bank of Scotland and the Royal Bank of Scotland group still have not provided a link to their current accounts through the Post Office. Therefore, encouraging the use of bank accounts&#151;especially those I have just mentioned&#151;automatically means that people can no longer use their post office. The Bill sets out a procedure to enable a neutral choice to be made.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-05_para9">
<a name="stpa_9">The National Federation of Sub-Postmasters has highlighted such a choice in its 2004&#150;05 manifesto. Hon. Members will find the document extremely useful in understanding the needs of our sub-postmasters and how best we can take forward a viable post office network. My Bill addresses the key part in the document on access to pensions and benefits in which the federation requests that the system be simplified. Currently, there are about eight steps to opening a Post Office card account. On receipt of a letter from the Government asking whether one wants to switch from the girobook, one has only to fill in one&#039;s bank details in order to use a bank account, but eight hurdles must be crossed in order to open a Post Office card account.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-05_para10">
<a name="stpa_10">The claimant receives an invitation pack for direct payment from the Department for Work and Pensions. The claimant then has to phone the Department&#039;s euphemistically named customer conversion centre where, as many of our constituents will attest, they have to fight quite hard to insist on their right to a card 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>2 Nov 2004 : Column 171</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>account. The Department then sends the claimant a personal invitation document; the claimant takes the personal invitation document to the post office; the post office gives the claimant a card account application form; the claimant completes the application form and returns it to the sub-postmaster, who sends it to Post Office Ltd; Post Office Ltd then sends the claimant account details, a personal identification number and a pick-up notice for the claimant to pick up the card at the branch.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-05_para11">
<a name="stpa_11">The Government slightly improved the service over the summer. The claimant used to have to fill in the account details from the Department&#039;s direct payment invitation pack, but at least the Government have short-circuited that last stage, and details can now be sent directly to the sub-post office, where the form will have already been filled in.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-05_para12">
<a name="stpa_12">The federation suggests a far simpler system. When mailed at the end of the girobook system, the constituent is presented with a simple choice of whether to tick the box to say that they want to use an account at the post office, and to take the pre-completed form that has arrived at the same time to the local sub-post office to open an account. Alternatively, they can tick a box to indicate that they want to use a bank or building society account, in which case they may fill in a bank mandate. Thirdly and importantly, the federation suggests a third option of the exceptions service, under which someone may receive regular payments by girocheque through the post. It suggests that it should be made clear that if the constituent fails to respond, the 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>2 Nov 2004 : Column 172</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>latter option will automatically be enabled. Many constituents find the new system worrying and may well prefer to use the exceptions service.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-05_para13">
<a name="stpa_13">It is vital to have a simple process for the future, because conversion applies not only to current claimants; all new claimants will have to consider their options and it is essential that they are aware that they can still use the Post Office and open a card account. There will be a clear statement in the Bill on the procedures to be followed for a DWP customer to open a card account. Hon. Members on both sides of the House have concerns about the pressure that is being put on people to switch to bank accounts and the Bill will state clearly that no pressure should be put on people using the service to switch from a Post Office card account. The Post Office should be driven by customer choice, not departmental convenience.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-05_para14">
<a name="stpa_14">The House must exert its authority and insist that pensioners and those on benefits have a fair choice as to how they collect their cash in future. I commend the Bill to the House.

<p><a name="st_25"><a name="41102-07_spnew1"><b> Mr. Touhig: </b> 
 Given the way in which Bills are usually drafted and considered, it is unusual for a Minister who speaks about Welsh issues to be on his feet first on Report, particularly when some of the amendments are minor and technical. However, the Bill will benefit the children and young people of Wales, and I am delighted to open the debate.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-07_para1">
<a name="stpa_18">Before turning to the first technical Government amendment, however, I should like briefly to reflect on the Bill&#039;s passage through both Houses of Parliament. The Bill was introduced in the other place, where it was well received and described as a small Bill with a big heart. Although almost 600 amendments were tabled, many of them were probing amendments and the Bill&#039;s core remains unchanged. It is testament to the thinking behind the Bill&#039;s central provision&#151;to establish a commissioner to help improve the lot of children&#151;that it has attracted general support in this House.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>2 Nov 2004 : Column 178</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-07_para2">
<a name="stpa_19">I pay tribute to the good work by members of Standing Committee B on the Bill. The debate was well informed and constructive, and the Government were able to respond positively on a number of areas&#151; I am sure that the contributions to this afternoon&#039;s debate will be equally positive. A number of issues have followed the Bill through both Houses, and I have no doubt that they will be touched upon in the debate.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-07_para3">
<a name="stpa_20">I shall discuss Government new clause 11 and Government amendment No. 40 now and respond to amendments moved by hon. Members afterwards. New clause 11 provides for the effective sharing of information between the Assembly and the Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service&#151;CAFCASS. Following the transfer of CAFCASS in Wales to the Assembly under part 4 of the Bill, it will be important for both to have a facility that will allow them to share information relating to individual cases. For example, there are likely to be cases involving children of families living on either side of the border who have separate family proceedings officers, both of whose tasks would benefit from sharing information about the two cases.

<a name="time_3">
<a name="41102-07_time1"><h5>1 pm</h5>

</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-07_para4">
<a name="stpa_21">Similarly, a child made the subject of an order in Wales may at a later date move to England, so that if there are second proceedings in relation to that child, a different family proceedings officer will be appointed. Again, there will be considerable benefit from the Welsh family proceedings officer being able to share information about the first case with their counterpart in England. In addition, following the transfer, it will clearly be in the interests of both services for there to be ongoing liaison on good practice and management issues. Certainly, it would be desirable for CAFCASS and the Assembly to be able to share centrally held information concerned with organisational issues.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-07_para5">
<a name="stpa_22">Government amendment No. 40 simply corrects a drafting error. As the Bill stands, clause 27(2)(a) requires a local health board to appoint a lead officer for children and young people&#039;s services for the purposes of the board&#039;s functions under the co-operation arrangements in clause 25 and the planning requirements in clause 26. The reference to clause 26 is incorrect. Although, under clause 25, the local health board would be involved in the planning consultation for children&#039;s services, the duty to prepare and publish a plan under clause 26 rests with the children&#039;s services authority. The amendment therefore restores the duties of a local health board under clause 27 to those originally intended.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-07_para6">
<a name="stpa_23">I shall confine my remarks at this stage to the Government&#039;s proposals and respond appropriately when hon. Members have spoken to the other amendments.
</p>








<p><a name="st_26"><a name="41102-07_spnew2"><b> Mr. Roger Williams  (Brecon and Radnorshire) (LD):</b> 
 There is much in the Bill that Liberal Democrat Members can support, including the transfer of CAFCASS to Wales. However, the Minister will know that we have reservations about several issues, and we look to the Government to be more accommodating on those than they have been in the past.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-07_para7">
<a name="stpa_24">I wish to speak to amendments Nos. 5 to 8, which stand in my name and in that of my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>2 Nov 2004 : Column 179</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>(Mrs. Brooke). Amendment No. 5 follows recommendations made in the Clywch inquiry into abuse in schools. In one case, a schoolteacher devised inappropriate drama activities as part of an examination curriculum whereby children were encouraged into activities that were, because of their sexual content, entirely inappropriate for their age and maturity. The examining board&#151;the Welsh Joint Education Committee&#151;provided examiners to go into the school to investigate the activities on its behalf and to evaluate them in terms of their dramatic merit in classifying pupils for exam results. Those examiners should have reported that something was going on in the school that was giving them great concern, but unfortunately they did not do so. As a result, some of the abuse and harm went on for much longer than was necessary.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-07_para8">
<a name="stpa_25">Amendment No. 8 would therefore require that the Welsh Joint Education Committee be one of the partners that co-operates with the children&#039;s departments of local education authorities to ensure the welfare of children. In a plenary session of the Welsh Assembly, Jane Davidson, the Minister for Education and Lifelong Learning, said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3">&quot;Jane Hutt and I have written to Charles Clarke proposing that examination boards be added to the list of bodies that the Bill requires to have regard for the need to safeguard and promote the welfare of children.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-07_para9">
<a name="stpa_26">I hope that the Minister will take that on board. It is important that examination boards have a role to play, especially where practical activities are concerned.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-07_para10">
<a name="stpa_27">Amendment No. 6 would require that governors of prisons or secure training units in Wales&#151;or directors of contracted-out prisons or secure training units&#151;also become partners in promoting the welfare of children and young people.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-07_para11">
<a name="stpa_28">Amendments Nos. 7 and 8 are minor amendments that would give discretion to local authorities in naming the lead member or lead officer responsible for the functions in the Bill.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-07_para12">
<a name="stpa_29">I should like the Minister to respond particularly to Amendment No. 5, which experience in Wales has led us to believe should be included in the Bill.
</p>








<p><a name="st_27"><a name="41102-07_spnew3"><b> Mr. Martyn Jones  (Clwyd, South) (Lab):</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>(Mr. Williams)&#151;and by my hon. Friend the Member for Clwyd, South (Mr. Jones), although I am sure that he will return to those a bit later.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-08_para0">
<a name="stpa_30">Amendment No. 5, which stands in the names of the hon. Members for Mid-Dorset and North Poole and for Brecon and Radnorshire, proposes the inclusion of the Welsh Joint Education Committee&#151;WJEC&#151;in the list of partners in clause 25 who must co-operate with children&#039;s services authorities in Wales to improve the well-being of children in the area. The intention of clause 25 is that, taken with clause 26, it will provide a statutory basis for the work of the children and young people&#039;s framework partnerships in planning local services. It is difficult to see how the WJEC could be included with the clause 25 partners, because it is different in nature from the other bodies listed. It is a company limited by guarantee and owned jointly by the 22 local authorities in Wales. It has an office base in Cardiff but no regional or local presence in Wales, and it would be difficult to support its attendance at meetings of local partnerships. Its functions are highly specialised and narrow in comparison with the other bodies named as partners, which include the police, the probation service and health services. The National Council for Education and Training for Wales is included as a partner in recognition of the significant role that it plays as a local education and training provider.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-08_para1">
<a name="stpa_31">I am of course aware of the criticisms of the WJEC by the Children&#039;s Commissioner for Wales in the Clywch inquiry report that he published a little while ago. I take this opportunity to pay tribute to his valuable work in carrying out that inquiry. I do not believe, however, that the amendment would adequately address his concerns. Apart from the inappropriateness of the WJEC being involved in 22 sets of local planning arrangements, many other awarding bodies operating within Wales would have to be brought into the equation. The vast majority are England and Wales awarding bodies, and the commissioner clearly had that wider field in mind when making his recommendation to my colleagues in the Assembly. He recommended that the Welsh Assembly, in partnership with the Department for Education and the Awdurdod Cymwysterau, Cwricwluwm ac Asesu Cymru&#151;ACCAC&#151;and the equivalent qualifications, curriculum and assessment authorities in Scotland, Northern Ireland and England consider the role of examining bodies across the UK with regard to child protection arrangements. The Government and the Assembly are committed to working together with the regulatory authorities in England and Wales to produce a practical response to the commissioner&#039;s recommendations, and we have established a steering group to take that work forward. I therefore hope that the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire will concede that his amendment is a bit premature, because it is important that we have this wider consultation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-08_para2">
<a name="stpa_32">I have some difficulty with amendment No. 6 as well. The arrangements in clause 25 for promoting co-operation are focused mainly on children and young people who are permanently resident in the local authority area concerned. There would be little purpose in requiring a prison or secure training centre to take part in local arrangements with local agencies if few of the young people in its care were likely to come to their 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>2 Nov 2004 : Column 181</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>attention. However, clause 25(1)(c) places a duty on the children&#039;s services authorities to promote co-operation with


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_4">&quot;such persons or bodies as the authority consider appropriate&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-08_para3">
<a name="stpa_33">which I hope will give some comfort to the hon. Gentleman. If the authority considers it appropriate for a prison governor or a director of a secure training centre to be involved in the co-operation arrangements, the authority must seek that involvement. The outcome will be a matter for local arrangement, and will depend on local circumstances. It would be inappropriate, and perhaps disproportionate, for such governors and directors automatically to be required to become involved in local co-operation arrangements.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-08_para4">
<a name="stpa_34">In regard to amendments Nos. 7 and 8, there are a number of differences between the provisions for England and Wales in the Bill, which serve to build on the distinctive approach to developing services for children and young people that has been taken by my colleagues in the National Assembly. In Wales, no change is planned in the responsibility for service provision by requiring the appointment of a children&#039;s services director. There is no requirement for children&#039;s trusts. Instead, clause 27(1) requires each local authority to appoint a


</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_5">&quot;lead director for children and young people&#039;s services&quot;</p>

</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-08_para5">
<a name="stpa_35">to co-ordinate and oversee co-operation arrangements to improve their well-being, and to designate a member for the same purpose. These lead directors and the lead members required to be designated will be responsible for taking forward arrangements for partnership planning to ensure that it acts as the strategic driver for action. I hope that, in the light of these assurances, the hon. Gentleman and his colleagues will feel able not to press their amendments to a vote.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-08_para6">
<a name="stpa_36">We are somewhat confused about the intention behind amendment No. 33, tabled by the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham (Tim Loughton) and his hon. Friends. It might help if I explain the reason for the difference in commencement arrangements for clause 28 for the devolved and non-devolved bodies in Wales. The duty on agencies to ensure that their functions are discharged, having regard to the need to safeguard and promote the welfare of children, is placed on a range of agencies in Wales by clause 28, and in England by clause 11.
</p>








<p><a name="st_32"><a name="41102-08_spnew4"><b> Tim Loughton: </b> 
 May I save the Minister some breath? This amendment would be more appropriately tabled in relation to the private fostering arrangements, but it has not been. On that basis, I was not proposing to move it, so I hope that I can save some of the Minister&#039;s time.

I intend to speak to the Government amendments and then respond to the amendments tabled by other hon. Members.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-09_para1">
<a name="stpa_38">During our discussions on the Bill, strong arguments were advanced by foster carers and their organisations. We have listened to those arguments and are now in a position to respond positively to them. All hon. Members recognise the importance of foster carers, particularly in providing stability and a loving home for the most vulnerable children in our community&#151;those who are looked after by the state. If we are to meet our objective of ensuring greater stability for more looked-

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>2 Nov 2004 : Column 183</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>after children, it is key that we try to recruit and retain more foster carers in the foster care work force. To do that, we need to put in place a range of measures.

<a name="time_4">
<a name="41102-09_time0"><h5>1.15 pm</h5>

</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-09_para2">
<a name="stpa_39">We have already achieved a lot, but I recognise that there is more for us to do. For instance, we are supporting local authorities in recruiting local foster carers in their local communities and we have prepared a pack for local authorities to use for that purpose. The recruitment of foster carers is most sensibly carried out locally and the job for the Government is to support local authorities in that task. We are also supporting the training of foster carers in the local community. For foster carers to feel valued and to feel that they have an important role to play, it is important that they receive continuous professional development and training, to give them a feeling that theirs is a proper profession.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-09_para3">
<a name="stpa_40">We have also improved the tax and pensions position for foster carers, which has made a welcome change over the past few years. We are putting other measures in place, too. For example, we are developing a national telephone helpline for foster carers, and we hope to provide better support for foster carers who face allegations. We also want to celebrate excellence in foster carers through the introduction of a national award scheme.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-09_para4">
<a name="stpa_41">For all that, we have had strong representations about what is perceived to be the unfairness resulting from the variability in the allowances paid to foster carers across the country. Those allowances do vary. I have looked at the Fostering Network&#039;s figures and seen variations from &#163;60 to &#163;250 in the costs awarded to foster carers for looking after an eight-year-old child. There are even variations within regions, which is difficult to explain. For example, in the north-west region, the allowance paid for looking after an eight-year-old varies from &#163;60 to more than &#163;200 per week.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-09_para5">
<a name="stpa_42">The Government want to ensure that the allowances for foster carers fully meet the costs of caring for a looked-after child. We want to ensure greater transparency and consistency in the way in which local authorities calculate those allowances. That is why we are introducing the new clause and the amendments that go with it. Over the coming months, we will work closely with the local authorities and all the other stakeholders to come to a sensible view of how we should proceed on these issues.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-09_para6">
<a name="stpa_43">We must all recognise that there will be variations in the cost for caring for a looked-after child. There will be variations according to the child&#039;s age, for example, and regional variations reflecting differences in housing costs up and down the country. There will be legitimate differences in the costs involved in looking after a looked-after child, depending on the complexity of the issues facing a particular child. We need to address what precisely the allowances should cover and decide what should legitimately be included in an allowance and what is perhaps less fair. We also need better to understand the relationship between allowances and the payments that some authorities give to foster carers for looking after children.


<br>&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-09_para7">
<a name="stpa_44">We want to examine other issues relating to payment over the coming months. For example, is there sufficient clarity in each local authority about entitlements? Do foster carers face difficulties when claiming one- off grants? Are there inefficiencies in various local authorities in regard to providing information or responding promptly to claims by foster carers?
</p>








<p><a name="st_56"><a name="41102-09_spnew2"><b> Mr. Hilton Dawson  (Lancaster and Wyre) (Lab):</b> 
 My right hon. Friend rightly differentiates the remuneration of foster parents and payment for skills. Does she propose to introduce some national scale on which foster parents could be paid for the skills that they bring to their work?

<p><a name="st_57"><a name="41102-09_spnew3"><b> Margaret Hodge: </b> 
 That is one of the many issues on which we want to consult local authorities and other stakeholders, including those organisations that represent foster carers, to make sure that we have a scheme that is workable and fair, and that enables us to recruit and keep more foster carers looking after children.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-09_para8">
<a name="stpa_45">We already have resources available, about which some local authorities have expressed concern. For example, we have set aside &#163;113 million over this spending review period under our &quot;Choice Protects&quot; programme, which puts a focus on fostering. If we consider the comprehensive spending review settlement, an extra &#163;1 billion will be invested in children&#039;s services by the end of the period 2004&#150;05 to 2007&#150;08. We need to discuss local authorities&#039; priorities with them.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-09_para9">
<a name="stpa_46">I hope that the new clause and amendments are generally welcomed by the House.

<p><a name="st_58"><a name="41102-09_spnew4"><b> Tim Loughton  (East Worthing and Shoreham) (Con):</b> 
 May I start uncharacteristically by congratulating the Minister and the Government on the new clause and corresponding amendments? We did not discuss foster carer payments in Committee. I have supported such payments, because we face a drastic problem. We spoke in Committee about foster carer registration schemes, which I shall deal with later in relation to our two amendments in this group.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-09_para10">
<a name="stpa_47">The situation is dire and has got worse over the past year or so. It is now estimated that there are about 10,000 foster carer vacancies at a time when demand is certainly not lessening. There is great confusion about the amounts paid by varying local authorities to foster carers and no real benchmark for assessing whether local authorities are really paying the full cost. Figures produced by the Fostering Network show the enormous disparities, region by region, in relation to the percentage of local authorities paying below the minimum allowance: in the east midlands, 100 per cent. were below the minimum allowance, whereas in London, the figure was as low as 19 per cent. There is enormous confusion and variation in how fostering is remunerated up and down the country, which is one of the problems associated with the current shortage of foster carers. Perhaps more worrying is the way that we lose foster carers: the cost of training a foster carer is 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>2 Nov 2004 : Column 185</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>calculated as &#163;12,000, so it is a false economy not to do everything that we can to keep good-quality foster carers in place once we have them.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-09_para11">
<a name="stpa_48">I therefore welcome the fact that the Government have at last addressed this problem. There was a high-pressure campaign and many of us were e-mailed incessantly by foster carers all over the country calling for a new scheme for minimum allowances. Clearly, that work has paid off. But as the Minister said, much work still needs to be done to define how this scheme will operate in practice. I want to raise a few questions, most of which I am sure she will already be aware of. Perhaps she will give some initial responses as to the Government&#039;s current thinking, particularly in relation to how the scheme will be funded through local authorities.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-09_para12">
<a name="stpa_49">The Deputy Prime Minister agreed at a Central Local Partnership conference of councillors two weeks ago that the Government would not impose additional burdens on local authorities if they were unfunded. That was a clear commitment given to the Local Government Association and local councillors. We therefore hope that it will be clear to local authorities how the scheme will be funded over the longer term. What reserve powers will the Minister have to invoke to put the scheme in place? When is it likely to be introduced? We hope that it is not just a wish list for several years hence. The Minister mentioned that &#163;113 million is already allocated to &quot;Choice Protects&quot;, much of which is targeted at the training of foster carers, and providing information to foster carers, but not at allowances. It does not therefore tackle directly the problem of proper funding of the scheme.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-09_para13">
<a name="stpa_50">The Minister rightly referred to the problem of local authorities doing different things in different areas of the country. Certainly, variations for different costs of living up and down the country would be desirable. What discussions has she had with the LGA on putting that into effect? In a letter, the LGA stated:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_6">&quot;It has the potential to cut across the ability of the local authority to develop different arrangements for paying allowances, expenses and other specific grants for costs such as holidays or school trips to foster carers. Taking account of local variables such as the age profile of looked after child population, or the regional variations in the cost of living are important in determining allowances locally.&quot;</p>
</ul>

<a name="41102-09_para14">
<a name="stpa_51">I hope that all those considerations will be taken on board when the scheme is finalised.

<br>&nbsp;<br>Government have commissioned over the past five years confirms that privately fostered children are very vulnerable, and that a registration system involving the approval of private foster carers would protect their interests better than the current situation in which private foster carers are required only to notify local authorities about arrangements. I tackled her in Committee about how many people have fallen foul of the law as it currently stands. She was unable to answer that, largely because the number is tiny. The system is not working at the moment, and still too many people&#151;we do not know the extent of it, because it is unquantifiable&#151;are entering into private arrangements, particularly with vulnerable girls from west Africa who, as we know all too well, come into the country, disappear into the system and are open to all kinds of abuse and neglect, ending up in the sex industry or effectively as domestic slaves.

<a name="stpa_57">In effect, we have attacked the problem from the other end, because the Minister was not responsive to setting up a registration scheme, with the question: when will private fostering be allowed, permissible and promoted by the Government if that arrangement is not registered? That is a different question to address the same problem, and I hope that the Government start to have the sort of conversion that they appear to have had on fostering allowances and become more open-minded on going the whole hog.

<a name="stpa_60">I am delighted that this good news has been welcomed by the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham (Tim Loughton). Having managed a family placement team during the last eight miserable years of Conservative government before 1997, I can tell him that the rates paid to foster carers then were an absolute disgrace, and carers prevailed on me regularly to do something about it.

 Can the hon. Gentleman confirm that those eight so-called miserable years were years in which there were rather more Labour councils than there are now, and that it was left to councils to pay the carers? It is entirely down to the hon. Gentleman&#039;s party that those years were so miserable.

 My hon. Friend was in a similar position. We were indeed starved of resources. Let us get real: the problem has been around for probably 50 years, but it was certainly much worse under the Tory Government. It has taken this Government to provide real resources and show real determination.

 The hon. Gentleman has a good deal of experience, but is there is not also a responsibility to ensure that local authorities have enough resources to support the foster carers whom we hope to recruit? Past failure has been due to a lack of resources at the centre to pay those taking on the task that the hon. Gentleman describes so eloquently.

<p><a name="st_64"><a name="41102-10_spnew5"><b> Mr. Dawson: </b> 
 I agree. Thanks to &quot;Choice Protects&quot;, at last some real investment&#151;good money&#151;is being spent on the training and ongoing support of foster carers, and we will see that that continues.

They vary in different parts of the country and in different parts of the care system. What I would insist on is the development of good practice. I hope that we will not end up with a basic service providing the bare minimum. What foster carers want, need and deserve is quality&#151;quality support, quality training and quality remuneration. They do not want to have to undergo endless bureaucratic processes just to identify the odd bit of money that they have paid on a child&#039;s behalf.

<a name="stpa_62">Looked-after children are the children of corporate parents, the local authorities. Those 60,000 looked-after children are our children.

<br>&nbsp;<br>that they will quickly realise that the present notification scheme is completely inadequate. A registration scheme would be effective, simple and in the interests of privately fostered children, their parents and the fosterers. Today, however, we should celebrate the progress that is being made, and look forward to consultation and the involvement of all parties in making the care system much better than it has been in the past.

We should value the wonderful people who offer those services, and show that we value them.

I particularly appreciate the Minister&#039;s assurance that there will be more emphasis on training: I think that professionalisation is part of the valuing of the skills from which we are benefiting as a society and as corporate parent. What is clear is that we have failed looked-after children in many respects, and we can do much better.

 I am sorry to disappoint hon. Members who may be looking for some dissent here but I too welcome the words of the Minister. I have long been in favour of establishing minimum fostering allowances. As a very young social worker in the mid-1970s, I found it extremely difficult to recruit foster parents, one of the reasons being that the rates were so insufficient. Only last year, I met with the fostering network in my constituency in Caernarfon, Gwynedd, and found the same concerns surfacing yet again, some 28 years later.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-10_para8">
<a name="stpa_68">Foster parents are in short supply. Often they are out of pocket, and willingly so because they are committed to the work that they do. They play an invaluable role on behalf of us all. That should be recognised properly. The state should not be, by default, taking advantage of

<a name="41102-10_para9">
<a name="stpa_69">There is something of a postcode lottery in Wales, as the rates vary in the 22 local authorities. I will be glad to see the establishment of minimum rates, so that the rates paid do not depend on the local authority&#039;s ability to pay. I and the hon. Members who have contributed so far may have been reading the same brief. I think that the questions that have been raised already are important: how will the rates be calculated&#151;I say &quot;rates&quot; because I assume that there will be a number&#151;when will they be implemented and will local authorities be certain that a ring-fenced grant is available to ensure that the measure is properly funded?
</p>








<p><a name="st_67"><a name="41102-10_spnew8"><b> Mr. Hancock: </b> 
 Like other hon. Members, I am delighted that we have this measure. It would be foolish of anyone here to doubt its necessity, or the pleasure that the whole House must have in seeing the new clause and indeed the Bill come into force. However, there are real issues.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-10_para10">
<a name="stpa_70">I had 35 years&#039; experience in local government of trying to recruit and encourage people to foster. It was not just the initial rate for the job that was a problem, but the failure of local authorities to support foster parents once in a position to take care of children. They always had to fight for the foster child&#039;s right to have the money to go on a school trip or to have the school uniform provided. Local authorities always saw foster care and fosterers as at the bottom end of social services&#039; responsibilities. There was never great enthusiasm, mainly because too many social services directors thought that they knew best and held children&#039;s homes as a solution to the problem. It has taken a generation to change that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-10_para11">
<a name="stpa_71">I am delighted that the director of social services for Portsmouth city council, Mr. Rob Hutchinson, has been actively involved in much of the work that we are discussing. It is to his credit that he brings his reputation and the experience that he has gained both in Portsmouth and in Hampshire to bear on this matter, but the issues do not end there. Hon. Members are right to raise some doubts: the length of time it will take clearly to establish a minimum rate that will be universally acceptable and the need for flexibility on top of that, because it will still be difficult to recruit. In London, it will for ever be difficult to recruit foster parents. In some regions of the south-east, because of the economic climate, it will be difficult because it will be better for a family who need the resources to go elsewhere. Therefore, we must ensure that the judgment made on the minimum rate is right, and that local authorities have flexibility to allow extra payments to be made to take care of local needs. That must be a requirement.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-10_para12">
<a name="stpa_72">On the point about local authorities ring-fencing not only the fostering element but their responsibilities towards fosterers, one cannot increase the number of fosterers if one does not increase the amount available to local authorities to manage, recruit, train and supervise what is happening properly. Too many local authorities will recruit as many fosterers as they can to take care of these vulnerable children in what they consider now to be the best way, yet not resource their central advisers to fosterers properly.

<a name="stpa_73">Sadly, private fostering has often come to the fore in my area. Local authorities face dilemmas in trying to deal with that, as do any of the authorities, such as the police, that may want to get involved but find it difficult to do so. I am at a loss to understand why the idea of a compulsory legally enforceable register for private fostering is not at the forefront of the Bill, because the real dangers are to those children.

For that not to be recognised is a failure. Some way of having proper control over those arrangements and over the monitoring of those children is essential if we are to give them a fair chance in life. It is simply not good enough to suggest that what we have at the moment is satisfactory, because it manifestly is not.

During 2006, we hope to work with local authorities in implementing the rates, as set in 2005. We will then, probably at the beginning of 2007, invoke the power, should that be necessary, if local authorities are not complying with the rates that have been agreed with them.

<a name="stpa_80">On costs, I accept the commitment given by the Government that were we to impose additional burdens, we would provide the necessary funding but I hope hon. Members will agree that looked-after children have to be placed. There is a legislative imperative to do so. If we do not have sufficient foster carers, particularly in the local community, an on-the-spot decision tends to be taken. Often, the looked-after children are placed in extremely expensive residential accommodation out of the borough. My officials and I will need some convincing during our discussions that setting an appropriate and proper minimum foster care allowance will constitute an additional expense. It could lead to a change in the way in which we spend money, and to an expenditure saving that we could then reinvest in other services that support foster carers or looked-after children. We will keep this issue at the forefront of our minds, but we do not necessarily agree that such an allowance will lead to an increase in expenditure on looked-after children in whom local authorities already invest money.
</p>

<a name="41102-11_para5">
<a name="stpa_81">I do not want to suggest, as I had to do in Committee, that on these issues we are the libertarians and the Opposition are the Stalinists. However, we will not consider using a ring-fenced grant as a mechanism for implementing a minimum foster care system. We will have discussions with the Local Government Association, the Association of Directors of Social Services, and the various voluntary organisations that represent foster carers. We want, in that partnership environment, to work through what are very complex issues and to establish a workable system.
</p>








<p><a name="st_69"><a name="41102-11_spnew1"><b> Tim Loughton: </b> 
 I do not wish to appear too Stalinist, but is the Minister saying that there will be a saving, which I agree there will be? As we discussed in Committee, we are talking about private children&#039;s homes that cost &#163;2,000 a week upwards compared with foster carers who cost several hundred pounds, but surely there has to be a lead-in process. Will the Minister make sure that the money is available for local authorities to ensure that foster carers are trained and in place&#151;doing so will indeed cost money&#151;even if the savings will come a few years down the line, when we will no longer have to rely so much on out-of-area placements?

 That is just the sort of detailed conversation that we need to engage in with our partners.

 Does my right hon. Friend agree that it is very easy simply to say that we will reduce the number of out-of-borough placements to the private sector? In fact, we need all these services, including specialist residential provision, so it is not a case of having one or the other. It is essential that we have such provision, and that it has the capacity to develop services for the most damaged children.

 I agree with my hon. Friend and I certainly respect his experience, which was gained during many years on the front line as a social worker. But equally, I hope that he agrees with me that it is in the interests of more looked-after children to provide them with the stability of a placement in a loving home with a foster carer. Whatever the shortages, if we can increase the number of such carers&#151;we need to establish a far better basis for doing so than currently exists&#151;using the creation of a national foster allowance system as one mechanism for doing so, that will improve the lives of looked-after children for whom such an environment is appropriate. Over time, that should lead to some savings for local authorities that currently do not commission in a particularly rational way the places that they require for such children.

<a name="41102-11_para6">
<a name="stpa_82">Given that Members want to speak about other issues, I shall deal briefly with the registration of private foster care. I agree with the House that this is a very important issue that we need to get right, which is why we have secured the relevant power through what is known as a sunset clause. As a result, if we cannot improve the current notification scheme, we can move immediately to a registration scheme without needing to return to the House to obtain primary legislation. The whole House agrees, as do I, that the current notification scheme is not working and is inadequate. But I hope that in the light of the additional powers that we are taking&#151;powers to insist that awareness of the scheme be promoted, and that local authorities monitor their own notification schemes&#151;Members will agree that it is worth allowing time to see whether the system works. With the best will in the world, even a registration scheme might not provide the safeguards and protection that we all seek for such children, who are sometimes the most vulnerable in our communities.

<p><a name="st_73"><a name="41102-11_spnew5"><b> Jonathan Shaw: </b> 
 My right hon. Friend knows my views on this matter. What criteria does she envisage the Department using to assess whether her proposed scheme is successful, particularly given that the number of private foster carers is not known because the figures are not collated?

<p><a name="st_74"><a name="41102-11_spnew6"><b> Margaret Hodge: </b> 
 This is a difficult issue, but those authorities that are making huge efforts to ensure that the notification scheme works have a far greater number of notifications than those that, in my view, are not making adequate efforts. So monitoring the number of notifications will be just one of the mechanisms that we will use. However, my hon. Friend is right to draw our attention to this issue. We do need to get a better handle on the quantum of the problem, and to focus on the most vulnerable among the broad group of children who come under private fostering arrangements.

 I think that the consensus has come to an end. I rise to speak to new clause 1 and amendment No. 1, which would delete clause 2, as amended in Committee, to consequential amendments Nos. 24 to 27, and to amendment No. 4, which would leave out clause 4. My hon. Friend the Member for Brecon and Radnorshire (Mr. Williams) very much hopes to speak to new clause 2, and on other issues pertaining particularly to Wales. As we are short of time, it might help if I said at the outset that we want to press new clauses 1 and 2 to a vote.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-13_para0">
<a name="stpa_85">The Minister will be aware that a wide range of organisations and individuals are enormously disappointed with the amendments to clause 2 that were recently passed in Committee. During the debate, it became apparent that the Government&#039;s views on the functions and role of the children&#039;s commissioner were 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>2 Nov 2004 : Column 197</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>fundamentally different from those who opposed the amendments, with little hope of convergence. Given the widespread welcome for a Children&#039;s Commissioner for England&#151;I do indeed welcome the concept&#151;it is surely right that we revisit the issues and reflect on the cross-party support given in the other place to a clause similar to new clause 1. Indeed, new clause 1 is also very similar to new clause 13, as proposed by the Conservatives.

</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-13_para4">
<a name="stpa_89">We welcome the fact that the Government accepted at a very early stage an amendment in the other place whereby the commissioner &quot;must&quot;&#151;rather than &quot;may&quot;&#151;have regard to the United Nations convention on the rights of the child. But the Government also required that the commissioner be concerned &quot;in particular&quot; with the five &quot;outcome goals&quot;. The Joint Committee on Human Rights concluded:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_14">&quot;We consider that the confusion engendered by reincorporating in the Bill a duty to have regard both to the Convention and the five outcomes will risk downgrading the Convention from a framework to a background to the Commissioner&#039;s work&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. We conclude that it is unnecessary for the five outcomes listed in clause 2(3) as originally introduced to be reinstated. If the Government feels they must, they should be clearly placed within the context of the CRC.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-13_para5">
<a name="stpa_90">The Minister told the Committee that if the focus were simply on rights, it would limit the work that the commissioner could do on behalf of children. That is a point with which we have considerable difficulty.

<a name="time_7">
<a name="41102-13_time0"><h5>2 pm</h5>

</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-13_para6">
<a name="stpa_91">There is nothing narrow about the proposed focus on rights and interests. The convention on the rights of the child covers all aspects of childhood and we ratified that convention in 1991. It gives all babies and children a comprehensive set of economic, social, cultural, civil and political rights, 40 in all. Because of constraints on time, I shall not run through them all, but they cover education, health, sexual exploitation, adoption, children in trouble with the law and so forth. The convention provides a wide framework for the children&#039;s commissioner and it is not limiting in the way the Minister suggested. It is, indeed, a foundation on which everything else can be built.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-13_para7">
<a name="stpa_92">We oppose clause 4 because it gives the Secretary of State the power to direct the commissioner to undertake an inquiry. The Government have given assurances that they foresee the power being used only in cases of extreme significance. However, the Secretary of State can already convene such an inquiry under existing powers.

<br>&nbsp;<br>Children argued in favour of the Secretary of State having powers to direct? Does she agree that that is totally wrong and that the Secretary of State should not have such powers?

<a name="stpa_99">The Government say that they do not want to extend devolution on this matter, but extending powers at this stage would not affect the current devolution settlement one iota. Acceptance of the amendment would not give a single additional power to the National Assembly for Wales, but would allow the Children&#039;s Commissioner for Wales to carry out his duties properly and to help Welsh children in all aspects of their lives, wherever they are in the UK.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-14_para7">
<a name="stpa_100">I cannot emphasise enough to the House that the Children&#039;s Commissioner for Wales is an independent body and not a National Assembly body and neither is the commissioner&#039;s role to be an adjunct to the Welsh Assembly Government. He stands alone and should not be mixed up in the devolution process, as the Government seem to fear is likely to happen.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-14_para8">
<a name="stpa_101">Members of the Welsh Affairs Committee have rehearsed the arguments on many occasions over this specific point. Indeed, the Committee conducted a report, &quot;The Powers of the Children&#039;s Commissioner for Wales&quot;, and we took evidence from the Minister for Children herself. The amendments advocate a logical and sensible move for the children of Wales, and I can assure the House that everyone in Wales agrees with what they propose. I would not have added my name to the amendments and new clauses if I were swimming against the tide of Welsh opinion. Children&#039;s organisations and the National Assembly for Wales believe that this is the right move for Welsh children and that the Government are wrong on this specific issue. I am sure that the Minister would agree that the acid test is how legislation operates in practice.
</p>








<p><a name="st_178"><a name="41102-14_spnew3"><b> Mr. Touhig: </b> 
 I congratulate the Committee on its excellent work, as reflected in the report, but is my hon. Friend aware that, in his annual report, the Children&#039;s Commissioner for Wales made it plain that he was able to make representations to the Government on any matter affecting children in Wales? It works.
</p>








<p><a name="st_179"><a name="41102-14_spnew4"><b> Mr. Jones: </b> 
 I have no doubt that he will attempt to make it work, but I also know from the evidence that he gave to the Committee&#151;my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary is being selective&#151;that he does not accept that the drafting of the legislation would make his job any easier. In fact, he said that it would make it more difficult.
</p>








<p><a name="st_180"><a name="41102-14_spnew5"><b> Mr. Martin Caton  (Gower) (Lab):</b> 
 Does my hon. Friend agree that the debate shows that we are not asking the Government to move very far? We are asking only to formalise and make proper an arrangement that already exists informally. The point is that the Children&#039;s Commissioner for Wales is not a creature of the Assembly&#151;it is completely independent&#151;so the huge constitutional crisis that Ministers seem to fear will not arise.
</p>








<p><a name="st_181"><a name="41102-14_spnew6"><b> Mr. Jones: </b> 
 Indeed. There is no crisis. The Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service has

<br>&nbsp;<br>already been devolved to the Assembly. We are talking about something that is far less of a move than that. I simply cannot understand why the Government are so intransigent on this matter. I know that the Minister wants what is best for children in Wales, so she should listen more to what the NGOs and charities in Wales are saying; they want the same thing.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-14_para9">
<a name="stpa_102">I am a huge supporter of the concept of draft legislation, but if the Government want Select Committees to undertake detailed pre-legislative scrutiny, they will have to accept that they should listen on occasions to what those Committees say. This is one such occasion and I ask the Government to accept the amendments in order to make a good and well-intentioned Bill even better.
</p>








<p><a name="st_182"><a name="41102-14_spnew7"><b> Tim Loughton: </b> 
 The consensus is well and truly over at this stage, and the great melange of amendments and new clauses in the group covers a wide range of subjects about the children&#039;s commissioner. I shall speak briefly to new clause 1, proposed by the hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole (Mrs. Brooke), which we shall support. It is similar to our new clause 13.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-14_para10">
<a name="stpa_103">In Committee debates about the children&#039;s commissioner, we applied five principles. First, the new children&#039;s commissioner should be independent of the Government and a champion for children. Secondly, the commissioner should be powerful enough to do his or her job properly, regardless of Government schemes and funding shortfalls. Thirdly, he should fully engage with children and young people and also gain their confidence, as Baroness Ashton said in the other place. Fourthly, the children&#039;s commissioner should have a clear status in the context of other UK commissioners and other agencies and interested parties. Fifthly, the commissioner should be accountable to all of the above.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-14_para11">
<a name="stpa_104">I fear that the way in which the Government have emasculated the powers of the commissioner has spoiled the cross-party consensus. I see the Minister for Children responding with an enormous Cheshire cat grin on her face as though she has just killed the biggest rat of all. There was enormous cross-party consensus to put together a comprehensive new clause 2 in the Lords. She has completely torn the guts out of it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-14_para12">
<a name="stpa_105">Let us remind ourselves of what the Government have reversed. They have completely left out the mention of children&#039;s rights. Instead, the children&#039;s commissioner will be promoting awareness of children&#039;s views. Children have no rights in the Bill; it is rights-lite, rights-free. In Committee, I offered the Minister the comparison of considering how feeble the Disability Rights Commission would appear if its general function were simply to promote awareness of the views of disabled people. The same would be true of the Commission for Racial Equality or the Equal Opportunities Commission.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-14_para13">
<a name="stpa_106">The Minister made a series of amendments rather than just replacing new clause 2, and I have never been sure why she did that. The Bill dilutes the review and reporting powers, removing the advocacy and whistleblowing arrangements. It declines to beef up the children&#039;s commissioner&#039;s obligations to make children aware that they can consult him, and restores the Government&#039;s limited checklist on what sort of children&#039;s views and interests&#151;not rights&#151;he can take 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>2 Nov 2004 : Column 201</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>notice of. It reinforces the commissioner&#039;s inability to undertake inquiries into individual cases, even when they have implications for children generally. That is why the original clause, to which the Government have reverted, was described in the upper Chamber as discriminatory and castrated and as giving the children&#039;s commissioner the powers of a glorified public relations consultant. All along, the Government have claimed that they have done what children wanted, but nowhere have they provided evidence of that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-14_para14">
<a name="stpa_107">Five references to children&#039;s rights have been removed. The provision to support individual children was removed. The references to reviewing and reporting on the effectiveness of advice and advocacy and on whistleblowing and inspection arrangements were removed. The Government reinserted their outcome goals in part 1 of the Bill.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-14_para15">
<a name="stpa_108">The Minister said that, in Committee, Ministers stated that the Government would ensure that they had the best commissioner in the world, built on their experience of the workings of commissioners in other countries. The Children&#039;s Rights Alliance has been completely unable to find a commissioner anywhere who does not have the basic duty of promoting and safeguarding children&#039;s rights, which means, by the looks of things, that the Children&#039;s Commissioner for England will not be permitted to be part of the European network.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-14_para16">
<a name="stpa_109">We want to restore the original clause 2 that was inserted in the Bill in the upper House, as it has been emasculated. We will support new clause 1 in endeavouring to do that, although we think that new clause 13, removing subsection (7)&#151;about which we, and the Government, have some qualms&#151;would be the best way to do that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-14_para17">
<a name="stpa_110">Amendments Nos. 11 and 12 are all about involving children, which is what the Bill is supposed to be all about. Amendment No. 11 would take the short phrase &quot;take reasonable steps&quot; from subsection (4) so that the children&#039;s commissioner must involve children in the discharge of his functions. That is what we have assumed all the way along, so why must &quot;reasonable steps&quot; be placed in the way of the commissioner&#039;s doing that?
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-14_para18">
<a name="stpa_111">In the first schedule to the Bill, we want to involve children much more in the selection of the children&#039;s commissioner in the first place. Amendment No. 9 says that the appointment of the commissioner should involve children and children&#039;s organisations. Consider the status of the other children&#039;s commissioners. In Wales, the appointment is made by the First Secretary of the National Assembly after taking account of the advice of the relevant committee, the views of relevant children and the advice of a selection panel independent of the Assembly. In Northern Ireland, the commissioner is appointed by the First Minister and Deputy First Minister jointly, independently of the Government. In Scotland, the commissioner is appointed by the Queen on the nomination of the Scottish Parliament. But in England, he will be appointed by the Secretary of State. That is very different from the arrangements that pertain in the rest of the United Kingdom, which is why the English commissioner is not going to be the best in the world. In a phrase often quoted in the House of Lords, it is all about big ears and no teeth.

<a name="stpa_112">Among the other amendments, one originally tabled by Lord Northbourne places in the Bill a necessity for the children&#039;s commissioner to take into account the views of parents and carers when dealing with children. Parents have a very special status, the most special status. The Government trotted out the usual routine about it being iniquitous to specify one set of people or organisations, but we think that that is tosh when it applies to parents, who clearly have a special status, hence amendment No. 13.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-14_para20">
<a name="stpa_113">The Government have dealt disgracefully with all the hard work that went into putting together a comprehensive new clause 2 that had support across the upper House and has support on all Benches in this House, other than the Government Front Bench. That work was about making the children&#039;s commissioner a real children&#039;s champion who would stand up to represent children and be a part of their lobbies. The Government have taken away all those additional powers that would have made the Children&#039;s Commissioner for England the most powerful and impressive of all, and that is a missed opportunity.

<a name="stpa_114">I shall not refer at length to concerns about the Welsh dimension. I share them, and we tabled amendments on that in Committee. There will be enormous confusion over the relationship between the English commissioner and those of the other three nations of the United Kingdom. Given that we have devolution, let us have a system under which the four commissioners can talk to each other equally without treading on each other&#039;s toes, as will invariably happen. We foresee great problems in the future, which is a pity. This is a missed opportunity, and I ask the House to support new clause 1.

</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-15_para0">
<a name="stpa_115">We discussed issues relating to Wales at length in Standing Committee and in the Select Committee on Welsh Affairs. We have taken a lot of evidence, as my hon. Friend, who chairs the Committee, has said. The Government should listen to the Welsh Affairs Committee, whose views have been totally ignored. It is shameful that the Government have not taken more notice of what we have said.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-15_para1">
<a name="stpa_116">The Government should also have taken more notice of the first children&#039;s commissioner to be set up in the United Kingdom, Peter Clarke, who has been in post for three years now. They did not even consult him about the shape and form of the new Children&#039;s Commissioner for England. That was a terrible failing. This is a good Bill and it is sad that issues remain that could have been sorted out. There is much to rejoice in, including today&#039;s good news from the Government, but it is sad that we have had to raise the Welsh dimension again today.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-15_para2">
<a name="stpa_117">The overwhelming view in Wales is that the Government&#039;s proposals in clause 5, which amendment No. 34 aims to delete, would undermine the Children&#039;s Commissioner for Wales and be confusing to children in Wales. The Northern Ireland and Scotland commissioners also find the proposals undermining.

<br>&nbsp;<br>to consideration of children and their rights. The Government have not consulted him or listened to him. What is happening is undermining him. Their proposals are a setback for Wales.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-15_para4">
<a name="stpa_119">The Children&#039;s Commissioner for Wales already has the power to listen to any concerns raised by children. He has been into prisons to see children and he has related his findings to the police and worked hard on such non-devolved matters. Clause 5 gives the English children&#039;s commissioner the function of promoting awareness in Wales about non-devolved matters, without any proposal for him to have even a base in Wales.

<p><a name="st_184"><a name="41102-15_spnew1"><b> Mrs. Betty Williams  (Conwy) (Lab):</b> 
 Is my hon. Friend aware that the president of the European Network of Ombudspersons for Children recently wrote to my right hon. Friend the Minister for Children emphasising that, under the job description that has been given, it is unlikely that the commissioner would be able to join the network. Not only is the commissioner in England likely to be a watered-down version of the commissioners already in place in the other UK nations, but the protection afforded would compare badly with what is offered by counterparts in Europe. I do not believe that English children are uniquely undeserving of a real commissioner.

<a name="41102-15_para5">
<a name="stpa_120">The English children&#039;s commissioner will operate without knowledge of the Welsh context or of the interface between devolved and non-devolved matters. Peter Clarke and the children&#039;s commissioners for Scotland and for Northern Ireland have condemned the proposed model and said that it is a recipe for confusion. Peter Clarke said that if he visited secure accommodation in Neath and saw two children, he would be responsible for the one who had come in through the care system but not for the other if that child had come in through the juvenile justice system, because the latter child would come under the remit of the English children&#039;s commissioner.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-15_para6">
<a name="stpa_121">That is bound to cause problems and difficulties. Our duty is to children in Wales, and we must ensure that those who have problems are clear about where they should take them. It is very sad that we have been unable to come to an arrangement that is satisfactory to everyone in Wales.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-15_para7">
<a name="stpa_122">Clause 5 also allows the English Secretary of State to direct the English children&#039;s commissioner to undertake inquiries in Wales. That means that an English Minister can ask the English children&#039;s commissioner to conduct an inquiry, in Wales, into a case involving a Welsh child. That is a recipe for confusion, and it calls into question the independence of the Children&#039;s Commissioner for Wales. I do not see how a person who can be directed by a Secretary of State can be called &quot;independent&quot;.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-15_para8">

<br>&nbsp;<br>arrangements that we are making will best serve the interests of children in Wales. I am sorry that the Government have not listened to the Welsh Affairs Committee, the Children&#039;s Commissioner for Wales or to children&#039;s organisations in Wales, because it means that they have not listened to those who work most closely with children in Wales.

</p>








<p><a name="st_186"><a name="41102-15_spnew3"><b> Margaret Hodge: </b> 
 I want to begin by assuring all hon. Members that the Government have listened to other opinions, throughout this debate and in connection with every clause in the Bill. The range of amendments that the Government have tabled, in respect of the children&#039;s commissioner and of other matters, is proof of that. Not every interested party will agree on every aspect of the Bill, but that is another issue. We have been engaged in a thorough process and have tried to listen to all the issues that people have raised.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-15_para10">
<a name="stpa_125">In the little time that remains, I want to go back over the principal issues, and the question of whether we are establishing a powerful and strong champion for children. I shall then turn to the issues raised by those of my hon. Friends who represent constituencies in Wales.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-15_para11">
<a name="stpa_126">I repeat what I said in Committee: I believe that the commissioner for English children that the Bill establishes&#151;who will also have responsibility for British children on non-devolved issues&#151;will be an extremely powerful and effective champion on behalf of children. In framing the commissioner&#039;s powers and duties, we have had regard for the UN convention on the rights of the child, which is why we listened to the arguments in support of amendments tabled in the upper House. As a result, the commissioner must have regard for the UNCRC, which proves that his work has its basis in children&#039;s rights.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-15_para12">
<a name="stpa_127">However, we have also said from the start that we do not wish to establish in England a commissioner whose primary purpose is to police individual rights. A panoply of structures exists already&#151;in the courts and various tribunals&#151;that ensures that individuals can pursue their rights. The commissioner will have the duty to oversee those systems, ensuring that the complaint mechanisms and tribunals work and that the courts defend individual rights.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-15_para13">
<a name="stpa_128">Yet we also want the commissioner to do more. We want him to look at the outcomes that children and young people say are important, and at the much wider picture of children&#039;s lives. He would report to Parliament and elsewhere on all those important matters. As I said in Committee, if a commissioner were in place today, he would be looking at matters such as how children and young people are portrayed in the media, their position in the criminal justice system, and child obesity. The commissioner may well also look at other important issues, but if he had to focus on policing individual rights, he would have no time to do anything else.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-15_para14">
<a name="stpa_129">I assure the House that under the general functions laid out in clause 2 the commissioner will be independent and able to look at any issue or question. 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>2 Nov 2004 : Column 205</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>He will be able to initiate inquires into any case that has wider significance and public policy implications. That is another example of how the Government have listened.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-15_para15">
<a name="stpa_130">The commissioner will have total discretion over the budgets that he commands, except for the normal considerations of propriety. Another sign of the Government&#039;s willingness to listen is the fact that the commissioner will have access to children&#151;a provision that we introduced to the Bill. In addition, the Government have amended the Bill to ensure that the commissioner can seek responses to the inquiries and recommendations contained in reports that he compiles. The commissioner will report annually to Parliament, and I hope that the relevant Select Committees will hold him to account.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-15_para16">
<a name="stpa_131">Finally, I remind the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham (Tim Loughton) that the word &quot;rights&quot; does not appear in the legislation setting out the functions of the disability rights commissioner.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-15_para17">
<a name="stpa_132">I turn now to the issues raised by those of my hon. Friends with constituencies in Wales. Like them, the Government are anxious to ensure that children in Wales are no less well served by their children&#039;s commissioner than their counterparts in England would be. However, we must work within the devolution settlement as it stands. I know that some of my hon. Friends find that difficult, but we do not want the children&#039;s commissioner&#151;who will report every year to this House through the Secretary of State for Education and Skills&#151;to relinquish all responsibility for matters in Wales that remain the responsibility of Westminster.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-15_para18">
<a name="stpa_133">Certain hon. Members have argued that we cannot change the devolution settlement in the context of this debate. I agree, and that is why we tabled three new clauses in Committee to clarify the role of the children&#039;s commissioners in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, and to enable all the UK commissioners to work together on non-devolved matters. Those amendments were accepted and now form part of the Bill.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-15_para19">
<a name="stpa_134">We envisage that, in practice, the commissioners will draw up informal ways of working together on non-devolved issues that will be child friendly while at the same time remaining within the terms of the devolution settlement. To deprive children in Scotland, Northern Ireland or Wales of the services of the children&#039;s commissioner in respect of non-devolved matters would not enhance those children&#039;s national identity or culture. They will simply lose the services of a commissioner who has a general overview and represents all our children in matters affecting the United Kingdom as a whole that are decided in Westminster. They will therefore be worse off than their counterparts in England. I cannot believe that that is the wish of my hon. Friends in tabling those amendments or of the House, and I hope&#151;

 We now come to what could be, barring the smacking debate that we shall hold later, the most contentious part of the Bill and the one about which the Opposition have the most concerns. I want to talk to clause 12 as a whole. Amendment no. 46 would delete it, but other amendments in the group, as well as new clause 4 itself, would improve and make acceptable the whole section about databases.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-18_para0">
<a name="stpa_136">This is an important part of the Bill. In Committee, we spent more than a morning on it, rightly, yet at the end of that time we had few assurances from the Minister for Children, Young People and Families about how the provisions would work, so we subsequently decided to vote against the whole clause. The upper House made some improvements to the clause, but although they were welcome they did not go nearly far enough.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-18_para1">
<a name="stpa_137">In Committee, the Minister mentioned that she hoped our fears would be assuaged by the publication of the consultation document on the whole database system, which duly took place last week. We are grateful for that consultation document, but that is all it is&#151;a consultation document. It is not a White Paper; it does not show a firm direction for the Government to take. The responses will not be in until the end of January, yet we are being asked, at this late stage of the Bill&#039;s progress, to write the Government a large blank cheque to set up powerful databases that would include each and every one of the more than 11 million children in this country.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-18_para2">
<a name="stpa_138">The 10 trailblazer projects&#151;pilots&#151;being set up to try to investigate how such schemes could work are only halfway through their task. That work is being extended until March 2005 and the projects have just been granted second-tier funding, yet we are being asked to give the Secretary of State enormous powers to set up databases, about which there remain a lot of 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>2 Nov 2004 : Column 215</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>unanswered questions. The Government do not even know what the final identity and nature of those databases will be.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-18_para3">
<a name="stpa_139">Even more worrying is the fact that only in the last week or so have we started to hear details about the Government&#039;s integrated children&#039;s systems, which, I gather, are to replace child protection registers by December 2005. They will be more detailed than child protection registers and will contain children&#039;s social care case records. They will operate in parallel with other case record systems, such as the NHS care record system for health practitioners.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-18_para4">
<a name="stpa_140">The Minister has pledged &#163;30 million to the project over the next two years, yet that was not mentioned once during the entire proceedings of the Bill in the upper House, on Second Reading or in Committee. Not once did the Minister allude to the fact that another much larger database is being constructed, for which money is already committed, and which will replace child protection registers.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-18_para5">
<a name="stpa_141">Why was that not mentioned? How will the new system interact with the databases that we are discussing in the Bill? How will information be transferred? What arrangements have been made for security of access under the new systems? In answer to my written question

 The hon. Gentleman has acknowledged Lord Laming&#039;s recommendation that information sharing is absolutely vital. He clearly welcomed the amendments to the provisions proposed by the Lords. He was complimentary about some of the information that is coming from his own trailblazer. He has asked for details about the consultation process throughout the passage of the Bill, and he now has them. Is he not just grandstanding when we should be getting on with cracking these thorny issues and making information sharing a reality for the safety of all our children?
</p>








<p><a name="st_228"><a name="41102-19_spnew1"><b> Tim Loughton: </b> 
 The hon. Lady is absolutely right that it is essential to make information sharing a reality, but although we are told that the method in the Bill is the only way of doing that, we do not know exactly how it will work. Information sharing is a sensitive subject, as I shall illustrate with comments made by the British Medical Association and sexual health clinics. We need to get the system right or it could be entirely counter-productive. People will not present themselves if they do not want information to be shared by others, so although the principle of information sharing is right, we need a proper system. We have said all along that we do not understand how putting the names of 11.5 million children on a database&#151;we do not yet know the extent of the other details that might be included&#151;will benefit the tens of thousands of children who could realistically be described as children at risk or vulnerable children.
</p>








<p><a name="st_229"><a name="41102-19_spnew2"><b> Mr. Dawson: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman is entirely missing the point, which is surely that it is difficult to define the children who are at risk. The Government&#039;s proposal would flag up causes of concern among professionals, which would help to identify the children who are missed under existing systems&#151;they will certainly be missed under any of his proposals.
</p>








<p><a name="st_230"><a name="41102-19_spnew3"><b> Tim Loughton: </b> 
 We will come on to the definition of &quot;cause for concern&quot; in a moment because that is another worry. I still cannot understand how overloading a system with the details of 11.5 million children would help those who are most at risk. Many of the missing children to whom the hon. Gentleman rightly often refers&#151;we debated them in Committee&#151;will remain missing if such databases are in place because their parents, carers or private fosterers often want them to remain missing, but that is an entirely separate issue.

<a name="stpa_152">Several problems have emerged due to conflicts in the proposals since the publication of the consultation document. A range of listed persons or bodies will be compelled to disclose information. There will be no caveats or exceptions to that requirement, except for the medical ones that I mentioned. When the Minister was asked in Committee about professional judgment, which we support, she said that permitting it would


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_25">&quot;cause confusion because it would mean that practitioners would have to think about whether they should enter the fact that they are working with a child on to the database.

We want to provide practitioners with certainty about using the database, not uncertainty.&quot;&#151;[<i>Official Report, Standing Committee B</i>, 21 October 2004; c. 263.]</p>

</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-19_para5">
<a name="stpa_154">It is interesting to note that paragraph 2.19 of the consultation document states that a practitioner can override a professional duty of confidentiality to place a flag on the database. However, paragraphs 2.22 and 3.25 say that a practitioner may not be able to share information because of a duty of confidentiality. That raises the amusing possibility that two practitioners could flag the database and contact each other, yet be unable to discuss their reasons for doing so&#151;such is the craziness of the consultation document and the Minister&#039;s proposals.

If they do not give us the real assurances that we need, they should consider removing the clause from the Bill. They could then do the work on it that is required and bring it back as a part of a criminal justice Bill.

<a name="41102-19_para13">
<a name="stpa_162">New clause 4, which we did not get to discuss in Committee, would set up an appeals procedure. There is no appeals procedure in the Bill that relates to any of the databases. There is therefore no defence against wrong information being placed on a database&#151;wrong information that may be vexatious, which has been placed there as a result of a complaint made by a child against a teacher or a parent. Those records&#151;we do not know the extent of what may be kept&#151;may be kept for an indeterminate period and if used may count against the person mentioned. Surely, as with any other such database, there should be a mechanism by which people who want to challenge the veracity and relevance of the information stored about them can do so. There are no safeguards in the Bill, and that is a deep worry. Wrong information about people could be placed on the database either accidentally or intentionally, and their lives and records could be unjustifiably blighted as a result.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-19_para14">
<a name="stpa_163">None of that detracts from the requirement, the necessity and the desirability of placing on the database worrying information about those who might be dangerous to vulnerable people.

<a name="41102-19_para15">
<a name="stpa_164">Amendment No. 17 would limit the Secretary of State to setting up one database. We now know why the Government resisted a similar amendment in Committee, saying that it might be appropriate for other databases to be set up. We are to have databases coming out of our ears, it would appear. The Minister claimed that accepting the amendment would prevent the Secretary of State from setting up a regional or a London-wide database, for example. There is a strong case for a London-wide database because of the nature of and interaction between all the boroughs in London, and the Climbi&#233; case clearly underlined that. I have no problem with that, but the Bill as it stands could facilitate it through co-operation between authorities.

They need to operate under one standard&#151;hence the amendment suggests that we identify &quot;cause for concern&quot; and that a basis for it should be set out in national guidance. As I said in Committee, that guidance should be distributed among the professional bodies concerned, to ensure that all professionals sing from the same song sheet and operate under similar thresholds.

Extraordinarily, the Minister again did not take the point on board, although it is clearly in the interests of vulnerable children that such a provision should be in the Bill.

</p>








<p><a name="st_232"><a name="41102-20_spnew1"><b> Tim Loughton: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right, which is why I have been suggesting exactly the reverse throughout proceedings on the Bill. We are in favour of local databases that join up local professionals and which would probably come under the aegis of the director of children&#039;s services. We need greater clarification of how that information would be submitted and acted on, and at what point an intervention by social workers would be triggered. I am in favour of that for vulnerable children, such as those on the at-risk register and those who are looked after.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-20_para0">
<a name="stpa_171">For exactly the reasons mentioned by the hon. Gentleman, I am also in favour of a national database&#151;information for which would be passed from authorities that flag up children on their own databases. The most vulnerable children are usually the most mobile. A child on the radar of Newcastle social services who disappears and ends up in Brighton would need to be the subject of a central exchange of information, so that the social services director in Brighton could check on a national database for any form. The decision on whether intervention should occur should be left to the relevant authorities in the area where the child resides, with or without parents. We absolutely need a national database, but 11.5 million children do not need to be on it. We must concentrate on the most vulnerable children, to whom the most resources should be devoted. That is the great difference between us.

 I wish the Minister well with the Bill. Children need the protection afforded by this legislation. There have been too many horror stories of the system failing to co-ordinate the activities of professionals and children have been killed or abused as a consequence. However, there needs to be augmented protection of individuals from Ministers taking sweeping powers in establishing one or several information databases, which could interfere with private and family life&#151;which, after all, is protected under article 8 of the United Nations convention on human rights. Therefore, my sole intervention on proceedings on this Bill is the tabling of new clause 16, which would go a long way to addressing the concerns expressed by the Joint Committee on Human Rights. The Committee warned of the human rights problem in paragraph 109 of its 19th report, which states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_32">&quot;We remain concerned about the lack of detail contained on the face of the Bill and the breadth of the regulation-making powers being conferred on the Secretary of State in a context involving serious interferences with Article 8 rights.&quot;</p>

</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-20_para4">
<a name="stpa_175">To my mind, that answer is clearly wrong, as clause 12 contains a host of special arrangements such as the wide-ranging ministerial powers that can be used to neutralise the data protection principles.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-20_para5">
<a name="stpa_176">Let me give a background example to show why subsections (2) and (3) of new clause 16 are needed. In Scotland, the collection of dates of birth on the poll tax form was not deemed excessive because it was prescribed in regulations. In England and Wales, a tribunal ruled that it was excessive, because there was no need to collect everybody&#039;s date of birth. That did not conform with the data protection principles. That is what happened in England and Wales when the Data Protection Act applied. In Scotland, the opposite happened under ministerial regulations. Therefore, statutory prescription specifically weakened the privacy protection afforded by the Act, and I think that the same will happen under this Bill.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-20_para6">
<a name="stpa_177">In clause 12, we see statutory provisions that could weaken data protection principles. Under subsection (6)(a), the Secretary of State has the flexibility to specify personal data that could be excessive for the purpose, and that neutralises the third principle of the 1998 Act. Under subsection (6)(b) to (f), the Secretary of State has the flexibility to specify in regulations disclosures that could otherwise be incompatible with the purpose of collection, and that neutralises the second principle. Under subsection (6)(g), the Secretary of State has the flexibility to specify in regulations a long, or even infinite, period of retention of data, and that neutralises the fifth principle. Under subsection (6)(h), the Secretary of State has the flexibility to specify in regulations criteria that allow inaccurate or out-of-date personal data to be retained on the database, and that neutralises the fourth principle.

<a name="41102-20_para7">
<a name="stpa_178">Under subsection (13)(a) to (c), the Secretary of State can specify a level of security that is lower than the appropriate managerial level, and that neutralises the seventh principle.

</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-20_para8">
<a name="stpa_179">In effect, the Bill gives the Minister control over how virtually all the data protection principles apply to personal data.

<p>
<a name="41102-20_para9">
<a name="stpa_180">It will not be satisfactory for the Minister to give reassurance about consultation with the Information Commissioner.

<a name="stpa_182">Subsections (2) and (3) of new clause 16 require the Secretary of State when issuing guidance or drafting regulations to allow time for the Information Commissioner to make representations on whether the protection afforded by the data protection principles or the protection in relation to data subjects is likely to be degraded.

<a name="stpa_186">My subsection dealing with the right to object meets the Committee&#039;s need for a safeguard, by removing the Secretary of State&#039;s ability to overrule the right to object. At present, it is a judicial process that determines whether there has been substantial distress and whether that processing should cease because it is unwarranted. In contested cases, it is the courts that determine the balance between the interests of those who run the information databases and those of the individual concerned. However, in this Bill the Minister is taking untrammelled powers to determine that her view will prevail. There is no balance there, and the proper judicial process should be reinstated.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-20_para16">
<a name="stpa_187">New clause 16(5) requires any processing purpose of personal data under the Bill to be defined by regulations made under it. It basically negates an organisation processing personal data for a secondary purpose, even

<br>&nbsp;<br>where that secondary purpose is authorised by other legislation. If the data are wanted for the secondary purpose, the Secretary of State&#039;s regulations should clearly say so. This is a major improvement. It limits processing purposes only to those identified under the Bill.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-20_para17">
<a name="stpa_188">Subsection (6) amends the definition of personal data. That is necessary because the European Commission has sent the Government a 20-page infringement letter stating that the Data Protection Act 1998 is deficient and does not implement the data protection directive, 95/46/EC. Has the Minister seen that 20-page infringement letter? If so, has she taken it into account? If not, I cannot see how she can stand at the Dispatch Box talking about the protection of personal data when our UK Act is, according to the Commission, deficient in affording protection. As I said, powers are being enacted to override its already weak provisions anyway. My wide definition of personal data helps to resolve the matter and I ask hon. Members to support new clause 16 in that light.

<p><a name="st_234"><a name="41102-21_spnew0"><b> Mrs. Brooke: </b> 
 Many of the comments that the hon. Member for Leyton and Wanstead (Harry Cohen) made underline our feeling that we are being asked to sign a blank cheque. Many questions remain unanswered. Despite last week&#039;s publication of the consultation document, I still believe that we have more questions than answers. We are not trying to be obstructive but it is difficult to vote on such an important issue without more details.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-21_para0">
<a name="stpa_189">There is a problem of being out of synch when we hear on Report that some matters will not be concluded until January. I share the concerns of the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham (Tim Loughton) but I want to place it firmly on record that I do not agree with his general stance. We need local databases with objective data and I cannot believe that they should be restricted to those identified as vulnerable. I therefore distance Liberal Democrat Members from that viewpoint. If we are genuinely to move towards a preventive agenda, we must have basic, simple information on everybody.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-21_para1">
<a name="stpa_190">I repeat the anxieties that I raised in Committee. Once one moves away from objective data into the subjective realm, my concerns increase. Let us consider the term, &quot;cause for concern&quot;. I have just used the word &quot;concern&quot;; everyone else uses it. There is no definition and I am not sure that I want anyone to start defining it. If we ask different professionals from different backgrounds to flag up a cause for concern on a database that will become available for other people to see, we must worry about the use to which it might be put.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-21_para2">
<a name="stpa_191">The consultation document suggested that the intention was for a flag to be attached if one professional wanted to talk to another. I do not want to belittle that because I should like the Minister to respond to the point. I do not understand how the proposal will make it any more likely that people will communicate with each other. For example, one either looks at one&#039;s e-mails or one does not. Someone either opens the database and 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>2 Nov 2004 : Column 224</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>knows which children they need to look up to find the flag or they do not. I do not understand how it will work. It sounds simple: an indication that someone wants to talk to someone else. However, I cannot understand how it will work when there are so many children and when other systems of communication are far more direct. We all say that our professionals need to communicate directly with one another if we are genuinely to protect our children and intervene at the earliest possible stage.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-21_para3">
<a name="stpa_192">I found the consultation document easier to follow on sensitive services. The Minister had picked up the points that many organisations raised but it is important to note that the NSPCC remained concerned about the Bill. It might be fairly content about subjects for consultation but the measure permits the disclosure that someone has accessed sensitive services. I fear that that will put off young people and parents from using the services. I am not assured about that matter.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-21_para4">
<a name="stpa_193">I have tried to make it clear that I agree with some provisions and take a different approach from Conservative Front-Bench Members to others. Overall, we have more questions than answers and we must vote to express that opinion. It must be rare to have so many unanswered questions about a major Bill at this stage in the proceedings. I hope that I am making clear our support for the some provisions but despite that, we must vote to express our anxiety, which centres especially around the subjective nature of any data on the database.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-21_para5">
<a name="stpa_194">Although we support the local databases, I should have liked some suggestion of the options for passing on data when the child moves. I do not perceive the necessity for a national database per se, but mechanisms must exist. There must be different methods and we need to be able to assess them and have an opinion. The proposal will not work if it is viewed as a massive intrusion into one&#039;s life by a national database that has masses of information about everybody. However, some of the most vulnerable children are those who are moved around for various reasons and I would be distraught if I believed that we had a system that allowed the children who need protecting the most to fall through the gap.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-21_para6">
<a name="stpa_195">I am sorry that we do not have a range of options. I do not have a full grasp of how the system could work. I simply have an image of the principles that I want the Bill to retain. We cannot be confident that those principles are retained because of the lack of detail in the measure.
</p>








<p><a name="st_235"><a name="41102-21_spnew1"><b> Mr. John Gummer  (Suffolk, Coastal) (Con):</b> 
 It is obviously necessary to take every measure that we can to protect vulnerable children. Our ability to collect data more effectively and efficiently than in the past does not necessarily mean that it would be sensible to act on it. We should therefore consider the proposals carefully. I support my hon. Friends in their quest for a great deal more information from the Minister.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-21_para7">
<a name="stpa_196">The hon. Member for Leyton and Wanstead (Harry Cohen) made a powerful case. His description of the way in which the Bill runs counter to the proper protection of the individual was impressive. The trouble is that the Minister does not have a good reputation for willingness to listen or for use of data. I am therefore not

<b>2 Nov 2004 : Column 225</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>prepared to leave in her hands the decision about the information that goes on to the lists, especially when the provisions are remarkably imprecise. In many years in the House of Commons, I have never known an occasion on which the relevant professional bodies have criticised a Government Bill in such detail for lack of precision. I cannot recall circumstances in which a Minister&#039;s hon. Friend made such a devastating attack about data protection.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-21_para8">
<a name="stpa_197">I was interested that the Brook Advisory Centre, an organisation of which I largely disapprove, singled out a fascinating matter. Information that cannot be given to parents could be given to the state under the Bill. That is a new system. The centres will be asked to put on a database information that they have spent all their time&#151;in my view, wrongly&#151;trying to remove from parents. That is amazing.

<p><a name="st_237"><a name="41102-21_spnew3"><b> Mr. Gummer: </b> 
 If the Minister claims that that is not correct, why does the Brook Advisory Centre, which is close to her, appear to believe that it may be asked to do things of which it disapproves and that, in its view, would undermine its activities?
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-21_para9">
<a name="stpa_198">Apart from that, I want to discuss the phrase &quot;cause for concern&quot;. I am amazed by the causes for concern that people manage to produce. If the phrase is not defined more effectively, I fear that many people in all sorts of areas will have causes for concern that involve their own views and attitudes rather than children. The Minister must free us from our cause for concern, which is lack of precision in the keeping of data about young people, who have the right to be protected in the same way as adults&#151;we live in a world in which far too many people think it satisfactory to keep information about adults.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-21_para10">
<a name="stpa_199">Lastly, I want to underline something that my hon. Friend the Member for East Worthing and Shoreham (Tim Loughton) said on holding data about those who are vulnerable. The idea that every child should be recorded in that way is immensely illiberal. Indeed, I was very surprised to hear the Liberal spokesman, the hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole (Mrs. Brooke), once again underline the illiberality of the new Liberal party.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-21_para11">
<a name="stpa_200">It is not acceptable to keep data on people for no reason and I cannot see why children should be put on a database unless there is a reason for it. I am perfectly prepared to protect people, even for the smallest of reasons, but the idea that data must be kept on every child in order to protect the vulnerable is the reverse of the truth, because the more data kept, the more likely it is that the data that one needs will be obscured.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-21_para12">
<a name="stpa_201">The Minister has not proved her case either here or in Committee, and the House of Commons needs a better explanation than the one that she has given. The professional bodies are all as confused as the House.

<p><a name="st_239"><a name="41102-21_spnew5"><b> Mr. Gummer: </b> 
 It is no good the Minister shaking her head, because the professional bodies have said that they are confused. The Minister may think that those bodies are all stupid, which is an attitude that she often takes towards people outside this House, but the fact of

<b>2 Nov 2004 : Column 226</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>the matter is that they are confused. Unless she can remove the confusion of this House and the professional organisations, she will go down as a Minister who wants the power to do things as she thinks fit, and this House does not have confidence in her to do things as she thinks fit, because we have had too much experience of her.

<p><a name="st_240"><a name="41102-21_spnew6"><b> Margaret Hodge: </b> 
 I regret that final contribution. When the right hon. Member for Suffolk, Coastal (Mr. Gummer) comes to the House to discuss a serious matter such as this, he should read himself into it so that he can make a more informed contribution. He would do better to return to the Herbert Laming inquiry into the death of Victoria Climbi&#233; and the many other inquiries into the deaths of children.

<a name="41102-21_para13">
<a name="stpa_202">Time and time again, such inquiries find that the same features went wrong.

Our attempt to establish a system&#151;a tool&#151;that professionals can use better to protect and safeguard children and better to promote children&#039;s well-being should command respect and support from both sides of the House and should not be pushed around like a political football, as in the case of the remarks made by the right hon.

 Is it not also the case that many deaths of children at the hands of parents and care givers come out of the blue as far as public agencies are concerned? Causes for concern would not be detected under the sort of system lamely proposed by Conservative Members.
</p>








<p><a name="st_242"><a name="41102-22_spnew1"><b> Margaret Hodge: </b> 
 I agree entirely. I am conscious that hon. Members want to discuss other issues and hope that the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham (Tim Loughton) will accept that we had a full debate on that issue in Committee. I shall simply say this: the information databases that we propose are no more than tools to support professionals in working together better. If professionals work together better, they may be able to prevent some other child&#039;s death. The databases are tools to shift the emphasis in how we work from simply intervening to protect children when things go wrong to, as my hon. Friend the Member for Lancaster and Wyre (Mr. Dawson) said, trying to intervene earlier to prevent children from going wrong. They are no substitute for the many systems that we have in place.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-22_para0">
<a name="stpa_203">I want briefly to deal with some of the new issues that were raised in the debate. The first concerns the integrated children&#039;s system, which was mentioned by the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham. That is not the same as the information database, nor is it a national register&#151;it is a framework for social services, working with children in need and their families. It will be supported by the computerisation of social services records that are currently kept on paper.

<a name="41102-22_para1">
<a name="stpa_204">As the hon. Gentleman well knows from the debate in Committee, those records would not appear on the databases where we are keeping the simple, basic information that can identify children and those who 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>2 Nov 2004 : Column 227</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>work with them. The integrated children&#039;s system will not contain information about all children, only the records generated by those working with children in need and it will not be accessed by all practitioners, only those working with the children who are specified. The hon. Gentleman&#039;s point was a red herring.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-22_para2">
<a name="stpa_205">In new clause 4, the hon. Gentleman raises an issue that we did not have time to debate in Committee. I remind him, and my hon. Friend the Member for Leyton and Wanstead (Harry Cohen), that the databases will comply with the subject access provisions of the Data Protection Act 1998. That means that parents and children can exercise existing rights to see what information is held about them through a simple request to the database operator. They will be able to ask for inaccuracies to be corrected, and that must then happen.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-22_para3">
<a name="stpa_206">Moreover, there are measures in criminal law that impose penalties for the misuse of data in computer records and under the DPA. It would be a breach of the fourth data protection principle, which deals with accuracy, knowingly to supply untrue data or to fail to delete inaccurate data. That can lead to enforcement procedures by the Information Commissioner; and failure to comply with an enforcement notice issued by the commissioner is a serious offence.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-22_para4">
<a name="stpa_207">I do not want to return to the argument about a national database because the Committee in general&#151;apart from the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham&#151;supported the need for it. He knows, however, that our thinking is along the same lines as his: that we should have local databases, some on a regional level, whether it be London or Greater Manchester. They need to be inoperable&#151;
</p>








<p><a name="st_243"><a name="41102-22_spnew2"><b> Tim Loughton: </b>

</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-22_para5">
<a name="stpa_208">The Bill needs to provide for what we call the 151st system, which would ensure that all professionals know where to locate a child and that, if that child leaves one local authority area and moves to another, there is a system that holds a record of them until they re-emerge in another area.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-22_para6">
<a name="stpa_209">I come to a concern that was expressed by several Members. The Bill contains a provision to enable a practitioner to inform another practitioner who subsequently accesses a child&#039;s record that they have a current concern about the child. That means that the second practitioner can see who else they should contact as a priority to determine whether their observations are related, so that together they can build a better all-round picture of the child&#039;s needs. That represents an added dimension to the information that the databases provide by simply holding the contact details of all the practitioners involved with a child. It will prompt contact and facilitate appropriate discussion to address the problem at an earlier stage. It is not a substitute for action&#151;I said that in Committee and reiterate it today.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-22_para7">
<a name="stpa_210">One would hope that in most cases placing a cause for concern on a database, as we suggested in the consultation document, would mean that the consent of 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>2 Nov 2004 : Column 228</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>the child and the family had been sought, and that only in the most exceptional circumstances where the child is at risk of harm and abuse would that happen without such consent.   
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-22_para8">
<a name="stpa_211">I shall deal briefly with the important contribution made by my hon. Friend the Member for Leyton and Wanstead. I provided him with a written answer before the summer recess, in which I said that the databases would comply with the Data Protection Act 1998. I should also like to reassure him and all other hon. Members today. We are establishing a complex system and we need to work our way through a lot of difficult issues. Because we know that Members are concerned about these issues, we have said that we shall come back to both Houses of Parliament to seek affirmative resolutions as we go forward with the regulations and guidance. There is no hidden agenda here. There is no way in which any future Minister could misuse or abuse the powers in this part of the Bill. What we wish to do is move forward to try to establish better systems for sharing information. I hope that hon. Members will be satisfied by those added assurances.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-22_para9">
<a name="stpa_212">Hon. Members have said that many children&#039;s organisations have concerns on this issue. Yes, but even during the first consultation on the first set of regulations, I have already had letters from organisations such as Barnardo&#039;s, the National Children&#039;s Bureau, the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, and the Children&#039;s Society, all welcoming the consultation in which we are engaged and recognising that it is starting to deal with some of the concerns that they had expressed earlier. Yes, it is only a consultation document, but we will come back to both Houses and use the affirmative resolution procedure to ensure that we have the support of everyone as we move towards regulations. Not to take advantage of this opportunity to provide a tool for professionals to share information, so that they can prevent the unnecessary deaths that we have witnessed, such as that of little Victoria Climbi&#233;, would be to miss the opportunity of a lifetime. I am not prepared to do that, and I hope that all hon. Members will share my wish to move forward with this part of the Bill.

</p>








<p><a name="st_252"><a name="41102-23_spnew0"><b> Mr. Grieve: </b> 
 I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-23_para0">
<a name="stpa_213">The purpose of the new clause is to amend the Children Act 1989 to provide a subsidiary measure to that in section 1 of the Act dealing with the child&#039;s welfare being of paramount consideration, so as to make it absolutely clear that the intention&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i>
</p>








<p><a name="st_253"><a name="41102-23_spmin0"><b>Mr. Deputy Speaker  (Sir Michael Lord): </b> 
 Order. The conversations that are breaking out throughout the House are making it difficult to hear the hon. Member who is addressing us.
</p>








<p><a name="st_254"><a name="41102-23_spnew1"><b> Mr. Grieve: </b> 
 Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-23_para1">
<a name="stpa_214">The intention behind the new clause is to make it clear that, subject to the welfare of the child being the paramount consideration, it should also be the case that a presumption exists that a child should live with their parents and that, in the event of the breakdown of a family relationship, both parents should have as equal and full a possibility to provide input into their child&#039;s life. The proposal was the subject of what I regret to say was a rather ill-tempered debate in Committee. I am slightly surprised that that should be the case because I would have expected the Minister for Children, Young People and Families to support the sentiments underlying the new clause.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-23_para2">
<a name="stpa_215">The position is extraordinary. Part I of the Children Act states that, when a court makes a determination,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_38">&quot;the child&#039;s welfare shall be the court&#039;s paramount consideration&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-23_para3">
<a name="stpa_216">a matter on which I have absolutely no dispute. Sections 2 and 3 of the Act restate our common law principles, slightly amended, that it is the parents who have parental responsibility for their children. I am sure that the Minister would not disagree with that, otherwise we would have a situation akin to &quot;1984&quot; in which children can be arbitrarily removed from their parents at birth. Yet when we come to part II, dealing with the important issue of how a court approaches divorce, or indeed when 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>2 Nov 2004 : Column 233</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>we come to the parts of the Act that deal with care proceedings, the principles set out earlier in the Act are, surprisingly, not provided for at all. The issue&#151;that the child&#039;s welfare is the paramount consideration&#151;is simply left in the air.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-23_para4">
<a name="stpa_217">That is why we have proposed the new clause. I make it clear to the Minister, for the avoidance of doubt, that it does not seek in any way to undermine the principle that the court should have paramount regard to a child&#039;s welfare, but it does seek to provide a framework within which the child&#039;s welfare interests are defined.
</p>








<p><a name="st_255"><a name="41102-23_spnew2"><b> Mr. David Heath  (Somerton and Frome) (LD):</b> 
 It is a great shame that we do not have sufficient time to explore the issue properly but in stating clearly that the child&#039;s welfare is paramount&#151;the hon. Gentleman has done so without equivocation, for which I am grateful&#151;and in putting forward a proposal that one doubts will take us further than case law in terms of its effect, rather than its intention, does he agree that the most fruitful area for looking at more effective arrangements might have been the early interventions programme, which the Government have failed to implement as part of their family resolutions and which would have provided a pre-court arrangement?
</p>








<p><a name="st_256"><a name="41102-23_spnew3"><b> Mr. Grieve: </b> 
 I agree entirely with the hon. Gentleman and I share his regret at the fact that the Government have not implemented the early interventions programme. We need such a programme; indeed, it is essential. However, I also believe that until we alter the principles in the statute, we cannot start driving home the message that people must co-operate to ensure that on the break-up of a marriage, both parents have the real possibility of a full and fruitful relationship with their children, so that they can have an input into their lives.
</p>








<p><a name="st_257"><a name="41102-23_spnew4"><b> Mr. Simon Burns  (West Chelmsford) (Con):</b> 
 Does my hon. Friend accept that however welcome his comments are, the reality is that, regardless of the law&#039;s intention, the courts are biased in favour of the mother?
</p>








<p><a name="st_258"><a name="41102-23_spnew5"><b> Mr. Grieve: </b> 
 I appreciate that that may have been a problem, but there has been considerable movement on that front. What is undoubtedly true is that the resident parent currently has a stranglehold over the ability to enable contact with the non-resident parent to work, be it the mother or the father. In many cases that might not be a problem, and the parties involved might be able to co-operate. But for the 10 per cent. of cases in which the parties involved are not willing to co-operate, there is no framework, despite the judiciary&#039;s best endeavours, through which to put relentless pressure on the resident parent to co-operate properly with court orders. So although one might get a contact order, it becomes meaningless, or contact is reduced to such a tiny level that is soon fizzles out, as inevitably it must. We have to address that.
</p>








<p><a name="st_259"><a name="41102-23_spnew6"><b> Mr. Dawson: </b> 
 Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
</p>








<p><a name="st_260"><a name="41102-23_spnew7"><b> Mr. Grieve: </b> 
 I am sorry but I cannot; I want to give the Minister time to respond.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-23_para5">
<a name="stpa_218">New clause 5 goes some way towards redressing the balance, and establishes a framework that in no way undermines the other parts of the 1989 Act. Indeed, on 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>2 Nov 2004 : Column 234</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>considering how to amend that Act, I initially contemplated tackling part II, but I concluded that it did not require reform; rather, what needed amending were the general principles. I hope that the Minister will accept the new clause in that spirit, and I look forward to hearing a positive response from her.
</p>








<p><a name="st_261"><a name="41102-23_spnew8"><b> Margaret Hodge: </b> 
 I have only three minutes to deal with new clause 5, but I should point out that I am absolutely delighted that we have flushed out the position that the Opposition are attempting to take. This is an extremely difficult, high profile, contentious and controversial issue, and the Opposition have tried to jump on a bandwagon. At best, they are being disingenuous; at worst, they are being opportunistic. In my view, they have tried to exploit many fathers&#039; quite proper frustration and misery at not seeing their children by raising false hopes&#151;that is particularly true of the right hon. Member for Maidenhead (Mrs. May)&#151;and have led people to believe that they would legislate for equal parenting and 50:50 residence. We have exposed that opportunism&#151;
</p>








<p><a name="st_262"><a name="41102-23_spnew9"><b> Mr. Grieve: </b> 
 Will the right hon. Lady give way?
</p>








<p><a name="st_263"><a name="41102-23_spnew10"><b> Margaret Hodge: </b> 
 No, I will not. This is another of the ill-thought out, hastily constructed and opportunistic policies that are designed to gain support from any quarter on any issue, in order to save a dying party. What an appalling way to exploit genuine human distress and misery.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-23_para6">
<a name="stpa_219">We recognise that although the current system has the paramountcy of the interests of the child at its heart, it is not working as well as it should. That is why we have published a Green Paper, and why we are pursuing the &quot;family resolutions&quot; pilots that are up and running in three places. We know, as the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve) himself knows, that under existing case law, in 99.2 per cent. of cases that go to court, contact between children and both their parents is maintained. We agree with the Opposition that the child&#039;s best interests are served by both parents maintaining responsibility for that child where it is safe for them to do so. We want to speed up the system and to introduce more mediation and conciliation. We also want to give the courts a wider array of appropriate enforcement measures to ensure that parents comply with court orders. What we will not do is to be populist in the short term against the interests of children in these very difficult situations, and we will not exploit emotions&#151;

<p><a name="st_267"><a name="41102-24_spnew0"><b> Mrs. Theresa May  (Maidenhead) (Con):</b> 
 On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. Is it in order for a Minister to use the wholly unreasonable guillotine on this debate to launch a personal attack on another hon. Member, confident in the knowledge that that hon. Member cannot respond? The guillotine means that serious issues affecting children, parents and grandparents in this country have not been addressed. Surely it is the Minister&#039;s job to deal with the issues under debate, rather than to launch a tirade of invective against the Opposition. The serious issues involved in this Bill have not been considered, and the Minister has not put the interests of children first.

 I want to begin by repeating the warm welcome that I gave on Second Reading for the broad thrust of the Bill. In general, it is a very positive measure. With some minor amendments, it could represent a genuinely historic step forward in children&#039;s welfare.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-25_para1">
<a name="stpa_221">New clause 12 deals with the physical chastisement of children. I accept that this is a highly contentious matter for some, and that it generates strong feelings among a significant number of people. I also accept that it is not any easy matter for any Government to address, as some people will accuse them of establishing a so-called nanny state and of interfering in the private domain of the family. I am therefore very grateful to the ministerial team responsible for the Bill for their willingness to listen, over a long period of time, to the concerns and arguments of those of us who believe that children should have equal protection in law from assault.

<a name="stpa_223">I shall not dwell on the outcome of our dialogue, save to say that it is unfortunate that Labour members have been whipped to vote against a new clause that has the overwhelming support of every child protection agency in the country. For some, this is an abstract academic issue, but for many hon. Members, and myself, it is about the basic human rights of a significant proportion of our population. Our arguments are based not on policy briefings from worthy organisations but on the experience that some of us have gained from working in child protection with vulnerable and abused youngsters. Our strength of feeling comes from the certain knowledge that our laws and society could do a great deal more to ensure their well-being.

 My hon. Friend told the House that a range of child protection agencies supported his amendment. Is he aware that Lord Laming, the author of the Victoria Climbi&#233; report that led to the introduction of the Bill, does not support his amendment and, indeed, supports the Government&#039;s position?
</p>








<p><a name="st_287"><a name="41102-25_spnew3"><b> Mr. Hinchliffe: </b> 
 Lord Laming appeared before the Health Committee, and we discussed the matter. I do not know why he does not support the amendment, bearing in mind the fact that the escalation of injuries to this girl stemmed from what might be termed &quot;gentle smacking&quot;. His personal perspective differs significantly from that of his predecessor, Sir William Utting, who was a strong supporter of the arguments that I shall make.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-25_para4">
<a name="stpa_224">I am the first to agree that the vast majority of children, even most of those whose parents use physical chastisement, are probably better treated now than at any other time in history. For a minority whom the current law does not protect properly, however, the reality is very different. It is a scandal and a disgrace that in 21st century Britain, at least one child every week&#151;more than 80 children every year&#151;dies at the hands of their parents or carers. Compared with many similar countries, our record on child deaths is appalling.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-25_para5">
<a name="stpa_225">Like my colleagues who have worked in child protection, I do not just think that there is a connection between our shocking levels of child deaths and laws permitting so-called reasonable chastisement; I know that there is. I have witnessed in individual cases the progression from what is now called &quot;gentle smacking&quot; to serious injury and, in a couple of instances, death from shaking, hitting, punching and beating. I have direct experience of the inability of a child protection agency to stop a child suffering serious beating because of a court&#039;s acceptance of the reasonable chastisement defence.

<p>
<a name="41102-25_para6">
<a name="stpa_226">New clause 12 seeks to right a long-standing wrong for children. It has the modest aim of giving children equal protection from assault, but has substantial potential to reduce all forms of violence. Equal protection means what it says; hitting a child will be unlawful to exactly the same extent as hitting an adult. Some adults and, sadly, even some Government Ministers are fond of using the term &quot;smacking&quot; to make them feel more comfortable with what they are condoning or defending. Children, however, tell it as it is; smacking is hitting, and smacking hurts. It does not just cause physical pain, but hurts inside too.
</p>

<p>

<b>2 Nov 2004 : Column 241</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>us, deserve nothing less. Some members of the Government have said that they do not want parents to be criminalised for hitting their children. If they mean that they will not apply the criminal law on assault equally to assault by parents on children, we are on opposite sides of the fence. If they mean that they do not want parents to be drawn into the criminal justice system, charged and prosecuted for minor assaults on children, we are on the same side. No one in their right mind would think it constructive, apart from in very exceptional circumstances, to pursue parents into court for trivial assaults. Prosecution of parents is seldom in the interests of their dependent children, but that cannot be used as an excuse for leaving the law unclear, and sending the message that hitting children, unlike hitting adults, is acceptable.

 The hon. Gentleman will know that since the law was changed in Germany in 2000, not one parent has been criminalised. Does he agree that the issue at the heart of the Bill is summed up in the film of Roald Dahl&#039;s &quot;Matilda&quot;, in which Danny DeVito says to his daughter, &quot;I&#039;m big and you&#039;re small. I&#039;m right and you&#039;re wrong&quot;? It is not only about quality, but about defending the most vulnerable in society. It is plainly wrong that a 13-stone, 40-year-old man can hit a four-stone seven-year-old child. We just have to change the law.
</p>








<p><a name="st_291"><a name="41102-26_spnew1"><b> Mr. Hinchliffe: </b> 
 I did not see the film, but I agree with its message. The only way to clarify the law and send a clear message that hitting children is at least as wrong and unlawful as hitting anyone else is to give children equal protection by removing the existing defence of reasonable chastisement altogether.

<p><a name="st_292"><a name="41102-26_spnew2"><b> Peter Bradley  (The Wrekin) (Lab):</b> 
 Through an honest sleight of hand, my hon. Friend has elided smacking and hitting. Most responsible parents are well able to distinguish between smacking that does not cause lasting harm and hitting, which certainly would. When he listed the ways in which those 80 children met their tragic deaths, he identified shaking and other forms of assault, but did not refer to smacking. It is clear to most reasonable people that assault is a different kettle of fish from disciplining a child in a loving family environment.

<p><a name="st_293"><a name="41102-26_spnew3"><b> Mr. Hinchliffe: </b> 
 My hon. Friend gets us into the heart of the debate. I have been in court when the same point has been raised in individual cases. Is a smack in the mouth a hit? What is the difference between a smack and a hit? What is a gentle smack and what is a more serious, heavier smack? There are different smacks from different people. I weigh 16 stone. If I smacked my hon. Friend, it would be different from someone who was 10 stone smacking him. We need to consider how difficult it is for the courts to come to terms with the doubts that he raises.

<a name="stpa_229">The evidence of the Director of Public Prosecutions has been grossly misrepresented.

He stated:

<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_39">&quot;The reality is that we would have to have some sort of policy about this but I think it would be inconceivable for us to draft a policy that would be so wide as to say that minor assaults on children would never be prosecuted because there clearly could be circumstances where they would be. One might posit an example of a child who was mentally handicapped or a child who was subjected to sexual abuse or other forms of assault. So we would not and could not draft guidance which would absolve all minor acts of battery against children from criminal prosecution. That said, the reality is that, just as most minor assaults against adults are not prosecuted, I suspect most minor assaults against children would not be either, although it is not an entirely accurate analogy because children are much more vulnerable than adults.&quot;</p>

<a name="stpa_230">The DPP did not say that equal protection was unworkable. He said that Parliament should decide. Two tests have to be satisfied before any prosecution goes ahead: the evidential test and the public interest test. The public interest test invariably includes consideration of the best interests of the affected child. It is hard to understand how charging and prosecuting a parent for a minor assault that causes no injury is going to pass the tests and go ahead except in extreme circumstances. That does not render the law meaningless. On the contrary, it shows it to be sensitive.

<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_43">&quot;since 2002, the police service in England and Wales has adopted an approach of recording crime whereby if a child or a witness or a member of the public had called to allege that a parent had smacked a child, that matter would be recorded as a crime. That does not mean that prosecution would follow, there is a well established procedure under &#039;Working Together&#039; that enables the police and social services to decide on the best course of action and that would be followed. Therefore, if Parliament removes the defence I would anticipate no lasting issues which would make the situation unmanageable for the Police. The matter would be recorded as a crime and investigated by police or social services, dependent on the evidence, injury and a view on what is best for the family, as happens now&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. There may be an increase in allegations, however, given the increase in police resources over the last four years I am confident that we could cope with that. It is my view that were the change to be made over a reasonable period of time the number of allegations would fall, as given a good education programme by Government, rather like drink driving, smacking a child would become socially unacceptable&quot;.</p>

 Part of the hon. Gentleman&#039;s argument is the idea that children should be equally protected from being hit or smacked, whichever word one chooses to use. However, there is a difference between a child and a parent. A parent has a duty of care to a child and carries that out by putting it to bed, giving it food, looking after it and giving it moral guidance and help with discipline so that it may become a proper civilised adult. Smacking might be appropriate in that context. Why does he want to influence the relationship between a responsible parent and a child who may well need proper guidance?

People who oppose new clause 12 because of the risk that a parent might, in exceptional circumstances, be prosecuted for what is perceived as a minor assault should not fool themselves that they have the backing of those charged with a responsibility for child protection; clearly, they do not. The Joint Committee on Human Rights has heard evidence on the matter from the Director of Public Prosecutions and others. In its 19th report in September, it emphasised the fact that equal protection would provide more legal certainty than clause 56. No one has challenged the law of assault against adults as not providing legal certainty. No one would suggest that we should decriminalise the minor slapping of women, confused elderly people or those with learning difficulties, who, like young children, might have limited powers of reasoning. I am merely proposing to extend the existing law to cover children equally. We have already extended equal protection to children in schools, nurseries and so on. This is the last logical step in establishing equality.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-27_para1">
<a name="stpa_242">Colleagues who have looked at debates on the Bill in the House of Lords will have seen that some particularly absurd examples were cited. One Member asked whether we really wanted to criminalise the exasperated parent who smacks her child to stop him running into the road for the fourth time. Well, do we really want to decriminalise the exasperated but loving daughter who smacks her confused father who is suffering from dementia and who is also straying into the road for the fourth time? Again, we must not confuse the law, which must be clear and take sensible common-sense approaches to prosecution. All assault and battery should be unlawful. In either of the examples, can anyone seriously envisage the perpetrators being dragged off to court?

<p>
<a name="41102-27_para2">
<a name="stpa_243">If there are not to be wholesale prosecutions, some will ask what is the point of changing the law if we are not going to enforce it. Let us be clear that removal of the defence will make prosecution easier in cases where it is necessary to protect children from significant harm and doing so is in the child&#039;s best interests. At the moment, the law inhibits the child protection system at every stage. Most importantly, it inhibits those working with families in intervening early with clear and supportive messages, rather than waiting for significant injury.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-27_para3">
<a name="stpa_244">The concept of prosecution and punishment is just one purpose of the law. Prosecution in this area is a demonstration of the law and the system failing to protect the child. The higher purpose of the law and its particular purpose when dealing with the private sphere of the family is to set a standard, send a clear signal, educate, change the culture, change individual attitudes and satisfy human rights.

<a name="stpa_246">In accepting that something must change, let us consider the amendment agreed in the House of Lords, which now forms clause 56. I regard it effectively as a sticking plaster. I am sure that legalistically it addresses the fundamental issue that we are in breach of various conventions, but as the Joint Committee on Human Rights says, it is likely that there will be further incompatibilities in future. So, if anything, clause 56 would be only a temporary fix and does not tackle the main issue. If we think about it, putting a sticking plaster on something makes one feel better and more comfortable. I worry that clause 56 makes people feel a little better because they think that they are tackling the worst of abuses and that therefore things will be all right. That concerns me greatly. For that reason, I support new clause 12, but I do not do so lightly. It has taken me quite a long time to come round to that and to have the courage to speak up on it.

Any form of physical punishment sets that lead.

<a name="41102-28_para0">
<a name="stpa_255">The law, which allows reasonable chastisement of a child, fails to protect children who are physically abused. It allows their abusers a loophole at trial and prevents other cases from coming to trial. The alterations that were made in another place present an unsatisfactory compromise, allowing children to be hit but placing a physical marker on how hard they can be hit and in what way. That is dangerous because children mark in many different ways for different lengths of time, and shaking and blows to the head often do not offer the physical proof that would have to be brought as evidence to ensure a conviction. The proposal is impractical because it will place doctors and paediatricians in a difficult position in determining what constitutes minor bruising and thus whether a child is covered by the new law. That is unsatisfactory.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-28_para1">
<a name="stpa_256">However, although my hon. Friend and I believe that the current law fails to protect a child, we acknowledge the need to bring the public with us.

I stress that, if the review shows that the child abuse statistics have not dramatically improved, legislation will need to be reconsidered. That should happen only after we have had a proper time to consider the effectiveness of the proposals.

 I want clause 56 to be removed from the Bill because, like the hon. Member for Wakefield (Mr. Hinchliffe), I believe that it worsens the position. The hon. Gentleman spoke of the need for a careful, measured and consistent approach to assist those who care for children and he mentioned several agencies that supported his careful, measured and consistent approach. The group that he did not mention in that connection was those who have the greatest responsibility for bringing up children: parents. I am not fortunate enough to be a parent, but I have no doubt that the best way to bring up children is with their two natural parents. Not all of us achieve that aspiration&#151;we do not, of course, condemn those who do not achieve it&#151;but parents have a unique relationship with their children and a unique responsibility to bring them up as citizens of tomorrow, as my hon. Friend the Member for Bromsgrove (Miss Kirkbride) suggested. We know that the overwhelming majority of parents not only do their best, but do an excellent job of bringing up children. Just as we make mistakes from time to time in our personal and political lives, so, under much greater pressure than us, do parents.

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>2 Nov 2004 : Column 250</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>moved in the other place throws the law on smacking into confusion. It removes the reasonable chastisement defence in three cases&#151;wounding, grievous bodily harm and cruelty. That is entirely justifiable, but it will make no difference because a court is unlikely to accept that chastisement with such effects is reasonable. Indeed, the reasonable chastisement defence has been attempted in only 11 cases since 2001, and in only five of those was a conviction not secured. Lord Lester&#039;s amendment would retain the reasonable chastisement defence for assault and for battery, but abolish it for assault causing actual bodily harm. That is the nub of the problem, because the definition of assault causing actual bodily harm includes tenderness and bruising; and, as the hon. Member for Wakefield said, some children bruise more easily than others.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-28_para4">
<a name="stpa_259">It follows that a parent who administers a quick slap in a supermarket, perhaps to foreshorten the sort of childish tantrums to which the hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole (Mrs. Brooke) referred, will be guilty of a criminal offence if it causes actual bodily harm such as tenderness.

 I should have thought that there is an obvious difference between a child who is not yet, or is in the process of becoming, a moral being and a wife or a servant, who, one would hope, already is.

It may be argued&#151;indeed, it was put to me by members of the Isle of Wight youth council, who lobbied me vigorously and eloquently last Wednesday&#151;that no one will be charged with this offence.

 At the heart of these proposals is the fact that every week more than one child in this country dies as a result of parental physical abuse. We are not asking whether people in this country love their children more or less than those elsewhere in the world. The fact is that in Sweden, where smacking has been banned, no child has died as a result of parental physical abuse.

 I am not sure that banning smacking will lead to any more convictions of parents who abuse their children in this country. I understand that in Sweden smacking was abolished in 1979. Between 1981 and 1994 there was a fivefold increase in the number of child abuse cases and child-on-child assaults, which is interesting; but, more to the point, UNICEF states that the average number of deaths per 100,000 children over the past five years in Sweden is much greater than the United Kingdom average.

<br>&nbsp;<br>punishment by an adult to a child, who is smaller, weaker and vulnerable, is not acceptable. Hitting a child is humiliating for the child and for the adult involved.

<p>
<a name="41102-30_para6">
<a name="stpa_279">I have looked into research that has been conducted in Wales by Save the Children about how children feel about being smacked. That research clearly shows that children do not view smacks as trivial and that the effects of a smack are deeply felt. They associate smacking with angry parents. Some of the older children said that they felt that the adults felt regret after they smacked a child. Children said that smacking usually takes place in the house and in other areas where no one can see. They felt that adults were ashamed of smacking their children.

That is one of his main findings in the reports that have been published and the discussions that he has had with children since he became the commissioner. They feel that the main reason that they do not have such respect is that adults are allowed to hit them. As Peter Clarke said in his letter to the Prime Minister yesterday, urging him to support new clause 12:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_50">&quot;As long as the smallest and most vulnerable members of society have less protection from assault than adults, the Government&#039;s position is at odds with the title of the Green Paper &#039;Every Child Matters&#039;.&quot;</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-31_para0">
<a name="stpa_283">Child protection agencies say that smacking is often a result of loss of control by the adult. Children in Wales has concrete evidence of injuries to very young children where parents have felt justified in their actions because the defence of reasonable chastisement exists. By not removing that defence completely, we will feed into that justification.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-31_para1">
<a name="stpa_284">I am also very concerned about clause 56, which should be removed. It allows parents to justify common assault as reasonable punishment; the message is, as the &quot;Children are Unbeatable!&quot; briefing tells us, &quot;Carry on smacking.&quot;Many people have expressed concern about parents being criminalised, but as has been pointed out, the new clause is not about that; rather, it is about giving parents support and help with positive parenting. If it were accepted, it would be accompanied by a great deal of help, education and support; it cannot be introduced by itself overnight. There would be a change in climate and we would do all that we could to help and support parents. The message would be clear and the Government would be giving a clear lead on what is acceptable.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-31_para2">
<a name="stpa_285">At the heart of all this is the question, &quot;What is in the child&#039;s best interest?&quot; and taking a parent to court will almost always not be in their best interest. The hon. Member for Ceredigion (Mr. Thomas) said that in Germany, where smacking was outlawed in 2000, it appears that no parents have been prosecuted since then. Early research suggests that there has already been a major shift in public opinion away from physical punishment. My hon. Friend the Member for Bridgend (Mr. Griffiths) drew our attention to Sweden, where public opinion has changed. A Government have to lead, and the evidence from other countries shows that on this issue, public opinion has followed.

 I shall be very brief. Following on from the comments of the hon.

There is simply no basis for the connection that has been made. People who are wicked enough to want to kill or sexually abuse a defenceless child are, in my opinion, beyond the realms of the law. No modest measure to say that all parents should not smack their children will influence their behaviour in any way. The case has not been made.

What are the staff supposed to do&#151;bring in the police, corral the parents or what? What will happen if a child is upset about being smacked in the home and calls the police? They often do not turn up for a burglary, so are they to turn up because a child has protested about being smacked by their parent? It makes a nonsense of the law and I implore hon.

If she commits actual bodily harm, the maximum penalty is five years in prison, but what is currently common assault has a maximum of six months in jail, and that is, in some cases, now to become actual bodily harm.

<p>
<a name="41102-32_para10">
<a name="stpa_308">It will be extremely easy to make false allegations about parents under the Government&#039;s proposals. It will be easy to make a serious criminal allegation against the parent whose child slips and bruises himself by accident. Many loving parents already fear being unjustly accused by neighbours or social workers, and the new proposals will add to their concerns. Parents may even be afraid to present their children at a doctor&#039;s surgery if they have marks in case they are accused of child abuse.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-32_para11">
<a name="stpa_309">The fourth and final test is whether the change would undermine family and children relationships. Will it promote undue intrusion by the state? Surely it will. It will mean undue intrusion by the state into the lives of decent, caring families who are trying to bring up their children as best they can, often in difficult circumstances. It is a legitimate concern that the changes proposed in the law would give rise to an unprecedented level of unnecessary and potentially damaging state intrusion where children are looked after well and are at no risk of abuse.

<p>
<a name="41102-32_para12">
<a name="stpa_310">One wonders where it will all end. There are many things that parents do to and for their children that it would be quite inappropriate, if not illegal, to do to another adult. Why pick just on smacking? Perhaps soon it will become illegal for parents to send a child to his room&#151;imposing incarceration on another human individual.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-32_para13">
<a name="stpa_311">If the proposals fail to pass those four tests&#151;I believe that they have so failed&#151;the burden of proof that falls on the prosecution should be removed. The law should remain as it stands and we should return to the status

<br>&nbsp;<br>quo. Those are the options before the House this evening. I know that Opposition Members will exercise their free vote in an intelligent manner and in the best interests of the welfare of children.
</p>








<p><a name="st_367"><a name="41102-32_spnew4"><b> Margaret Hodge: </b> 
 I recognise the passionate feelings and views held by Members on both sides of the House and I appreciate that new clause 12 is an attempt to be constructive. However, the Government cannot support what amounts to an absolute ban on smacking.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-32_para14">
<a name="stpa_312">The Government&#039;s position remains unchanged: it is vital that we protect children from violence and abuse. The House will know that one of the driving forces behind the creation of my post and the development of this Bill is our determination to strengthen the way that society safeguards and protects its children. That is why we took seriously the representations from the children&#039;s charities and others to the effect that the defence of reasonable chastisement was being misused by parents who were harming their children. It is also why we supported a free vote in the House of Lords on Lord Lester&#039;s amendment, which would have removed the defence of reasonable chastisement for acts of actual bodily harm, grievous bodily harm or cruelty. It is for that reason that Labour Members will be offered a free vote on the matter tonight.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-32_para15">
<a name="stpa_313">I recognise that that does not go far enough for some hon. Members, who believe that the level of harm required by the offence is too great a threshold. However, actual bodily harm has been defined by the courts as any hurt or injury calculated to interfere with health or comfort. That seems to me to offer quite broad protection. Clause 56 provides additional protection for children and tightens the existing law. Some of the cases in which there was a misuse of the reasonable chastisement defence would no longer be able to use that as a legal defence.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-32_para16">
<a name="stpa_314">It is nonsense and wrong to suggest that clause 56 would create a new loophole, or that it would legitimise acts of harm and abuse. It tightens the law but it does not change the standard of evidence needed to prove actual bodily harm or anything else, as my hon. Friend the Member for Wakefield (Mr. Hinchliffe) suggested.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-32_para17">
<a name="stpa_315">Clause 56 provides additional protection for children but it does not criminalise parents for administering a light smack to their children. The Government are tightening up on a defence that was misused, but we are not creating a new offence, as to do so would be wrong. Actual bodily harm, grievous bodily harm and cruelty do not require that serious injury must be suffered. As the Attorney-General told the House of Lords, actual bodily harm is not confined to physical harm but can include psychological harm, for example.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-32_para18">
<a name="stpa_316">The Director of Public Prosecutions is reviewing charging standards and the Government are toughening the law. At present, when a decision is being made about whether to pursue charges, no regard is given to children&#039;s physical strength and vulnerability. That is what the DPP is considering, and changes that have regard to those matters should be welcomed.

<p>
<a name="41102-33_para0">
<a name="stpa_317">The Joint Committee on Human Rights has been critical of Government on this matter, but it recognised the positive impact of clause 56 when it said in its report that


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_55">&quot;the combination of the new clause and the new charging standard may well be considered sufficient to satisfy the UK&#039;s obligation to comply with the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights in A <i>v.</i> UK, because it makes the defence unavailable in relation to treatment or punishment which is contrary to article 3.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-33_para1">
<a name="stpa_318">It would be very odd, to say the least, if anyone who wanted to encourage parents to seek alternative forms of discipline voted to remove this clause.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-33_para2">
<a name="stpa_319">I turn now to new clause 12, which the Government cannot support. All hon. Members believe that it is vital to strengthen the safeguarding and protection of children, but it would be wrong to create a new offence by imposing a ban on smacking. That would leave parents wondering whether a trivial smack could land them in prison. We cannot deal with the misuse of a defence by creating a new, inappropriate and ill-conceived offence. There is a world of difference between a light smack and violence or abuse. We should recognise that the vast majority of parents understand that difference and would never harm their children deliberately. Some people argue that minor smacks will not be prosecuted, but the new clause would make smacking a crime, so there is no guarantee that that will be the case. It is for Parliament to be clear and to make the law. We cannot expect the Crown Prosecution Service to pick and choose which crimes it does, or does not, prosecute in the light of a clear statement by Parliament that all smacking should be a criminal offence. The confusing gap between the effect of the new clause and the claims made by its proponents, as well as the fact that the Government simply do not believe that every single instance of parental smacking should be treated as a criminal offence, have led to our decision not to offer a free vote. No one decides lightly to smack a child, and most people feel bad and guilt-ridden about doing so. They believe that they have failed if they resort to smacking, but do hon. Members really believe that we can support good parenting by adding to those bad feelings by threatening the strong arm of the law? Is not a better way of changing the culture positively to encourage and support good parenting in the home? That is what our Sure Start programme aims to do, as do the children&#039;s fund, through many projects that it supports, and the parenting fund. We want to offer more support to good parents.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-33_para3">
<a name="stpa_320">I turn to the amendment tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Crosby (Mrs. Curtis-Thomas), which was supported by my hon. Friend the Member for Ogmore (Huw Irranca-Davies). I recognise the reasoning of my hon. Friend the Member for Crosby in calling for a review of the effects of clause 56 once it has been in operation for two years. I agree wholeheartedly that when significant extra legal protection is introduced by the clause we should look closely at its practical effects. I am afraid, however, that her amendment does not meet its intended objective. None the less, I can give a clear commitment that two years after clause 56 comes into effect we will review the practical consequences of those

</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-33_para4">
<a name="stpa_321">This important debate has rightly engendered much passion in all parts of the House. I understand and respect the sincerity and strength of the views of all hon. Members, but I urge them to consider that while we want to stop the misuse of a defence that could lead to children being harmed or abused&#151;I believe that clause 56 achieves that aim&#151;we do not want to be responsible for introducing a new offence that could criminalise thousands of parents throughout the country who are trying their hardest to do their best for their children. They love and cherish their children, and want to establish a framework of discipline while protecting them from harm and endeavouring to support their well-being. They try their hardest to get it right.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-33_para5">
<a name="stpa_322">A total ban on smacking could criminalise most parents. That is surely not what we are about. Let us focus on the important job of safeguarding and protecting children who are in real danger of harm and abuse. Let us support parents in that most difficult and important job of bringing up their children. Let us legislate in a clear and practical way, which will properly benefit children and young people. I urge hon. Members to accept clause 56 and reject new clause 12.

<p><a name="st_403"><a name="41102-35_spnew0"><b> Margaret Hodge: </b> 
 I beg to move, That the Bill be now read the Third time.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-35_para0">
<a name="stpa_324">We are approaching the end of the Bill&#039;s passage through the House. It is a significant moment. I am pleased to reflect on a process in which there has been a great deal of constructive engagement from hon. Members of all parties who have brought their wide experience, intellect and attention to detail to our deliberations and the Bill has benefited greatly from that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-35_para1">
<a name="stpa_325">When the measure was introduced in the House of Lords in March, it was widely and warmly welcomed in and outside Parliament. Many people have waited a long time for the measure. The Bill has acted as a vehicle for important discussion of an exceptionally wide range of issues that are important to children&#039;s lives and the outcomes that they achieve. Throughout, there has been a wide consensus about the value and importance of the reforms that we are making. Baroness Howarth of Breckland came up with the catch phrase:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_56">&quot;It is a small Bill with a large heart&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report, House of Lords</i>, 30 March 2004; Vol. 659, c. 1287.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-35_para2">
<a name="stpa_326">It is slightly larger now and, thanks to this House and the other place, its heart beats even more strongly.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-35_para3">
<a name="stpa_327">The Government&#039;s plans for the commissioner have been well tested during the parliamentary process, and I pay tribute to the parliamentarians and lobbyists who have campaigned for the creation of a commissioner for such a long time. The Government are confident that the Bill, enhanced by the amendments that the House has agreed today, is the best way forward. We will have a strong champion for children with a powerful, independent and manageable role, which will allow them to be an important voice on children&#039;s behalf. We intend the commissioner to be appointed early next year, and I am pleased to say that we are involving children and young people in the appointment process. My ministerial colleagues and I look forward to working with the commissioner.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-35_para4">
<a name="stpa_328">Part 2 of the Bill contains a range of duties and powers for local agencies, which will establish clear lines of accountability for children&#039;s services and lead to better arrangements for safeguarding children and planning, commissioning and delivering services. I was pleased that the Standing Committee agreed a Government amendment to introduce the children and young people&#039;s planning requirement, which is an important rationalisation of the planning burdens on local authorities and which will be another lever to encourage more effective outcomes in planning, commissioning and delivering services.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-35_para5">
<a name="stpa_329">The Bill allows us to set up universal information databases, which have attracted considerable attention. I repeat that those databases will in no way be a substitute for action, and I hope that they will provide a valuable tool to help practitioners work together better so that they can more easily identify children and meet their needs.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-35_para6">
<a name="stpa_330">In response to parliamentary scrutiny, we have made some helpful amendments. The Bill now contains clear descriptions of the information that will be on the database and the agencies that may access it. Crucially, 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>2 Nov 2004 : Column 274</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>it includes the reassurance that the databases will not include details of case information.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-35_para7">
<a name="stpa_331">Last week, we published our first consultation document on the difficult issues around the cause for concern and sensitive services. In developing the regulations and guidance, it will be important to respond to the issues raised by the consultation, to continue to learn from the work of the trailblazers and to take into account the issues and concerns that have been raised legitimately during the passage of the Bill. I am grateful to all hon. Members who have taken pains to ensure that we are aware of the importance of getting the Bill right and of the many things that we must avoid getting wrong.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-35_para8">
<a name="stpa_332">We have spent a lot of time today debating aspects of the latter parts of the Bill, and hon. Members know that some significant improvements have been made. Today, we have introduced a power to establish a minimum fostering allowance, which is an important step that has been welcomed on both sides of the House. We have amended the Children Act 1989 to ensure that children&#039;s feelings, as well as their wishes, are taken into account when assessing their needs in a range of circumstances.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-35_para9">
<a name="stpa_333">We have responded to hon. Members&#039; concerns by enabling changes to be made to the rules of court, which will help us to represent our constituents without getting into contempt of court, and I am grateful for the work that has been done by my right hon. and learned Friend the Solicitor-General.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-35_para10">
<a name="stpa_334">The passage of the Bill marks the beginning of the important programme of change for children to which the Government are committed. As I have said many times, the Bill provides a legislative framework, rather than all the answers, to improve outcomes for children.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-35_para11">
<a name="stpa_335">Our purpose is to maximise opportunity and minimise risk; to enhance opportunity for every child; to work to close the gap between those who succeed and those who achieve less well; to make sure that every child matters; and to support our resolve to do all we can to prevent children such as Victoria Climbi&#233; from falling through the net and dying at the hands of adults in whose care they have been entrusted.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-35_para12">
<a name="stpa_336">But it is what happens at the local level, on the ground, that will make a real difference to the lives of children, young people and their families. What will count is our work over the coming months and years with all those who provide services for children at the front line, from strategic agencies to individual practitioners. Our task is to build on the framework created by the Bill to reconfigure our services so that we shift our efforts to prevention while strengthening the safeguarding and protection of children; change services and organise them around the needs of the child, not of the professionals; and ensure that the voice of children and young people lies at the heart of all that we do.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-35_para13">
<a name="stpa_337">This is a great Bill that will help us to create a step change for children. I commend it to the House.

<p><a name="st_404"><a name="41102-36_spnew0"><b> Tim Loughton: </b> 
 We are pleased to support the Bill that we are about to pass on Third Reading. That has been the case throughout, although we have had vigorous debates and remain concerned about some of the details.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>2 Nov 2004 : Column 275</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-36_para0">
<a name="stpa_338">We support the Bill in order to support vulnerable children and to promote the life chances of looked-after children, too many of whom are left behind. I hope that we can do that in a way that does not intrude too much into the private family lives of those many children who are fortunate enough not to be described as vulnerable. I also hope that we have added safeguards to the Bill in relation to the independence from Government of certain of the new systems that are being set up and ensuring a more joined-up approach by the professionals that is at the heart of what we need to achieve.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-36_para1">
<a name="stpa_339">The Minister said that this is a great Bill. That may be slightly over-egging it, but it is a very important Bill. As Lord Laming said, it was wholly unacceptable that there had been some 40 predecessors to his report on Victoria Climbi&#233; in as many years. We were failing too many children, and the message from Lord Laming was that things must be different. All hon. Members who have participated in the passage of the Bill would subscribe to that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-36_para2">
<a name="stpa_340">The Committee could be described as the testimonial of the hon. Member for Lancaster and Wyre (Mr. Dawson). He contributed to it with his usual well-informed demeanour and, when responding to me, cantankerousness. We respect and admire that, and we will miss him greatly when children&#039;s legislation comes before the House in future. I thank hon. Members on both sides of the Committee, particularly my hon. Friends, for their well-informed contributions.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-36_para3">
<a name="stpa_341">Debate in Committee was sometimes fiery, particularly when the Minister talked about parental access. We saw that again today&#151;fireworks from the Minister three days before Guy Fawkes night. However, the subject will not lie down. It is not a bandwagon on to which the Opposition have opportunistically climbed, but a very serious issue that is blighting the lives of too many decent parents around the country, and it deserves to be treated with rather more respect and seriousness than the Minister has shown in Committee and in this Chamber. Her comments may well come back to haunt her and will not be appreciated by many thousands of fathers and mothers who feel that they are being shut out of their children&#039;s lives.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-36_para4">
<a name="stpa_342">I congratulate the Government on some of the later additions on foster allowances and look forward to the emergence of details on how that can become a practical reality. We sensed that the door was opening a tiny bit further in regard to a private fostering registration scheme, but we shall have to wait patiently for that. We particularly welcome the amendments that the Government accepted today on the wishes and feelings of children.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-36_para5">
<a name="stpa_343">The Standing Committee was the first on which I had ever served in which I had my amendments hijacked. Quite a few that were accepted by the Government started off as Conservative amendments; mysteriously, the name of the Minister&#151;or, today, the Secretary of State&#151;then appeared on them. We are delighted that the Government have seen fit to support Conservative amendments, but it is slightly odd that they had to try to hijack them in that way.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>2 Nov 2004 : Column 276</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-36_para6">
<a name="stpa_344">There are certain outstanding problems in the Bill; we make no issue about that. The independence of the children&#039;s commissioner still needs to be proven, and the &quot;big ears, no teeth&quot; tag will still concern their lordships when the Bill returns to the upper House. The relationships between the English children&#039;s commissioner and those in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland will also present various problems that we shall have to review. One of my biggest concerns relates to the operation of the database. That provision still needs an awful lot more work and thinking out, because it represents a radical change to the way in which we account for our citizens, and many people will be concerned about its implications.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-36_para7">
<a name="stpa_345">The structures that we have put in place in the Bill, the new people with titles, the tsars and the committees all sound very fine, but they will be as nothing unless there are well-trained professionals on the ground&#151;social workers, teachers, school nurses, police officers and everyone else&#151;who are properly informed, know what to look out for and work practically with each other to share that information safely in the interests of vulnerable children. The real test will not be what the Bill says but whether the people out there on the ground, whose job is to put it into action every day of the week, every week of the year, are able to do that; if, indeed, they are there to do it at all, because we still suffer from an enormous shortage of those dedicated people.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-36_para8">
<a name="stpa_346">I was very pleased with our debate on promoting the educational achievement of looked-after children, which has been a scandal for far too long. We all agreed that it was a scandal, and that urgent action was required to address it. I hope that some of the practical measures in the Bill will begin to do so.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-36_para9">
<a name="stpa_347">It is absolutely right that the Government should involve children as much as possible in making the provisions work. That is what the Bill is all about, and why we have all signed up to it. If it works, I hope that it will serve to re-engender some faith in the system among those children who have been left behind or left vulnerable for too long.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-36_para10">
<a name="stpa_348">It is now four and a half years since the tragic, horrendous and unimaginable death of Victoria Climbi&#233;, but we should not forget that an average of 80 children suffer similarly at the hands of parents or carers each year without hitting the headlines. We need to reduce that figure, and we hope that the Bill will go some way towards achieving that. Lord Laming&#039;s report said that we needed to take urgent action now, and that his recommendations could not be


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_57">&quot;deferred to some bright tomorrow.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-36_para11">
<a name="stpa_349">That was absolutely right, and I hope that the Bill will represent an important step towards ensuring that this problem is addressed now. If it works, it will be a fitting tribute not only to Victoria Climbi&#233; but to all the other victims of horrendous abuse, whose abusers should never have been allowed to get away with what they did. We hope that they will not be allowed to do so in the future.

<br>&nbsp;<br>against the Government on the Bill, I have still been really nasty to the Opposition.

<a name="stpa_350">Despite my recent voting record, this is a good Bill, which presages a tremendous future for children in this country. I hope that it leads to a future of child-centred services, integrated services, co-operative services and, as the hon.

<a name="stpa_351">In all of our discussions, we have all been guilty of tending to think of children as a great object of concern, while ignoring their dynamic and creative potential.

The Bill has been amended one way or the other, but I believe that it provides a huge opportunity for children and young people to take the commissioner and children&#039;s services wherever they will. We now have one person and, I presume, an office, who will be responsive to the agenda not of the Government or Parliament, but of children and young people. That will take children and young people&#151;and eventually this whole country&#151;in directions that perhaps we do not fully understand, as I believe that children and young people know things that we do not know, that they can engage with their peers in ways that we cannot, that they are the future of this country and that the experience of having a children&#039;s commissioner will allow them to lead and eventually take over the running of this country in directions at which we can only hint.

<a name="stpa_353">Throughout consideration on this Bill, we have made much of the fact that we all need to listen to children. We cannot remind ourselves of that too often. Listening to children imposes on us the responsibility of not letting them down. Undoubtedly, we, collectively, have let many children down over the years. A core part of the Bill involving adults relates to the quality and quantity of staff and the training that is needed. Most importantly, if we are to learn the lessons of the past, we must achieve real multi-agency working and common practices, so that people are not compartmentalising and going home because they have done their bit, resulting in somebody being left out of the equation.

We still have a lot to do, and it would have been good to reflect concern for those most vulnerable children in the Bill.

Often we start to engage such parents only in tragic circumstances, and sometimes they are forced to become involved through parenting orders. Research relating to such orders is positive, but we want parents to become engaged voluntarily rather than in a punitive context. Let us hope that the children&#039;s commissioner will concern himself not just with children but with the people with whom they spend most of their time&#151;the people who shape their lives. Those people are, of course, their parents.

Although CAFCASS has had its difficulties in recent times, we all hope that, under the new leadership, it will be able to achieve the aspirations that many had when it was set up. The people who work for CAFCASS in Wales welcome the challenge of adapting it and ensuring that it is appropriate to the needs of children and families in Wales. Hugh Patrick, a constituent of mine with a long history of involvement in children&#039;s welfare issues, who is now a union representative for people working for CAFCASS, has assured me that staff are ready, willing and wanting to take up that challenge.

He has been instrumental in many cases, working with the commissioner in Wales, looking at his recommendations and taking them to other Ministers and Government Departments here.

<p><a name="st_417"><a name="41102-38_spnew0"><b> Mr. Peter Viggers  (Gosport):</b> 
 May I thank Mr. Speaker, through you, Madam Deputy Speaker, for allowing me the opportunity to raise this evening on the Floor of the House the issue of health care on the Gosport peninsula? The subject has been forced to the centre of our concerns in Gosport because of the Ministry of Defence&#039;s decision in December 1998 to close the Royal hospital Haslar, which is the only military hospital left in the United Kingdom. The local population greeted this decision with dismay and I proposed a rally and a march to the hospital&#151;it involved 22,000 people&#151;to express their view that the hospital should be retained.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-38_para0">
<a name="stpa_369">The cause of the problem is that the MOD is seeking to disengage from hospital management, which is in stark contrast with the approach of Governments in other countries, who are building up&#151;or at least maintaining&#151;their defence medical services. Faced with a tremendous shortfall in key faculties in general surgery, anaesthetics, orthopaedic surgery and general medicine, the Government have taken the most peculiar decision to close the one remaining military hospital, at Haslar, and to develop a centre of military excellence elsewhere.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-38_para1">
<a name="stpa_370">I maintain that in this area, more than any other, what we need is joined-up Government and the maintenance of links between the MOD and the national health service, but I am afraid that this Government have resolutely refused to provide that. In fact, although the Under-Secretary of State for Defence kindly invited me to his office, the purpose of the invitation was to tell me in clear terms that the MOD is absolutely determined to withdraw from Haslar not later than 31 March 2007. So, it is clear that the Government are determined to press ahead.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-38_para2">
<a name="stpa_371">However, there is no doubt that Haslar hospital will be needed after March 2007, because the proposed development of Queen Alexandra hospital, Cosham, which is the subject of a private finance initiative bid, will not be completed by that date. Secondly, military medicine is still strong at Haslar and has much to offer in the context of the new hospital arrangements in south Hampshire, even after the development of Queen Alexandra hospital. Haslar still has 33 Field hospital. It has advanced telemedicine, a clinical measurement department, echocardiograms, cardiac systems and neurophysiological systems; such provision is not available at the proposed new location in Birmingham. If satisfactory arrangements can be made for the conjunction and joint use of Haslar with Queen Alexandra hospital, defence medicine would have a lot to gain and a lot to offer.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-38_para3">
<a name="stpa_372">Military medicine is currently in a very sad state and there is a shortage in every specialty. The proposal was to move from Haslar to a new centre of defence medicine. At one point, the idea was jointly to involve Guy&#039;s and St. Thomas&#039; hospitals in London. Then, the John Radcliffe hospital in Oxford was considered; indeed, Newcastle was also considered. Eventually, Birmingham was chosen and the decision was taken 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>2 Nov 2004 : Column 283</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>to spend &#163;200 million on a new centre of defence medicine at Selly Oak hospital. Doing so would also allow military personnel to use the very good facilities at Birmingham university. Unfortunately, the Government ran out of money. The &#163;200 million development was cancelled and, among other things, the admiral in charge of the project resigned from the Navy, rather than put through a project that he thought unworkable. Currently, armed forces personnel are left billeted out in twos and threes in small groups all around Birmingham. Some live in a YWCA hospital, some in a former hostel for the homeless. There is no real centre for defence medicine. The plans have collapsed, and so has the ethos of defence medical services.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-38_para4">
<a name="stpa_373">The Ministry of Defence defiantly says that recruitment is satisfactory, but retention of trained doctors is at an abysmal level to the extent that the shortage of trained medical staff is a factor in troop deployment. We have to rely on other nations, particularly the Americans who, unlike us, give medical back-up a priority. If hospital and secondary care can be sorted out in Portsmouth and the Gosport peninsula, defence medicine could have a future in the south Hampshire area even now.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-38_para5">
<a name="stpa_374">The civilian aspects, which are the main subject of my Adjournment debate this evening, are dominated by the construction of the new Queen Alexandra hospital at Corsham and the MOD&#039;s intention to close the Haslar hospital. The local population has consistently showed over the past six years complete determination in wanting Haslar to continue as a hospital providing local services. As a result of that determination, a consultation was undertaken by the Portsmouth and South East Hampshire health authority, which resulted in changes being announced in January 2000.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-38_para6">
<a name="stpa_375">The announcement was as follows:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_61">&quot;The new Haslar Accident Treatment Centre will replace the RH Haslar accident and emergency department. This will treat&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. an estimated 17,500 per year&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It will open 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and will be staffed by emergency nurse practitioners.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-38_para7">
<a name="stpa_376">It continued:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_62">&quot;Day surgery will be provided on the Haslar site for many patients in good general health&#151;an estimated 1,100 cases a year. The day surgery will include general surgery, orthopaedics, gynaecology and urology. Diagnostic services, including x-ray facilities, and investigations will be provided at Haslar. Outpatient clinics on the Gosport peninsula will be increased so that around 5,000 more patients a year than at present will be seen at either Haslar or Gosport War Memorial Hospital. It is expected that there will be more than 100 clinics a week in over 20 specialties.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-38_para8">
<a name="stpa_377">That is an outline of the proposals advanced by the health authority in 2000. The Haslar taskforce, which I formed and have chaired from the beginning, reluctantly went along with those proposals, believing that it was the best that could reasonably be expected. We were somewhat reluctant to lose in-patients but felt that Haslar could at least survive as a major hospital and perhaps even expand in due course.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-38_para9">
<a name="stpa_378">We formerly had a primary care trust both for Gosport and for Fareham, then a Fareham and Gosport PCT, and now a Fareham and Gosport PCT that shares its executive with an another PCT&#151;not a happy scene. That PCT has now put forward two revised proposals, 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>2 Nov 2004 : Column 284</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>both of which involve having a community hospital at Fareham. The main difference between the two is that the first proposal has one key idea&#151;the retention of the Haslar cross-link to provide various facilities, including an accident treatment centre, out-patients, physiotherapy and occupational therapy. The alternative proposal would have similar facilities, but provided at the Gosport War Memorial hospital. It would expand the Gosport health centre to provide an accident treatment centre, out-patients, minor surgery and more diagnostics. Both alternatives include the Fareham community hospital, but only one would retain Haslar with the other developing the Gosport War Memorial hospital.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-38_para10">
<a name="stpa_379">Haslar is a major hospital. It is a former district general hospital equivalent and it deals with out-patients, has an accident treatment centre, a breast unit, 5,000 gastroenterology cases a year, a first-class X-ray department, including an magnetic resonance imaging scanner and ultra-sound. Its diagnostic and treatment centre is very successful, having succeeded in reducing waiting lists for operations in the area. It is a busy and successful hospital. Support for Haslar in the community has not wavered. People respect its superb facilities and its staff and they admire the way that nurses march at Haslar. It is a military hospital and it retains the ethos and spirit of the area, which has very much a military flavour in south Hampshire. Haslar is an outstandingly good hospital and people want it to be retained.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-38_para11">
<a name="stpa_380">Gosport War Memorial hospital, on the other hand, is a former cottage hospital. When it was a cottage hospital, it was proposed that it should close, and we all campaigned to keep it open. While we did that&#151;this shows how fashions change in medicine&#151;it suddenly became fashionable to have a community hospital, so it was expanded to become one, and it is also much loved. However, it is a small hospital on a site that is already quite congested. Car parking is really quite difficult and it would not take further expansion.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-38_para12">
<a name="stpa_381">The one thing that is not mentioned in the latest consultation document by the primary care trust&#151;in the shorter version, certainly&#151;is money. What I most fear is that the comparison between the two proposals will not be dealt with like for like, but handled entirely on the matter of money. The primary care trust, on advice, has concluded that for the Haslar alternative, economic assessment capital over 30 years would cost &#163;93.038 million, risk adjusted, net present value&#151;that is the way these things are assessed. The War Memorial hospital option would cost &#163;75.318 million on the same basis. In capital terms, it is maintained that Haslar would cost &#163;13 million, which would need to be paid to the Ministry of Defence, and &#163;14.9 million in capital cost. The War Memorial hospital would cost &#163;3.594 million, plus &#163;2.6 million for replacing the health centre, where there might be some capital offset through a lift project. There would also be some &#163;23.6 million for the community hospital at Fareham under both plans.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-38_para13">
<a name="stpa_382">Where do we go from here? Hampshire county council&#039;s scrutiny committee, which is charged by statute to look at local plans, will meet on 26 November, and I look forward to being there to discuss the issue. The Fareham and Gosport primary care trust plans to make its final decision on 15 December.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>2 Nov 2004 : Column 285</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-38_para14">
<a name="stpa_383">I do not believe that those making the judgments are comparing like with like. Gosport War Memorial was a cottage hospital; it has been expanded and is a busy site, and it will not take further expansion. Car parking is a problem. Haslar is a large, airy, superb location. It is a former district general hospital. There is room for change and expansion. Excellent equipment is in place and it has the suites of operating facilities that will be needed. Portsmouth and South East Hampshire hospitals trust concluded in 2000, and again in 2002, that Haslar would be needed. We simply cannot believe that it will be possible to manage in future with fewer operating theatres and fewer beds. There is an absolute and widespread conviction that Haslar is needed, and my plea from Gosport is that consultation should be genuine. Our wish is to retain Haslar hospital, and I ask the Minister to support that proposal.

As part of that, we want services to be accessible, flexible and designed around the needs of local patients. The policy of devolution gives local communities an opportunity to plan and develop health services according to their needs and demands and we have backed that up with significant funding.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-39_para1">
<a name="stpa_385">Overall, there will be an average year-on-year increase in England of 7 per cent., over and above inflation. There will be an increase of &#163;34 million in total budgets between 2003&#150;04 and 2007&#150;08, and more than 75 per cent. of that will go directly to PCTs. That means that we are putting resources in the hands of people in the front line of the NHS, alongside their responsibilities for developing and running services.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-39_para2">
<a name="stpa_386">Fareham and Gosport PCT, in the constituency of the hon. Member for Gosport, will receive an increase in revenue allocation of &#163;41 million between 2003&#150;04 and 2005&#150;06. That represents a cash increase of 30 per cent. However, to achieve our goal of modernising the NHS, many NHS economies and organisations are considering, with their local stakeholders, changes to the way in which they organise their services. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will agree that hospital services need to change if we are to continue to fulfil patients&#039; needs and improve access. Services cannot remain static forever, but must be responsive to local needs.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-39_para3">
<a name="stpa_387">In Fareham and Gosport, work is already under way to plan health services fit for the future. Central to these plans is the major private finance initiative to which the hon. Gentleman referred. That scheme will mean a 

<br>&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>redevelopment of hospital services in Portsmouth, focusing on the current Queen Alexandra hospital site in Cosham. Once the new hospital is completed, all acute in-patient services will move there. It will be the main acute site for the whole of south-east Hampshire.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-39_para4">
<a name="stpa_388">The rebuilding of the Queen Alexandra hospital and the reorganisation of its services mean that the local NHS has a unique opportunity to look afresh at what it does, and from where. As the hon. Gentleman noted, in October last year, the local PCT commenced a project to review the health needs of the local population and develop a strategy to provide services to meet those needs over the next five years and beyond. That work included a needs assessment, site feasibility studies, analysis of patient activity data and a bed census.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-39_para5">
<a name="stpa_389">In March, as a result of that work, three broad options were offered for further consideration. They were discussed at various informal meetings, eight of which were held in the hon. Gentleman&#039;s constituency. In addition, five staff briefings were held.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-39_para6">
<a name="stpa_390">The PCT is now undertaking a comprehensive and thorough consultation process that gives local people an opportunity to make their views known and to shape local health services. All that is in line with the Government&#039;s policy and principles, outlined in the document, &quot;Keeping the NHS Local&quot;.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-39_para7">
<a name="stpa_391">As the hon. Gentleman knows, two main proposals are being consulted on. He has gone through them already, so I shall not outline them again. However, the dispersed model provides new buildings for services when and where they need replacing, while the community hospitals model develops community hospitals as the hub of health services, in both Fareham and Gosport. Common to both models is the building of a new Fareham community hospital, and of new premises for an existing GP practice.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-39_para8">
<a name="stpa_392">The hon. Gentleman raised concerns about the future of the Royal Hospital Haslar. I am aware that it has been a subject of discussion locally for many years. As he knows, the Ministry of Defence will vacate the hospital in 2007. The former Portsmouth and South East health authority gave a commitment in 2000, following public consultation, to develop a substantial facility at Haslar, subject to MOD agreement to the use of the site. The new hospital will offer day surgery, diagnostic and out-patient facilities, operative clinics and accident treatment.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-39_para9">
<a name="stpa_393">That commitment was subsequently reiterated in a letter sent to the hon. Gentleman in January last year by my hon. Friend the Member for Salford (Hazel Blears), who is now Minister for Crime Reduction, Policing and Community Safety but who at the time was a Minister in the Department of Health. The local NHS has therefore been in discussions with the MOD about the potential use of part of the site for the provision of those services. The MOD identified two potential locations on the site of the Royal Hospital Haslar on which to develop a range of services&#151;the crosslink block and the undeveloped area on the periphery of the site. As the hon. Gentleman will be aware, the latter option was excluded after public feedback this summer. The use of the crosslink block remains under public consultation, but the proposal brings with it, as he outlined, a substantial capital cost accruing from the purchase of 

<br>&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>the site and the necessary adaptations. The NHS has a duty to use public money wisely, and must therefore consider other options. The future of the Royal Hospital Haslar cannot be looked at in isolation, and the NHS has a responsibility to look at a range of options to ensure that primary and secondary services meet the needs of local patients and fit with wider plans for modernisation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-39_para10">
<a name="stpa_394">The precise configuration of services is under consultation, and we are in discussions on the matter. All the services currently provided by the Royal Hospital Haslar, including therapies, diagnostics and out-patient services, will still be provided locally, but the location of those services has yet to be decided. The NHS in Hampshire and the Isle of Wight remains committed to the pattern of services for the population of Gosport and Fareham agreed after the 2000 consultation, but their precise nature is under debate. It would be inappropriate to speculate about the outcome of the present consultation, which does not end formally until 8 November next week. Locally, the NHS has been in discussions with the MOD about the use of the site and I have already outlined the two options and their consequences. The arrangements for those discussions, as well as discussions with other partners, are the responsibility of a local partnership board, which will make sure that the quality and continuity of health services for the people of Gosport, Fareham and the south-east Hampshire area are not affected in the event of a delay, as the hon. Gentleman mentioned, in completing the redevelopment of the Queen Alexandra hospital in Cosham. The MOD has given assurances that sufficient time will be allowed for the Hampshire and Isle of Wight strategic health authority, the Portsmouth Hospitals NHS Trust and the Fareham and Gosport primary care trust to decide future 

<br>&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>requirements for the Haslar site and ensure that patients continue to receive the highest possible standard of health care over that period.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-39_para11">
<a name="stpa_395">The hon. Gentleman spoke extensively about the role of the MOD, but he will understand that I can only comment from the perspective of the Department of Health. I was pleased to hear that he has had discussions with my colleagues in the MOD, even though I detected a note of frustration&#151;the future of health services on the Gosport peninsula is obviously an issue of great concern to him. As I have mentioned, it is our policy that the local NHS should decide the priorities for the NHS locally, including decisions on the location of services. That is where specific local knowledge and expertise lies, and it is not appropriate for Ministers to decide on the direction of travel and how services should be configured, as we have made clear.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-39_para12">
<a name="stpa_396">There is a discussion to be had about the relative merits of the different options with regard to the cost to the local economy. Money deployed on a more expensive option would mean less for other services. Local people need to have that discussion with the local health service. That process is going on, and the meeting on 15 December, to which the hon. Gentleman referred, is part of that. We have made it clear that it is best for that local knowledge and those local decisions to come into play through local decision making.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41102-39_para13">
<a name="stpa_397">The health community in Fareham and Gosport has set out its proposals for change to a number of the key health services to improve the quality and the range of services for local people. That is an opportunity for local people to influence the debate by responding to the consultation. I hope that the hon. Gentleman continues to work with the local NHS to build a better future for residents in his area and that he urges local people to respond to the consultation so that they have a say in the provision of local health services.
