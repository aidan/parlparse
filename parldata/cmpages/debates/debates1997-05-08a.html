<P>

<a name="70508-01_para0"><i>The House being met at half-past Two o'clock, and</i> Madam Speaker-Elect <i>having taken the Chair;</i>
<P>

<a name="70508-01_para1"><i>Message to attend the Lords Commissioners;</i>
<P>

<a name="70508-01_para2"><i>The House went; and, having returned--</i>



<a name="70508-01_head0"><H3><center>Election of Speaker</center></H3>



<P>
<P>
<a name="70508-01_spnew0"><B> Madam Speaker: </B> 
 I have to report to the House that, in the House of Peers, Her Majesty, by Her Royal Commissioners, has been pleased to approve the choice made of myself for the Office of Speaker, and that I have, in your name and on your behalf, made claim by humble petition to Her Majesty to all your ancient and undoubted rights and privileges, particularly to freedom of speech in debate, freedom from arrest and freedom of access to Her Majesty whenever occasion may require, and that the most favourable construction may be placed upon all your proceedings. All these Her Majesty, by Her Commissioners, has been pleased to confirm in as ample a manner as they have ever been granted or confirmed by herself or by any of Her Royal Predecessors.
<P>

<a name="70508-01_para3">My first duty to the House is to report my respectful acknowledgments and my grateful thanks for the great honour you have conferred upon me in placing me in the Chair.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70508-01_spnew1"><B> Madam Speaker: </B> 
 I must now call upon the Members of the House, according to the usual custom, to take the Oath of Allegiance at the Table of the House, but first I must do so myself.
<P>

<a name="70508-01_para4"><i>Thereupon</i> MADAM SPEAKER <i>first, alone, standing upon the upper step of the Chair, took and subscribed the Oath</i>.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70508-01_spnew2"><B> Madam Speaker: </B> 
 Before Members proceed to the taking of the Oath, I regret to have to report to the House the death of Sir Michael Shersby, Member for Uxbridge. I am sure that hon. Members on both sides of the House will join me in mourning the loss of a colleague and extending sympathy to the hon. Member's family and his friends.
<P>

<a name="70508-01_para5">It may be for the convenience of the House if I indicate my intentions with regard to the taking of the Oath by right hon and hon. Members. I propose to call, first, the Father of the House; then the Cabinet; then the shadow Cabinet; then all the Privy Councillors not included in those two groups, wherever they may be sitting, and then other Ministers. Thereafter I shall call other hon. Members according to seniority determined by the basis of seniority, that is by the Parliament of first entry or, for those with broken service, that of most recent entry.
<P>

<a name="70508-01_para6">The first batch will be those elected in or before 1974. Thereafter I shall proceed by successive Parliaments. I hope by late this afternoon to have made sufficient progress to enable all Members to swear in who wish to do so up to and including those elected to the 1992 Parliament. The House will sit again tomorrow at 9.30, when I shall call those Members first elected to the current Parliament as well as Members elected to earlier Parliaments who were not able to take the Oath today.
<P>

<a name="70508-01_para7">Finally, the House will meet again next Tuesday at 2.30 to enable Members to take the Oath who have not done so this week.
<P>

<a name="70508-01_para8">I hope that this announcement will be helpful to Members in planning their programmes. Progress will depend, of course, on the number of Members wishing to take the Oath at any particular time. I advise Members to watch the annunciators to establish progress and to speak to their Whips. I hope also that Members will come forward in an orderly manner. Let us now begin.
<P>
