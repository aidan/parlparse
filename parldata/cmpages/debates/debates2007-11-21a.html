 I thank the Secretary of State for that reply, but he knows full well that whatever increase there has been in overall employment levels in Wales in the past two to three years has resulted from the enormous increase in migrant labour coming into Wales. Given that his Neath constituency has more than 6,000 people on incapacity benefit and more than 1,000 young people not in education, employment or training, when will he shake off this complacency and start taking seriously the problem of worklessness in Wales?</p>

 What is interesting about that question, which I am delighted that the hon. Gentleman has asked, is that incapacity benefit levels tripled in Wales under the Conservative Government. I remember that in my constituency, and in those of hon. and right hon. Friends, people were just pushed out of mining and heavy industry&#151;not into jobs, because they did not exist, but on to incapacity benefit, there to stay. Economic inactivity rates are now falling faster in Wales than anywhere else in the United Kingdom because of the interventionist measures that the Government have taken to give people hope and jobs for the future.</p>

 I completely agree with my right hon. Friend. Indeed, the Opposition&#146;s policies would take Wales back to the miserable economic situation of the 1980s and 1990s, when unemployment went through the roof, people were put on to incapacity benefit and the economy suffered as a result. He might have been thinking about other Opposition barriers, so I should mention the vice-president of Plaid Cymru. When she proposed last week rejecting the St. Athan defence academy training establishment, the Plaid Cymru annual conference merely noted her proposition.

 I thank the Minister for that reply, and I am sure that he will agree that one of the best ways to tackle the twin challenges facing the Welsh economy today&#151;economic inactivity and low skills levels&#151;is to support the excellent work being done across Wales by many organisations. In my constituency, they include the Shaw Trust in Llandarcy, Remploy in Baglan and, in particular, the New Sandfields Aberavon development trust, whose Strides project, in partnership with Sandfields comprehensive school, has done so much to assist the skills levels of young people.</p>

 I agree entirely, and my hon. Friend is right to point out that a genuinely partnership approach is being adopted. That is why employment in Wales is at historically high levels, with 1.334 million people now in work. As a result of this Government&#146;s policies, Wales is attracting record levels of investment, and that has led to consistent growth in employment levels. In partnership with all sorts of organisations, Wales is becoming truly world class.</p>

 Gross value added is now recognised as a key economic indicator. If the UK average is taken to be 100, Wales stands at 78 while west Wales and the valleys languish at 65, despite seven years of objective 1 funding and expenditure of &#163;1 billion. The main reason for that is the absence of involvement by the private sector. What conversations will the Minister have with the Welsh Assembly to ensure that the private sector gets more involved with convergence funding to make it more successful than the abortive objective 1 funding?</p>

 By way of answer, let me say that incapacity benefit claims have fallen by 9 per cent. in west Wales and the valleys, and the figure for Wales as a whole is even higher. The strategies to turn the existing problem around are firmly embedded, but I agree entirely that the private sector must get involved. It is noticeable that private sector output in Wales has risen for 45 successive months, from March 2003 to October 2007, but it is true that we must also get the private sector involved with convergence funding.</p>

 One of the most significant developments in the next few years will be the St. Athan defence training academy, on which we hope that building will start in the next two years. We have already won the first package, so will the Minister do everything in his power to make sure that the Ministry of Defence understands the benefits of bringing the second package to Wales as well? That is supported by everyone on the Labour side of the House, but will he make sure it is supported by everyone on the other side as well?</p>

 My hon. Friend makes a very important point. The success of the academy depends very much on strong and coherent cross-party support and leadership. The massive investment in the new St. Athan defence training academy, worth billions of pounds, shows that the Government have given Wales a huge vote of confidence and is a sign of the country&#146;s bright economic future. Thousands of jobs will be created when construction of the academy is complete, and they will come on top of the 1,500 jobs created  <br>

 I do not accept anything that the hon. Gentleman has said. As I explained patiently to the hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham (Mrs. Gillan), the Conservative spokesman for Wales, the truth is that the measures for which the Welsh Assembly Government are asking Westminster to grant will enable them, for example, to impose a toll like the one that has been successfully operated on the M6 from Birmingham towards Manchester, in order to fund the M4 relief road. The hon. Gentleman might know&#151;he might not, of course&#151;that there is severe traffic congestion in the Brynglas tunnel and elsewhere on the M4 on the stretch from the Severn bridge to Cardiff.

I do not think that there is any point in calling a premature referendum, which would produce a repeat of 1979, rather than the success, albeit narrow, that we achieved in 1997.

Revenue and Customs claimed it was a one-off incident in a single office. That is what I call systemic failure&#151;when procedures are not followed over and over again. HMRC was the Prime Minister&#146;s department. He insisted that it paid child benefit, and he increased its scope.

 I have to say that on a day when the Government have lost the details of 25 million people, to try and blame the Opposition is pathetic. What people want from their Prime Minister on a day like this is for him to stand up, show some broad shoulders, be the big man and take some responsibility. This morning his Chancellor, to give him credit, had the guts to admit that his confidence had been shaken. The Prime Minister was in charge of the Department for 10 years. By definition, that must have been when the systemic failure developed, so has his confidence been shaken?</p>

 I said right at the beginning that I apologise for what has happened. Everybody who is a recipient of child benefit should know that we will follow every proper procedure now to improve the working of HMRC and of every Government Department and agency. I have announced not only the inquiry into HMRC, but that the Cabinet Secretary will look at every Government Department and every agency. I have also announced, which is important, that we will look at the collection of private and public data. That is what the Walport review will look into. The idea that we are complacent about the matter is ridiculous. We are taking all the action that is necessary. The right hon. Gentleman raised the question of HMRC and its resources and staff.

Some of us imagined that after the events of the past 24 hours he might well have enjoyed a rapid promotion back to the Treasury, where he would sit at the right hand of the Gord. We will probably have to wait a few weeks before that miraculous assumption happens.</p>

I refer, of course, to the need to heal the breach in the Labour party on education and bring the Secretary of State back into line and on to the side of real reform. One of the most worrying aspects of the Secretary of State&#146;s tenure is a crab-like inching away from the proper reform programme, which began under Tony Blair. In recent weeks, that process has taken on the aspect of a full-scale invertebrate retreat.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o15"><a name="71121-0004.htm_para2"><a name="07112160000176">It was all so different only two years ago. In those days, the Government had a reputation for competence, and the Secretary of State was only a Back Bencher. The two may or may not be related. Only two years ago, the country was led by a Prime Minister who, whatever his defects, knew where he wanted to take the country. Now, we are led by a Prime Minister who, because of his defects, dare not even go to the country. Only two years ago, there was an emerging consensus on the need for the Government to promote a public sector reform vision, driven by greater pluralism, diversity and choice. Now, there is a growing consensus that the Government do not have a vision and that they are paralysed by cronyism, incompetence and weakness.</p>

the chance to deploy his intellectual gifts, which are still there, and the powers of his office in the service of reform, which will make opportunity more equal and help the disadvantaged most. My challenge to him is to be a moderniser.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o19"><a name="71121-0004.htm_para6"><a name="07112160000188">Two years ago, there was a modernising consensus in the House of Commons. It drove the Education and Inspections Bill through and put it on the statute book, thanks to Conservative Members&#146; votes. The current Secretary of State was deeply unhappy with that at the time, as he told the <i> New Statesman. </i>However, that consensus was built on a powerful set of insights. Improvements in education had to be driven by not only a relentless focus on standards but a proper reform of structures.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o20"><a name="71121-0004.htm_para7"><a name="07112160000189">In 2005, when the Blair Government published their education White Paper, the then Prime Minister and the then Secretary of State argued for greater pluralism and diversity in schools. They anticipated the development of fully independent schools in the state system. They hoped that local education authorities would play a progressively smaller role. They hoped that all new state schools would be created outside local authority embrace, and cited Florida and Sweden as exemplars. They looked at those states that had enacted thoroughgoing supply side reform with greater parental choice as their models. Schools outside local authority control, such as academies, would act as a goad and a spur to improvement. They would utilise their freedoms to pioneer new ways of doing things. They would also provide parents with a new choice: to take children out of failing schools and place them in more successful ones.</p>

 I am grateful to the hon.

If he were to come to Chapel-en-le-Frith in my constituency, he would see a new high school and a new infant school, both of which have been built to replace schools that the previous Tory Government did not replace, even though they were completely derelict.

 I will tell the hon. Gentleman what is completely irresponsible and reckless: making an intervention without studying the facts. I am afraid that he is completely wrong in his idea that we would abandon the building schools for the future programme. He must insist that the Government Whips Office supplies him with better questions. I like the hon. Gentleman and I enjoy his interventions, but quality needs to rise.

In Hackney, the presence of new academies, such as Mossbourne community academy, which my right hon. Friend the Member for Witney (Mr. Cameron) and I were privileged to visit yesterday, has driven up standards, not just for those who attend them, but for all schools. In Sweden, where a more thoroughgoing process of opening up the supply side has taken place, there is a direct correlation between the number of new independent schools in the state sector in a municipality and improvement in standards overall.</p>

There are several reasons why we fear that he does not. The first is the Secretary of State&#146;s complete failure so far to make the case that choice, competition and contestability drive up standards. Professor Julian Le Grand, the then Prime Minister&#146;s senior policy adviser between 2003 and 2005, has written thousands of eloquent words making the case for choice. The preface to the 2005 education White Paper made the case. The co-ordinator of the 2005 general election victory, the right hon. Member for Darlington (Mr. Milburn), has made the case. He said:</p>

 I do not like to disagree with my hon. Friend on the Front Bench, but I wonder whether he is being too kind in saying that the Secretary of State lacks the bottle for reform.

His first act as Secretary of State was to limit the freedom of academies. Under him, academies were stripped of the right to shape their own curriculum and compelled to follow the national curriculum. They were also told that they would have to fall in line with local authority control. Rather than acting as a competitive force outside town hall control and levering up standards, they were to fall under the sway of bureaucrats.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o27"><a name="71121-0004.htm_para14"><a name="07112160000209">We have already seen how Labour local authorities have succeeded in thwarting new academies in areas where educational provision is weak and the system desperately needs new providers. In Tower Hamlets, where Goldman Sachs wanted to set up an academy, the local authority said, &#147;No, we don&#146;t need no competition&#148;, even though the standards there are so poor that almost half the secondary schools fail to get 30 per cent. of their pupils to the level of five good GCSE passes, including in maths and English.</p>

These local authorities are emboldened by the Secretary of State&#146;s words to resist new entrants and competition.

Mossbourne wants to expand: it has been so successful that it needs to establish a sixth form and build an extension.

I am afraid, however, that my Soviet history was awry. I now realise that he was actually more like one of those grey men from the Kremlin who led the plot against Gorbachev. He launched an abortive coup against a halfway sincere reformist only to end up making himself and his cronies look foolish, and leaving the country desperate for real change at the top.</p>

 My hon. Friend characteristically makes two good points. We are clear that we should get rid of the surplus places rule and that new entrants to the state education system will provide a goad and a spur to existing local authority schools to improve. Whether in Essex or, as we have seen, in Hackney, new schools entering the system force the existing local authority schools to raise their game and improve their act. That is a virtuous competitive circle, which we would like to be extended, in line with the best Conservative principles, across the country.</p>

 I am most grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving way: it shows uncharacteristic politeness. Let me explain the situation: schools can be started up in areas with surplus places, but there is a built-in motivation for the local authority to close underperforming schools in exchange, so that there is a net relationship between the two that conforms to the surplus places rule. What is important is that we motivate local authorities to close underperforming schools, unlike the Conservative party&#146;s proposals.</p>

Our point is that we want those new entrants that the Government have not allowed to come into the state sector to drive up standards all round.

 Does my hon. Friend agree that the people involved in a school are much more important even than its buildings, and that some of the best schools have old or tatty buildings? Is not the failure of this Government&#146;s strategy that they have no way of changing the leadership in underperforming schools and they have allowed too many such schools to exist for too long?</p>

 My right hon. Friend makes an important point: among the most important qualities in schools are leadership, motivation and personnel. One of the great virtues of academies is that their leaders&#151;such as Sir Michael Wilshaw at Mossbourne&#151;have the freedom to pay more than the national minimum and to reward good staff with bonuses. They also have the opportunity to recruit and retain the best, and, if necessary, to deal with any weaker teachers. I am sorry to have to say that some of the teaching unions oppose that degree of freedom, but we believe that it is concomitant with the greater freedom in the academy system and that it is necessary to drive up standards, which is our aim.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o44"><a name="71121-0005.htm_para14"><a name="07112160000269">Unfortunately, there has been a pattern under this Government: instead of change and dynamism, there has been timidity, retreat, paralysis and bureaucracy. We would remove barriers to the creation of new schools.</p>

 Not yet. We would ensure that money followed the pupil and, crucially, that pupils from the most disadvantaged homes got more money for their schooling&#151;a progressive policy that I think the Liberal Democrats share, but the Government reject. We would demand high standards, ensuring that every child who can do so is reading after their first two years in primary school, because having learnt to read, they can read to learn. We would restore discipline to our schools, shifting the balance of power in the classroom back in favour of the teacher.</p>

 Let me turn to academies and the exact issue that the right hon. Gentleman raises. At last, we are dealing with a school reform that is mentioned in the motion.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o57"><a name="71121-0006.htm_para12"><a name="07112160000407">Academies are central to our reforms to promote excellence for all and not just the few. The ability to replace a weak or seriously underperforming school with a new school that has new leadership and a new ethos is a crucial part of local strategies to tackle failing schools. So far, the evidence from our first 83 academies&#151;evidence we are testing further with the Prime Minister&#146;s delivery unit across the whole programme&#151;is that academies are delivering faster than average improvements in results in areas and, crucially, with intakes that are disproportionately disadvantaged.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o58"><a name="71121-0006.htm_para13"><a name="07112160000408">In the motion and in his speech, the hon. Member for Surrey Heath says that we are retreating on academies. I know that he wishes we were, but in fact we are accelerating our programme and removing barriers so that, for example, more universities will find it easier to sponsor academies. Our target was 200 academies by 2010, on the road to 400, but last week my hon. Friend the Minister for Schools and Learners announced that we are now planning for 230 academies by 2010.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o59"><a name="71121-0006.htm_para14"><a name="07112160000409">So far, 12 universities have expressed interest in the programme and I can make two announcements today. Three further universities&#151;King&#146;s college, London, Bolton and Gloucestershire&#151;are announcing today that they will engage with the academies programme. Secondly, I have today given the go-ahead for three new academies: the Nottingham university Samworth academy and academies in Croydon and Cheltenham. They will all replace underperforming schools. The hon. Gentleman&#146;s charge that we are backsliding on academies is wrong.</p>

<p><a name="st_o198"><a name="07112160000410"><a name="71121-0006.htm_spnew18"><a name="07112160001691"><b>Mr. Laws:</b>
 Given the Secretary of State&#146;s warm words about academies, why has he still not explained his reason for asking the No. 10 delivery unit to look into the policy, which suggests he has some concerns about it? Furthermore, he has still not answered the question about whether Lord Adonis was present at the seminar on 1 November.</p>

<p><a name="st_o199"><a name="07112160000411"><a name="71121-0006.htm_spnew19"><a name="07112160001692"><b>Ed Balls:</b>
 The answer is exactly the same as the one I gave last week when the hon. Gentleman asked me exactly the same question. When there are large spending programmes it is perfectly normal for the Treasury, the PMD unit and Departments to look at the detail of individual elements to make sure that they work as well as we want in delivering value for money. We are doing that with the academies programme, just as we would with any other programme, and I make no apology whatever for that. Of course, I have had discussions with Lord Adonis and the delivery unit to make sure that the programme continues to deliver what we want&#151;it is doing so. The idea that I should apologise for ensuring that there is proper scrutiny and we get value for money is completely absurd.</p>

 I listened carefully to the Secretary of State&#146;s reply to the hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Laws), but is not the truth that the decision to hold a review is political? It is more about compromising the future of academies, including the largest one in England, Thomas Deacon academy in my constituency, while capitulating to the bovine instincts of Labour Back Benchers and the teaching unions.</p>

 It is always lovely to hear from the Secretary of State that saying things over and over again does not make them true. It is a lesson I hope he will take to heart. However, the key point is that there is one thing he has not said at all&#151;never mind over and over again&#151;which is that academies, as new providers, give choice, competition and contestability. That is what drives up standards, so will he take the opportunity we have given him today to affirm that that is the case and that he agrees with what the right hon.

 I fear that the hon. Gentleman cannot have been listening to my speech.

<p><a name="stpa_o63"><a name="71121-0007.htm_para0"><a name="07112160000427">In respect of science, the only way that state schools are bound is through the national curriculum, so on Channel 4 news at lunchtime when the hon.

Does he include academies in the requirement to teach the national curriculum on science? Yes or no?</p>

 In these debates, we should try to get to the substance and have some discussion of policy&#151;<i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i><i> </i>The point is that I have made it a requirement that academies follow maths, science and IT, because I believe it is the right thing for them to do. To deal in part with the creationism point, I am making it clear that academies will follow the science curriculum. That is what the hon. Gentleman said on Channel 4 news yesterday, yet when I ask him whether he agrees with what he said yesterday, he cannot answer. If he was not referring to the national curriculum, what does he mean? He says that the national curriculum would bind all schools&#151;<i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i><i> </i>I will read the quotation again. The hon. Gentleman said:</p>

He cannot be referring to the independent schools guidance, because it includes nothing at all on the content of science. He must have been referring to the national curriculum, but that contradicts what he said in the morning. I keep asking the question, but as with almost everything else, he cannot give me an answer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o65"><a name="71121-0007.htm_para2"><a name="07112160000431">Yesterday, we found out what the hon. Gentleman&#146;s real plan is. He proposes to create 220,000 additional secondary school places in what he calls &#147;new&#148; academies. He tries to claim that those new academies are different because they can be set up by parents, but where parents want to set up schools we have already supported them in doing so. The first parent-promoted school was opened in Lambeth in September, with our support. What is different about the hon. Gentleman&#146;s proposal&#151;as was made clear in his speech&#151;is that the commissioning role of local government will be abolished. So yes, there is a difference of view between us and him on that issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o66"><a name="71121-0007.htm_para3"><a name="07112160000432">The Government believe there is a vital role for local government in driving change in local areas and turning round or replacing weak or underperforming schools.

That legislation gives local government a duty to raise standards in all schools and act as commissioner for education in their area, to be held to account for the performance of schools in their area and to use all the levers at their disposal, including trusts and academies, to tackle poor performance.</p>

tackle weak and underperforming schools. So far, 79 local authorities are working with us on academies, and more are coming forward week by week&#151;but in his view, those are 79 local authorities that are holding back the programme. Nine local authorities are going further still: they are not just working with us but have agreed to co-sponsor academies&#151;or in the hon. Gentleman&#146;s view, they are really strangling the programme.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o68"><a name="71121-0007.htm_para5"><a name="07112160000434">I shall read the hon. Gentleman the list of culprits: Manchester city council, Labour; Sunderland city council, Labour; the Corporation of London, Independent; Cheshire county council, Conservative; Coventry city council, Conservative; Kensington and Chelsea, Conservative; Kent, Conservative; Telford and Wrekin, Conservative; and West Sussex, Conservative. Has he told those Conservative councils that they are strangling the academies programme? Has he told them their support will no longer be required if the Tories are in power? Has he told them that rather than taking the lead in tackling weak or failing schools, they will have to wait for parents and livery companies in their area to come along and do the work for them? That is where we disagree.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o69"><a name="71121-0007.htm_para6"><a name="07112160000435">I want parents to set up schools if they want to do so. I want parents to be able to choose, and I want diversity in the schools system. However, I also want a role for local government, and for it to be accountable for delivering change and tackling underperformance. I want it to do so quickly, rather than waiting while a school&#146;s rolls fall year by year, damaging the education of children. That is the dividing line between us: I think that local government should deliver and should be held to account on that delivery, while the hon. Member for Surrey Heath wants to walk away from that. He would allow the market to decide and have vouchers, rather than allowing local government to intervene.</p>

That could cut against the entire purpose of the academies programme.</p>

 I am sorry that there was not a Liberal Democrat council in the list of councils that sponsor an academy. <i> [Interruption.] </i>Maybe one will come along. The fact is that we have moved away from requiring local government to run all the schools. Local government now commissions schools and is responsible for key services. Local authorities are also responsible for the education of all children in their area, and accountable for intervening to tackle weak or underperforming schools. That is our policy&#151;and the policy of the hon. Member for Surrey Heath would completely undermine it. He is proposing a policy that promotes excellence for a few and not excellence for all. In answer to the question asked by the hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Laws), I believe that for a local authority to sponsor an academy in a particularly difficult or failing school is exactly the right thing to do, and I wish that he would support me on that.</p>

 I have already taken many interventions. Let me turn to the point at which things will get particularly interesting for Opposition Members. The hon. Member for Surrey Heath has come forward with a proposal to create 220,000 new school places. To be fair to him, he has told us how he will pay for it. Yesterday he said in black and white in his policy document that the Conservatives would pay for it with a &#163;4.5 billion cut from our building schools for the future programme, which will rebuild or refurbish every secondary school in England over the next 10 years. However, the Conservatives said that they would honour existing commitments under BSF. The impact of the new academies would therefore apply to those waves where commitments have not yet been made, which would be concentrated on the 76 local authority areas in BSF wave 7 onwards that are not yet engaged in BSF.</p>

 Let me give hon. Members the details, and then I shall take interventions. The policy would involve taking &#163;4.5 billion out of BSF from 2008-09 onwards. That is a 15 per cent. cut in all future rebuilding projects. <i> [Interruption.]</i> If I set out the facts for hon. Members, they can then reflect on them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o70"><a name="71121-0007.htm_para7"><a name="07112160000444">More than one in seven secondary schools that hope to undertake rebuilding projects would find that those projects will not go ahead under the Conservative proposals. Two thirds of all secondary schools currently in those 76 authorities are hoping to have schools rebuilt. At the moment, all those new schools are under threat. The 76 local affected authorities would lose an average of &#163;60 million each. The largest local authorities will lose more. That is the equivalent in each local authority area of an average of three complete secondary school rebuilds, which would not go ahead under the Conservative proposals.</p>

 It is easy to explain. The Conservative proposals would take money away from schools that need it to build surplus places in areas that do not need it.

All those councils see academies as vital to improving education in their areas. That is why I am right.</p>

For many years&#151;since long before 1997&#151;they have been failed successively by their local schools. Even with the improvements in GCSE results over recent years, 50 per cent. of youngsters in something like a third of all secondary schools do not achieve five A* to C GCSEs even across the whole range of subjects, leaving aside maths and English.</p>

 In a moment. The challenge that has to be met has to do with that minority of schools that have high levels of deprivation and have underperformed for years. Earlier today, I visited one such school in west London that will be familiar to Front Benchers on both sides of the House. Only a decade or so ago, 95 per cent. of pupils at the Phoenix school were leaving without having achieved five good GCSE qualifications. Disorder was rife, and the school had many poor-quality supply teachers. They were teaching so badly that a great many were eventually sent home, with the result that multiple classes were taught in the school hall. Even so, that represented an improvement in the quality of teaching.</p>

He went right back to saying that standards, rather than structures, were the focus, and when he said that, he knew very well that the Prime Minister&#146;s predecessor had said that he believed that structural reform was vital to getting standards right.

Why does <i> The Times Educational Supplement</i><i> </i>say this week that the unit will look at five specific academies, including Knight&#146;s academy in London? If there is a shortlist of those that will be looked at, can we know about it?</p>

Ultimately, it seems nonsense that hundreds of schools in the maintained sector could have accountability that will bypass local authorities altogether and that there will be no strategic control. However, the Secretary of State appears to be trying to make it easier for some bodies to involve themselves in the academies programme. To the extent that that is bringing new structural reform and new people into the education system who are aspirational, particularly about schools that have large numbers of deprived pupils, that is very welcome, but we want to be sure that that does not actually involve a reverse takeover of the academies programme, so that the Secretary of State can say that he has got 400, 500 or 600 academies, when their power to innovate and to do things that they cannot do in the maintained sector is compromised.</p>

 The Secretary of State should hear the questions first. He has got some new local authority co-sponsors of academies. He mentioned seven of them in Manchester. Can he confirm in those cases where co-sponsorship occurs who exactly will choose the school leader? How many governors will they have? Who will determine whether there will be variations in the length of the school day, in aspects of the curriculum and in hiring teachers? Will that end up, by default, going back to local authority control? In that case, the involvement of local authorities would be precisely the opposite of what would make sense.</p>

some aspects of the Conservative policy that was laid out yesterday. I have sympathy with quite a lot of the Conservative motion, but I also have quite a large number of reservations, which caused us to table our amendment and prevent me from supporting the motion.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o91"><a name="71121-0008.htm_para12"><a name="07112160000508">I have already raised the first issue: who has strategic control? If either the Government or the Conservative party is remotely serious about all their warm words about localisation and devolving power, I hope that they will recognise and agree with the fact that it would be nonsense to maintain the academies programme when it includes 200, 300, 400 or 500 academies, run by one Minister from an office in Whitehall. Surely, when local authorities accept, as many of them now have, that they will be much more purchasers, rather than solely providers, of maintained school education, they should have a strategic role in ratcheting up standards and in managing some of the capital and admissions issues. Surely, that is completely different from what the Secretary of State is ending up with by default: a system run by a Minister, with local authority involvement coming at a lower level.</p>

 What the hon. Gentleman is suggesting is happening in local authorities now. There is best practice in Tameside in my constituency, where the local authority has set up the Tameside campus, where all the schools&#151;whether academies, comprehensive schools under the local education authority or foundation schools&#151;are in free association with one another, with the local authority as a key partner, to develop a range of education facilities across the borough. Is that not precisely what he is suggesting? And it is happening now in Labour-controlled Tameside.</p>

If there is a great school leader&#151;such as the gentleman who is running the Phoenix school, which I visited this morning&#151;there is no need for an academy. He is doing many of the things that academies want to do. I would be happy to take him to any of the Government&#146;s academies, because they could all learn an awful lot from him.

 The hon. Gentleman makes a good point. By talking about failing schools, he highlights precisely the type of strategic role that local authorities should have. It would be totally unacceptable to rely in the future merely on an Ofsted report every three or four years, and a Secretary of State sitting in Whitehall and Westminster, to determine how such schools are doing. Sometimes the governing bodies of dysfunctional schools do not work either, so local authorities should have a role in setting standards and pouncing on schools that are failing, whether they are academies or local authority controlled schools. All those schools, in some way, run the risk; there is no guarantee that any school will have no problems at all in the future. The issue is about bringing in additional leadership.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o93"><a name="71121-0008.htm_para14"><a name="07112160000514">May I raise two other issues of concern, about Government policy and&#151;perhaps to a greater extent&#151;about Conservative policy? I tried to tempt the hon. Member for Surrey Heath to resolve the issue of his party&#146;s approach to grammar schools, but I fear we are not much the wiser. I know that he is desperate to avoid getting entangled in this net, but if he aspires to be Secretary of State, he cannot avoid it for ever. If he were Secretary of State, he would have Conservative authorities, including Buckinghamshire, asking his permission&#151;it is not just a matter for them&#151;to establish new grammar schools. Unless he is going to change the law and opt out completely, he cannot duck this issue for ever.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o94"><a name="71121-0008.htm_para15"><a name="07112160000515">I hope that the hon. Gentleman, and the Secretary of State, will accept that there is one way of moderating many of the concerns that people have had about the academies system in the past&#151;and perhaps about the Conservative party in the past and in the future. People have been worried that academies will end up as a type of selective education and will improve their results not by doing better for their needy and deprived catchments, but by sucking in youngsters through different forms of selection. If the Secretary of State is having a serious review in the delivery unit, and if the Conservative party want to lance the boil of their selection policy, I invite them both to get rid of some of the totally unnecessary powers that academies still have to select by aptitude and potentially by banding. Those powers run the risk of allowing some academies to choose to improve their results by selecting pupils, rather than by improving standards. It would give great comfort to many on the progressive side of politics to know that academies will have to be judged on the real results they achieve for the catchments that they are there to serve.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o95"><a name="71121-0008.htm_para16"><a name="07112160000516">If academies and other maintained schools work well, it is possible that their intakes will be more balanced. When a school starts to do better, that is bound to pull back youngsters and parents who would previously have fled and would have done anything to avoid going there&#151;as was surely the case with the Phoenix school before William Atkinson took over and turned the school round. Incidentally, he turned it round from a situation 10 years ago in which 5 per cent. of pupils got five passes at A* to C, to a situation over the past couple of years in which 70 per cent. achieved that. That is a staggering turnaround, which demonstrates to many of us the extent to which our communities can be failed by some schools. I hope that both Front-Bench teams will think about the issue of selection.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman has strayed on to the subject of selection. May I ask him his view on a question that I would have liked to put to the Secretary of State? The Secretary of State&#146;s new adviser reportedly proposed that faith schools should no longer be allowed to admit pupils on the grounds of faith, because he considered that to be a form of academic selection&#151;something that I absolutely deny. What is the hon. Gentleman&#146;s view?</p>

 Many faith schools do a fantastic job and I certainly would not want to get rid of them. However, the hon. Lady will know that a lot of the research shows that some of the better results achieved by faith schools reflect the fact they have better and more aspirational intakes. I hope that, in the future, faith schools will take a more inclusive approach&#151;</p>

 Some do, as the hon. Lady says, but, frankly, some do not. Faiths that want to reach out to a wider community&#151;as the faiths that I respect and admire want to&#151;will want youngsters coming into their schools who do not necessarily have the faith, or parents with the faith, that the school relates to.</p>

The Government have done a fantastic amount on school funding over the past decade and deserve a lot of credit for the buildings programme that we have talked about. That is important, as people at the school that I visited this morning said. Having the right setting, aspirations and quality for youngsters who are not used to those things in their home environment sends out every right signal. However, the head teacher I met was the first to say that&#151;as most of us would agree&#151;the leadership in schools and the quality of staff are always more important than the buildings themselves. Those things should go together.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o97"><a name="71121-0009.htm_para1"><a name="07112160000522">Over the next few years, we are going to have a much more restrained school budget. The minimum funding guarantee for many schools will barely keep place with the rate of inflation and, in some cases, will be below it. So far, I am really disappointed in the Secretary of State when it comes to deprivation funding. He has not seized the opportunity to do something much more radical. I am talking about a system of the type that my party has suggested for a number of years and that the Conservative party is flirting with now&#151;although I note that it has not allocated any extra funding to it, and it will not become a meaningful commitment until the Conservative party does that. I am talking about having a better system for funding deprived youngsters&#151;a system that does not target parts of the country, but tags people themselves, follows them through school, gives more money, predictably, to schools with the greatest deprivation, and also gives schools in the leafy catchment areas more of an incentive to take on some of those challenging youngsters.</p>

The figure is &#163;40 million, which is peanuts. The amount that my party has been talking about&#151;between &#163;1.5 billion and &#163;2.5 billion&#151;would take the 10 or 15 per cent. that constitutes the most deprived youngsters, on free school meals, up to the private school level of funding now. That would be a far more sensible way of funding schools than the Prime Minister&#146;s rather daft and meaningless commitment to raise the level of maintained school funding in the future to the private school level&#151;but the private school level in 2005. That target is not likely to be met until after 2020. I would have hoped that the Secretary of State&#151;who has been so concerned about issues of child poverty and the lack of social mobility, during his involvement in politics and before he came to the House&#151;would take the opportunity of a growing cross-party consensus to do something much bolder on this issue.</p>

 I wonder whether the hon. Gentleman could join a growing cross-party consensus that, when pupils, particularly from deprived areas such as Bransholme in Hull, cross over into a neighbouring education authority such as East Riding, they should bring with them the additional funding that has rightly be allocated to them. They should not go to one school, a mere half a mile away, and have &#163;500 a year less spent on them, when they need that support.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman is quite right and we would want to see the funding follow the pupil. However, I urge him to lobby his Front-Bench team, rather than me, on the issue. The Conservative party&#146;s proposals on the pupil premium or advantage premium are pretty woolly and vague, and they are not funded. Until they become both clear and funded, they will not mean very much.</p>

I hope that, over the next couple of weeks, the Secretary of State will take the opportunity to clarify, seriously, the Government&#146;s policy on this particular programme. I believe he is to make a speech next week on academies and specialist schools. I hope that he will not leave it until the report of the delivery unit to be really clear about the Government&#146;s philosophy in this area. He needs to get over and to swallow any of the traditional concerns he has about the reform programme. If he fails to do that, it will have serious impacts on the credibility of the Government&#146;s public service reform programme, and on the domestic agenda. Far more importantly, it will mean that in future there will be many more schools that fail their many deprived pupils&#151;we are all aware of that type of school&#151;not for one year or two, but for generations.</p>

I am one of those Members of Parliament who visit many schools, most of which are good. They are full of energy and have good leadership, excellent staff and a learning environment.

<p><a name="stpa_o102"><a name="71121-0009.htm_para6"><a name="07112160000544">Opposition Front Benchers say that a dramatic change is occurring in the Government&#146;s attitude to academies. So far, I have not seen that, and I spend a lot of time talking to the Specialist Schools and Academies Trust, many of the major sponsors and academies themselves. I try to keep my finger on the pulse of what is happening in academies. I do not see, and they do not seem to perceive, a radical change in the academy programme, or restrictions being put on them. The suggestion is that heavy emphasis is being put back on the dead-weight hand of local authorities. After years as Chair of the Select Committee on Children&#151;[Hon. Members: &#147;Schools and Families.&#148;]&#151;Schools and Families; sorry, someone was passing me something. With my experience as Chair of the Committee, I do not see academies being put at risk by local government.</p>

Time and again, in every inquiry we undertook, parents, head teachers and people in the education sector and in schools said, &#147;Give us a good, supportive, well-informed, local authority in partnership with us; that is our best option.&#148; That is what they crave, and even those places that do not have that relationship would like it. In a sense, getting that balance right is one of the responsibilities of any Government.</p>

Two councillors changed in the local elections, and we now have a Conservative-led administration that is in favour of academies, and I support that.

We have told the Government that it would be good if we had a fair balloting system for selective schools instead of the present rules, under which any proposal for change is defeated. A balloting system might not be bad; I just put that idea in the ears of the Minister for Schools. It could apply to schools that want to become academies and schools that want not to be grammar schools. It would be a more even-handed approach, but I am not sure how quickly he will grasp it.</p>

Evidence given to our Committee suggests that academies have shown steady improvement, but there will be some challenges. I was interested to hear the caution of the Liberal Democrat spokesman, the hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Laws), on banding. In our inquiries on admissions, head teacher after head teacher said, &#147;If we had a school intake that represented our community, we could do wonderful things,&#148; but what happens if everyone who can do so moves to a better catchment area, or puts their children into independent education?</p>

With such an imbalance, it is extremely difficult to do a good job for all the children, no matter how charismatic the head. Of course, if children go to a selective school in Kent, they will do well and get a good education, but the majority of pupils who do not get into the grammar schools get a poor education, so on average all children in Kent get a sub-standard education. That is an interesting effect of selection.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman can scratch away as deeply as he likes, but the faith schools in my constituency all have a genuinely comprehensive intake. A Roman Catholic secondary girls school, of which I am a governor, has a genuinely comprehensive intake and its fair share of statemented children and children with disabilities. It has high standards of discipline and behaviour and high parental interest in the education of their children. It takes pupils from a neighbouring, notably more deprived parish, and the children from the more deprived area are often the highest achievers. It is the ethos of the school that is so successful.</p>

 I thank the hon. Lady for that intervention. Going back to evidence-based policy, we looked closely at admissions. I am not saying anything about the school with which she is involved, but there was a general problem with faith schools. I hope very much that the new admissions code and the provision that enables it to be delivered more powerfully and positively will show results.

 I listened with interest to what the Secretary of State said about funding and choice. In my constituency, many parents are concerned about special educational needs. As a result, they wanted to set up a new school that dealt specifically with autism. Such a school was set up in Stevenage and was visited by the hon. Member for Stevenage (Barbara Follett). However, the parents struggle with getting the funding out of the system; that funding is not recognised in respect of choice because they have set up their own school for special educational needs.</p>

One of the problems that parents often have, and on which they often seek my support, is when an excellent school&#146;s indicated admission number does not reflect physical capacity, but has been set, perhaps, at a time when people did not appreciate its importance. Such parents&#146; children are turned away from their choice of school. Having spoken to the head teacher, visited the school and considered its ethos and teaching methods, those parents feel that it best reflects the needs of their child, and they are turned away. They are always advised to send their children to a school that is failing to attract parents, so that the books can be balanced and the surplus places rule dealt with. That simply puts the needs of children behind the bureaucrats&#146; need to tidy up the numbers and meet the surplus places rule.</p>

We do not talk about having surplus places in other services or businesses; we expect to have a range of choices and to be able to choose where we want to go. Businesses are able to deal with increased demand and provide the extra capacity. If we had more of that in the education system, that would drive up standards and give parents more choices.</p>

That would highlight failing schools that are not delivering the quality of education that all our children need; it would force something to happen. Preventing parents from getting their first choice, and forcing them to send their children to a school that they do not want, just props up schools that are not delivering and delays the steps that need to be taken to deliver proper education&#151;not only for the area generally, but for the pupils in the school that is not doing as well as it should.</p>

The indicated admission number does not always correspond with the physical capacity of the school, and once that number is hit, the school cannot take in any more pupils, regardless of whether the school has the physical capacity. <i> [Interruption.]</i> If the Minister is saying something different, that is incredibly encouraging and I shall pass the news to my local education authority.

The Minister will also know, although it is not now his Department&#146;s responsibility, that not enough socially disadvantaged young people are able to go to university.

I have it on good authority that when the Conservative policy review body sat down to try to think through those ideas, this was all that they could come up with at the end of a two-hour session with the great and the good. There was nothing that they could do to better the academy programme.</p>

 I realise that the hon. Gentleman is new to the Select Committee, but he will of course be aware that the academy programme builds on and almost replicates the city technology college concept, which was introduced by the last Conservative Government.</p>

 Having run an LEA for 20 years, I am certainly not new to Conservative education policy. I take it as flattery that the Conservatives wish to borrow the policy and try to claim it as their own.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o133"><a name="71121-0010.htm_para17"><a name="07112160000591">The Government&#146;s amendment sets out their achievements in education. I welcome those achievements in three respects. First, I welcome the proposals in the Gracious Speech, with the education and skills Bill, which will extend education and training further to 17 and 18-year-olds, and the Children and Young Persons Bill, which will take steps to address the disadvantaged position of children in care. I thought, perhaps naively, that those proposals would be relatively uncontroversial, and I, like my hon. Friend the Member for Huddersfield (Mr. Sheerman), was dismayed to hear how Opposition Members approached them in the debate on the Gracious Speech, in trying to find fault with wholly praiseworthy measures.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o134"><a name="71121-0010.htm_para18"><a name="07112160000592">Secondly, I praise the investment that the Government have put in. Yesterday I visited Burlington Danes academy in my constituency, where in addition to the &#163;2 million put in by sponsors, &#163;16 million is being put in by the Government to build new parts of the school to an extremely high standard and to give that school, which has gone through some troubled times but is basically excellent, a bright future. Earlier this year I attended the opening of Acton high school, which has been completely rebuilt to an astonishingly high standard. As soon as one walks into such a school, one can see the value that is placed on young people and their education, which I never saw in the dirty, unkempt and distressed schools that I visited when the Conservative party was in government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o135"><a name="71121-0010.htm_para19"><a name="07112160000593">I also praise initiatives such as building schools for the future, which will give more than &#163;100 million to schools in my constituency, Sure Start and neighbourhood renewal. I think that the hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Laws) mentioned Phoenix high school, which is in my constituency, and William Atkinson six times. I am not surprised, because William, who is the head teacher of Phoenix, is a most inspiring individual. I am glad that the hon.

<p><a name="stpa_o137"><a name="71121-0010.htm_para21"><a name="07112160000597">Thirdly, I praise the Government on results. I could go through every school attended by children from my constituency, but I will mention just three. William Morris sixth form, of which I have been a governor since it was set up in 1994, has had an outstanding Ofsted report. I was told that if one types &#147;outstanding sixth form&#148; into Google, William Morris comes up on the first page. Phoenix is the most improved school in England over the past three years. Hurlingham and Chelsea school, having been in special measures three years ago, came out of special measures in record time, and its A to C GCSE results increased two and a half times over that period under the utterly inspiring leadership of Phil Cross, who is the new William Atkinson of the borough.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o138"><a name="71121-0010.htm_para22"><a name="07112160000598">I mention those three schools because they were all, at different times, targeted for closure by the Conservatives: William Morris was targeted in the last three years of the Conservative Government; Phoenix, which was for many years rubbished by Conservative councillors, who said that if they came to power they would close it; and Hurlingham and Chelsea, which, now that the Conservatives are in power locally, they are seeking to close. It may seem parochial to talk about one of my own LEAs, but there are lessons to be learned from looking at the Conservatives in local government, and how they deal with education, that give the lie to what they say when they talk in this House about education policy nationally.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o139"><a name="71121-0010.htm_para23"><a name="07112160000599">The history of education policy over the brief 18 months since the LEA and the council changed hands in Hammersmith and Fulham is an extraordinary and disgraceful one, which may interest my hon. Friends on the Front Bench, if nobody else. The first move was an attempt to close Hurlingham and Chelsea school, which, as I said, came out of special measures in record time and is fast improving. At the end of a seven-month campaign by the school to avoid closure, the closure proposal was withdrawn, but only because it was clear to the LEA that the school adjudicator was not going to find in its favour.</p>

Since then, over the past six months, a commission has been set up under the chairmanship of Baroness Perry. I have nothing but respect for her professional record, but it is unfortunate that she was at the same time chairing the Conservative party&#146;s policy review. Her report was highly critical of the LEA and its poor relations with schools, and called for a full review of 14-to-19 education; both those facts have been ignored. It also put forward two quite extraordinary proposals, which are leading to the misuse of building schools for the future money in the LEA, and to an attempt to use the academy process to introduce selection by the back door&#151;a topic that the hon. Member for Yeovil alluded to in his speech. Such misuse of the academy programme  <br>

<p><a name="stpa_o141"><a name="71121-0010.htm_para25"><a name="07112160000601">What were the two proposals? The first is known locally as the French connection. It is the proposal to sell off two propitious school sites to the French Government. That came out through Freedom of Information Act inquiries and investigations by the head teachers of the schools concerned. A proposal to sell off two of the best sites in Fulham to the French Government for conversion to private lyc&#233;e schools was being made without the knowledge of the schools. I have a letter here from the chairman of governors of one of the schools, who says that in June he found some French people wandering uninvited around his school, asking people at random questions about the curriculum. I have asked for a meeting with the French ambassador to discuss these matters, but the fact remains that neither that school nor Hurlingham and Chelsea school, which is being asked to share its site with a private lyc&#233;e, was consulted in any way. Hurlingham and Chelsea now faces its second battle in a year to remain open, despite its outstanding achievements.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o142"><a name="71121-0010.htm_para26"><a name="07112160000602">The second proposal being pursued by my Tory LEA is to close the only secular girls school in the borough, which is the first school of choice for many Muslim families in my constituency.

 I can answer that very straightforwardly. At the same time as the LEA is proposing those closures, it is proposing to open a new academy in my constituency. I know about that only through hearsay, because neither local residents nor the heads have been consulted. For example, the head of the other academy that is less than a mile away, whom I was talking to yesterday, has not been consulted. I have not been consulted. A feasibility study has gone on; it is another fait accompli.

 The Opposition motion expresses the clear commitment in my party to continuing reform of our schools system, to the encouragement of devolved responsibility in schools and to the provision of greater support to the disadvantaged through greater choice and openness. It is, moreover, a clear commitment that we have in the past honoured in the Lobby by supporting the Government when we believed that they were introducing necessary reforms. Our crucial support for the Education and Inspections Act 2006 proves that we, at least, have the courage of our convictions when it comes to schools reform. But while we were busy reaching for consensus in the Lobby, many in the Labour party were reaching for consensus on paper, and were still not finding it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o150"><a name="71121-0011.htm_para6"><a name="07112160000619">It is perhaps unfortunate that next to the Government amendment, some rather more ominous names appear alongside the name of the Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families.

Thirdly, there is the Secretary of State for Innovation, Universities and Skills, who, before his second coming, was busy with an alternative, but sadly not very innovative education White Paper, while on the Back Benches. Last but not least, we have the Secretary of State for Health, who is presumably listed for showing his dedication through taking a hospital pass from the Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families when he got himself into a spot of bother in last Tuesday&#146;s debate. When we analyse the Government&#146;s policy on schools reform, it appears that only one principle is at work&#151;random movement, otherwise dubbed as Brownian motion.</p>

It can sometimes be too easy to view disadvantage in a narrow, socio-economic sense. That is the root of a great deal of, but by no means all, disadvantage. Pupils with special educational needs are still some of the most disadvantaged in our schools, as hon. Members from different parties have pointed out.</p>

on education. I have a strong and personal interest in children with SEN getting a better start in life and I do my best to keep abreast of the Government&#146;s stance on those issues. However, that stance is beginning to look shaky. The comprehensive spending review in October announced the availability of an extra &#163;340 million over the CSR period to support disabled children and young people, but the way in which the additional funding will interact with existing provision for SEN remains unclear.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o154"><a name="71121-0011.htm_para10"><a name="07112160000623">I am sceptical of the utility of additional funding without a root-and-branch review that places children&#146;s needs first and foremost. Such a review is now getting started under my hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham (John Bercow). Once again, the Conservative party is setting the reform agenda. However, if reform is to be effective, an SEN system must be founded on genuine parental choice. Just as choice should be the decisive factor in driving up standards in the wider school system, so it should be decisive in approving the outcomes for children with special needs.</p>

The reason for the repetition is simply the Government&#146;s intransigence. I am not a member of the Committee, but I hope that I shall never miss an opportunity to pay tribute to its work. Sir Robert Balchin, the chair of the Conservative party&#146;s commission on special needs education, has also produced a fine report, which I recommend to the Secretary of State. Those are only two in a growing chorus of voices that call for a fundamental reform of SEN provision.</p>

I hope that, when the Minister for Schools and Learners responds, he will commit to giving the Committee&#146;s latest report on the matter the attention that it deserves. I hope that he will also commit to providing a national strategy for SEN, which allows schools the freedom to tailor their provision to the needs of the communities that they serve.</p>

Nevertheless, SEN provision remains, all too often, both stretched and inflexible for parents and children.</p>

The Government should act now to prepare the system of SEN provision to handle a great deal more strain if their proposals to raise the school leaving age are to go ahead.</p>

Better still, fundamental reform of provision is needed. A significant gap remains between the perception of SEN provision in Whitehall and the experience of parents on the ground. I do not want that gap to widen further because the Government have announced a policy on compulsory education to grab the headlines without doing their homework on special needs.</p>

the new education policy of Cameron&#146;s Conservatives, who are trying to be touchy-feely, liberal, progressive modernisers, is in any way different from the policy of Thatcher&#146;s Conservatives. The Conservatives still have a fundamental commitment to wholesale privatisation and fragmentation of the system and to seeing the individual school as the basic unit, not understanding the need for schools to operate within a co-operative framework.</p>

 My hon. Friend makes an important point. That is the hidden agenda, and we could see that from the expression on the shadow Secretary of State&#146;s face. Throughout his speech, he found it extremely difficult to keep a straight face, in his new-born commitment to liberal, progressive modernity. Indeed, I would go further back. The shadow Secretary of State spoke about the miraculous assumptions of some aspects of Government policy, but he was the personification of miraculous assumptions, in what he was saying about the way forward. He combined that with a kind of immaculate conception. It was almost as if Keith Joseph had come back to speak to us.

On the one hand, they keep telling us that they want to give more freedom to schools and head teachers, pass down more power to parents, lift the dead hand of bureaucracy, move away from the command economy and take centralisation out of the system. On the other hand, they want to tell every pupil in the country that they must keep their shirts firmly tucked in their trousers and every teacher that every time anyone walks through their classroom door, every child in that classroom must&#151;day in, day out, week in, week out, month in, month out&#151;stand to attention. That is a level of prescription that Joseph Stalin could not have dreamed of, and it blows out of the water any commitment to trusting the professional judgment of teachers and head teachers that the Conservatives want us to believe they support.</p>

 I understand that perfectly, because that has been the case since the passing of the Education Reform Act 1988. The only people who seem to think that local authorities run every school are the Liberal Democrats and the Conservatives. Certainly nobody on the Government Benches thinks that that is how the system in this country could reasonably be described.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o167"><a name="71121-0011.htm_para23"><a name="07112160000645">I should like to say a word or two about choice and selection. The ground of this debate, which has been going on for 40 years or more, fundamentally shifted when the hon. Member for Havant (Mr. Willetts) made his speech earlier this year. Only last week, in the debate on the Loyal Address, I was able to read the key extract of his speech, in which he finally admitted that a selective admissions policy&#151;selection by academic ability&#151;entrenches disadvantage rather than eroding it. From that moment on, regardless of the divisions in the Conservative party, the ground of the debate shifted. I welcome the fact that the Opposition have included in their motion a clear commitment to</p>
<a name="71121-0011.htm_brev4"><a name="07112160001370"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;all-ability schools in the state sector&#148;,</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o169"><a name="71121-0011.htm_para25"><a name="07112160000647">However, we have to be clear about the issue of choice. It is a simple matter: either we want schools to choose pupils through various forms of selection, such as academic selection, which exists in some areas, selection by aptitude or a variety of fairly dubious proxies, or we want parents to be able to choose schools. I am firmly on the latter side of the argument. However, we must accept that the historical legacy of the location of our schools and the distribution of population mean that it is logistically impossible for every parent in the country to secure their first choice school, unless the Government are committed to a massive expansion in their budgets, to keep thousands and thousands of spare places open.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o170"><a name="71121-0012.htm_para0"><a name="07112160000648">We heard from the official Opposition yesterday that they are doing precisely the opposite, because they intend to take a huge slice&#151;I think that the figure was &#163;4.5 billion&#151;out of the building schools for the future programme. They have to understand that choice can operate only in a fair, balanced and regulated framework, where the objective is to ensure that parents secure their first choice school, but where that is balanced by other factors. Otherwise, the exercise of choice by some individuals can, if not operating in a fair framework, simply mean the denial of choice to others. It is the central role of the Government and of local authorities to ensure that we have that fair and balanced framework, which maximises choice to the benefit of the greatest number of parents.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o171"><a name="71121-0012.htm_para1"><a name="07112160000649">I should like to make a point about good schools and good GCSEs. A comment that I have made to a number of Ministers for education is that although the Government have been extremely successful in driving up standards over a 10-year period and in enabling thousands of young people to obtain qualifications that they would not have obtained before&#151;it really is as simple as that&#151;the focus on good GCSEs nevertheless has a downside. The target of 5 A to C grades has a general level of support, but every time we describe such grades as good GCSEs, we are saying to the young people who do not achieve them that their GCSEs are somehow no good, and that they have failed miserably to achieve what we expect of them. We are sending that message not only to those young people, but to their parents. I have discussed this point with my hon. Friend the Minister for Schools and Learners, and with his predecessors, but I would like to appeal again for a different way to describe levels of achievement. I am not talking about manipulating targets&#151;targets are important and I want to see results improving year on year, and to see children achieving more year on year&#151;but we have to find a different kind of language.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o172"><a name="71121-0012.htm_para2"><a name="07112160000650">We have to find a different kind of language to describe schools as well. It is too easy just to talk about a good school. In my experience&#151;I think most Ofsted inspectors would agree with this&#151;there are good schools, but most schools are good at something. To assume that there is a category of schools defined as good and another that is defined as failing is utterly simplistic and does not accurately describe what is taking place. Furthermore, we all too often fall into the trap of defining a school as good because it happens to have a favourable intake. Again, I ask the Government to revisit the kind of language that we use. We need to find a better, richer language to describe the range of schools that we have, their many qualities and the many ways in which they advance the education and achievement of their pupils.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o173"><a name="71121-0012.htm_para3"><a name="07112160000651">In respect of language, I should also like to make a point about the 14-to-19 diplomas. In the Queen&#146;s Speech debate last week, I made an appeal for us to look again at Sir Mike Tomlinson&#146;s original report on the relationship between A-levels, GCSEs and the new diplomas. I now want to ask my hon. Friend the Minister to think again about the use of the words &#147;vocational&#148; and &#147;academic&#148;. In theory, there is cross-party consensus that we need to bridge the academic-vocational divide. In my view, however,  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="21 Nov 2007">

that will not be achieved as long as we continue to use the terms &#147;vocational&#148; and &#147;academic&#148;. Again, we need a richer, more careful language to describe the range of subjects in the curriculum, and the range of knowledge and skills that young people require to pursue different careers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o174"><a name="71121-0012.htm_para4"><a name="07112160000652">For example, we can ask the simple question: is maths an academic subject or a vocational subject? For someone going to university to do a degree in maths, physics or information technology, maths is an academic subject. However, for someone training to be an electrician, a plumber or a joiner, it is vocational. This is an issue for all Members of the House, head teachers, teachers and parents, and we really need to revisit it, to determine the best way of describing the range of subjects, knowledge and skills in the curriculum. I have noticed the word &#147;applied&#148; creeping into recent speeches. Perhaps the terms &#147;theoretical&#148; and &#147;applied&#148; would provide better ways of achieving this.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o175"><a name="71121-0012.htm_para5"><a name="07112160000653">I want to touch briefly on the subject of special educational needs. Reference has been made by other hon. Members to the Select Committee&#146;s report on SEN, which I believe moved the debate forward a little. I still think that we have a major problem with statementing, however. The noble Baroness Warnock&#146;s speech two years ago calling for a rethink on statementing and on the categorisation of SEN was really important. I am not sure that the Select Committee&#151;of which I was then a member&#151;or the Government&#146;s response have fully taken that report on board.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o176"><a name="71121-0012.htm_para6"><a name="07112160000654">The basic principle should be that, in reality, the vast majority of children have special educational needs of one kind or another. For many children, those needs will be fairly minor, but they need to be recognised none the less. By focusing on SEN as a distinct category of people with highly visible disabilities, and on the statementing process, we have overlooked the less dramatic, less obvious needs of large numbers of children who nevertheless need a little more attention than the present system can provide.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o177"><a name="71121-0012.htm_para7"><a name="07112160000655">Finally, I should like to put three questions to my hon. Friend the Minister. First, is it the case that, as the schools commissioner goes round the country looking at local authorities&#146; plans for building schools for the future, he is requiring the authorities to adopt academies if they are going to secure BSF money? If that is the case, it needs to be made public and a matter of policy. If it is being done quietly, on the side, I do not believe that that is the best way of handling this matter. My own local authority might well be interested in having an academy in the near future, but that is a decision that should be taken locally. It should not involve a bit of arm-twisting by the schools commissioner.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o178"><a name="71121-0012.htm_para8"><a name="07112160000656">Secondly, will my hon. Friend tell us how far the Department has got with the commitment that was made some weeks ago to review the ballot system for wholly selective schools? As he will know, this is an issue of great importance to me and to many other Members, and the Government need to keep us informed about it, and to consult widely on improvements to the present ballot arrangements. Thirdly, will my hon. Friend confirm the ongoing importance of the historic commitment made by the Prime Minister, when he was Chancellor, not only to narrow the gap between per-pupil funding in state schools and that in private schools, but to close it? Will my hon. Friend also tell us in what time scale he thinks it would be feasible to achieve that?</p>

Benchers, who say that we must extend the academies programme to make choice real, while also allowing the establishment of new schools. We must allow charities and other groups to set up new schools.

 The hon. Gentleman makes an excellent point, which helps my argument immensely. His own figure shows the comparative failure of the state sector, despite record funding, to match the private sector. It shows up the false promise made by the Prime Minister that funding in the state sector would somehow match that of the independent sector. Some of the independent schools that are bagging those university places receive little more money&#151;in some cases, even less&#151;than the average state school, yet they have the successes. Why? It is because of their culture, and because the system itself is important. It is no use Ministers suggesting, as the Prime Minister did earlier, that it is somehow the universities&#146; fault for failing to select children from schools that are not raising standards sufficiently.

 That is an interesting point&#151;<i> [Interruption.] </i>No, absolutely not. When parents, many of whom are not wealthy, are forced to spend their every penny to escape the failing schools around them, and to pay the tax burden for state schools as well as the additional fees for their children&#146;s education, it is nonsense to propose to remove charitable status from high quality education institutions. What we need to do is bring the choice that exists in the independent sector to the state sector, so that poorer parents are able to use their power as educational consumers to find the best for their children. In places such as Hull, parents are desperate for the opportunity to find better education for their children.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o184"><a name="71121-0012.htm_para14"><a name="07112160000667">I hope that the Secretary of State and the Minister who will reply will redouble their efforts to bring those opportunities to parents and children. For 10 years, the previous Prime Minister was held back by the Secretary of State&#146;s former political master&#151;and perhaps current one, too. We need a fully reforming Government, who can capture the optimism and hope of Conservative Front Benchers and offer opportunity for all rather than guaranteed failure for so many at the bottom of the social pile.</p>

 We have had an excellent debate and it is a pleasure to follow my hon. Friend the Member for Beverley and Holderness (Mr. Stuart).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o185"><a name="71121-0012.htm_para15"><a name="07112160000669">Our debate has been about the academies programme, but also about reform. Our party believes that giving schools more autonomy and freedom to manage themselves, and bringing in new providers, will help to raise standards. That can be seen in practice at Mossbourne academy in Hackney, where half the children qualify for free school meals, 40 per cent. speak English as a second language and a quarter are on the special needs register. Yet in this year&#146;s key stage 3 SATs results, 92 per cent. achieved level 5 or above in English and 93 per cent. did so in maths. That puts the school on track for 80 per cent. to achieve five or more GCSEs at grades A* to C, including English and maths. We should compare that with the figure for most comprehensives in leafy suburbs, and with the national average of 46 per cent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o186"><a name="71121-0012.htm_para16"><a name="07112160000670">Mossbourne is an excellent school with exemplary behaviour and a strict school uniform policy that is strictly enforced.

 The hon. Gentleman must accept that a policy directed from the centre of national Government that tells every school what every child in every classroom must do every time the door opens and an adult walks in is absolutely absurd. Has he calculated how many times children will be standing up and sitting down during a school year?</p>

 Well, it seems to work, and what matters is policies that actually work rather than those that are based on assertion&#151;or on ideology, as in the hon. Gentleman&#146;s case. There is nothing contradictory in wanting more freedom for schools, especially from the hundreds of directives that come out of the Department every year, full of prescriptions about a whole range of issues. We just want two or three priorities to be achieved: better reading, better discipline and children taught according to their ability.</p>

 I appreciate what the hon. Gentleman seeks to achieve through some of his policies, but does he not agree that his party is sending a contradictory message? It talks about more freedom for schools, but it is being incredibly prescriptive on issues such as setting. Is it right for his party to be so prescriptive if it also wishes to give greater freedoms?</p>

 We are discussing the freedom to manage schools without interference from political bodies such as local authorities and a whole range of other organisations. Ministers must have certain key priorities. It is well known that there is a massive amount of evidence on reading.

 If that is what the evidence shows works. The Liberal Democrat spokesman tabled amendments at the Committee stage of an education Bill that were full of prescriptive proposals. The hon.

 About 20, but we must remember that CTCs were introduced in the last few years of the previous Government, whereas this Government have been in power for 10 years and there are still only 83 academies. We must be realistic: when we examine the results of the CTCs, we see what several years of freedom and effective leadership can achieve. Conor Ryan, a former Labour education special adviser, points out in his excellent blog, which I recommend to Labour Members, that CTCs beat many fee-paying independent schools in their GCSE results.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o194"><a name="71121-0012.htm_para24"><a name="07112160000688">The top performing CTC is Thomas Telford school. It has a genuinely comprehensive intake, and 100 per cent. of its pupils achieve five or more GCSEs&#151;95 per cent. do so when English and maths are included. More than that, 100 per cent. of pupils achieved 12 or more GCSEs, including vocational equivalents. Even when one strips out the vocational qualifications, the school remains the best performing comprehensive in the country. Last year, 88 per cent. of pupils at the Harris city academy in Crystal Palace achieved five or more GCSEs&#151;75 per cent. did so when English and maths are included.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o195"><a name="71121-0012.htm_para25"><a name="07112160000689">The key to this success was the freedom that academies and CTCs were given, but that is slowly being eroded by the Secretary of State. He said in a parliamentary statement:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o197"><a name="71121-0013.htm_para1"><a name="07112160000691">That confirms the fear expressed by the hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Laws) that the Secretary of State is creating a system of academies in name but not in substance. He is also right to say that the drive behind the academies programme is to bring into education the innovation and excellence that head teachers such as William Atkinson bring to their schools. He could also have mentioned Sir Michael Wilshaw at Mossbourne community academy, Sir Kevin Satchwell at Thomas Telford school or Mrs. Brenda Bigland, the head teacher at the excellent Lent Rise combined school in Burnham, near Slough.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o198"><a name="71121-0013.htm_para2"><a name="07112160000692">During the debate, the Secretary of State made a strange and rather political point&#151;surprise, surprise. He said that our decision to use a small portion of the building schools for the future budget to build new schools is somehow a cut in spending on building new schools. That does not make sense. He went on about the dangers of teaching creationism without mentioning any school where that happens. Under our proposals, new academies will be bound by section 157 of the Education Act 2002, which sets out the curriculum requirements for independent schools.</p>

We want to make it easier for educational charities, philanthropists, livery companies and groups of parents to set up schools and to have access to capital and revenue funding. We want to give additional incentives to establish schools in deprived areas, with a pupil premium diverting extra resources directly to schools that accept children from poorer areas. We want to remove the bureaucratic restrictions and planning laws that make setting up a new school so difficult.</p>

We are committed to setting children by ability so that the most able can be stretched and the least able given time and space to learn. We are committed to ending the disgrace that one in five children leave primary school unable to read properly. We are committed to improving behaviour in schools, so that they can be calm, safe places where children enjoy learning. Last week&#146;s Ofsted report pointed out that four in 10 children wished that their classmates would be quieter and better behaved. Poor behaviour is a key factor in driving teachers out of the profession.</p>

That is one reason why the national curriculum programmes of study for science, as well as for maths, English and IT, now apply to academies. Beyond those subjects, academies have curriculum freedom. The Conservative party has no answer to the question how it will regulate new academies to prevent intellectual perversions such as creationism from entering science lessons.</p>

 There is no evidence that any independent school teaches creationism. However, is the Minister aware that the biology syllabus offered by one of the three exam boards contains a segment on discussing creationism?</p>

They would still be in a significant minority, while the private sector sponsor would appoint the majority of governors.</p>

He said that when schools face falling rolls they should close. I assume, therefore, that he is against our presumption against closing rural schools. However, I agreed with what he said about aspiration. I gazed at the Public Gallery, and noticed that a bunch of children were admiring his comments about how informative tours of the House are.</p>

I should be delighted to do so, and to add my voice to the congratulations directed at Sir William Atkinson on his work as head teacher of the Phoenix school. I was also pleased to hear my hon.

Rather than talking about schools in isolation, we have to get things right for children in all the contexts in which they live and are supported by public services.</p>

concerns with his party about the exclusion policy that it sets out. We know that exclusions disproportionately affect people with SEN, especially those with complex conditions. Such problems can be difficult to diagnose, and members of the work force sometimes struggle to understand them properly. Students in those circumstances can be seriously disadvantaged by exclusion and, if they do not have the right of appeal, they have no opportunity to raise their concerns unless they can afford to go to court.</p>

Friend the Member for Bury, North in congratulating Elton high school, its head, Neil Scruton, and the head of its governors, Jeff Coles, on the job being done for his constituents. I agree that it is important that parents should choose schools, rather than the other way around. As ever, my hon. Friend stimulates us to think carefully about the words that we use in education debates, and I was especially struck by what he said about the use of the words &#147;vocational&#148; and &#147;academic&#148;. The Government envisage that diplomas will bring out the academic best in young people, through the motivation to learn that work-related learning supplies. The way to bridge the gap between those two alternatives is to mix the best elements that each offers.</p>

Member for Beverley and Holderness (Mr. Stuart) made it clear that he thinks that his party should put the country first when it comes to education, and I believe that he used the phrase &#147;country before party&#148;. A year ago, after some civilised and informed debates, Government and Opposition Front Benchers were near to agreement on that, and it is the hon. Member for Surrey, Heath who is constantly trying to define difference rather than putting his country first. If he believes that the policies in the green paper will do anything for social mobility, he needs to read the document more carefully.</p>

I am glad that he acknowledges that there is a clear role for regulation and that all schools should adopt best practice, as enforced by Ofsted. Essentially, that is how most of the regulation passed by the House in respect of schools is enforced already, so that is another example of the Opposition borrowing our clothes. As for city technology colleges, the previous Conservative Government managed to establish 15 such colleges in their 18 years in power, whereas this Government have established 83 academies in 10 years. After 13 years, we will have 230, so I think that we are doing a little better in that respect.</p>

In September, they proposed that children should be kept back at 11, whereas now they say that they should be tested at six. They offer no answers as to where those branded failures at six will go&#151;perhaps they will go to the sin bins along with the pupils who are excluded and unable to afford to appeal in court.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o227"><a name="71121-0013.htm_para31"><a name="07112160000737">We led Conservative Front Benchers to abandon their support for selection, although that support is as strong as ever among their Back Benchers and in the shires. They still cannot answer the Buckinghamshire question, first raised by the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve), but their next change of heart must be their raid on BSF, to bypass local authorities. The unregulated creation of new schools might work for the privileged few who can get it together&#151;I have set up co-operatives; I know how tough it can be&#151;but that will fail the many in disadvantaged areas, and it will be paid for by areas elsewhere in the country that need new schools after decades of under-investment. That is why we should oppose this flawed Tory motion and back the Government amendment: back vision, back reform, back leadership and reject flip-flopping froth from an Opposition who have failed on reform.</p>

Time and again, they stand at the Dispatch Box and say that that is a priority. Time and again, the independent evidence shows their subsequent failure to do what is proven to be needed. The Healthcare Commission&#146;s report on the outbreaks at Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells NHS Trust is only the latest, although possibly the worst, example of such reports.</p>

In 2006 some 20 NHS Trusts had C. diff rates higher than those reported at the Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells NHS Trust, although I hope that very few of those trusts are responsible for the kind of failings that were disclosed at Maidstone.</p>

In particular, we hold the Secretary of State to account for his failure to act in relation to the failings at Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells. In our motion I have focused on three main topics&#151;screening, isolation facilities and bed occupancy rates. I acknowledge that there is much else that will form part of a comprehensive strategy, including an antibiotic regime, high cleaning standards, improved hand hygiene, surveillance and new technologies for antimicrobial techniques and surfaces. I set out much of that in our previous debate in January, but I draw attention to the three matters that I mentioned, over which the Government could exercise influence through investment and policy.</p>

 Does my hon. Friend recall the case that I raised at Health questions a few days ago? A decorated RAF war hero in my constituency nearly died after contracting C. difficile in Southampton general hospital following a routine operation. Does my hon. Friend think that the reason for the inaction is that the people who suffer so much&#151;and in many cases lose their lives&#151;are of a certain age? If such things happened to people of middle age or younger, perhaps the Government would feel it necessary to take firmer action and act more decisively. Is not a form of ageism at work in respect of the problem?</p>

 I recall my hon. Friend&#146;s question, and I fear that he may be right, although I wish he were not. It is clear from the report on Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells NHS Trust that some of the same infection control issues were manifested in the lack of response to issues of privacy and dignity. That, of course, impacts disproportionately on the very elderly. Although C. difficile is not confined to the very elderly, they are particularly at risk. I share my hon. Friend&#146;s concern.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o238"><a name="71121-0014.htm_para9"><a name="07112160001286">A search-and-destroy strategy would clearly take several years to achieve its aims, just as would a zero-tolerance approach in respect of C. difficile; we face increasing risks from new strains and from community-acquired infections. I do not discount the simple fact that even with such a strategy, there is a continual fight against the reintroduction of infection. However, an aggressive strategy of that kind is even more necessary now, as those more virulent strains become evident.</p>

 I want to pick up the point about elderly people who contract MRSA and other infections. Some of the most common sites for such infections are leg ulcers, which are very frequent among older people, whether they are admitted to hospital, in residential care or seen by practice nurses in the community. Does my hon. Friend agree that, as leg ulcers are so open and likely to acquire such infections, we should not only tend to their healing, but concentrate more on the issue of leg ulcers among the elderly, so that we can see whether they have acquired those diseases?</p>

The measures that the hon. Gentleman is outlining are fairly obvious, and they are critical. However, is not the real problem antibiotic resistance? Unless we tackle that at root by promoting more research, we will be stuck with the problem for a long time. Can the hon. Gentleman tell us what research was instituted by the Conservative Government to persuade the pharmaceutical industry and Government laboratories to crack that major pharmaceutical problem?</p>

 The hon. Gentleman may say that the measures are obvious, and they may be obvious to him, but they were not as obvious as they should have been in the Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells NHS Trust. From memory, I think that only about 7 per cent. of the appropriate C. difficile patients received access to Vancomycin. We have to make sure that the available antibiotics regimes are being used. In the majority of cases that it reviewed, the Healthcare Commission found that broader-spectrum antibiotics were being used when narrower-spectrum ones were available. Of course there is a need for research and the constant addition of techniques to deal with the problems.</p>

Does the hon. Gentleman agree that, especially when we talk about ulcers, there is more to consider than broad-range antibiotics? There are other, effective ways of dealing with leg ulcers in particular. I am thinking of the surgical maggots available from ZooBiotic. They not only clean the wound, but combat the MRSA. The overuse of broad-spectrum antibiotics in dealing with infection in leg ulcers sometimes exacerbates the problem.</p>

 I am grateful to the hon. Lady. I recall her Adjournment debate on that subject earlier this year, which clearly caught the interest of the House. Where C. difficile is concerned, staff in the NHS need to be extraordinarily well aware of the risks that they run with broad spectrum antibiotics, particularly when they are combined with proton pump inhibitors, because the combination of those two things can leave patients very vulnerable to the consequences of C. difficile infection and its proliferation. The hon. Lady refers to one way of combating that, but another would be the use of probiotics, which has been pioneered in Nottingham.</p>

Some of the things on which we should focus have been obvious for a long time&#151;the point is that those things have not been done. Let us take the screening of patients for admission.

admissions. I welcome the fact that they have now done that, albeit that it is nearly three and a half years since we called for it to happen.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o240"><a name="71121-0014.htm_para11"><a name="07112160001294">This is not the first time that the Department of Health has advised that. Last November a best practice code was published, which said:</p>
<a name="71121-0014.htm_brev3"><a name="07112160001379"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The logical conclusion of risk factor assessments and the results of modelling studies is that the most appropriate approach to the reduction in MRSA carriage in the population, and resultant MRSA infection, is the universal screening of all admissions to hospital&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o241"><a name="71121-0014.htm_para12"><a name="07112160001295">Now, a year later, Ministers tell us that they are going to put in place the resources to support screening; we said during the general election that that should be done and that the necessary technology should be supported.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o242"><a name="71121-0014.htm_para13"><a name="07112160001296">The hon. Member for Bolton, South-East mentioned research; we said that there should be research and support for new technologies to deliver rapid screening, so that when one is in a ward and asks staff about the process of managing patients, one does not find that it will be two days before they are in a position to be able to access results and know whether patients are infected.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o243"><a name="71121-0014.htm_para14"><a name="07112160001297">In the past few weeks, I have had responses to freedom of information requests that I made of hospital trusts, and the results are deeply disappointing. Only 2 per cent. of trusts said that they screen all patients for MRSA, only 32 per cent. of trusts can provide any data on the number of patients screened, and not one trust collects data on whether patients are isolated following a positive MRSA screening result. None offered data on whether, if a patient was screened and found to be positive, they would as a matter of course be put in a single room or isolated. I am afraid that that rather accords with the findings of the Health Protection Agency, which were published by the Department just a couple of weeks ago, although not with a press release. The HPA said that nearly one third of trusts did not screen all patients, only 60 per cent. screened all previously MRSA-positive patients, and only 55 per cent. screened all patients from nursing homes, despite that being a high-risk factor. It is all very well to say that there should be screening of admissions, including emergency admissions, but that has been said before and it has not been done. We want to see results.</p>

In the past year, the Government have reduced the number of acute and general beds in the national health service by the largest proportion since 1982. We saw a reduction of 6,000 acute and general beds, which has taken us down to a figure of 127,000 such beds, when the NHS plan said that there would be a 2,000-bed increase to take us up to a figure of 135,000. There is a very big gap. Last year, <i> The Independent</i> said that the Department had conducted a review suggesting that reducing bed occupancy to a maximum of 85 per cent. would save 1,000 cases of MRSA a year. Apparently, according to speculation in the press, there are further factors that the Government know about, but which they have chosen not to publish. When the Secretary of State replies, perhaps he will tell us about some of those factors that the Department has found in its research.</p>

They are interrelated, and they require the Government to support investment in isolation facilities, as well as the policy change on screening. Screening requires more isolation facilities. It is no good having screening for admissions if there are insufficient isolation facilities available to back it up. Isolation requires more single rooms, and therefore more beds. It is no good the Government going down the road that they propose, if they are cutting beds at the same time, and if nurses do not have time to clean beds before patients are admitted.  <br>

Given the intense pressures, very limited access to additional staffing&#151;staffing numbers were going down&#151;and bed occupancy rates of 90 per cent. or more, they find it hard to take the fact that they are held responsible for the poor professional standards when the management were putting them under intolerable pressure. The report discloses serious failings at every level: on antibiotic prescribing, which we were talking about; on lack of training; on the failure to establish an isolation ward for four months; and on simply admitting the scale of the problem.

 I recall the occasion that my hon. Friend mentions, and also his Adjournment debate on the subject. The Government said nothing about C. difficile and, when we challenged them about what they would do, it was obvious that they had targeted MRSA and that C. difficile rates had risen because of lack of action on, for example, hand washing. They said that they did not believe that it was right to have a national target; a central target was wrong. They claimed that the targets had to be local because there was such local variation in C. difficile. Ten months later, the Secretary of State came to the House to say that central targets were essential.

For example, the rate of HCAIs is 9 per cent. in England, while rates vary between 6 and 10 per cent. in France and between 5 and 10 per cent. in the United States. The hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley) mentioned Holland, which has enjoyed good success in tackling MRSA, but its rate of health care-associated infections is 7 per cent., which is very close to the rate in the UK.</p>

MRSA is a bacterial infection that is resistant to commonly used antibiotics. It can infect surgical wounds and ulcers and, more seriously, can cause bloodstream infections. Clostridium difficile is a bacterium that naturally lives in the gut. Again, it particularly affects the elderly. When antibiotics kill off normal, healthy bacteria, the consequences can be severe, so antibiotic prescribing policies are even more important in controlling the disease.</p>

That is still too many, but it has to be seen in the context of a health service that deals with 1 million people every 36 hours. The Government have introduced a range of measures to improve cleanliness and tackle infections. In 2001, we became the first country in the world to introduce mandatory surveillance of MRSA. We built on that in 2004, with the introduction of C. difficile surveillance for those aged 65 and over, the most vulnerable group of patients. In 2005, we enhanced the surveillance system for MRSA and earlier this year we extended C. difficile surveillance to every patient over two years of age.</p>

High standards of cleanliness and hygiene are not just an important part of the drive to lower infections but a core part of what patients are entitled to expect from the NHS, day in and day out. In 2000, we introduced patient environment action teams, which assess annually every in-patient health care facility in England. The inspection covers hospital cleanliness, the quality of the environment, food and the issues of privacy and dignity. Thanks to the hard work of NHS staff, and to the priority that we have placed on this issue, hospital cleanliness has improved year on year since annual inspections first began more than seven years ago.</p>

We raised the bar for PEAT scores in 2007, and I am pleased that the NHS has risen to the challenge. Even with this higher standard, figures published today by the National Patient Safety Agency show that in 2007, 98 per cent. of hospitals were rated excellent, good or acceptable, up from 95 per cent. in 2006.</p>

The Health Act 2006 introduced a mandatory code of practice for the prevention and control of health care-associated infections. That came into force on 1 October 2006 and it requires NHS bodies to have management and clinical governance systems in place to deliver effective infection control. Compliance with the code is assessed by the Healthcare Commission, which is in the course of making 120 unannounced visits, mainly to acute trusts, to ensure compliance. We have also announced that from next year, health care-associated infection inspections by the Healthcare Commission will be undertaken annually by specialist teams.</p>

In July, we made an additional &#163;50 million available to directors of nursing and a further &#163;270 million will be made available by 2010-11 to support the drive to tackle infections. We are introducing MRSA screening for all patients&#151;starting with elective patients&#151;supported by &#163;130 million of comprehensive spending review investment. We have published new guidance on uniforms, so that all staff workwear leaves the arm bare below the elbow to assist with hand washing, which is crucial in countering such infections.</p>

 I want to ask about high bed occupancy rates. The West Hertfordshire primary care trust was languishing around the weak category and was rated only 17 above the trust that experienced the dreadful deaths, yet we have a 95 per cent. bed occupancy rate. Will the Secretary of State address the problem of those rates, which seem to be linked to these infections?</p>

 There is actually no correlation between high bed occupancy rates and levels of MRSA, as the hon. Lady well knows. The Sherwood Forest Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, for example, has a bed occupancy rate of 92 per cent., but it has cut the number of MRSA cases by well above the national average. As to the suggestion that we should set a national target for bed occupancy rates, I had thought that the Opposition were supposed to be against national targets. We have a bed occupancy rate of about 84 per cent. and we think that high levels of bed occupancy are wrong, but the real issue is how best to manage the beds, rather than providing simple statistics on bed occupancy.</p>

Milton Keynes hospital, which has an equally high rate, lacks any form of decanter area that would enable it to carry out a deep clean. What specific measures will the Secretary of State offer hospitals such as the one at Milton Keynes to enable them to carry out their deep cleans?</p>

 We are providing the funding to strategic health authorities and it is then a matter for them to oversee the process. Every trust has assured me that it will have completed its deep clean by the end of March. Many hospitals with high bed occupancy rates already have deep cleans. They usually find the capacity to carry them out around December or Christmas time. If Milton Keynes hospital has any specific problems, it should come and talk to us about them. Better still, it should talk to its SHA.</p>

 The Secretary of State is struggling for a good news story in all of this, so may I offer him one? It is the relatively low rate of health care-acquired infections in community hospitals.

 It is ironic that the hon. Gentleman should ask that question when he knows that we have put &#163;750 million aside to build new community hospitals.

 Will the Secretary of State respond to a recent piece in <i> The Lancet </i>which cast considerable doubt over the value of hospital deep cleans? I can see that there are all sorts of good reasons for doing that, but the question is whether it will have a significant effect on the management of C. difficile and MRSA.</p>

 The article in <i> The Lancet </i>would have been fine if that was all we were suggesting we should do. I have already mentioned a number of initiatives&#151;deep clean is one&#151;and I will mention a series of other measures. Of course, deep clean on its own will not solve the problem, but it is highly symbolic in that it gives patients the confidence that that is happening in their hospitals at least once a year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o282"><a name="71121-0016.htm_para5"><a name="07112177000044">In addition to the measures I have mentioned, we are increasing the number of matrons to 5,000&#151;to be in post by next spring. The hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire asked where that idea came from: one particular place it came from is his colleague, the right hon. Member for Maidstone and The Weald (Miss Widdecombe)&#151;whom I notice is present. When we discussed the Healthcare Commission report on Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells, she was powerfully vociferous, as only she can be, on the need for more matrons in our hospitals. Sometimes, populist measures are right&#151;and the public are absolutely right about the decline of matrons in the past. The right hon. Lady&#146;s point is important, because the public do see matrons in a certain light. Ward sisters do a tremendous job as well, but they also welcome the creation of more matron places because they see that as important for the job that they do.</p>

For that reason, I have declined to mention the rise of HCAIs under the previous Government. <i> [Interruption.]</i> Well, I did not dwell on it, and Conservative Members should not tempt me to do so, because an explosion in MRSA took place during the late 1980s and early 1990s.</p>

What the Secretary of State describes as a response to the report would strip away much of the emergency care in local A and E departments, which could be essential in the treatment of major trauma.</p>

 Time and again, the hon. Gentleman and his party talk about a moratorium on reconfigurations. That was their policy. That is what they were saying in the summer. They got their statistics wrong. They got the hospitals wrong. They got the areas and the geography wrong. The one thing that was clear and consistent was&#151;no change. They are fighting a political campaign based on the lowest common denominator: any change anywhere must be wrong. That is the view of the hon.

The NHS must take such infections very seriously.</p>

The increased throughput of patients to meet performance targets resulted in considerable pressure towards higher bed occupancy, which was not always consistent with good infection control and bed management practices. Higher bed occupancy meant that there was less time for thorough cleaning of beds and bed spaces between admissions of individual patients and a higher probability of transmission of infection between patients. Seventy-one per cent. of trusts were still operating in bed occupancy levels higher than the 82 per cent. that the Department of Health reported it hoped to achieve by 2003-04.&#148;</p>

 The evidence is overwhelming.

In 1996-97, overall bed occupancy was at 80.7 per cent, whereas it had reached 85.3 per cent. by 2006-07. That is the average, and the House must bear it in mind that many hospitals will be way above that level, as I have already said.</p>

 Bed occupancy rates and the management of beds are important, but we do not need top-down targets for them. Does the hon.

<p><a name="stpa_o308"><a name="71121-0017.htm_para13"><a name="07112177000093">The Secretary of State has to understand that Maidstone is not alone; those concerns apply across the NHS. Trusts often feel that they are bamboozled by targets. He has accepted in other contexts that an over-reliance on top-down targets sometimes has perverse effects. I am in a sense challenging him to concede that that is a factor in the problem, as the Healthcare Commission recognises. Does he accept what the commission says? If so, is he prepared to ensure that hospitals are given guidance stating that, although there are other priorities, this must be the top priority?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o309"><a name="71121-0017.htm_para14"><a name="07112177000094">The third issue that the Healthcare Commission deals with is the pressure of finances, which is a Government responsibility and leads, among other things, to cuts in nursing staff. The report says:</p>
<a name="71121-0017.htm_brev8"><a name="07112177001318"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Both trusts had undergone difficult mergers, were preoccupied with finances, and had a demanding agenda of reconfiguration and private finance initiative...

What concerns me is that, by targeting only reductions in MRSA, the former Secretary of State imposed what I regard as a political target of halving the MRSA rate by 2008, without paying any attention to C. difficile, which was increasing very rapidly. Again, the Healthcare Commission raises concern about that issue. Page 7 of its report says:</p>
<a name="71121-0017.htm_brev9"><a name="07112177001319"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Before the outbreak it only monitored the MRSA rate, as there was a national performance target in relation to MRSA, though not as regards <i> C. difficile</i>.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o317"><a name="71121-0017.htm_para22"><a name="07112177000102">The next issue is antibiotic prescribing.

I was surprised that the motion makes no reference to antibiotic prescribing. <i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> I know that the Conservative spokesman talked about it. The Government amendment also misses it out. The Healthcare Commission report says:</p>

The Health Protection Agency and Healthcare Commission report in 2006 said that 38 per cent. of trusts did not have restrictions in place to prevent inappropriate antibiotic use.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o319"><a name="71121-0017.htm_para24"><a name="07112177000104">The Government have issued new guidance on antibiotic use, but is it being monitored? Have trusts implemented the new guidance, and is it being applied effectively? It is clearly important that the prescriptive rules are applied. When I visited Hereford county hospital last week, I was told that a new policy on antibiotics had been introduced earlier this year and had had a dramatic effect.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o320"><a name="71121-0017.htm_para25"><a name="07112177000105">Beyond Maidstone, the Conservative spokesman referred to the importance of screening and he was right to question why it has taken so long to introduce it. The Government say that they will introduce it for non-emergency cases by next year and for emergency cases within the next three years. In Hereford, I was told that screening of emergency cases had been implemented earlier this year. If that hospital and a small percentage of others&#151;the Conservative spokesman referred to a survey he had undertaken&#151;can do it, why cannot all hospitals? Does it really need to take three years to implement screening for emergency cases across the country?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o321"><a name="71121-0017.htm_para26"><a name="07112177000106">I will conclude by setting out what we see as the priorities. First, I urge the Government to undertake a thorough, robust review of the impact of overcrowding in our hospitals. Overcrowding does not necessarily mean that a certain scenario will happen, but all the evidence indicates that there is a link, which needs to be addressed. The trends are in the wrong direction.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o322"><a name="71121-0017.htm_para27"><a name="07112177000107">Secondly, there needs to be zero tolerance of failures of infection control. We need to get the mindset right. If senior hospital managers have failed in their duties to control infection, that needs to be treated as gross misconduct&#151;it is that serious&#151;rather than their getting a pay-off and a comfortable early retirement. That principle needs to apply throughout the trust, from the most senior people to those working on the wards. There should be no pay-offs. I acknowledge that the Secretary of State indicated that himself.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o324"><a name="71121-0017.htm_para29"><a name="07112177000109">There has been discussion about the Dutch approach. I recognise that rates in the Netherlands are not much lower, but we ought to acknowledge its good practice and strict process to deal with outbreaks. The Secretary of State is right that that is possible only because of the space in Dutch hospitals, but that brings us back to the occupancy rate. There needs to be space for isolation, and to enable a hospital to have some slack in the system. He is right that historical underfunding in this country resulted in too much pressure on the system, but staff need to be sent home if they are infected.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o325"><a name="71121-0017.htm_para30"><a name="07112177000110">There need to be changing facilities for staff. Again, the Secretary of State is right: it may not be appropriate to impose such measures from above, but surely the Department of Health needs to say that all hospitals should, as a matter of best practice, have changing facilities for staff, so that they do not have to travel home on a bus in their uniform. We need monitoring of death certificates to ensure that it is common practice to record hospital-acquired infections when they are a contributory factor to death. The Healthcare Commission report found, in the sample from Maidstone that it considered, that in 20 per cent. of cases where C. difficile was not mentioned on the death certificate, it was a contributory factor. In other words, if we simply looked at death certificates, we would understate the scale of the problem. In many cases&#151;I have come across the issue as a constituency MP&#151;people who have died in hospital had C. difficile but there was no reference to it on the death certificate. We need common good practice on the issue, so that we can accurately assess the scale of the problem. The rules on antibiotic prescribing should be rigorously applied, too.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o326"><a name="71121-0017.htm_para31"><a name="07112177000111">Finally, it is important to give the patient the power and the right to raise concerns in hospital about failures in hygiene standards. There must be a mechanism through which the patient feels able to raise concerns in hospital without feeling that they will suffer in some way. I recognise that the Government have taken steps to address the issue of hospital-acquired infections, but the question is whether they are doing enough, and are doing the right things. Today, I have raised a series of issues that the Healthcare Commission highlighted, and that fall within the Government&#146;s responsibility. If the Government intend to criticise the trust&#151;and it is right that they should&#151;they must also acknowledge their role and what they can do to address the concerns that the commission raises. I think that we all agree that the issue has to be treated as a top priority, so that we can ensure that people are safe when they visit hospitals, care homes and nursing homes.</p>

 I prepared two speeches for this afternoon&#146;s debate. In one of them, I assumed that there had been a constructive contribution from the Opposition, which meant that we could have a serious debate about a problem that affects not just Britain but all of Europe, and a debate about how other countries are dealing with this serious issue. Sadly, the Opposition decided to play politics with people&#146;s lives. It is important to give them a bit of a history lesson on what they did on the issue when they were in power.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o327"><a name="71121-0018.htm_para0"><a name="07112177000115">I worked in the national health service from the early &#146;70s to the early &#146;80s. Those of us of a certain age can remember going into an NHS hospital where there was that smell of cleanliness. When a person who worked in the hospital left the ward and went straight to the pub or social to meet friends, people could tell that they had been in the hospital all day from the clean smell that prevailed. Let me tell hon. Members what happened on my ward. A domestic came on duty at half-past 7 in the morning and went off duty at 2 o&#146;clock. Another domestic came on duty at 4 o&#146;clock and went off duty at 8 o&#146;clock. Those individuals were part of the health care team. They were totally accountable to the ward sister or the charge nurse. In fact, they made a major contribution not just to the cleanliness but to the morale of the ward. For example, when they were going off on Saturday, they would take bookie lines into local bookmakers for patients. They made a significant contribution to patients&#146; well-being and care.</p>

 The Government claim, rightly, that there have been 250,000 extra staff in the NHS, of whom 107,000 have been administrators. How many have been cleaners? Does the hon. Gentleman understand that on wards at Maidstone at the time that the infections were occurring there was access to cleaning for two hours a day twice a day. That is all that was available.</p>

<p><a name="st_o435"><a name="07112177000124"><a name="71121-0018.htm_spnew8"><a name="07112177001421"><b>Mr. Devine:</b>
 That is outrageous. The hon. Gentleman is right. Let me explain the process. Whether the contracts were won by the private sector or in house, the cleaning hours fell by two thirds in most cases. The scenario that I painted at the start of one domestic coming on duty at 7.30 am and working till 2 and another working from 4 till 8 was replaced by an individual who worked in four, five or six wards, whether that was privatised or in house.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o329"><a name="71121-0018.htm_para2"><a name="07112177000125">Reference has been made to laundry services. Exactly the same scenario prevailed there. Working as a nurse, I had 12 uniforms. At any given time, four were in use, four were on the way to the laundry, and four were in the laundry. Again, after privatisation, that was cut down. In practice that meant that the majority of nurses started washing their uniforms themselves, adding to the difficulties. In some hospitals the turnover of staff was more than 100 per cent. There was no training for staff coming on duty. There were numerous stories of new people turning up in the morning and working on a ward an hour later.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o330"><a name="71121-0018.htm_para3"><a name="07112177000126">We must remember the politics of the time. The early 1980s was the start of the No Turning Back group, many of whom were advisers to private contractors. What did the Conservatives do? They said that there was no problem, yet in a debate in 1997, my hon. Friend the Member for Thurrock (Andrew Mackinlay) highlighted a report prepared by the Conservatives in 1990.

 May I first apologise for not having been here during most of the opening speeches? I had already told Mr. Speaker that I was coming from Market Harborough&#151;splendid place&#151;and was at the mercy of both trains and a passage across London in the rush hour.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o332"><a name="71121-0018.htm_para5"><a name="07112177000135">I am grateful for the opportunity to speak in this debate, particularly as my trust forms such a central part of the motion. I digress for just a couple of seconds to answer the gibe made by the hon. Member for Livingston (Mr. Devine). He said that because I had private health insurance, I was some sort of terrible public liability. I point out to him that every time that I pay full whack for my prescriptions I take a burden from the NHS. Although I am an OAP, I still pay full whack&#151;a bit more than the hon. Gentleman pays, and people benefit from it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o333"><a name="71121-0018.htm_para6"><a name="07112177000136">However, I digress; I shall pull myself back into order before you do, Madam Deputy Speaker. I turn to the main part of the motion. I make no apology for repeating what I said when I raised a question with the Under-Secretary of State for Health, the hon. Member for Brentford and Isleworth (Ann Keen), after the publication of the report into Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells NHS Trust. I have since had a meeting with her and I reiterated the point then.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o334"><a name="71121-0018.htm_para7"><a name="07112177000137">The crux of the matter relates to authority and accountability in the wards themselves. No matter how good the chief executive or matron, they are not on the ward all the time. They cannot be. Ward sister, however, is on one ward for an entire shift and therefore authority and accountability need to be vested in her. It is clear that that system has broken down in large parts of the NHS and in particular in my own trust. I do not wish to go over again the problems that my trust has faced, because the crucial thing now is that we look forward and try to put right what has gone wrong. We should address ourselves to the future, rather than always harp on about the past.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o335"><a name="71121-0018.htm_para8"><a name="07112177000138">Nevertheless, I have to say that, despite all the publicity around that report and all the local press and media coverage, I still got a letter from a constituent saying that she had recently visited a relative in hospital where a nurse had dropped a syringe on the floor, picked it up and gone to use it. The nurse was stopped&#151;this is the crucial point&#151;not by a ward sister but by an observant relative, who said, &#147;Hey, you can&#146;t use that.&#148; The role of a ward sister should be almost wholly supervisory. She should be going round the ward saying, &#147;Nurse, that drip is empty&#148;, &#147;Nurse, that patient has been ringing the bell&#148;, or &#147;No, nurse, you don&#146;t use that syringe&#151;you&#146;ve just dropped it on the floor.&#148; That is the ward sister&#146;s  <br>

job, together with issuing appropriate instruction of the nurses as to why not to use the syringe that has just fallen on the floor&#151;if such instruction should really be necessary.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o336"><a name="71121-0018.htm_para9"><a name="07112177000139">However, the ward sister does not do such things anymore, and there are three reasons for that. First, her role has become confused and she spends far too much time commissioning blankets and bandages instead of supervising the nurses. Secondly, she spends rather too much time filling in forms. If this Government do not get to grips with form-filling, targets and box-ticking, a lot of time will be diverted from the sharp end of patient care. The ward sister also nurses, because when there are nursing shortages she has no choice but to do so; and while she is nursing, however admirable that may be, she is not supervising others. Thirdly, there is an air of what I might describe as excessive egalitarianism whereby she no longer likes to boss. When I went to see the Minister, she told me rather endearingly how she used to be bossed tremendously, even to the extent that she was not allowed to plump up a pillow because it released germs into the air. Indeed, she told me that she never plumps up her pillows at home having learned that lesson so thoroughly. What a difference between that level of supervision and what we have today. We need the ward sister bossing, however nicely and politely, and taking control of the ward.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o337"><a name="71121-0018.htm_para10"><a name="07112177000140">Ward design has a major role to play, although I know that that cannot be put right by the middle of Tuesday afternoon. I have had one very positive experience of the NHS in recent years, when I took my mother into Royal London hospital under trauma procedures. The wards there were of the old Nightingale design, which meant that all the nurses could see all the patients all the time and all the patients could see all the nurses all the time. Nobody was ringing bells for people to appear round double corners, which is the layout of most modern wards. Given that the Government are boasting about how many hospitals they are building, perhaps before they build any more they might revisit the whole issue of ward design and how easy it is for nurses to be supervised in a situation where they can hardly ever be seen.</p>

 That must be right. We need to get right back to the sorts of situations that the Minister described to me, with meticulous attention paid to hygiene whether it relates to pillows or syringes, let alone telling a patient to &#147;go in the bed&#148;, which, as she will be aware, is what happened at Maidstone.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o338"><a name="71121-0018.htm_para11"><a name="07112177000143">I would like something terribly simple: an air of carbolic, as I described it to the Minister. I had some sympathy for the hon. Member for Livingston when he described the situation that used to prevail in hospitals, whereby one was immediately hit in the nostrils by the scents of disinfectant, carbolic, floor scrub and every other horror. Now, even hand-washing is a forgotten discipline. It would be helpful if very basic hygiene practices were restored.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o339"><a name="71121-0018.htm_para12"><a name="07112177000144">As a slight digression, I also think that we need to look at the NHS as a whole and ask whether what we have is going to last us to the end of the 21st century or  <br>

whether we need to carry out some serious restructuring. That does not mean the sort of piecemeal restructuring going on at the moment, which is afflicting my trust, where in order to have a trauma specialism at one hospital&#151;I have nothing against such a specialism&#151;people going in under accident and emergency procedures have to travel 17 miles on B roads before they may be attended to. Nor do we want, as also proposed under the reconfiguration, those using maternity services to have to travel down to Tunbridge Wells, so that anyone whose labour runs into difficulty at Maidstone will be taken there along 17 miles of B road. Tunbridge Wells is a splendid place, but no one wants to travel 17 miles by B road when they are in severe orthopaedic trauma, or in a complicated labour. Therefore, those sorts of reconfiguration are not the answer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o340"><a name="71121-0018.htm_para13"><a name="07112177000145">We need to consider the financing of the NHS, and whether those who can do so should be encouraged to take some of the costs on themselves. We need to face the fact that the state cannot do everything&#151;it does not. What, after all, would the hon. Member for Livingston say to those who were told to go blind in one eye before the other could be dealt with? The state cannot do everything, and it is time that it stopped pretending that it can. By pretending, it is running a three-tier NHS. At the top are those who get their NHS treatment or who choose to go private; at the next stage are those who cannot get their NHS treatment and can go private but do not want to do so; and at the third stage are those who do not get their NHS treatment, and could not go private if they starved themselves for a month. If we do not look at the whole picture of the NHS, we betray the most vulnerable in the population. </p>

 I come to this debate as someone who has actually cleaned hospitals in a previous job. I have cleaned up after patients who have been suffering from the conditions in question, and it is tough to do so, particularly when dealing with something like Clostridium difficile, and the sheer number of spores that are produced in the faeces of someone with diarrhoea as a result of C. difficile. They are produced in enormous numbers, and it is quite tough to clean all the surfaces involved to ensure that there is no transmission from the environment. I did that work many years ago, so the situation is not new. C. difficile has been with us for many decades, and it is only recently that there have been particular problems, which I shall come to later.</p>

 Given the time pressure, I will not. In this country strains 15 and 16 are the most prevalent, and those strains are the most resistant of all&#151;far more resistant than the ones prevalent in the Netherlands and Denmark. Those are the strains most prevalent in Japan, too, for example, and no one who has been to Japan and seen hospitals there would say that they had problems with their cleaning regimes and hygiene.

<p><a name="stpa_o342"><a name="71121-0018.htm_para15"><a name="07112177000152">Some 30 per cent. of us carry Staphylococcus aureus on our body: one third of the Members who will go into the Division Lobbies tonight carry it on their bodies. Some of us even carry resistant strains, but the majority of us are healthy individuals. Staphylococcus aureus acts opportunistically, and targets people with compromised immune systems who are vulnerable to it. Most of us will not be troubled by MRSA.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o343"><a name="71121-0018.htm_para16"><a name="07112177000153">We have to consider why Staphylococcus aureus has become a problem in this country. It is largely to do with the inappropriate prescribing of antibiotics in past decades. People were often given antibiotics almost like sweeties: if someone had a snuffle or a cold, they would be given antibiotics. It was quite wrong to give people antibiotics in those circumstances, as they killed off many of the less damaging strains of Staphylococcus aureus, so that the resistant strains came to the fore and became increasingly prevalent. We must therefore look at prescribing regimes, and hold back from prescribing so many antibiotics. That is as true for C. difficile as it is MRSA.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o344"><a name="71121-0018.htm_para17"><a name="07112177000154">The Northern Lincolnshire and Goole Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust is my local NHS trust. It is responsible for three hospitals, and it pioneered the cleanyourhands initiative. MRSA rates have continued to decline, and the trust&#146;s target is one case a month across all three hospitals. The trust has one of the lowest MRSA rates in the country, because it pioneered that initiative, but&#151;and this is a gripe I have with the Government&#151;it was told to reduce that rate by half. Given that it already has one of the lowest rates, the statistics become quirky. If we have two cases a month, one of which might be acquired in the community, not hospital, we will not reach our target. People will report the trust as a failing regime, but in fact the chances of acquiring MRSA in those hospitals is minimal.</p>

For example, they assume that everyone who is admitted is MRSA-positive unless proven otherwise. Everyone has to undergo an alcohol body wash to decolonise the body of MRSA, and the hospitals will soon progress to nasal decolonisation as well. The cleaning in those hospitals is in-house, and that is welcome. They are considering more innovative ways in which to deal with cleaning to reduce not so much MRSA but other infections.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o346"><a name="71121-0019.htm_para1"><a name="07112177000156">Let me consider C. difficile. Again, I pay tribute to Diana, Princess of Wales hospital, Goole hospital and Scunthorpe district general hospital. They are working hard on C. difficile and putting in place cleaning regimes to tackle the environmental contamination that can occur from the multitude of resistant spores that C. difficile produces. Their work is phenomenal.</p>

There are 100 types&#151;I think type 027 causes the problems that we are experiencing in the UK. It produces many toxins, which lead to fatalities. It is so resistant and produces so many spores that I am not sure whether we shall completely eradicate it. However, the work being done to reduce it is welcome. Again, we must stop prescribing so many strong broad-spectrum antibiotics, which destroy the good bacteria in the intestine, thus allowing the production of the toxins. That is a serious problem.</p>

However, I should like the Government to consider the statistical quirks, which show that one case per month across three hospitals is fine, but two cases mean the red zone. We must reconsider that. It was disheartening for staff to be told that they were in the red zone because there were two cases, as opposed to one, across three hospitals.</p>

He was then transferred to the Royal orthopaedic hospital, so I make no accusation about where he contracted MRSA. However, he contracted it. Six months on, he has been unable to work, go out properly or function normally. It has wrecked his life. Those things are affecting our constituents today. Another case is that of a lady whose daughter took her to King George hospital. Tragically, she lost her life through C. difficile. I will not go into more detail because the family has asked for formal investigations into the matter.</p>

My wife and I visited her. I used the alcohol scrub to wash my hands, but I noticed many visitors to the hospital not using it and not being asked to use it. That is not the fault of the nurses on duty, who are simply rushed off their feet and unable to do that. I blame the management and the powers that be, but I do so pragmatically&#151;I am not looking today to have a political go at anybody.

<p><a name="stpa_o354"><a name="71121-0019.htm_para9"><a name="07112177000168">It would be remiss of us to have a debate on what is seen by the general public as one of the biggest patient safety issues in the country and not put that debate in its proper context. We have had a chance today to raise some of the many issues associated with MRSA and C. difficile, but we should do so in a balanced way and look at the wider picture of problems with patient safety and of public concern about national health issues.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o355"><a name="71121-0019.htm_para10"><a name="07112177000169">That was touched on by the hon. Member for North Norfolk (Norman Lamb), who opened his speech by saying that we needed to see the issue in context. The hospital-acquired infections of MRSA and C. difficile are a matter of great concern, but they are as nothing compared with the problem of hospital-acquired venous thromboembolism. The hon. Member for Ilford, North (Mr. Scott) talked about the tragedy of his constituent going in for orthopaedic surgery and coming out with the dreadful infection of MRSA. However, believe it or not, his constituent was 25 times more likely to come out with a potentially fatal or debilitating venous thromboembolism, which could involve deep vein thrombosis, than he was to contract MRSA or C. difficile. According to the latest recorded figures, just over 2,000 NHS patients died after contracting MRSA. In the same period, as far as we know&#151;I ask the House to listen carefully to this figure&#151;25,000 patients a year died from hospital-acquired venous thromboembolism, yet we hear very little about it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o356"><a name="71121-0019.htm_para11"><a name="07112177000170">The hon. Member for Beverley and Holderness (Mr. Stuart) made the valid point that the difference between the two kinds of hospital-acquired conditions is that the figures for the deaths caused by the superbugs are collated accurately by the NHS, yet the number of deaths caused by hospital-acquired venous thromboembolism are not collated properly. So when we say that 25,000 people a year are dying unnecessarily from hospital-acquired venous thromboembolism, that is a great underestimate. That figure comes from the Health Committee&#146;s report in 2005, which, I am pleased to say, was accepted in full by the Government and the chief medical officer, but it is almost certainly a great underestimate of the exact figure. I refer the House to the seminal work of Dr. Ander Cohen of King&#146;s College hospital, one of the leading epidemiologists in the country. He suggests that the figure is at least double the one that I have just cited.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o357"><a name="71121-0019.htm_para12"><a name="07112177000171">These are huge numbers, so when we have a debate on hospital-acquired diseases and patient safety issues, for goodness&#146; sake let us look at them in context. The Government have rightly decided to spend &#163;270 million a year on tackling hospital-acquired infections such as MRSA, C. difficile and some of the new conditions that have recently been identified, yet they are spending less than &#163;30 million a year on the prevention of venous thromboembolism.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o358"><a name="71121-0019.htm_para13"><a name="07112177000172">It has been made clear from the start of this debate that tackling those superbugs is not a simple business. In fairness to the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley), he said that we needed to take a comprehensive approach. We need new research into medicines, a review of bed occupancy and more deep cleaning in our hospitals. Even if we had all those things, however, there would be no guarantee that they  <br>

would have the desired effect. As far as deep vein thrombosis is concerned, however, all that we need to do is to introduce mandatory risk assessments in all patients in the NHS, which is relatively easy compared with treating the superbugs. We know that that could save at least 15,000 lives a year and avoid the tragedy associated with this unnecessary loss of life.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o359"><a name="71121-0019.htm_para14"><a name="07112177000173">The chief medical officer, having been asked to report on this matter by the Government, recommended that we should produce mandatory risk assessments for all NHS hospitals, certainly in England. He made that announcement last April. Shortly afterwards, National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence guidelines were issued which contained the same recommendation for the risk assessment of patients using a relatively simple questionnaire, to enable doctors to work out what thromboprophylaxis&#151;preventive treatment&#151;could be applied. This devastating loss of life could be prevented at very low cost and, in some cases, at no cost at all. Those recommendations came out seven months ago, and we welcome the steps that the Government have taken.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o360"><a name="71121-0019.htm_para15"><a name="07112177000174">The all-party parliamentary group on thrombosis conducted a survey, starting in August, that was published this week. It surveyed 174 NHS hospitals and received a very good response. Eighty-one per cent. responded, and 99 per cent. of those hospitals said that they were aware of the chief medical officer&#146;s recommendations on dealing with this condition&#151;I stress that this is hospital-acquired; this is not DVT in the community&#151;and of the NICE guidelines, both of which recommended mandatory risk assessment. We do not want to decry&#151;indeed, we want to encourage&#151;such responses in future, but sadly, fewer than a third&#151;only 32 per cent.&#151;actually implemented risk assessments on all their patients, as recommended. We calculate that it is seven months since the recommendations and guidelines came out.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o361"><a name="71121-0019.htm_para16"><a name="07112177000175">Once again, I ask the House to listen carefully. We have heard figures on deaths from MRSA and C. difficile, but they are as nothing compared with the number of deaths from hospital-acquired deep vein thrombosis. We calculate that since April to today, approximately 11,000 patients have died. The all-party group on thrombosis and the excellent charity Lifeblood believe that those deaths were unnecessary and were relatively easily preventable. If we did something now, we could offset the cost of those who suffer this dreadful illness but survive&#151;usually after orthopaedic surgery and general medical treatment&#151;and re-present themselves to the NHS. No correlation is made with their presence in hospital, but the cost of those patients re-presenting themselves back to the NHS is &#163;640 million a year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o362"><a name="71121-0019.htm_para17"><a name="07112177000176">I welcome what the Government have done since the Health Committee report two years ago. They have moved quickly and comprehensively, but we cannot wait another 18 months for these mandatory risk assessments to come into our hospitals, which could mean thousands, if not tens of thousands, more patients&#151;especially in England, but in the whole of the UK&#151;dying from this condition.</p>

point about an issue that I had not appreciated before. However, I would argue that it is not a question of having one or the other; we need to save lives in respect of both.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o363"><a name="71121-0019.htm_para18"><a name="07112177000178">I shall speak mainly about C. difficile, as the hospital that most of my constituents have to attend has the worst rate of C. difficile in the country. I am pleased to see my hon. Friend the Member for Kettering (Mr. Hollobone) in his place, as I am talking about Kettering hospital. I know that my hon. Friend pays a great deal of attention to this matter.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o364"><a name="71121-0019.htm_para19"><a name="07112177000179">The likelihood of someone getting C. difficile in Kettering hospital is three times the national average. I hope to make constructive points tonight, as I refer to a particular constituency case, but there must be some reason why Kettering hospital has such a high rate. One thing that we know about our primary care trust is that it is the worst funded in the country. The national capitation formula shows that, this year, our PCT is &#163;38 million underfunded, as it has been for every one of the last four years&#151;so we are talking about substantially more than &#163;140 million. We know another important factor, which is that the hospital is very efficient, but that the capacity is never there. A bed is emptied and another patient goes in. We thus have underfunding, high capacity and the top rate for C. difficile. I do not want to make a party political point, but there does seem to be some correlation between the three. I do not believe that we could have the worst funded area, a highly efficient hospital and the highest rate of C. difficile without there being any sort of correlation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o365"><a name="71121-0019.htm_para20"><a name="07112177000180">I want to pay tribute to the staff of the NHS, particularly in my area. The doctors, nurses and ancillary staff are superb. They helped save my wife&#146;s life and I spent a lot of time in local hospitals seeing what happened. On the capacity problem, I recall my wife having a major cancer operation. She was lying in a hospital bed with drains; she had just come back from the theatre. The ward was full of course, and they cleaned it while she was there. They started to clean the bed and above it, and they sprinkled dust all over her, because they had no other opportunity to clean the ward. Lack of capacity is one of the problems we face. If there was more capacity in hospitals, and fewer targets, the situation would improve.</p>

I can understand that when Opposition politicians are jumping up and down and complaining, people in hospitals where there is concern about C. difficile are under pressure not to record the facts properly.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman raises such an important point that I should answer it at this stage. There is a duty on doctors to record the cause of death accurately on death certificates. The chief medical officer wrote to all doctors to remind them of the importance of giving full and accurate information on death certificates. MRSA or C. difficile infection will be cited on a death certificate if the certifying doctor considers it to have been the underlying cause of death.

 I pay tribute to my hon. Friend the Member for Wellingborough (Mr. Bone). His powerful speech went to the heart of an important problem, and I hope that the Minister will take it further into account.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o373"><a name="71121-0020.htm_para0"><a name="07112177000195">I agree with my right hon. Friend the Member for Maidstone and The Weald (Miss Widdecombe): the overwhelming mood in west Kent is that we must move on and rebuild confidence in our local NHS having learned the lessons. If we are to do that, we must not ignore lessons that are still to be learned from the report. Discussion about the headline measures to tackle infection control has continued, but in the brief time available to me I want to mention four contributions that we must continue to take into account in the weeks and months ahead.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o374"><a name="71121-0020.htm_para1"><a name="07112177000196">First, if any possible good could come out of the report, it is that it has concentrated Ministers&#146; minds on the need for a new hospital to serve the people of west Kent. The two hospitals in my constituency, the Kent and Sussex and the Pembury, must be two of the most decrepit in the country. Pembury hospital is a converted workhouse. The buildings that are not part of the workhouse are wooden huts. It is impossible to imagine patients and staff of a hospital elsewhere in the country suffering from such conditions in the 21st century. I welcome my right hon. Friend&#146;s support, and I hope that the sad opportunity that this report has given us to press the case for a new hospital will ensure that it is delivered after decades of waiting.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o375"><a name="71121-0020.htm_para2"><a name="07112177000197">Secondly, we need to go beyond the initial response on infection control and implement a zero-tolerance approach to hospital-acquired infections such as C. difficile. The national target of a 30 per cent. cut is fine as far as it goes, but we need to rebuild confidence to match the confidence that people on the continent and people using the private sector have in their hospitals. They fully expect to come out of hospital without having acquired an infection.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o376"><a name="71121-0020.htm_para3"><a name="07112177000198">Greater urgency is required. The excellent matron of Kent and Sussex hospital, Linda Summerfield, took me on a tour of the wards recently. They were spotless and their cleanliness could not be faulted; nevertheless we saw physically inadequate facilities. In an intervention earlier, I mentioned the lack of changing facilities. The Royal College of Nursing is clear: every nurse should be able to travel to work in their own clothes and change on site into a uniform that is laundered on site and guaranteed to be free of infection. That is impossible at Kent and Sussex hospital, because the changing facilities have space for only a dozen people at a time, in a trust that employs many hundreds. There is an urgent need to address such facilities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o377"><a name="71121-0020.htm_para4"><a name="07112177000199">Curtains are another factor. It is imperative that hospitals have disposable curtains, rather than tatty old curtains that attract the spores that contribute to C. difficile. When I put that point to the trust&#146;s chief executive, he told me that there were plans to replace the curtains over time, but that is not good enough. The situation is urgent, so if it is clear that disposable curtains will make a difference they should be used throughout the entire trust immediately. I am concerned about the lack of progress on that issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o378"><a name="71121-0020.htm_para5"><a name="07112177000200">We need to consider the adequacy of the management team that replaced the previous, inadequate team. We have a new, interim chief executive and I have no personal complaints about his authority or capability to manage the trust, but I am concerned about the fact that he is only part-time. He is also the chief executive of the Ashford and St. Peter&#146;s Hospitals NHS Trust in Surrey. The headline on the press release announcing his appointment was &#147;Glenn Douglas to split time equally between two organisations&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o379"><a name="71121-0020.htm_para6"><a name="07112177000201">A trust needing as much care and attention as ours requires a full-time chief executive. Of course, we require a skilled individual and I should be delighted if Mr. Douglas, with his skills, was appointed full-time as interim chief executive. He may be spending too little time at Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells although, to be fair, I do not think that is the case. However, we cannot engage in a smoke and mirrors exercise and pretend to people in Surrey that they have the full-time attention of their chief executive, given that hospital-acquired infections in his home trust increased by 88 per cent. over the past year. If there is one lesson we should learn from this whole episode it is that we cannot keep the public in the dark with nudges and winks about what is going on in the NHS. If the man is supposed to be running two trusts we need to know about it, and people in Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells need the same clear message as people in Surrey.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o380"><a name="71121-0020.htm_para7"><a name="07112177000202">Finally, as we reflect on the grossly inadequate supervision given by the failed management of the trust over the past few years, we can see that there is a general problem of accountability. I would be hard-pushed to say to whom any of the NHS institutions in my area&#151;the  <br>

strategic health authority, the Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells NHS Trust or the West Kent PCT&#151;are accountable. If I ask questions of the Health Secretary about local issues he will say it is a matter for the local trusts, but I have no direct means of holding them to account, other than, occasionally, to embarrass them publicly, which is a crude mechanism. I hope that we will reflect on the lessons and design in the appointment of new non-executive directors, not just in our own trusts, but more widely across the NHS, a more genuine means to hold NHS managers to account.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o381"><a name="71121-0020.htm_para8"><a name="07112177000203">We should make it clear to non-executive chairmen that they have a duty to the public. That applies to George Jenkins, the interim chairman of Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells trust, and every non-executive chairman of NHS bodies throughout the country. Their role is not always and everywhere to defend management. In the absence of anyone else&#151;although that absence is a fault of the system&#151;their responsibility is to represent our constituents and take management to task when necessary. The Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells non-executive directors and chairman failed abjectly in that responsibility. I look to the new chairman of our trust, and the new non-executive directors to be appointed, to exercise that role.</p>

 Of all the reports that hon.

I have no doubt that the sense of betrayal among local people is immense. The success of the NHS is largely down to the confidence and trust that people have in the organisation and its staff. There is no doubt that the majority of NHS staff continue to work to achieve exactly that end. The rise in health care-acquired infections has seen the loss of that trust, a loss of confidence and an increasing sense that NHS staff are no longer in control of their own decision making. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o390"><a name="71121-0020.htm_para17"><a name="07112177000215">A Healthcare Commission report was published in July in response to requests from the chief medical officer for ways to reduce infection rates. It stated:</p>
<a name="71121-0020.htm_brev0"><a name="07112177001333"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;We found evidence that a significant number of trusts were also experiencing difficulties in reconciling the management of&#148;</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o392"><a name="71121-0020.htm_para19"><a name="07112177000217">It would be awfully welcome if the Secretary of State listened to this bit, as it is the one that I do not think that he entirely understands. He needs to grasp the difference between targets and outcomes. He does not support outcome-driven activity, but he does support process-driven targets. For exactly the reasons cited in the Healthcare Commission report to which I have referred, he needs to pay attention because, if he continues with his obsession with targets, we will not see any improvements.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o393"><a name="71121-0020.htm_para20"><a name="07112177000218">The report found that 45 per cent. of trusts were experiencing difficulties with accident and emergency targets. In addition, 29 per cent. of trusts told the commission about difficulties with waiting times and lists for the treatment of in-patients, while 36 per cent. reported that they had experienced difficulties reconciling the management of health care-acquired infections and cleanliness with the fulfilment of financial targets. The Secretary of State continues to deny that evidence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o394"><a name="71121-0020.htm_para21"><a name="07112177000219">Moreover, the report found that 46 per cent. of trusts do not have a programme to check the cleaning of beds and the spaces around them. Only 48 per cent. of trusts report all health care-acquired infections, and 19 per cent. report none. Another 26 per cent. report less than half of such infections, and 62 per cent. do not audit readmission to hospital of people suffering from them. The report is truly damning about what is going on.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o395"><a name="71121-0020.htm_para22"><a name="07112177000220">Until the Secretary of State starts to listen, and to accept the causes and consequences of health care-acquired infections, rates will continue to rise. Protesting about the progress that has been made while denying the figures and causes will not get anywhere. The right hon. Gentleman asked that this debate be non-party political, but he must accept the facts. The problems are to do with bed-occupancy rates, targets, competing priorities, antibiotic prescribing habits, the number of nurses on wards and the number of hand basins available per bed. They are also to do with our built structure, and with training, monitoring, audit and the need to change practices on the basis of that audit.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o396"><a name="71121-0020.htm_para23"><a name="07112177000221">The Secretary of State maintains that infection rates here are similar to those in the rest of Europe, but I doubt that that is any comfort to the relatives of the 90 patients who died in west Kent. We must adopt a ward-to-board approach, but hospital boards must be able to make decisions on the basis of clinical need, not of Government targets. That means that some targets must be let slip sometimes, but a culture in which senior managers do not listen to what is happening at ward level because they fear not meeting Government targets and thus getting sacked will mean that what happened at the Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells NHS Trust will occur again.</p>

Member for Tunbridge Wells (Greg Clark) mentioned that money should be made available for changes in design and, very importantly, for patient safety. I remain concerned that money is being mentioned, because the money is available for such things to take place, and I am happy to investigate that further.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o404"><a name="71121-0020.htm_para31"><a name="07112177000232">In relation to the uniform guidance&#151;an issue that was raised by the Opposition Front-Bench spokesman&#151;it is recognised good practice for staff to change at work before going home. There is no evidence of a risk of infection, but there is evidence of an effect on patient confidence, which is of course important.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o405"><a name="71121-0020.htm_para32"><a name="07112177000233">We must remember that the latest figures from the Health Protection Agency show that we are heading in the right direction in tackling infection. I am looking forward to seeing how best we can demonstrate the effects in further reducing health care-associated infections. The further investment highlighted by the Secretary of State in his opening speech will cover further measures such as screening for MRSA for elective patients. It will also ensure that every acute trust has undergone a deep clean by 31 March next year. I hope that Members on the Opposition Front Bench will note that that is not a gimmick; it is a reality. It will happen by 31 March next year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o406"><a name="71121-0020.htm_para33"><a name="07112177000234">The private sector, in the main, undertakes elective surgery, which is very different from the work that our NHS does. The Health and Social Care Bill, introduced last week, will establish a new regulator. I urge hon. Members to vote to support the new tough powers that will allow that regulator to investigate and intervene on issues such as health care-associated infection.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o407"><a name="71121-0020.htm_para34"><a name="07112177000235">The issues of targets and bed occupancy have been raised. Patients have a right to clean and safe treatment, regardless of where in the NHS they are treated. I am very clear that if trusts fail to deliver that, senior managers and trust boards will be held accountable. As has been said, that will go right down the line from the ward to the board. There are no excuses. The management of complex systems, such as health organisations, requires the balancing of many different priorities.</p>

Health care-associated infections are a challenge, not just for hospitals in the UK, but worldwide. However, as the Secretary of State and I have explained, the NHS is demonstrating that it is up to the challenge. That is nowhere more the case than in Wolverhampton, where leadership was provided not only by the director of nursing, Cheryl Etches, but by the chief executive, David Loughton, who reversed the most serious MRSA and clostridium difficile infections. They received the Secretary of State&#146;s award and the <i> Health Service Journal </i>award on Monday. We can praise&#151;</p>

 Since the Minister says that she and other Ministers were shocked, and that she is going to hold managers accountable, will she tell the House when she first saw the Healthcare Commission&#146;s report&#151;the Secretary of State said he saw it on 9 October&#151;and what action she took?</p>

 Our service men and women are the bravest and the best in the world, and we are rightly proud of them, particularly those who serve in the most difficult places in Iraq and Afghanistan. We must adopt policies that will ensure that we provide them with the correct equipment while they are serving out there, and provide them with a better deal when they return to this country. It is with that in mind that my constituents, led by David Cain of Canvey Island, prepared the petition, which states:</p>

 I am very glad to have succeeded in obtaining this Adjournment debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o424"><a name="71121-0022.htm_para8"><a name="07112177001262">Northern Ireland has made some progress in recent times, and we can see advantages of devolution in proper scrutiny, accountability and local decision making. Instead of killing the police, mainstream republicans have signed up to public support for the Police Service of Northern Ireland. Those are steps forward towards a final destination, but other issues still need to be tackled. We need a new beginning to parading. Victims and survivors of the troubles must be kept to the fore, not just in funding but on a settled, strategic basis. Equality issues cry out for reform. In time, we must move on to a more normal system of government, and it is vital that the IRA&#146;s so-called army council be stood down.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o425"><a name="71121-0022.htm_para9"><a name="07112177001263">There are also serious issues surrounding the activities of dissident republican paramilitary organisations. Northern Ireland recently witnessed a stark and brutal reminder of our darker past. I know that I speak for all hon. Members when I condemn such attacks without hesitation. We all wish the police officers a speedy recovery, and wish, too, for speedy arrests, trials and convictions. That process would be greatly aided if, alongside words of condemnation, senior republicans, out of a sense of civic duty, passed on everything they knew about such people to the PSNI.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o426"><a name="71121-0022.htm_para10"><a name="07112177001264">We must also tackle the continuing problem of loyalist paramilitary organisations. Yes, the recent announcement was a step that takes things a bit further along. However, more remains to be done to deal with weapons and to call time on all forms of criminal activity. We are debating policing this evening, and everything that ties up necessary police resources contributes to making society less safe and people less secure. That goes for loyalist as well as republican communities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o427"><a name="71121-0022.htm_para11"><a name="07112177001265">The current position of mainstream republicans also requires attention. The recent murder of Paul Quinn brought that to the fore once again. If it emerges that the IRA sanctioned that cowardly murder, will the Government take the view, as they did in the past, that democrats should be punished with the guilty, and say that we must continue to sit alongside them in an Executive? Would the Government then seriously propose devolving policing powers in such a setting? Have the Government genuinely learned so little? Is that what they expect&#151;or perhaps what they expect of Northern Ireland politicians? Is that what they would call on the people of Northern Ireland to accept? If the Government are serious about devolution in Northern Ireland and about ever devolving policing and justice powers to Northern Ireland, they will display that seriousness now, or else they will show that they have not learned the lessons of recent years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o428"><a name="71121-0022.htm_para12"><a name="07112177001266">We must also consider how we can best assist the police in performing their duties. Northern Ireland needs a police college, and work needs to commence urgently. The Northern Ireland Office has been stalling over police community support officers. When will proper funding be forthcoming? That needs to be tackled, and  <br>

I urge the Minister to inform us exactly when the necessary steps will be taken and confirm that recruitment of police community support officers will definitely commence in April 2008.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o429"><a name="71121-0022.htm_para13"><a name="07112177001267">We must also consider the way in which we deal with past crimes. There is a continuing denial by many of their past. That is especially true of the republican movement. There is huge denial by republicans about what they call collusion. On 30 July, Gerry Adams said:</p>

If the British state used former republicans to do its killing for it then the victims of that policy have the right to truth also.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o432"><a name="71121-0022.htm_para16"><a name="07112177001270">Mr. Adams is in the state of denial that has come to characterise Irish republicanism.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o433"><a name="71121-0022.htm_para17"><a name="07112177001271">I now come to a more personal part of my speech, which is about a relative. On 1 May 1979, ex-Reserve Constable Frederick&#151;or, as he was affectionately known, Eric&#151;Lutton was murdered by the IRA outside a National Trust attraction in the village of Moy, in County Armagh. A police radio alert called officers who were on patrol in the area. It told them that a shooting had occurred and that a Renault car had been used as the getaway vehicle. Those officers arrived at the scene as Mr. Lutton was being placed inside the ambulance. They set up a vehicle checkpoint five miles from the incident, at which they stopped a cattle lorry coming from the direction of the shooting.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o434"><a name="71121-0022.htm_para18"><a name="07112177001272">Inside that lorry were two brothers, well known smugglers with deep republican connections. The names of those two brothers have been forwarded to the historical inquiries team. As the police questioned the driver, one of the officers looked in the back of the truck. Inside was a Renault car matching the description of the getaway vehicle. The brothers were questioned about that and offered no credible explanation. Both were arrested under section 14 of the prevention of terrorism Act, &#147;on suspicion of being involved in terrorist activity&#148;. The two brothers were separated. One took the truck with a police escort to Gough barracks in Armagh, which we all know, and the other was taken in a police vehicle.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o435"><a name="71121-0022.htm_para19"><a name="07112177001273">That happened within 30 minutes of the shooting and less than five miles from where it took place. Yet today no record is to be found with the police of those two brothers or their arrest. Did they enjoy protection or immunity from prosecution? It has long been asserted by police officers that that was the case, and that another well-placed officer who was a relative of the two helped, as it were, to &#147;get it fixed&#148; for them. Tonight we have to ask: was that the case?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o436"><a name="71121-0022.htm_para20"><a name="07112177001274">As the ambulance carrying Mr. Lutton approached the hospital, a local cleric stopped his car in the middle of the road, blocking its path. He was made to move  <br>

his car and Mr. Lutton was admitted to hospital, where he died. Why were no charges ever brought against that individual? We do not know whether Eric would have survived&#151;probably not&#151;but impeding the medical assistance of a gravely wounded police officer not only was immoral, but helped to ensure that he would never provide any testimony about who was responsible.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o437"><a name="71121-0022.htm_para21"><a name="07112177001275">While at the family home, investigating officers discussed the case in front of Mr. Lutton&#146;s wife and family. They identified one Mr. Francie Molloy as a live suspect in the killing. They discussed the need to pursue a thorough investigation of Mr. Molloy. To a man, the investigating officers agreed that that was a vital line of inquiry. All that was discussed openly, in front of Mr. Lutton&#146;s wife and family. Molloy was well known to the police, yet none of this was ever fully investigated. Why was he not properly investigated?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o438"><a name="71121-0022.htm_para22"><a name="07112177001276">As well as being a suspect in the Lutton case and known to the police, Francie Molloy was well known&#151;this information comes from the police&#151;for a series of sexual indiscretions. That was to rebound on Francie Molloy. He was caught by the security forces in a compromising position. As a result, he was recruited as an informer for the police. He would make regular contact with a handler at a public phone box near a road haulage company in town called Tamnamore, in County Tyrone. During the years that followed, Molloy passed on information to the police in Northern Ireland. That helped them to break open the IRA&#146;s notorious east Tyrone brigade. Prior to Molloy&#146;s recruitment, the east Tyrone brigade had been virtually impregnable. After it, the brigade suffered setbacks, taking direct hits and losing personnel.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o439"><a name="71121-0022.htm_para23"><a name="07112177001277">Any right-thinking person would wish to welcome the fact that the police in Northern Ireland were able to run agents against the IRA and to compromise it. But during that time, even though Molloy was an informer, it is also true that innocent people were attacked, injured and murdered, and he said or did nothing to prevent that. He was less than a willing informer. While he gave over enough information to help to compromise the IRA in east Tyrone, the question still lingers as to whether he gave everything he knew. How many of Molloy&#146;s neighbours lived under threat? How many were forced out of their homes, attacked, injured, killed or bereaved while he did nothing? Any good that he might have done by acting as an informer against the IRA, and by helping to compromise the east Tyrone brigade, was more than cancelled out by his callous disregard for the lives of his neighbours.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o440"><a name="71121-0022.htm_para24"><a name="07112177001278">Today, Francie Molloy is Deputy Speaker of the Northern Ireland Assembly. He is also the Sinn Fein spokesman on victims. If ever anyone was wholly unsuitable for such a position, it is Francie Molloy. Gerry Adams has said that the truth behind republican informers&#151;or touts, as they are called in Northern Ireland&#151;ought to be told. However, he has described all such people as former republicans. How can this particular tout be a former republican when remains a Sinn Fein MLA and his party&#146;s spokesman? How can he be a former republican when he is Sinn Fein&#146;s nominee for the position of Deputy Speaker in the Assembly? The denial that runs right to the very top of Sinn Fein is still very evident.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o441"><a name="71121-0022.htm_para25"><a name="07112177001279">I have been criticised by some for doing what I am doing here tonight. I want to make it perfectly clear that I am taking this step in order to ensure that a story that  <br>

needs to be told will be told. The police in Northern Ireland infiltrated the republican movement, and they were helped by agents such as Francie Molloy and others yet to be exposed, whose activities weakened it from within. That the security forces would run agents was only to be expected, and that those agents would be people like Molloy who were usable in that way was predictable. However, the fact that someone such as Molloy chose to allow innocent people to die is reprehensible, and that is why he deserves to be exposed here tonight. I make no apology for doing that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o442"><a name="71121-0022.htm_para26"><a name="07112177001280">There is a clear need to deal with the past in Northern Ireland, and in particular, with the policing of the past. I&#151;and many, if not all, Members of the House&#151;have the highest regard for the brave officers who protected the people from those who were intent on their murder. Today, however, there are many unsolved cases, grieving homes and vacant chairs. Many people do not even know the story of how their loved ones were cut down. We must give that to them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o443"><a name="71121-0022.htm_para27"><a name="07112177001281">When I compare the money thrown at inquiries with the relatively small amount of funding that has been granted to the historical inquiries team, I have to ask whether the money could not have been better spent. We now also have Eames-Bradley consultative group. That group must not be used as a replacement for our competitor against the historical inquiries team. It is also important that there be no simple, one-size-fits-all attempt at a solution. Rather, there must be an approach that allows for individual grief to find expression&#151;and, we hope, eventually some comfort.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o444"><a name="71121-0022.htm_para28"><a name="07112177001282">The past in Northern Ireland still cries out for its pain. The Bible contains this lament in verse 11 of chapter 8 of the book of Jeremiah:</p>

 I begin by congratulating the hon. Member for Upper Bann (David Simpson) on raising the issue of Northern Ireland policing in tonight&#146;s Adjournment debate. I know that he follows this issue very closely, not least because he is a member of the Policing Board. I hope that he will understand why it is not possible for me to comment on the detailed allegations and statements that he made, particularly in the latter part of his speech, in respect of the murder of Frederick Lutton&#151;or Eric to the hon. Gentleman, as he was a close relative. I will say, however, that Mr. Lutton, as a reservist RUC officer, was playing an important role in trying to keep the peace and maintain law and order at that time. He was one of the 3,368 innocent people who&#151;needlessly and often in a very violent way&#151;lost their lives during the troubles.</p>

a full investigation or move to what is called the resolution of the particular case. That entails sharing as much information as possible with the family so that, as far as possible, the situation is explained and the family can somehow come to terms with its tragic loss. Let me assure the hon. Gentleman that there will be no interference in that process by any external force. It is a policing matter and a matter for the historical inquiries team, which conducts its inquiries as it sees fit. It is perfectly independent and free so to do.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o447"><a name="71121-0023.htm_para1"><a name="07112177001286">When we talk about policing in modern times in Northern Ireland as being a very positive influence on society, we in no way seek to detract from or criticise those who policed Northern Ireland in the past. It is very important to say that. Officers often had to deal with very difficult, almost impossibly challenging circumstances; we owe them a debt and pay due respect to them. It was important, however, for policing to move on as well.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o448"><a name="71121-0023.htm_para2"><a name="07112177001287">At the international policing conference held in Belfast in February, senior police officers from around the world attended to hear about developments in Northern Ireland and it became clear that Northern Ireland policing now sets a standard for policing around the world that others seek to follow. I certainly pay tribute to the Chief Constable, Sir Hugh Orde, and his senior team, who have provided great leadership to the Policing Board under the chairmanship of Sir Desmond Rea. As I have already mentioned, the hon. Gentleman is a member of the Policing Board, which has helped to guide and shape policing in Northern Ireland and to hold policing to account.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o449"><a name="71121-0023.htm_para3"><a name="07112177001288">There is also the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland, a position held until recently by Nuala O&#146;Loan. She often showed great courage and held the position with distinction. She is now succeeded by Al Hutchinson, who I am sure will continue to carry out the responsibilities in a similarly effective way. District policing partnerships are also important. Those two roles&#151;the ombudsman and the district policing partnerships&#151;provide additional scrutiny to policing in Northern Ireland, which is very welcome.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o450"><a name="71121-0023.htm_para4"><a name="07112177001289">The change has been accompanied by a growing confidence in policing. According to figures confirmed just this week, there is now 78 per cent. confidence in policing in Northern Ireland, which is tremendously encouraging when we look across the community there and think of where we have come from. There are a number of reasons for that. First and foremost, the Police Service of Northern Ireland is helping to bring crime down. I am able to say that 2,000 fewer crimes were committed last year than in the previous year and since 2002-03 there has been a 15 per cent. fall in crime. I am also pleased that the Policing Board has in setting priorities for reducing burglary and vehicle crime seen its ambitions fulfilled&#151;there have been large reductions in those areas.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o451"><a name="71121-0023.htm_para5"><a name="07112177001290">The PSNI has become more representative of the communities it serves. That more needed to be done to encourage people from the Catholic community to enter the police service was a key Patten recommendation. He reported at the time that only 8 per cent. of the PSNI was Catholic. There is now 23 per cent. Catholic representation and that is on the way to being 30 per cent. by 2010-11. A police service more representative of the community it serves will generate greater confidence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o452"><a name="71121-0023.htm_para6"><a name="07112177001291">There is also the historic decision taken by Sinn Fein earlier this year to support policing and the rule of law, enabling it to encourage people from the communities it represents to report crime, but also crucially to take their place on the Policing Board and district policing partnerships. Their support for policing has been fundamental and has underpinned the devolution settlement in Northern Ireland.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o453"><a name="71121-0023.htm_para7"><a name="07112177001292">A fourth reason for growing confidence in policing is the model, or style, of policing in Northern Ireland. In the past there has had to be a more remote, security-style of policing, but now we are able to move to neighbourhood policing&#151;to community policing and policing with the community&#151;which will always engender a greater degree of confidence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o454"><a name="71121-0023.htm_para8"><a name="07112177001293">Effective policing in Northern Ireland requires adequate resources and I am confident that, following the comprehensive spending review settlement, we will be able to provide the necessary financial support to make sure that Northern Ireland continues to be properly policed. At present, there are 7,500 regular police officers in Northern Ireland, and we understand why that figure is rather higher proportionally than in England and Wales. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State made it clear in last week&#146;s Northern Ireland questions that that level of investment in policing must continue to be justified, but we still face considerable risks and threats. As the Gentleman alluded to, the attacks in recent days on officers Doherty and Musgrave confirm the threat that still remains from dissident republicans. It is encouraging that all political leaders in Northern Ireland immediately, clearly and unequivocally condemned the attacks on those two officers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o455"><a name="71121-0023.htm_para9"><a name="07112177001294">What is now needed is for people deep within the communities to step forward, to stand shoulder to shoulder with their police officers and to make sure that those responsible are brought to justice. It is important that statements are made, evidence is given and the right thing is done so that the people responsible are put behind bars where they belong. I am pleased to report that when I visited the police at Dungannon last Tuesday afternoon in the wake of the shooting of the second officer, I found officers who were upbeat and confident and who remained absolutely determined to serve their community and to make sure that the right thing is done and that justice prevails.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o456"><a name="71121-0023.htm_para10"><a name="07112177001295">I, of course, join the hon. Gentleman in condemning absolutely the brutal murder of Paul Quinn some weeks ago. That matter is subject to police investigation, which will continue to be led by the Garda Siochana because the murder took place in the Republic. It will report in due course, as will the Independent Monitoring Commission. I know that the hon. Gentleman will pay particular attention to comments from both those sources.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o457"><a name="71121-0023.htm_para11"><a name="07112177001296">As the hon. Gentleman said, May 2007 was a significant time in Northern Ireland, and I was pleased to hear him extol the benefits of devolution. He is entirely right that having both this degree of scrutiny and political leadership in action at the local level&#151;led, of course, by his colleague the right hon. Member for North Antrim (Rev. Ian Paisley), who is sitting with him this evening&#151;is a huge step forward in terms of democracy and governance in Northern Ireland. It is good that local Ministers are now running the schools, the hospitals and all the important public services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o459"><a name="71121-0023.htm_para13"><a name="07112177001298">The hon. Gentleman will know the legislative procedure that we now adopt. The Assembly will make a report to the Secretary of State about the degree of readiness for the devolution of policing and justice powers in March next year. The key moment will come when the parties, together, want that devolution and the Assembly formally requests it. In the meantime, I assure him, his colleagues and all politicians in Northern Ireland that the Secretary of State and I will continue to work in partnership with the devolved Ministers to ensure that the people of Northern Ireland are properly protected.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o460"><a name="71121-0023.htm_para14"><a name="07112177001299">The hon. Gentleman mentioned several other issues, including parading. It is important that the peaceful parading of the past two years continues. That is why we established a review under the chairmanship of Lord Ashdown to see whether a consensus could be formed about how to ensure that parading continues in Northern Ireland in a sustainable and peaceful way, without the disruption and destruction that often occurred in the past.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o461"><a name="71121-0023.htm_para15"><a name="07112177001300">The hon. Gentleman asked about progress on the police college. I assure him that we are determined to see the police college delivered. More than that, we want an integrated college that will also train firefighters and prison officers. A project board is in place, and we are determined to ensure that that project is delivered. He also asked about police community support officers. As he knows, we have taken powers in this House to ensure that PCSOs can operate in Northern Ireland. I know from recent discussions that the Policing Board and the Chief Constable remain committed to that. An implementation date for the arrival of the first PCSOs has yet to be finally determined by the Chief Constable, but I am sure that he will take that decision in due course.</p>
