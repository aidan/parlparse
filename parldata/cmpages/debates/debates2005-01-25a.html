 May I first pass on the Foreign Secretary&#039;s apologies for not being here today, as he is in Washington? I know that he has passed those on to you, Mr. Speaker, to the shadow Foreign Secretary and to the hon.

<a name="stpa_o0">The Foreign Secretary has had recent discussions with a number of European colleagues on recent events in Israel and the occupied territories, and will hold further talks at the General Affairs and External Relations Council on 31&nbsp;January.

<p><a name="st_o1"><a name="50125-01_spnew0"><b> Angela Watkinson: </b> 
 The recent election of Abu Mazen in Palestine and the willingness of Israel to co-operate give us the best opportunity that we have had for a long time to break the dreadful cycle of suicide attacks and reprisals. May I urge the Minister to redouble his discussions with the European Union to take best advantage of the situation, so that we can make progress before any more atrocities take place and that good will is lost?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o2"><a name="50125-01_spnew1"><b> Mr. Rammell: </b> 
 I wholly agree with the hon. Lady that we have a real opportunity. There is still too much death and hardship on both sides, but the election with a strong majority of Mr. Abu Mazen, who has a clear and unambiguous commitment against violence, is a positive step forward. We are looking forward to his visit here on 1&nbsp;March so that we can show our political support for reform in the Palestinian Authority and take the process forward.

 (Lab): In 2004&nbsp;alone, 232&nbsp;Qassam rockets were fired from the Gaza strip into Israel, and there were 18&nbsp;such attacks in the first two weeks of this year. Given Abu Mazen&#039;s recent welcome announcement on cracking down on terrorism in the Gaza strip, what help and assistance can the EU give to increase the security capacity of the Palestinian Authority, with specific reference to stopping the rockets being smuggled into Gaza through Egypt in the first place?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o4"><a name="50125-01_spnew3"><b> Mr. Rammell: </b> 
 My hon. Friend highlights a key concern. It is critical that the Palestinian Authority make it abundantly clear that it will step up its security efforts to tackle the challenge. We are doing everything that we can through aid and training to bolster and support the Palestinian Authority. A real effort in tackling terrorism at the same time as the Israeli Government are making efforts to ensure that they act proportionately and with due regard for civilian life, although we recognise their right to defend themselves, provide us with the best opportunity to move forward.

 (Con): Does the hon. Gentleman recall that much equipment sent by the European Union over the past two or three years has been destroyed during incursions by Israelis into the west bank, for whatever reason? That has included computer, air traffic control and hospital equipment. Has he held discussions with his European counterparts about replacing that equipment, and if so, when does he expect replacements to be delivered?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o6"><a name="50125-01_spnew5"><b> Mr. Rammell: </b> 
 The contributions that both we and the European Union are making to bolster the security effort of the Palestinian Authority are ongoing, and we maintain that commitment. I appreciate what the hon. Gentleman says, and such actions have been regrettable. Nevertheless, there are still significant resources in the Palestinian Authority, especially manpower, and it is crucial for it to use that, with our support, to tackle terrorism and beef up its security efforts.

 We have consistently urged all neighbours in the region to desist from supporting terrorist attacks, and we will continue to make that abundantly clear. Both sides must make a real effort to tackle terrorism. The statements made thus far by Mr. Abu Mazen present a real opportunity, so it is crucial to take that forward.

 I represented the United Kingdom at the inauguration of President Yushchenko in Kiev last Sunday and had talks with senior officials who are expected to take up ministerial posts. I expressed our Government&#039;s support for the ambitious programme of President Yushchenko to develop Ukraine as a European democratic market economy under the rule of law.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o10"><a name="50125-01_spnew8"><b> Mr. Lazarowicz: </b> 
 A Vice-President of the European Commission was reported yesterday as saying that the idea of Ukraine&#039;s future membership of the EU was &quot;realistic&quot;. Does my hon. Friend agree with that assessment?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o11"><a name="50125-01_spnew9"><b> Mr. MacShane: </b> 
 In broad terms&#151;but let me quote President Yushchenko himself. In his policy statement, &quot;The European choice for Ukraine&quot;, he said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_o0">&quot;We are realists: Ukraine&#039;s membership in the EU is not a question for today.&quot;</p>

<p>
<a name="50125-01_para1">
<a name="stpa_o1">Yesterday, Javier Solana published an ambitious 10-point programme on how the EU can help Ukraine. I welcome the fact that Ukraine has chosen to direct its future towards Europe and developing European norms of a market economy, the rule of law, respect for human rights and cleaning up corruption. I only wish that more Members of this House were as enthusiastic about the EU.

 (Con): Of course Ukraine&#039;s membership of the EU is not a matter for today, for tomorrow or for next year. Does the Minister recognise that Ukraine has been through an incredibly fraught period since the end of the Soviet Union? Now, it has made the difficult decision to lock itself into the path of the rule of law and market reform, as he says, and President Yushchenko deserves huge support in his efforts to accomplish that. Ukraine&#039;s directing itself toward eventual membership of the EU is very much in its interest and ours, and I hope that there will be no diplomatic timidity about encouraging that.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o13"><a name="50125-01_spnew11"><b> Mr. MacShane: </b> 
 There is certainly no diplomatic timidity on my part. I entirely agree with the right hon. Gentleman&#039;s comments&#151;he is right. I said all that on the record yesterday in Kiev. Regrettably, my support for Ukraine&#039;s European ambitions did not get the wide front-page coverage that I might have hoped for&#151;but we live for the next day. I encourage all hon. Members with an interest in Ukraine to travel there; I want more tourism and more trade contacts with that country. Let us not underestimate the democratic revolution that occurred between mid-November and the inauguration on Sunday: to see hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians demanding a new country was a marvellous moment in European history, and we should celebrate it. I hope that Britain will be a strong friend of Ukraine in the coming years.

<p><a name="st_o15"><a name="50125-01_spnew13"><b> Mr. MacShane: </b> 
 Quite so&#151;I leave diplomacy to diplomats. The Government have clearly expressed their support for Ukraine as an entirely European country, and for Kiev&#039;s position as one of the cradle cities of European civilisation. I hope that in the coming years, Britain will continue to give Ukraine every possible assistance in realising its European ambitions.

</p>



<p><a name="st_o16"><a name="50125-02_spmin0"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs  (Mr. Bill Rammell): </b> 
 The Foreign and Commonwealth Office has consistently provided a high level of assistance to Afghanistan since late 2001. That includes financial and political support to President Karzai&#039;s Government and the election process, to counter-narcotics efforts and to reform of the Afghan security sector.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o17"><a name="50125-02_spnew0"><b> Mr. Mackay: </b> 
 Does the Minister accept that, with the welcome election of President Karzai, much more needs to be done? Does he share my criticism of some of our NATO allies who, unlike ourselves, have done very little to offer support and assistance? What will he and the Foreign Secretary do through NATO to put pressure on the recalcitrant states and name and shame them?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o18"><a name="50125-02_spnew1"><b> Mr. Rammell: </b> 
 First, it is important to recognise the real progress that has been made in Afghanistan. I attended President Karzai&#039;s inauguration just before Christmas. The first nationwide democratic election is a huge step forward and 3&nbsp;million refugees have returned to the country, but we need to maintain our assistance and support. I agree that NATO should do more. The recent force generation conference noted some welcome progress&#151;the United States, Italy and Lithuania made some additional contributions&#151;but we need more. I recently spoke at the NATO Council urging NATO to do more, especially on the counter-narcotics front. We shall continue to make that argument.

</p>








<p><a name="st_o20"><a name="50125-02_spnew3"><b> Mr. Rammell: </b> 
 I pay tribute to my hon. Friend, who ever since the demise of the Taliban has consistently argued for women&#039;s rights in Afghanistan. There has been a dramatic improvement. In the recent presidential election, a woman stood for the presidency and three for the vice-presidency, and 25&nbsp;per cent. of the seats in the lower house are reserved for women; those are important steps forward. However, as we move towards the parliamentary elections, we need to continue to support women. We, the European Union and our other partners are determined to undertake that task.

 (Lab/ Co-op): Does my hon. Friend agree that crucial to the future of Afghanistan is the provision of alternatives to the poppy cultivation there? Will he outline what steps we and other countries have taken to achieve this?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o22"><a name="50125-02_spnew5"><b> Mr. Rammell: </b> 
 I thank my hon. Friend for that question. To tackle narcotics in Afghanistan we need what we have, which is a multi-faceted strategy including eradication, interdiction and the spread of the criminal justice system. If we are genuinely to move farmers away from the poppy, we need to provide alternative livelihoods. The Department for International Development has recently increased its commitment to &#163;30 mllion over three years, and &#163;13 million of that is now being spent on local community development councils in 5,000 villages, focusing on the bare basics of water pumps, irrigation channels, bridges and roads, which is the first step. We certainly need to take that effort forward.

 (Con): what recent discussions he has had with the Government of Eritrea about the boundary dispute with Ethiopia; and if he will make a statement.  [210384]
</p>



<p><a name="st_o23"><a name="50125-02_spmin1"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs  (Mr. Chris Mullin): </b> 
 We discuss the border dispute with Eritrea, Ethiopia and other interested parties on a regular basis. I had a long discussion on the subject with Eritrean President Isaias in Asmara in January last year, and with Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles in Addis Ababa on 26&nbsp;October. I hope to be able to discuss the matter again with representatives of both Governments at the African Union summit in Abuja this weekend.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o24"><a name="50125-02_spnew6"><b> Mr. Robertson: </b> 
 I thank the Minister for that response. At a meeting with the Prime Minister of Ethiopia in November, he affirmed his commitment to a peaceful solution with Eritrea and, indeed, wanted to accept what he did not like in terms of the border dispute&#151;he accepted the ruling of the boundary commission. Indeed, in November the Parliament of Ethiopia passed a motion to that effect. Recently, however, Ethiopia has been expressing deep concern about the attitude of Eritrea towards the boundary solution. There is concern that that country, which is not democratic and does not have a free press, might seek to return to war. That would, of course, cause devastation in the area, loss of life and loss of aid. Will the Minister redouble his efforts to discuss the situation, particularly with Eritrea, with a view to persuading that country that the peaceful way forward has to be the only way forward?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o25"><a name="50125-02_spnew7"><b> Mr. Mullin: </b> 
 I take a close personal interest in the border dispute, having been engaged with it, one way or another, for about the past 18&nbsp;months. Our assessment is that neither side wants a return to war, but it is correct to say that there is always a danger that a small spark on the border will reignite the conflict. Our approach is based on three principles: no return to war; that the findings of the boundary commission are binding; and that dialogue between the two parties must take place. 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>25 Jan 2005 : Column 146</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Professor Lauterpacht, who was the chairman of the Eritrea-Ethiopia boundary commission, has said that any issue can be discussed, provided that both parties agree. We think that that should happen, and that is the view that we are making clear to all parties, including the Eritreans.

 (Lab/ Co-op): With the deterioration of the situation in Eritrea, are not the Government there beating the drums of war as a diversionary tactic to draw attention away from their numerous failings, and to strengthen their own position? Will my hon. Friend commit himself, when we next meet the representatives of either Eritrea or Ethiopia, to pursue the question with Ethiopia, whose attitude to the Eritrea-Ethiopia boundary commission&#039;s final recommendations is not entirely unambiguous? Indeed, it is already entering qualifications. The removal of those would defuse the tension, would it not?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o27"><a name="50125-02_spnew9"><b> Mr. Mullin: </b> 
 A settlement of this dispute will require both sides to move. We welcome the recent movement by the Ethiopians, which we had been urging upon them. In due course they may have to make some further concessions. At the moment it would be welcome to have some sign from Eritrea that it is willing to engage in discussions. So far there have been no such signs from Eritrea.

 (Con): What assessment he has made of the conclusions of the Iraq survey group.  [210385]

<p><a name="st_o28"><a name="50125-02_spmin2"><b>The Minister for Trade and Investment  (Mr. Douglas Alexander): </b> 
 The Government have read the conclusions of the Iraq survey group carefully. My right hon. Friend the Prime Minister has publicly accepted its principal conclusion that Saddam Hussein&#039;s regime did not possess stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o29"><a name="50125-02_spnew10"><b> Andrew Selous: </b> 
 The Joint Intelligence Committee warned the Government that the limitations of its intelligence on weapons of mass destruction were not made sufficiently clear.

</p>








<p><a name="st_o30"><a name="50125-02_spnew11"><b> Mr. Alexander: </b> 
 I do not accept that. Since May 2003&nbsp;there have been four inquiries&#151;by the Intelligence and Security Committee, the Foreign Affairs Committee, Lord Hutton and Lord Butler. A central question, of course, for those inquiries was whether the Government had in any way acted improperly or dishonestly in using the intelligence available to them.

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>25 Jan 2005 : Column 147</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>on the basis of his perceived need to deter Iran and Israel? Surely, that proves that the imminent WMD threat to the United States, which the Bush Administration used to justify war, was absolute fantasy?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o32"><a name="50125-02_spnew13"><b> Mr. Alexander: </b> 
 The report is extensive; if I recollect correctly, it is more than 800&nbsp;pages long. Its central conclusions included the fact that Saddam never abandoned his intentions to resume a chemical weapons effort, and indeed was pursuing an aggressive strategy of subverting the UN sanctions and the oil-for-food programme. The report therefore comes to a range of conclusions, and I do not accept the point made by my hon. Friend. Frankly, the issue has been well ventilated in the House on a number of occasions.

</p>








<p><a name="st_o34"><a name="50125-02_spnew15"><b> Mr. Alexander: </b> 
 Dr. Blix&#039;s views on this issue are clearly important. As the executive secretary of UNMOVIC, mandated under United Nations Security Council resolution 1284, he was shown a draft of the Government&#039;s September 2002&nbsp;dossier and commented that he felt that some sections of it understated Iraq&#039;s capabilities. It is too often forgotten by people who disagreed with the Government&#039;s action that UN resolution 1441&nbsp;was adopted unanimously by all members of the Security Council.

</p>








<p><a name="st_o36"><a name="50125-02_spnew17"><b> Mr. Alexander: </b> 
 In relation to what my hon. Friend describes as the winding up of the survey group, it is the case that it continues to undertake work inside Iraq. It is certainly the case that Charles Duelfer has returned to the United States. None the less, the group continues to work closely with the multinational force.

<p><a name="st_o38"><a name="50125-02_spnew19"><b> Mr. Alexander: </b> 
 It is of course the case that people have made criticisms of the Government&#039;s action, but they can hardly include in that a failure by the House to discuss the issue.

Moreover, it had demonstrated its capacity to use them extensively in northern Kurdistan.

 I concur with my hon. Friend. No other country in modern times has used chemical weapons against both its neighbours and its own civilian population. That is an important corrective to some of the arguments that we have heard in the House in recent months. It is important to recognise that whatever the divisions in the House&#151;which were present at the time the action was taken&#151;there is now common ground across the House about the need to support the efforts of the Iraqi people as they look ahead to the democratic elections at the end of the week

 That is an important question, which is why we have supported fully the decision to set up a high-level inquiry within the United Nations. We fully support Paul Volcker in his efforts.

 The gangs certainly pose a threat, not just to British companies but to all proper activity in the Niger delta. We are working with the Nigerian Government to try to improve the situation in the delta, which includes providing technical advice. But it is primarily a matter for the Nigerian Government to assert control over the delta, and we judge that they are capable of doing so. What is necessary is to find the political will.

 There are faults on both sides, and actions in accordance with the road map that need to be undertaken by both sides.

We are doing that in political terms with the meeting that is taking place here on 1 March, but we are also doing it in practical terms, through the Department for International Development and through advice and funding support. We will continue to do that, and if those efforts are made and there is an increased focus on the part of the Palestinian Authority on improving its security performance, we will be better able to urge the Israeli Government to move forward with their commitment to the disengagement plan as a first step along the road to fulfilling the objectives of the road map.

We should all deplore the carnage in Falluja and the fact that this unnecessary war has claimed 100,000&nbsp;victims. A support group has grown up around the Prime Minister, and it has singled out trade unionists as victims, which does the anti-war movement no good.

 Any deaths are to be regretted, but Prime Minister Allawi made a clear statement on Falluja: the insurgents were given the opportunity to lay down their arms and take part in the democratic elections.

 As my hon.

As we rightly make Africa the priority in our chairmanship of the G8, we should urge the international community to focus on that particular part of Africa, support the work of the United Nations and do everything we can to bring international pressure to bear to achieve a political solution. We should also use our relationship with Rwanda to urge it to keep its troops out of the DRC and to play a more constructive role in bringing peace to that country.

 We keep in close touch with Rwanda regarding its activities in the eastern DRC. There is no hard evidence of Rwandan troops having been there recently. As regards the international community, we and our main allies are well aware of the Congo&#039;s central significance to stability in Africa, and my hon. Friend is right to draw attention to the scale of the catastrophe that has occurred there. MONUC&#151;the United Nations Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo&#151;has recently been strengthened and is the largest United Nations mission anywhere in the world. The international community is making a major effort because, like my hon. Friend, we recognise the possibilities there. It does, however, require political will on both sides of the argument, and that cannot necessarily be supplied by the international community. Nevertheless, we can encourage, and we do. We can also discourage people on the ground from doing bad things, and we do that too. The most important priorities in the Congo are these: first, to start to integrate the army and the various armed bands that exist there into a unified army and stop them preying on their own people; and secondly, to make progress towards an election, which is scheduled for June.

 Under the existing treaties and the new treaty, voting weights are for those who are already members of the European Union.

 Very much so. Only five years ago, we would have been worried about the death penalty in Turkey, the number of Kurdish people in prison in Turkey, the journalists and writers in prison in Turkey, and the complete ban on the use of the Kurdish language. Many of those problems no longer exist. Rather than condemning, or demanding that Turkey adopt our levels of human rights from one day to the next, we should applaud the fact that the Turkish Parliament and Government have made more strides towards human rights in the past three or four years than at any time in the previous 300&nbsp;years.

<p><a name="st_o82"><a name="50125-04_spnew17"><b> Mr. MacShane: </b> 
 On the first point, under the Annan plan, the number of troops would have been reduced to the number contained in the 1960&nbsp;treaty&#151;from some 25,000&nbsp;or 30,000&nbsp;today to fewer than 1,000. Unfortunately, the Greek Cypriot population voted massively to reject the Annan plan, which would have 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>25 Jan 2005 : Column 156</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>helped to solve that problem. The hon. Gentleman is right about the second point. I stress that we do raise the specific issue of different faiths in Turkey, especially different Christian faiths and the rights of their members to have their churches and seminaries. Under the EU&#039;s charter of fundamental rights, which is part of the new treaty, an absolute condition of EU membership is respect for everybody&#039;s right to manifest their religion. Again, that is a reason to support the new constitutional treaty. It is remarkable that the Turks want in to Europe, while the Tory party wants out.

<p><a name="st_o84"><a name="50125-04_spnew19"><b> Mr. MacShane: </b> 
 Again, my hon. Friend makes a fair point. I have gone on record as questioning whether the high number of Turkish troops stationed in northern Cyprus is justified by any legitimate concern for the security needs of the Turkish Cypriot people there. My hon. Friend is also right to say that, at the moment when Turkey joins the European Union, it must clearly have fully normal diplomatic relations with every other member of the Union. These points are well known; I have certainly made them both privately and on the record. It is important to allow all the inhabitants of Cyprus to trade, travel and operate freely, and I would encourage all sides to move forward in a more positive direction.

<p><a name="st_o89"><a name="50125-05_spnew3"><b> Mr. Rammell: </b> 
 I do not believe that that co-operation is at risk. We understand the concerns expressed by the United States Government. That is why we are actively engaged in discussions with them. Part of the issue is that there is not a sufficient understanding of the effectiveness of the code of conduct. That is the message that we are communicating to our US colleagues at the moment. It is also why we are reviewing the code to ensure that it is effective, and looking to implement a toolbox for countries in a post-embargo situation.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o90"><a name="50125-05_spnew4"><b> Mr. Ancram: </b> 
 It is a most extraordinary argument to say that we are lifting the embargo because that will not make any difference. Is it not a little disingenuous to suggest that a non-enforceable code of conduct will have little effect in changing what is happening at the moment? If that is the case, why are the French so keen to have the embargo lifted so that they can sell military technology to the Chinese, and why is China so keen to see the ban lifted so that it can buy that technology from the French? Is it not a classic example of this Government&#039;s policy of surrender in Europe that they are prepared to put at risk our national security simply to curry favour with the French?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o91"><a name="50125-05_spnew5"><b> Mr. Rammell: </b> 
 First, let me deal with the right hon. and learned Gentleman&#039;s point about legal force. I have read his comments on this issue, and I simply do not understand his arguments. I say emphatically that the embargo has no greater legal force than the code of conduct. Arguably, it has less. Secondly, I know that there is an obsession with anti-European hysteria on the Conservative Benches, but the European Union is united on this issue and has made a strong statement that the lifting of the embargo will not lead to an increase in arms sales, either qualitatively or quantitavely. Given the right hon. and learned Gentleman&#039;s statements on this matter, I must point out that the former Prime Minister John Major was the first European Union Prime Minister to visit Beijing in the aftermath of the events in Tiananmen square, in 1991&#151;so the statement that we are now going soft on China rings a bit hollow.

<p><a name="st_o92"><a name="50125-05_spnew6"><b> Mr. Lindsay Hoyle  (Chorley)</b> 
 (Lab): I listen to what my hon. Friend the Minister has to say, but may I express the great concern among Labour Members about the lifting of the EU arms embargo? First, there is the threat to Taiwan. Secondly, the threat to Tibet continues, and China does not recognise the rights of the people of Tibet. Thirdly, there is China&#039;s religious intolerance in relation to whatever faith wishes to practise there. China needs to improve on human rights before such action is considered.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o93"><a name="50125-05_spnew7"><b> Mr. Rammell: </b> 
 I take my hon. Friend&#039;s points about human rights, which we raise regularly with the Chinese Government. His concerns about the situation in Tibet are valid. We are encouraging the process of dialogue between the Chinese authorities and representatives of the Dalai Lama, and it is important that that process be taken forward. I need to reiterate to my hon. Friend the fact that the lifting of the embargo, which is the fundamental point, will not allow arms sales that are currently prohibited to take place. We have made it abundantly clear at the December European Council that we are not looking for an increase in arms sales to China from the European Union, in either qualitative or quantitative terms.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o94"><a name="50125-05_spnew8"><b> Dr. Jenny Tonge  (Richmond Park)</b> 
 (LD): I certainly do not suffer from anti-European hysteria&#151;rather the reverse, in fact. Will the Minister assure the House that the Government will stick to their policy of never selling arms to countries that will use them for internal repression or external aggression? If he does give us that assurance, how can he possibly consider selling arms to China?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o95"><a name="50125-05_spnew9"><b> Mr. Rammell: </b> 
 I was pondering what the opposite of hysteria is&#151;but that is by the by. Let me be clear: under the European Union code of conduct, which we pushed for and initiated once we brought in our code of conduct, criterion four is about the preservation of regional peace, security and stability, and criterion two is about not undertaking an arms sale if there is a clear risk of internal repression. Both those categories will apply in any post-embargo situation. It is therefore simply not the case that by lifting the embargo we will suddenly see a flood of arms exports to China. We have made that abundantly clear, and we will continue to do so.

<p><a name="st_o101"><a name="50125-05_spnew13"><b> Mr. Rammell: </b> 
 There is an issue over whether progress has been made since the immediate aftermath of the events in Tiananmen square. While we continue to have significant concerns about the situation in China, there has undoubtedly been some progress on human rights since those events, as has been acknowledged by past Governments. Given that, we must ask ourselves whether it is right, through the arms embargo, to lump China into the same block as Burma, Sudan and Zimbabwe. That is why we are reviewing the embargo. I repeat, however, that no arms sale that has been refused until now under the embargo would, to all intents and purposes, be possible under the code of conduct. It should also be made clear that most applications for arms exports to China that have been refused in recent years have already been refused under the EU code of conduct, not under the arms embargo.

<p><a name="st_0"><a name="50125-06_spnew0"><b> Mr. Jonathan Sayeed  (Mid-Bedfordshire) (Con):</b> 
 I beg to move,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0">That leave be given to bring in a Bill to provide for Sovereigns to be chosen by the House of Commons from among the immediate family of the preceding Sovereign; to provide that all Sovereigns so chosen shall cease to be Sovereign upon reaching the age of 75; to make consequential provision relating to Regencies, succession to the Duchies of Lancaster and Cornwall, and the private estates of the Crown; and for connected purposes.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="50125-06_para0">
<a name="stpa_0">I am a strong supporter of the monarchy. I believe that as a nation we owe this institution and its present incumbent a debt of gratitude as well as our allegiance. It is because of the selflessness of many recent monarchs, exemplified by Her Majesty the Queen, and the curb on elected tyranny that the institution provides that this apparently anachronistic institution continues to receive such widespread support. But if the monarchy is to continue to be the popular apex of an otherwise democratic pluralist state, it is right to consider whether it would be beneficial if, while retaining its traditional role, it evolved to meet modern demands and expectations. The danger is that without such evolution, the continued existence of an hereditary unreformed apex in a modern state will be pilloried as incongruous, and will be used to promote republican views.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50125-06_para1">
<a name="stpa_1">My proposals would enact three principles. The first is the end of succession based on male primogeniture. No account should be taken of either gender or order of birth in the determining of succession to the Crown, but this proposal would not affect the current heir. The second is the retirement of the sovereign at 75&nbsp;years of age, although not in the case of our current monarch. Finally, public support for a successor should be demonstrated, possibly by Parliament sanctioning the choice of the heir from within the immediate children of the monarch, and members of the Commonwealth in which the sovereign remains the head of state should have the right to be consulted.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50125-06_para2">
<a name="stpa_2">It is important to make it clear at the outset that nothing in the Bill should be construed as an attack on the current sovereign, the heir or the institution of the monarchy. The changes that I propose would not affect the status of Her Majesty the Queen, or the role of His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales as her heir. Her Majesty has sworn the existing coronation oath, and Prince Charles has already been invested as her heir. It is only fair and proper that their position remain unchanged.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50125-06_para3">
<a name="stpa_3">The laws determining succession to the throne have their historical origins in the 17th century and the struggle between two different conceptions of monarchy: divine right, and the view that the sovereign&#039;s title rests on a willingness to rule within the law and through Parliament. The Queen rules not by simple hereditary right, as did James II, but because of the agreement by William and Mary to accept the constitutional arrangements in the 1689 Bill of Rights, then strengthened by the Act of Settlement. These rules of succession are based on the concept of primogeniture: male heirs take precedence and the Crown is offered automatically to the eldest son. It is a tradition that was 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>25 Jan 2005 : Column 162</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>historically reinforced by the feudal belief that men were better able to defend property and to lead armies into battle. This assessment of the differences in the capabilities of men and women has since been rendered irrelevant, as the modern responsibilities of the monarch have not extended to fighting in battle since 1742, when George II fought in the battle of Dettingen.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50125-06_para4">
<a name="stpa_4">A law of succession under which female and male heirs are considered equal has both historical and international precedence. Such precedence is found under the ancient Irish Brehon law and in the Iceni. In 1980, Sweden modernised its Act of Succession and moved to full cognatic primogeniture; a similar debate has since arisen in Spain. Her Majesty the Queen has proved that a woman is capable of fulfilling the modern leadership and advocacy roles of the British monarch as well as any man. Some of the finest English monarchs have been female, and some of the worst, male. We no longer live in need of a feudal monarchy, and the monarchy will be strengthened if it acknowledges that fact.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50125-06_para5">
<a name="stpa_5">Secondly, I propose that the requirement placed upon the monarch to serve until death be removed and replaced by retirement at 75. In an age when people are living longer, and in which the monarch has fulfilled a lifetime of responsibility, service and duty, it seems sensible that they should have the right to a retirement away from the commitments of the Crown, and without thereby calling the institution of monarchy into question. This change is more likely to ensure a suitable and able monarch by virtue of age, and it would allow the heir to succeed to the Crown earlier, rather than waiting all their life in the wings. It is reasonable to expect that without such changes, an heir will only ascend to the throne having reached an age at which most of their contemporaries are already drawing their pensions.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50125-06_para6">
<a name="stpa_6">My third proposal&#151;that public support for a successor be demonstrated, perhaps by Parliament sanctioning choice of the heir from within the immediate children of the monarch&#151;is the oldest idea of the three. It is witnessed in European history through the Elector of Hanover, and in Britain by the Act of Settlement of 1701, which states that it is for Parliament to decide the title to the throne. It is reinforced by the elective element at the coronation ceremony, for through the coronation oath, the sovereign acknowledges their duty to preserve the liberty of their subjects, while their representatives symbolically&#151;and consequentially&#151;pledge their allegiance to the sovereign.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50125-06_para7">
<a name="stpa_7">My ideas go further than simply bringing the monarchy into line with the basic legal and societal values of equality; they move towards reflecting a value that is at the heart of our democratic society: choice. The populace could have an indirect input into choosing the monarch, and the potential monarch could choose whether to accept the responsibilities and duties of the position. For an unwilling monarch is more likely to be an unfit monarch, and not all offspring wish to follow in their parents&#039; footsteps. In this respect, the royal family is probably no different from our own.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50125-06_para8">
<a name="stpa_8">Historical precedents for these proposed changes exist alongside modern impetus, but inertia risks the monarchy being portrayed as increasingly remote and anachronistic. With that in mind, support for considering these ideas would, over time, allow change

<br>
That this House calls for a delay in the implementation of the Licensing Act 2003&nbsp;in the light of concerns expressed by doctors, senior police officers and members of the judiciary that the Act will lead to increased health and policing problems; is concerned about the increase in violent crimes since 1998, half of which are attributed to alcohol misuse; recognises that drunken revellers are turning town and city centres into no-go areas, thus putting an increasing burden on health and police resources, and predicts that the implementation of the Act will exacerbate these problems; is further concerned about increased alcohol consumption and believes that extended opening hours will have an adverse serious effect on health of the nation; and regrets that the Government has fundamentally failed to deal with the problem of binge drinking before proceeding with the implementation of the Licensing Act 2003.
<br>







<p><a name="st_4">I am conscious of a slight irony as I open this debate. After all, in recent times the Government have shown a distinct interest in telling us what to eat, what to do in our spare time and how to raise our children. In terms of sheer nannying, the Government have few equals. However, although there is genuine concern about this matter among experts, professionals and the general public, the Government are taking the exact opposite approach. I shall argue today that, by pressing ahead with 24-hour drinking, the Government are neglecting their responsibilities. Once again, they are displaying a perverse sense of priorities and an arrogant disregard for all contrary opinion.</p>













<p><a name="st_5">Britain is now one of the worst countries in Europe for binge drinking. It begins with the young. Young people under 16 drink twice as much as they did a decade ago. A third of all British 15-year-olds say that they have been drunk at some time in their lives. That compares to just one in 10 in France and Italy. The <i>British Medical Journal</i> reports that more than 2,000 drunken children are admitted to hospital every year.</p>













<p><a name="st_6">However, it is not just a young person&#039;s problem. Overall, Britons are drinking 12 per cent. more today than in 1997. One adult man in three now exceeds the recommended guidelines on alcohol consumption, and the figure for women is one in five. UK consumers spend more of their disposable income on alcohol than they do on personal goods and services, fuel and power, or tobacco.</p>













<p><a name="st_7">Some might say that that is their choice, but the annual cost of crime and antisocial behaviour linked to alcohol misuse is estimated to be more than &#163;7&nbsp;billion. The cost of productivity lost as a result of alcohol misuse is estimated to be more than &#163;6&nbsp;billion. Every year, 17&nbsp;million working days are lost because of alcohol-related absence.</p>













<p><a name="st_8">The problem is about more than just money. First, there is the cost to our health. Liver disease is now an increasingly frequent cause of death. The incidence of 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>25 Jan 2005 : Column 165</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>liver cirrhosis is rising among 20&nbsp;and 30-year-olds, and 70&nbsp;per cent of all weekend night-time admissions to accident and emergency departments are linked to alcohol. That is a problem that our already overworked doctors and nurses could do without.</p>













<p><a name="st_9">Secondly, there is the crime and disorder cost. Since 1998, violent crime has increased by 83&nbsp;per cent. There are now over a million violent crimes each year, and the police say that alcohol is largely to blame for this increase. Every week in England and Wales, there are 23,000&nbsp;incidents of alcohol-related violence and 360&nbsp;drink-related sexual assaults. Around a third of all domestic violence is related to alcohol misuse.</p>













<p><a name="st_10">Third, there is the cost to us all of binge drinking. The rise in binge drinking is having a disastrous effect on our towns and cities. The delicately termed night-time economy can mean a lifetime of misery for those unfortunate enough to live in the vicinity of late-opening pubs and clubs. Their sleep is disturbed. Their gardens get filled with litter, and worse. They fear to go out on to their own streets at night, and they cannot escape because the value of their houses is cut by 20&nbsp;per cent. or more. Ask any family in a town or city centre up and down the country what is the biggest threat to their quality of life and it will not take them long to mention drunken louts hanging around the streets.</p>

<a name="stpa_17">Indeed we do. The previous Home Secretary, the right hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett), made it clear that drunkenness and disorderly behaviour was spiralling out of control. On that basis, convictions for drunk and disorderly behaviour should have grown rapidly. However, since this Government came to power, the number of people found guilty or cautioned for drunk and disorderly behaviour has fallen by 10,000&#151;about 20&nbsp;per cent. In that time, the number of minors convicted or cautioned for buying alcohol has fallen by 80&nbsp;per cent. Under-age drinking has been virtually decriminalised under this Government, and only five pubs have had their licence revoked in recent years.

<p>
<a name="50125-07_para6">
<a name="stpa_18">The Prime Minister recently said that the police would be given new powers to shut down problem pubs, but the powers that already exist have simply not been used.

<p><a name="st_13"><a name="50125-07_spnew3"><b> Mr. Dobson: </b> 
 I agree with virtually every word that the right hon. Gentleman has said. What I cannot understand is why his predecessor as shadow Home Secretary, the right hon. Member for West Dorset (Mr. Letwin), never said any of this when the Bill was introduced in 2003. Some of us who were concerned about those issues might have welcomed a little support from Tory Front Benchers.

<p><a name="st_14"><a name="50125-07_spnew4"><b> David Davis: </b> 
 I am coming to exactly that point now. Just before the 2001&nbsp;general election, the Labour party texted voters saying:

<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_4">&quot;Cldnt give a XXXX 4&nbsp;last ordrs? Vote Labour 4&nbsp;xtra time&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="50125-07_para7">
<a name="stpa_19">That is the motive behind what we hear today. When the Licensing Bill was first introduced, the Conservative spokesman raised concerns about the potential for a decline

</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="50125-07_para8">
<a name="stpa_20">She described it presciently as a &quot;leap in the dark&quot;, a phrase that was used later by the previous Home Secretary when he expressed his fears about it. But it is undoubtedly true&#151;as the right hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras (Mr. Dobson) pointed out&#151;that people on both sides of the House largely accepted the Government&#039;s arguments that relaxation of the licensing laws would improve the situation, not make it worse. Hon. Members accepted those arguments on the basis of information provided by the Government.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50125-07_para9">
<a name="stpa_21">There have been a number of allegations in the press about Government cover-ups and misleading information, and it is an extremely serious charge to allege that the Government have misled the House. If proven, it would normally require a Minister to resign. I do not know whether the Government&#039;s extremely partial stance was deliberate, the result of incoherence between Departments, or a matter of simple incompetence. My review of the Government&#039;s pronouncements during and since the proceedings on the Licensing Act 2003&nbsp;have led me to believe that they have been literally economical with the truth. I listened very carefully to the explanation from the Home Secretary and the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport.

<br>&nbsp;<br>We now know that much more information was given to the Government at the time and that it was not released to the rest of us.

 My hon. Friend makes an apposite point. As I was about to say, there was no indication during the passage of the Act that the medical fraternity had concerns. When the Government published their alcohol harm reduction strategy paper, the report highlighted the adverse impacts of binge drinking on the nation&#039;s health, and on levels of antisocial behaviour. However, evidence has now come to light that the Government withheld several criticisms of their policy on licensing. <i>The Sunday Times</i> has reported that the paper was redrafted to remove evidence of a link between drink and 19,000&nbsp;sex assaults a year and the &quot;adverse&quot; effect 24-hour opening might have on local residents.

<a name="50125-08_para3">
<a name="stpa_25">Many experts consulted by the Government concluded that the increased alcohol consumption resulting from liberalisation of licensing laws would have a severe negative impact. These concerns were included in a draft of the report that was circulated to the Cabinet in August 2003. However, they had been removed from the report by the time an interim report was published in September. One of the report&#039;s expert contributors, Professor Griffith Edwards, said at the time:

If it does work, what will it do but force people to different, more distant, pubs? It would encourage them to undertake a more extended pub crawl and perhaps to compound the felony with a drink-driving offence, thus putting the innocent public at even more risk.

 Will the Secretary of State give way?
</p>








<p><a name="st_41"><a name="50125-10_spnew1"><b> Mr. Clarke: </b> 
 I am going to make a little progress.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50125-10_para0">
<a name="stpa_47">On the first question, evidence shows that liberalising licensing hours does not necessary lead to the increased use of alcohol. The right hon. Member for Haltemprice and Howden says that he is looking for evidence, so let me simply cite the effect of changes in this country.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50125-10_para1">
<a name="stpa_48">Several well documented conclusions were drawn from the change to all-day opening in Scotland in 1976, which I shall cite to inform the House, as the right hon. Gentleman would want me to. In 1974, average spending on alcohol in Scotland was greater than in England and Wales, but following the change to the licensing laws, the gap narrowed and in 1983&#151;seven years after the changes&#151;the average Scottish household was spending 7&nbsp;per cent. less than the UK average.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50125-10_para2">
<a name="stpa_49">To address the point made by the hon. Member for West Derbyshire (Mr. McLoughlin), drunk-driving convictions in Scotland increased by 1.2&nbsp;per cent., compared with an increase of 36&nbsp;per cent. in England and Wales over the same period. Violence against the person increased in Scotland by 16.7&nbsp;per cent., compared with 43.8&nbsp;per cent. in England and Wales.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50125-10_para3">
<a name="stpa_50">Convictions for under-age drinking fell by 18.6&nbsp;per cent. in Scotland in the four years after reform, compared with a rise of more than 23&nbsp;per cent. in England and Wales. Convictions for drunkenness in Scotland fell by 13.6&nbsp;per cent. in the five years following the change, compared with a rise of 13.1&nbsp;per cent. in England and Wales. In the 19&nbsp;to 26&nbsp;age group, the decline in Scotland was 14.1&nbsp;per cent., compared with a rise of 19.2&nbsp;per cent. in England and Wales. Those were the effects of the changes&#151;
</p>








<p><a name="st_42"><a name="50125-10_spnew2"><b> Mr. Frank Field: </b> 
 Will my right hon. Friend give way?
</p>








<p><a name="st_43"><a name="50125-10_spnew3"><b> Mr. Clarke: </b> 
 I shall give two more examples, then give way.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50125-10_para4">
<a name="stpa_51">The second change was to all-day opening in England and Wales, for which the Conservative Government legislated in 1988. The introduction of all-day opening that year was followed by a decline in per capita alcohol consumption in each of the next five years. The consequence is clear. My final example before giving way is that of extended new year&#039;s eve opening in England and Wales after 1999. Most police forces and local authorities reported significant improvements as a result of the change. That is the evidence of the state of affairs resulting from changes made in this country, and it must be taken into account.
</p>








<p><a name="st_44"><a name="50125-10_spnew4"><b> Mr. Frank Field: </b> 
 Could not the first set of statistics that my right hon. Friend presented be read differently, to show that although consumption in Scotland has increased, it has increased faster in this country? The 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>25 Jan 2005 : Column 174</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>question that the Government have to answer is whether further liberalisation of licensing laws will lessen consumption or increase it.
</p>








<p><a name="st_45"><a name="50125-10_spnew5"><b> Mr. Clarke: </b> 
 My right hon. Friend is entirely right&#151;that is the question that must be addressed. People of good will can come to different views of the potential change; I simply place in evidence the fact that where change has taken place, it has not led to the increase in consumption that was feared&#151;in fact, the reverse has happened. I accept that many hon. Members, including my right hon. Friend the Member for Holborn and St. Pancras (Mr. Dobson) and others, have, for reasons of perfect propriety, taken the view that the proposed step is risky and undesirable&#151;but the principal force of my argument is that we should not entangle the debate on licensing hours with the debate on how to fight the impact of over-consumption of alcohol, alcohol-related crime and so on. Both are important issues that must be given proper consideration, but they are separate: the link between the two is not made and should not be thought to have been made.
</p>








<p><a name="st_46"><a name="50125-10_spnew6"><b> Mr. Henry Bellingham  (North-West Norfolk) (Con):</b> 
 The Home Secretary reads our local newspaper, the <i>Eastern Daily Press</i>, so he is aware of the problems in King&#039;s Lynn affecting the residents of Pilot street in particular, and of the fact that most of the local police apparently oppose liberalisation. I do not know whether he has spoken to the chief constable of Norfolk about the proposals, but what have the Norfolk police told him about the Government&#039;s proposals?
</p>








<p><a name="st_47"><a name="50125-10_spnew7"><b> Mr. Clarke: </b> 
 I shall mention the chief constable of Norfolk if the hon. Gentleman wants, but the fact is that the problems in King&#039;s Lynn have arisen without any of the proposed changes being made.
</p>








<p><a name="st_48"><a name="50125-10_spnew8"><b> Angela Watkinson  (Upminster) (Con):</b> 
 Will the Home Secretary come to the London borough of Havering and speak to local residents, police, councillors and accident and emergency department staff? The fallout from the largest concentration of late-night entertainment centres outside the west end, in Romford, monopolises the services of the police and the local hospital. I guarantee that he will not find anyone who wants licensing hours extended.
</p>








<p><a name="st_49"><a name="50125-10_spnew9"><b> Mr. Clarke: </b> 
 I shall not accept the hon. Lady&#039;s kind invitation to Havering and Romford. However, I visit many places and discuss with people precisely those questions.
</p>








<p><a name="st_50"><a name="50125-10_spnew10"><b> David Davis: </b> 
 The Home Secretary properly attempts to distinguish 24-hour licensing and binge drinking, but the former has two effects. The first is to allow perfectly normal, reasonable, law-abiding people more time for their leisure and pleasure, and we all agree with that&#151;there is no argument between us. The other effect, shown by the operational evidence from Nottinghamshire, where Stephen Green is chief constable&#151;the sort of evidence that has persuaded the right hon. Gentleman&#039;s own advisers&#151;is that it creates the opportunity for further binge drinking. If he has answers to or effective 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>25 Jan 2005 : Column 175</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>methods of dealing with the problem of binge drinking, the opportunity opens up for a safer extension to 24-hour opening.
</p>








<p><a name="st_51"><a name="50125-10_spnew11"><b> Mr. Clarke: </b> 
 I agree with part of that statement. The right hon. Gentleman is right to say that in places like Nottingham city centre we need a package of measures to deal with the ill. I know about Nottingham&#151;many people have spoken to me about the situation there and I have discussed it with the chief constable. I understand that we need a set of measures to target that particular problem in a focused way. That is why, last Friday, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport and my hon. Friend the Minister for Crime Reduction, Policing and Community Safety announced a set of measures to do just that, including the establishment of alcohol disorder zones. I cannot predict what will happen, but I would be surprised if Nottingham did not fall within the relevant category. Also announced were powers to enable the immediate closure of establishments&#151;for making under-age sales, for example&#151;and to tackle irresponsible promotions. We shall also review the penalties for alcohol-related disorder. Why? Because with each of those measures, we acknowledge the truth of the right hon. Gentleman&#039;s words: it is necessary to move away from any idea of accommodating the problem of alcohol-fuelled disorder and towards its eradication through the type of measure that I have suggested. The key point is that those measures stand in their own terms. They are designed to deal with the situation in Romford, Nottingham and other areas, irrespective of the issues relating to licensing flexibility.
</p>








<p><a name="st_52"><a name="50125-10_spnew12"><b> Mr. Mark Field: </b> 
 Does the Home Secretary not understand that having to announce all those new initiatives to deal with the problems in all our town centres under the current regime makes nonsense of liberalising the drinking laws? What is the point of the initiatives, if not to deal with the present situation?
</p>








<p><a name="st_53"><a name="50125-10_spnew13"><b> Mr. Clarke: </b> 
 The aim of the police, including the chief constables of Nottingham and of Norfolk and the other chief constables with whom I have discussed the problems, is to make an impact on binge drinking through the type of measure that I have announced. That is why the president of the Association of Chief Police Officers accompanied my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport on the platform of last Friday&#039;s press conference to commit ACPO as a whole to implementing the measures and making them work. I can tell the House confidentially&#151;<i>[Laughter.]</i> I know that the right hon. Member for Haltemprice and Howden is concerned about confidentiality. The principal reason for the concern that is rightly adduced by some senior police officers was simple: there were resources issues and those who were causing alcohol-related crime&#151;establishments in the areas in which binge drinking was common&#151;were not, in the view of the police, making a sufficient contribution. We have addressed that problem; the measures announced by my right hon. Friend last Friday have to be carried through, but they explicitly answer those concerns.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>25 Jan 2005 : Column 176</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50125-10_para5">
<a name="stpa_52">Such measures reinforce the implementation of the recommendations in our alcohol harm reduction strategy. Those include close working with industry to draft a code of practice covering on and off trade and producers. As an aside, I observe that some of the problems to which the right hon. Gentleman referred are as much the result of off-licence purchases as of on-licence purchases. That problem needs to be dealt with, and alcohol disorder zones give us the powers to tackle it. The code will be supported by an accreditation scheme that incentivises good practice and highlights poor operators. We are working on making the sensible drinking message easier and clearer, so that people can make informed choices, and on establishing a range of fixed penalty notices. The police will have powers to close immediately an area or premises where disorder is occurring or anticipated, or where there is excessive noise.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50125-10_para6">
<a name="stpa_53">I emphasise that, thanks to the legislation, we have a unique opportunity in the fact that all licences are up for renewal in the coming six months. Today, I ask that all applicants be properly assessed by the local authority on the basis of advice from the police regarding their appropriateness to hold a licence to sell alcohol. We therefore have a new mechanism for review.
</p>

<p><a name="st_54"><a name="50125-11_spnew0"><b> Mr. Mark Field: </b> 
 Central London has particular problems. One of the grave concerns about the new initiatives felt by those who represent the area&#151;including the right hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras (Mr. Dobson), with whom I have Covent Garden in common&#151;is that many of them will simply give the green light to the larger-scale outlets of the alcohol and entertainment industry and that some of the small, independent, family-run businesses that lie at the heart of our communities will either be driven out of business, or forced to sell up to a larger organisation. In other words, we will be playing to the lowest common denominator.
</p>








<p><a name="st_55"><a name="50125-11_spnew1"><b> Mr. Clarke: </b> 
 I do not accept that. I think that as a result of the proposed measures, the well run family pub will be in a far stronger position vis-&#224;-vis the competition.
</p>








<p><a name="st_56"><a name="50125-11_spnew2"><b> Mr. Frank Field: </b> 
 There is widespread support on the Opposition Benches for the approach that those who cause some of the disorder in our towns and cities should pay more to cover policing costs. In Wirral, the police have taken eight cases before the magistrates to try to deny a licence to those who produce many drunks at the end of the day, and they have lost all of those cases. Under the new system, will my right hon. Friend support local authorities, when they are pushed by highly paid QCs on the other side, to maintain the line against licensing continuing?
</p>








<p><a name="st_57"><a name="50125-11_spnew3"><b> Mr. Clarke: </b> 
 I can answer that question unequivocally: yes. I cite an example not from the Wirral but from my own constituency, where precisely these events happened. A licence was granted on appeal. There were precisely the legal issues that my right hon. Friend has described. It was granted despite the opposition of both the local authority and the police. I strongly hold the view that these measures, for the first time, will give a

 The right hon. Gentleman speaks about the review of licences by local authorities that will take place. The figures for the fees were produced on Friday, and they are based on rateable value. This coincides with a general revaluation, which means that there will be a perverse incentive for local licensees to make an application during the transitional period. To ameliorate that, the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport has announced a review. Will that review take into consideration the actual cost during the period of transition? Will it include the fee level? Will consideration be given to the structure of the licensing committees in terms of numbers?
</p>








<p><a name="st_59"><a name="50125-11_spnew5"><b> Mr. Clarke: </b>

<p><a name="st_60"><a name="50125-11_spnew6"><b> Jim Knight: </b> 
 My right hon. Friend has mentioned some of the powers and initiatives that the Government want to have and to take to tackle binge drinking. I am a strong supporter of the Licensing Act 2003, but I shall be interested to know whether anything more can be done to support those in the alcohol industry who, voluntarily, are trying to do something about happy hours and incentives for people to binge drink. Can the Government take any more serious action to work with the industry in that direction?
</p>








<p><a name="st_61"><a name="50125-11_spnew7"><b> Mr. Clarke: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is correct. One of the measures that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport announced on Friday was designed specifically to encourage that approach. We intend to offer support to the alcohol industry in banning irresponsible promotions. We want to see all promotions that encourage speed drinking ended. These are promotions such as, &quot;All you can drink for &#163;X.99&quot;, or, &quot;All girls drink free between 11&nbsp;and 12.&quot; We want to see a set of measures that will strengthen the voluntary regulation of the industry. We are supporting the British Beer and Pub Association and others in developing guidance to owners and operators that will ban irresponsible drink promotions. I hope that I have given my hon.

 Like my hon. Friend the Member for South Dorset (Jim Knight), I support the measures set out in the Licensing Act 2003.

It replied, tending to say that the Government&#039;s guidelines did not allow it to go as far as I wanted so as to have local control over these issues, as promised in the Act. Is my right hon.

At present, we are categoric that the guidelines are right to deal with these matters. As I said a short while ago, I ask all applicants to ensure that all applications in this process of renewal are properly assessed and that the opportunity is taken to do that in detail.

<a name="50125-11_para3">
<a name="stpa_57">I shall focus for a moment on alcohol disorder zones, which will create a direct link between the level of disorder in a locality and the financial contribution that is required from the industry.

Before an alcohol disorder zone is imposed, operators will be given a warning. They will be given a chance to work with the police and the council to agree an action plan for improvement. This approach is not draconian or arbitrary. It is designed to ensure that everybody takes the issue seriously and addresses it properly. This is the right approach and the right way to go forward.

 The right hon. Gentleman has announced a number of what appear to be sensible measures. One of the concerns that I raised earlier was that many existing measures are not being used. I take, for example, under-age drinking. There has been a halving of the prosecutions for sales to under-age drinkers and almost an elimination of cautions and 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>25 Jan 2005 : Column 179</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>prosecutions against under-18s who have bought drink. How will the right hon. Gentleman ensure that these measures are used?
</p>








<p><a name="st_65"><a name="50125-11_spnew11"><b> Mr. Clarke: </b> 
 The right hon. Gentleman is right. It is a point that I raised with the police when I first met them to discuss these matters. There is an issue about resources, which we are tackling. There is also an issue about new powers, which we are addressing in the way that I have described. There is also an issue, as the right hon. Gentleman rightly says, about the use of existing powers so that there is proper enforcement.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50125-11_para5">
<a name="stpa_59">I can say only two things at this juncture. First, the greater powers that we have given to local government, working with the police, will strengthen the ability to enforce. That will be their direct result. Secondly, my colleagues in the police have been clear in acknowledging that there is a need to act more on the enforcement side. To be frank, the fact that we have given them what they are looking for in this regard will enable us more effectively to carry through our policy.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50125-11_para6">
<a name="stpa_60">We already have a number of measures in place to tackle the problem of alcohol-fuelled disorder. The police enforcement campaigns, the alcohol harm reduction strategy, the Christmas drinking campaigns and the introduction of the new fixed penalty notices are having an effect. Part of the industry is already raising its game and acting responsibly, and we welcome that. However, we need to do far more. The measures proposed last Friday in the consultation paper are a robust package to ensure that the industry and individuals take their full responsibility for their part in the problems of alcohol-related disorder. We must keep clear in our minds the need to have a focused strategy to tackle alcohol abuse, which is what we have put forward. We must not confuse that issue, which is very important, with the other important issue of more flexible opening hours, which I believe will be of benefit to the country as a whole.

That, too, is an important provision in the Licensing Act.

Instead of being woken up and disturbed by people turning out at 11&nbsp;o&#039;clock from all three establishments, the residents are woken up at 11, 12&nbsp;and 1&nbsp;o&#039;clock, with intermediate problems caused by shuffling and shouting as people move from the pub closing at 11&nbsp;o&#039;clock to the one closing at 12&nbsp;o&#039;clock and then to the wine bar closing at 1&nbsp;o&#039;clock.

A recent BBC poll for the &quot;Breakfast&quot; programme showed that 67&nbsp;per cent. of people thought the legislation would increase the trouble on our streets and 62&nbsp;per cent. thought the Act likely to make Britain a worse place in which to live.

Examples have been given of provisions that are not being fully utilised, and a couple of other examples serve to illustrate the point. Only 12&nbsp;landlords on average each year since 1997&nbsp;have been prosecuted for allowing drunken or riotous behaviour on their premises. In the same period only 11&nbsp;people in total have been prosecuted for buying drinks for friends who were incapable as a result of binge drinking.

The increased fees that have been proposed will provide additional resources only to the local authorities to enable them to do the monitoring. We have still to see where the additional resources for the police are to come from. The Secretary of State may wish to say more about that when she winds up.

<a name="stpa_76">The debate has been unfairly characterised as being about 24-hour drinking. We recognise that the vast majority of pubs are unlikely to want to move towards that. The powers that pubs were given during the new year period to open for as much as 36&nbsp;hours were not taken up by a single pub, as far as I am aware. The Home Secretary was right to point out that the debate is not just about pubs and clubs. With more than 50&nbsp;per cent. of alcohol being purchased from supermarkets and other off-licence establishments, we need to address that as well, as is acknowledged in some of the measures being introduced.

<p>
<a name="50125-13_para7">
<a name="stpa_78">Other Members have referred to the numerous statistics about the binge drinking problem in this country. The Secretary of State rightly points out that these are problems that exist now, before the introduction of the new legislation. Reference has been made to the health costs, the impact on crime, and the problems that face many employers because of days of work being missed. That represents a great deal of human misery and a significant cost to the country, estimated by the Government to be in the region of &#163;20&nbsp;billion a year. We need to focus more on the problem in relation to young people. As we have already heard, British teenagers are drinking far more than any of their European counterparts.

</p>








<p><a name="st_77"><a name="50125-13_spnew6"><b> Mr. Foster: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman rightly points out that we have a belief that the age of 16&nbsp;should be consistently used for all issues, including the one that he is talking about. Our saying that 16-year-olds should be able to buy alcohol does not mean, however, that we are advocating that they should become involved in binge drinking. It is worrying that the figures demonstrate that about 33,000&nbsp;children are admitted to hospital every year because of alcohol-related illnesses. In another debate on the same issue in Westminster Hall earlier today, my hon. Friend the Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey (Simon Hughes) referred to the situation in the Grampian health authority, where two young people under 15&nbsp;are admitted every single week with acute alcohol poisoning.

<p><a name="st_79"><a name="50125-13_spnew8"><b> Mr. Foster: </b> 
 The answer is yes. I do not think that I could explain the position more clearly. I have already set it out to the hon. Member for Wealden (Charles Hendry). I am clear about that policy, but I have no reason to accept any suggestion from the hon. Member for Cardiff, West (Kevin Brennan) that it would lead to an increase in binge drinking if we get the correct measures in place. Our concern is that the legislation does not provide us with the complete panoply of measures that we believe are necessary.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50125-13_para9">
<a name="stpa_80">We were sold a false prospectus by the Government during the passage of the legislation in terms, for instance, of whether the police supported it. We now know that very many police are deeply concerned. The Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis, Sir John Stevens, made that clear when he recently said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_26">&quot;The move towards 24-hour drinking needs to be slowed down. The fact that large groups of people will be coming out at 3am or 4am will mean that we have to man the streets to ensure they behave.&quot;</p>

<a name="50125-13_para10">
<a name="stpa_81">We now know that even some of the information that was to be included in the alcohol harm reduction strategy and that would have been helpful subsequent consideration of the issues was removed. According to the <i>Daily Mail</i>, that includes this initial warning:

<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_27">&quot;Relaxing availability increases general harm whether through more outlets (Finland), denser outlets (California), or longer hours (Western Australia).&quot;</p>

</p>

<p>
<a name="50125-13_para11">
<a name="stpa_82">The consensus has certainly moved away from support for the measure. We have also heard that there were deep concerns even in the Cabinet. The Prime Minister has already referred to binge drinking as the British disease, and as we have heard, the former Home Secretary described the proposals as a leap in the dark.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50125-13_para12">
<a name="stpa_83">If we were given a dodgy dossier, however, the real issue is whether we are being given a sensible set of proposals that will really work. We are being told that local authorities will have significant powers to deal with the issues, but the more we study the Bill, the more we see its deep flaws. For example, at the very last minute, the Government accepted Liberal Democrat proposals that there should be some measures in place to address the issue of cumulative impact. The idea of special saturation policies was referred to. It does not appear in the Bill, but it is included in the guidance. Nevertheless, that opportunity is a rather thin one. For example, the very same guidance says:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_28">&quot;nothing in this Guidance should be taken as indicating that any requirement of licensing law or any other law may be overridden&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="50125-13_para13">
<a name="stpa_84">It does not give particularly special powers.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50125-13_para14">
<a name="stpa_85">When local authorities such as mine, Bath and North East Somerset, considered whether to introduce a special saturation policy, they realised that there were two problems. First, in the area immediately outside the saturation policy areas a green light would be given to all sorts of developments that might be unwelcome 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>25 Jan 2005 : Column 186</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>to local residents. Secondly, and more importantly, the authorities recognised that there was a real possibility of legal challenge. Indeed, Andrew McNeill, director of the Institute of Alcohol Studies, recently said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_29">&quot;I think it&#039;s going to be a legal minefield&quot;.</p>

<p>


</p>

<p>

<p>
<a name="50125-13_para16">
<a name="stpa_87">There are also concerns about the guidance relating to temporary event licences, as it will make it very difficult for local people to do anything about raves in their area. As the Secretary of State will know, only the police are allowed to object, and they have only 48&nbsp;hours in which to do so. A rave organiser can simply put a letter through a rural police station letterbox on a Friday, and there will be no time whatever for action to be taken.

<a name="stpa_90">Earlier, the right hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras asked the Secretary of State whether it would be possible for a local authority to say no to any increases. The problem is that local authorities are required to have a licensing policy saying that they recognise that increasing licensing hours is a good idea. That makes it very difficult for them to follow the line that he might want to suggest. To add insult to injury, the guidance on the special saturation policy areas that local authorities might wish to introduce states specifically that no rule can be introduced in those areas saying that all the pubs must close at the same time. The guidance forbids local authorities from doing that. When he asked the Secretary of State about that issue, she should have said that such an approach was not possible.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50125-14_para3">
<a name="stpa_91">There are also concerns about the role of local councillors.

Many people will welcome them, but it is worth pointing out that the fees on which she consulted extensively and those that were introduced are significantly different. The new fees have come as a huge shock to the pubs and breweries, and various other related organisations. I am not arguing about whether they are right or wrong, but the publication of the fees within days of the first named day, 7&nbsp;February, makes it hugely difficult for those involved to decide what action to take. At the same time, many bodies&#151;not least small sports clubs&#151;are deeply worried that the fee levels are far too high. All those arrangements have been introduced at very short notice.

When the Government introduced that concession on rates, however, it was intended to provide additional support to sports clubs to help them carry out sporting activities. The tune seems to have changed, and sports clubs must use that benefit, if they take it up, to pay the increased fees to which the hon. Gentleman has alluded, which cannot be right.

 I am happy with the idea that the vast majority of our electors are responsible drinkers, including the vast majority of young people. I do not want to label young people as irresponsible. The irresponsible minority who cannot handle their drink and who cause alcohol-related violence must be dealt with, and the 2003&nbsp;Act gives the police and local councils the powers to do that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50125-15_para0">
<a name="stpa_98">I was a member of the Standing Committee that scrutinised the 2003&nbsp;Act, which is based on sound logic. Alcohol-fuelled violence is a problem on our streets and we need to liberalise the laws for the many, while clamping down on the few who abuse them. We are not discussing 24-hour drinking but flexible drinking. The British Beer and Pub Association conducted an extensive survey of its members and did not find anyone who wants to open for 24&nbsp;hours. It is unfortunate that some people are getting on the bandwagon and labelling the policy as 24-hour drinking to score points with their friends at the <i>Daily Mail</i>. Who is the leader of the Opposition in this country? Is it the right hon. and learned Member for Folkestone and Hythe (Mr. Howard) or the editor of the <i>Daily Mail</i>? However, that is not the subject of this afternoon&#039;s debate.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50125-15_para1">
<a name="stpa_99">My view has been informed by accompanying the police in Weymouth late on a Friday night and through into Saturday morning to observe the behaviour of some of the irresponsible members of the community, who mix with the many responsible people who enjoy their leisure time in Weymouth town centre. I observed the activity in Weymouth town centre on the extensive CCTV system, which is funded by this Government, and on the streets with police officers.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50125-15_para2">
<a name="stpa_100">In Weymouth, there are pinch points between 11&nbsp;pm and 11.30&nbsp;pm, when the pubs chuck out, after 2&nbsp;am, when the nightclubs chuck out, and in Westham road, where late-night refreshment establishments are concentrated, where people get kebabs, pizzas and chips and where the concentration of people towards the end of the evening and early in the morning causes a lot of disturbance and inevitably leads to fights, which can occur over taxis. I have spoken to the police, met local licensing officers and discussed the matter with taxi drivers in my constituency and they all agree that the most important way in which to tackle alcohol-fuelled violence is to remove the pinch points. That is why a flexible approach is the right one in dealing with alcohol-related antisocial behaviour.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50125-15_para3">
<a name="stpa_101">The police want the resources to deal with the problem properly. That is why I welcome my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State&#039;s announcement of the fees structure, particularly the multiplier. That means that town centre licensed premises will have to pay considerably more than those with lower rateable values, so the full cost of inspection and enforcement can be recouped from those who make profits from selling alcohol and the community no will no longer have to pay through its council tax.

<a name="stpa_102">The Act introduces a complete policy that tackles late night refreshment as well as licensing. That is welcome. Licensing officers and police in Swanage in my constituency have told me that one or two establishments selling kebabs and the like, where people congregate after the pubs have shut, are the main cause of civil disorder and public nuisance.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50125-15_para5">
<a name="stpa_103">The Act contains many powers that balance the liberalisation that I have advocated in respect of reducing the pinch points. They include the power of the police to close premises down for 24&nbsp;hours where they see disorder, the inclusion of late night refreshments and the ability to introduce a special policy, although I have some concerns about that along the lines articulated by the hon. Member for Bath. I welcome the introduction of personal licences, whereby a licence is required not only for the premises but for the person who is responsible in that operation. That licence equates to their personal livelihood, which they put at risk if they flout the law. That is a powerful sanction.

<p><a name="st_94"><a name="50125-15_spnew3"><b> Sir George Young  (North-West Hampshire) (Con):</b> 
 It is a pleasure to follow the hon. Member for South Dorset (Jim Knight). He did not go out of his way to cultivate the support of the readers and editor of the <i>Daily Mail</i>, which might have been unwise given his small majority.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50125-15_para14">
<a name="stpa_112">I do not normally contribute to debates on licensing, and feel a little like a stranger who has wandered into a bar where a few regulars are exchanging familiar arguments and anecdotes. Nevertheless, I want briefly to make two points. The first echoes what the hon. Member for South Dorset said about his experiences while out with the police. I spent 30&nbsp;days on the police service parliamentary scheme. Several of those days and nights were spent in Southampton inspecting exactly the problem that we have been discussing. That is when I first came across the phrase, &quot;the night-time economy.&quot; To begin with, I was suspicious of what I regarded as a new Labour phrase. However, it is true that Southampton has a night-time economy that complements its day-time economy and which will probably, with the passage of time, become more important as people have more money and leisure.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50125-15_para15">
<a name="stpa_113">That economy relates not only to pubs and clubs, but to food outlets and minicabs and, going back a stage, to clothes, shoes and fashion accessories. There is an industry there of which we should be cognisant, and as a Conservative who is responsive to market forces, my overall instincts are not to stand in the way of such an expression of consumer power. It is important that those of us in the House of Commons, which is slightly detached from young voters, should not say anything that implies that we do not understand how young people like to use their leisure. They like to pub and club, at times of the day and night when most of us are asleep, and the vast majority do so entirely inoffensively. Indeed, when I went round the pubs and clubs in 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>25 Jan 2005 : Column 192</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Southampton, the vast majority of people, including several off-duty policemen and women, were enjoying themselves and acting entirely responsibly.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50125-15_para16">
<a name="stpa_114">I was struck by the all-pervasiveness of CCTV, not only at fixed points run by the local authority but as mobile cameras operated by the police. Young people should realise that, if they commit an offence in a city centre, it is almost certainly recorded on CCTV somewhere and will be used in evidence. On one occasion, I saw a young man being chased by potential assailants just outside the city centre. He headed for a spot that he knew was covered by CCTV, and the moment he got there his assailants stopped chasing him. Although CCTV may be criticised on libertarian or displacement grounds, I am all in favour of it as regards bringing law and order to the city centre. I was worried not so much by the alcohol as by the noise, which struck me as far more likely to injure people&#039;s health than alcohol. Several of the young people were not drinking alcohol at all, but soft drinks.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50125-15_para17">
<a name="stpa_115">Of course there are problems, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Haltemprice and Howden (David Davis) rightly said. There are some very aggressive people, and I was interested to see how well informed many of them are as to exactly how far they can go with the police without getting arrested. They know that they can abuse the police without getting arrested because they have to be cautioned first. Once they are arrested, it is clear that everything that people say about police bureaucracy and filling forms is true. When we took one inebriated young man to the custody suite, the policeman had to fill in a form before he could be taken in. One of the questions was: &quot;What is your religion?&quot; If one asks a man inflamed with alcohol what his religion is, one is likely to spark a theological discussion in which everybody else in the custody suite feels free to join. I am sure that one could consider more critically the number of questions on the form that people have to answer before they are allowed to go through. In one case, a man, once arrested, had to be detained under the Mental Health Act 1983. That meant that the policeman who arrested him had to spend the whole of the rest of his beat in the cell sitting next to him. He was therefore off duty.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50125-15_para18">
<a name="stpa_116">Many policemen who should be policing the city centres do not do so because they are back at the police station, filling in forms and getting tied up with bureaucracy. There is enormous scope to streamline that. If people are charged, the defence solicitors are up to every trick in the book. Even though they know that their client is guilty, they will advise him to plead not guilty in case the witnesses or the police do not turn up. If they do, the plea is switched to guilty in the hope of a lenient sentence. Much can therefore be done in the existing framework to improve the effectiveness of policing.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50125-15_para19">
<a name="stpa_117">My second point is based on what happens in Andover. The brewing industry appears to focus on the city centres. In my part of Hampshire, it drives up the rents of the village pubs, which are closing, and opens fresh outlets in the city and town centres. I ask it to consider what it is doing. Viable village pubs become unviable if the rents are jacked up in the rent review. We have lost the Hare and Hounds outside Andover, and other pubs are threatened.

<a name="50125-15_para20">
<a name="stpa_118">Yesterday, I spoke to the landlord of the Southampton Arms in Andover, where we have pubwatch, which I am sure that other hon. Members have in their constituencies. There are some 26&nbsp;individuals on the Andover pubwatch scheme. I found it interesting that the police implement it in Andover. The police rather than the landlord impart the good news to the individual that he is banned from every pub in Andover. That obviously removes a point of friction between the customer and the landlord.

<p>
<a name="50125-15_para21">
<a name="stpa_119">The application forms for the new regime that starts on 7&nbsp;February are not available at the local authority in Andover. The people to whom I spoke yesterday believe that the Department for Culture, Media and Sport is responsible for ensuring that the forms are available. It is unlikely that any pubs in Andover will open for 24&nbsp;hours but the position may be different in other constituencies.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50125-15_para22">
<a name="stpa_120">Some people are reluctant to go to the town centre, especially at weekends. To deal with that, the police are piloting a new strategy for eight weeks. It has two key personalities. The first is PC Ken Crosby, who is based on a bicycle. That enables him to access the many alleyways and pedestrianised areas of the town. He has CCTV on his helmet and his job is to identify potential trouble makers&#151;groups of young people who could cause difficulty. He is backed up by a 4x4, which has CCTV front and rear. It also has three directional microphones that pick up sounds 100&nbsp;yd away and is backed up by a community patrol vehicle.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50125-15_para23">
<a name="stpa_121">Another key personality is Amara, a black Labrador, who sniffs out a wide range of drugs. She can smell crack cocaine at 40&nbsp;ft and she examines people who stand in line for the clubs. To keep her on her toes, there are two stooges with 10&nbsp;g of cocaine somewhere in Andover. They ensure that she is alert.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50125-15_para24">
<a name="stpa_122">The new scheme covers the off-licences as well as licensed premises. As we have heard, off-licences are often the problem. It is supported by the local authority licensing officer, the community wardens and the fire service. It focuses roughly on 2&nbsp;am when there is a mass exodus and concentrates on the taxi ranks and fast food outlets.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50125-15_para25">
<a name="stpa_123">The initial evidence from the pilot scheme is encouraging. Proactive arrests early in the evening send a clear signal to the rest of the community. There is some evidence that the licensees are acting more responsibly and that revellers are more aware of what is going on.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50125-15_para26">
<a name="stpa_124">Although the House needs to tackle big strategic issues such as whether it is the right time to change the regime and the impact on consumption of longer or more flexible licensing hours, whatever the regime, much could and should be done now. My experience of Andover shows that genuine progress can be made through the police and local authorities working together and sending out a strong signal to minimise the irresponsible minority who threaten the pleasures of the vast law-abiding majority.

Member for Bath (Mr. Foster) on a range of issues, such as gambling and broadcasting, I was surprised that he committed himself to drinking in pubs by 16-year-olds. Whatever the differences between the parties, I believed that there was a fair consensus that the law on under-age drinking had not been properly enforced, as the right hon. Member for Haltemprice and Howden (David Davis) said at the beginning of the debate.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50125-16_para1">
<a name="stpa_126">It was announced last week that, for the first time, it may become an offence for someone who is under 18&nbsp;to try to purchase alcohol at a bar. Many people in the industry and in government have put much effort into the pass scheme, which will permit the use of a commonly recognised proof-of-age card throughout the country. That will be popular with many 18-year-olds who experience social embarrassment if they have to prove their age. As a friendly gesture towards the hon. Member for Bath, I ask him to reflect on his view because I have seen what some of my Whips and perhaps less scrupulous friends have done with Liberal promises in the past. I fear that the hon. Gentleman has given a hostage to fortune on 16-year-olds drinking.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50125-16_para2">
<a name="stpa_127">I want to put the subject of the debate in context. At the weekend, I looked at a picture the like of which we have all become familiar with in recent weeks on television and in newspapers. It depicts several young men fighting in the background, an older man falling over with a drink still in his hand and some young women who are clearly inebriated. It was an engraving by Hogarth in 1761&nbsp;entitled &quot;Gin Lane&quot;. I do not say that to diminish the current problem&#151;we clearly have a problem with binge drinking, which has been graphically described&#151;but to illustrate the fact that the problem has occupied the House many times over the years.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50125-16_para3">
<a name="stpa_128">I contend that we have had a century-long experiment in fixed opening hours and closing times for pubs, ever since Lloyd George proclaimed when he introduced the liquor licensing laws that we were fighting three enemies: the Hun, the Austrians and the drink, and that the greatest was the drink. Since then, our licensing laws have been framed in that context. I believe that they encourage binge drinking. The various early-day motions that support the Government were not generally inspired by big pub companies or civil servants with links to such companies. I shall not embarrass hon. Members by reading out the names of some who signed the early-day motions in the previous Session and the previous Parliament.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50125-16_para4">
<a name="stpa_129">The early-day motions were largely inspired by CAMRA, the Campaign for Real Ale. It is unfair to characterise its members as middle-aged men with beards. Its current president is a woman and it represents beer drinkers of all ages. However, it does not represent the cutting-edge youth drinking market yet it supports more flexible opening hours. The right hon. Member for North-West Hampshire mentioned the phrase &quot;the night-time economy.&quot; He is probably right that it is a bit of a new Labour phrase but the words have tripped off my lips occasionally.

<p>
<a name="50125-16_para5">
<a name="stpa_130">The problem with the night-time economy is, as many hon. Members have pointed out, that it is often the province of the young. The only places that can stay open after 11&nbsp;pm are those with entertainment licences. A bar or a club can stay open after 11&nbsp;pm only if it makes noise. An ordinary pub cannot stay open except in special circumstances. That is nonsense and distorts the evening economy. It stops people who come out of cinemas and theatres going for that last drink.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50125-16_para6">
<a name="stpa_131">Some chief constables have latterly said that they are against the new measures and my chief constable in North Yorkshire has made such signals. However, when I asked her local police whether that means that they will clamp down on all the lock-ins in villages and suburban areas about which they know, they say that they will not because they do not cause problems. The situation should be regularised, because the law should not be flouted in that way. If a well managed pub in a village or suburb is not causing a nuisance to anyone, why should it not stay open later if that meets a demand? Such regularisation would have a civilising effect, as it has in Scotland and in the Isle of Man. The Isle of Man is perhaps not the most socially liberal part of Europe, but it reformed its licensing hours two or three years ago in much the same way as we are doing. That resulted in a decrease in violent crime in the capital, Douglas, which had been having problems until then.

<p><a name="st_96"><a name="50125-16_spnew1"><b> Mr. Andrew Turner: </b> 
 I thank the hon. Gentleman for giving way, although I am not intervening on him because of his reference to another offshore island. Will he go back for a moment to his recollections of the views expressed by CAMRA during the passage of the Licensing Bill, and compare them with those of the Association of Chief Police Officers? Hon. Members across the House know that the problem is not that we did not want reform, but that we wanted reform that was well thought through and would achieve the objectives that the Government said that it would. In Committee, we were told that licensing authorities could not reject licences unless to do so was in line with the licensing objectives in the Bill. Those objectives, narrow as they were on Second Reading, were even narrower when the Bill came out of Committee, because Labour Members, and the Minister in particular, rejected our amendments to widen them.
</p>








<p><a name="st_97"><a name="50125-16_spnew2"><b> Mr. Grogan: </b> 
 In regard to the licensing objectives, why else would a licensing authority reject an application for a late licence if a pub was not causing disorder, nuisance or harm to children? Some of the powers to do with saturation were, in fact, widened. My right hon. Friend the Member for Holborn and St. Pancras (Mr. Dobson) made progress in those areas. A pub has to pass quite a tough test to get later opening hours and I think that many will apply for them and not get them, because they will not pass that tough test. The hon. Gentleman also mentioned ACPO. The presence of its representative, Chris Fox, at the press conference last week was illustrative.

<br>&nbsp;<br>not to mount blanket opposition to it, but to examine it carefully. Most small village pubs, for example, will not pay higher fees than was originally intended. They will not pay for extra policing. The pubs that will pay extra fees as a result of last week&#039;s announcement will tend to be the larger pubs and clubs, and they will probably end up paying much the same as they did under the old regime, if they take into account the effect of public entertainment licences.

Obviously, it would not do much for the image of a town to admit that creating such a zone was the only way of solving the problem, but it is nevertheless a useful power of last resort for councils.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50125-16_para9">
<a name="stpa_134">I also urge Ministers to look carefully at some of the existing powers. Exclusion orders exist under the present law, for example. They allow anyone convicted of a violent offence in a pub to be excluded not only from the pub in question but from others within a certain distance, if the magistrates so wish. I and others have urged Home Office Ministers for some time to ask magistrates to consider automatically imposing an exclusion order in such circumstances. That move is backed by publicans and the trade unions that represent people working in pubs.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50125-16_para10">
<a name="stpa_135">I want to return to the fundamental point about whether we should postpone the introduction of more flexible hours or experiment with them, as the hon. Member for Bath and others have suggested. I am against experiments or pilots because I cannot imagine anything worse than having just six or seven towns or cities being given the authority for much later licensing. Some young British people behave badly on holidays abroad because they regard drinking after 11&nbsp;pm as exceptional and different. Pilot schemes here could have the same effect.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50125-16_para11">
<a name="stpa_136">We suffer from a similar effect in parts of central London, where people think that they can behave badly because late night drinking is outside the norm. It should be very much the norm to be able to have a drink after 11&nbsp;pm in civilised circumstances if people are behaving well. There should be nothing wrong with that. It will take a while to change our drinking culture, which goes back a long way, but that principle is an important one. I am anxious, as is the Police Superintendents Association, to give councils&#151;which are much better placed than magistrates to deal with these matters&#151;these powers urgently, so that we can regulate our night-time economy.

Whatever happens with licensing reform, young people will be out and about on the town at midnight or 1&nbsp;am. The main beneficiaries of the new Licensing Act will be those in the more mature market&#151;which is well represented in the Chamber today&#151;who will, for the first time, be able to find somewhere conducive to having a drink after 11&nbsp;pm. Their very presence in our town and city centres will have a civilising influence.

<a name="50125-17_para3">
<a name="stpa_140">I want to make a relatively narrow point&#151;putting aside the rights and wrongs of 24-hour drinking&#151;on implementation and the effect on local authorities, on which several Members have touched briefly. I was very much in favour of the transfer of powers from magistrates to local authorities. Councils have a responsibility for crime reduction partnerships, with specific responsibilities for tackling youth disorder. Licensing in many ways has some commonality with planning, and most importantly, councils are democratically accountable to the population. It was therefore a brave decision, as it was in the face of opposition from many in the drinks industry.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50125-17_para4">
<a name="stpa_141">I cannot understand, however, what the point was of giving all those powers if they were to be made worthless once the guidance was produced. Under the regulations, unless an objection is made to a licence application, it will automatically be approved in full without amendment. The point that the hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster) made about raves is a good one. Local ward councillors are considered to be biased in favour of local residents and will be prevented from voting on late licences within their ward. They can object only if they live in the vicinity, in which case they must declare a prejudicial interest, which prevents them from attending any licensing application hearing. Therefore, it is somehow bad for democratically elected people to be biased in favour of their populations.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50125-17_para5">
<a name="stpa_142">I confess that I am biased in favour of the electors of Brentwood and Ongar. I doubt whether many Members of Parliament are not biased in favour of their electorate. That does not blind me to individual justice or the merits of an individual case. A balance must be struck&#151;it happens in decisions made in this Chamber and in council chambers across the country&#151;between individual rights and democratic accountability. The guidelines remove the one person who probably knows the local ward better than anyone, and to whom local residents look for guidance and leadership. That person is not only removed from voting, but cannot give evidence at any hearing. The representative nature of democracy, to which the right hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras (Mr. Dobson) referred, is wholly pushed to one side because of the new guidelines.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50125-17_para6">
<a name="stpa_143">Councils are being advised that under the Human Rights Act 1998&nbsp;they should not allow local ward councillors to sit and consider applications for their own wards, because of bias against pubs and clubs. That prejudice will lead to some strange circumstances. For example, Councillor Smith lives in Applegate ward, but two miles from the public house subject to the application. Councillor Black lives in the adjoining Mayflower ward, but one mile from the pub. Councillor Black can vote, but Councillor Smith cannot. There is no logic to that. Only in the never-never land of the Human Rights Act or the guidance would electoral divisions be regarded as natural catchment areas for licensed premises.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50125-17_para7">
<a name="stpa_144">Parish councils will not be recognised as objectors, but residents associations will. The guidance specifically defines interested parties as

<a name="stpa_145">It is unlikely that many residents associations are coterminous with parish councils&#151;I am not aware of any. Again, that marginalises councillors. Councillors will not be able to object to the saturation of pubs and clubs if existing premises apply to extend their licensing hours.

<a name="stpa_148">My belief is that local councils should be free to decide that there are already enough bars and pubs in a neighbourhood. Clusters of pubs and bars can create disorder and disorder hotspots. Local councils should be able to take into account the proximity of existing licensed premises when considering a new application. Such decisions would not be taken in isolation&#151;there are examples from other parts of the world. In New York, for example, a bar would not be licensed were it within 500&nbsp;yd of another bar. I see my hon. Friend the Member for Cities of London and Westminster (Mr. Field) in his place, and I look forward to his contribution. He represents a council that is a shining example of deciding on a set of policies that balance the rights of consumers and publicans and ensure that visiting those parts of Westminster is an enjoyable experience. All that hard work counts for nothing because of these new regulations.

<p>
<a name="50125-18_para2">
<a name="stpa_151">I want to make another point on the question of fees. Much has been said about the fees, and the hon. Member for South Dorset (Jim Knight) mentioned the idea that they would perhaps cover the costs of councils. The new multiplier for town and city pubs will have little impact, however, as most such premises are in rateable value bands of A and B. It will have only a limited effect in London. Most high-band premises are likely to be town halls, hotels, supermarkets and schools. In most local authority areas, only 5&nbsp;to 10&nbsp;per cent. of licensed premises are in bands D and E. I represent a prosperous part of Essex with high levels of council tax in terms of capital value, but although one would expect that to be reflected in the rates, in the Brentwood borough council area just 6.7&nbsp;per cent. of premises are in bands D and E, and 80&nbsp;per cent. are in bands A and B. In hard numbers, there are seven premises in band D and 11&nbsp;in band E. Those 18&nbsp;are Brentwood leisure centre, a number of supermarkets and the secondary schools. No public houses are involved.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50125-18_para3">
<a name="stpa_152">Given that revaluation is about to occur, any licensee with an eye to cost will put in for a new licence immediately to benefit from what are currently relatively low rateable values. Revaluation will mean dramatic changes in the figures. Licensees will put their applications in early to save money, and from February onwards authorities will be smothered in sacks upon sacks of applications. That is why the figures given by the Home Secretary and the Minister are so far off the mark.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50125-18_para4">
<a name="stpa_153">There has been a move towards a concession in the review. I am glad that the Home Secretary committed himself today to a review that will examine local authorities&#039; transition costs, the level of fees and the size of committees, for all those things are important.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50125-18_para5">
<a name="stpa_154">An important transfer of responsibilities to local authorities has been seriously undermined by the diminution of the role of councillors in speaking up for their local populations and the people whom they represent. What was sold to us as local democracy and local people working things out together has deteriorated into what is simply local management of a licensing system that is devoid of democratic accountability.

 It is a pleasure to take part in this important debate. I agree with my right hon. Friend the Member for North-West Hampshire (Sir George Young): the debate is not remotely concerned with how the overwhelming majority of law-abiding citizens, especially young people, live their lives. We know that they often live in a night-time culture, that they like going out at night and that drink is part of that culture, but the vast majority behave in an extremely responsible way. The debate is really about delaying the change in the laws to take account of growing public concern about the antisocial behaviour that already exists.
</p>

<p>

It may be welcomed by 16&nbsp;and 17-year-olds, but it will cause profound concern to parents, the medical profession, charities working with addiction, the police and many others.

<p><a name="st_106"><a name="50125-18_spnew3"><b> Mr. Don Foster: </b> 
 I am slightly perplexed by the juxtaposition of the hon. Gentleman&#039;s opening remarks, in which he praised the vast majority of young people for behaving responsibly, with his later comments. Does he not believe that 16&nbsp;to 18-year-olds can behave responsibly? If he does, does he not believe that they can therefore treat drink responsibly?

<a name="stpa_156">Today, however, we are obviously focusing on the Government&#039;s position. I am afraid that I thought the Home Secretary&#039;s speech was characterised primarily by a sense of complacency, which did not seem to take account of the depth of the crisis that we already face. This issue does not just affect big cities; it has spread to small towns. My constituency contains four medium-sized towns containing between 10,000&nbsp;and 20,000&nbsp;people, and antisocial behaviour linked to alcohol and the crime that accompanies such behaviour are an increasingly regular problem in those communities. Even the smaller villages containing 3,000&nbsp;or 4,000&nbsp;people are experiencing alcohol-related problems, including crime, which were unknown just a few years ago.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50125-18_para8">
<a name="stpa_157">My right hon. Friend the Member for Haltemprice and Howden (David Davis), the shadow Home Secretary, said that the cost of alcohol-related crime was &#163;7&nbsp;billion a year. That is an horrific and frightening figure. Perhaps we should set it against the amount that the Government will make from the change in the licensing hours. They will gain extra money from income tax and national insurance, extra money from VAT on the extra alcohol that is served, and extra money from corporation tax on the extra profits that are made. Yet they say that they should bear no responsibility for the associated costs of disruption and crime that will follow the change, which I consider very irresponsible.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50125-18_para9">
<a name="stpa_158">It goes further than that, however. The Government cannot claim to be the party to solve the current problems when they must bear responsibility for the growth of those problems in the first place. Reference has been made to their campaign at the time of the last election:

<b>25 Jan 2005 : Column 202</b>

They worked to encourage that culture&#151;they thought it would be cool to be the champions of late night drinking&#151;and now they face the consequences as the majority who do not want that kind of society rise up in anger.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50125-18_para11">
<a name="stpa_160">The Government have also shown shocking naivet&#233;. The Home Secretary must be the only person who believes that longer opening hours will not lead to more drunkenness. We must ask ourselves why the publicans would want the longer hours. Do we honestly believe that if they thought the same people would be drinking the same amount of alcohol, but over a longer period, they would be keen to stay open for longer? Their staffing costs would rise, their takings would stay the same and their profits would go down. The publicans only want to stay open because they know that people will drink more. We must be in no doubt that, as a result of these changes, some people will become more drunk, and the consequences will be more serious. The Home Secretary also seems to make no distinction between all-day drinking and all-night drinking. The culture that goes with night-time drinking is very different.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50125-18_para12">
<a name="stpa_161">It is clear that the Government simply do not recognise the misery that drunken behaviour causes. It is not just the violence; it is the noise, the rowdiness, the rudeness and the threatening behaviour that so often accompany drunkenness. Nor do the Government take account of the consequences. They take no account of those who must clear up the broken glass, those who must dodge the sick left on the pavement the following day, and those who must put up with the smell of urine that is left behind. Those are things that have blighted communities and made living in too many of our town centres a misery for people&#151;people on whom the Government have turned their back. People want a Government who will deal with the root causes, and not just bandage the problems that they have allowed, even encouraged, to get worse.

<a name="stpa_163">The people who bear the brunt of these problems are of course the police, whose concerns have already been discussed at some length today. Just last week, the chairman of the Sussex police authority wrote to the Home Secretary. In that letter, copies of which were provided for local Members of Parliament, he expressed concern about the impact that such changes will have on police officer recruitment and training in particular. He said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_43">&quot;It has been widely acknowledged that if people are drinking longer and later, our towns and cities will be busier and people will be drinking more. The result will be more people under the influence of alcohol or drunk, and this will result in more crime and disorder.</p>
</ul>
<p>




</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_44">The implications for Police Forces in terms of additional workload are significant and officers will have to be diverted from other policing priorities and activities to undertake enforcement activity against those who are drunk and disorderly.</p>
</ul>
<p>




</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_45">If drinking establishments were allowed to open until three or four in the morning the police would have to take officers off day shifts in order to do their job effectively at night.</p>
</ul>
<p>




</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_46">However, I am particularly disturbed by recent comments from ministers that simply introducing a levy on the drinks industry will pay for the extra cost of policing the effects of binge drinking. Of course the industry&#151;as a major contributor to the problem&#151;should meet the lion&#039;s share of the costs, but these comments make huge assumptions that Police Forces will easily be able to recruit police officers and attract young people to a career which fundamentally involves policing anti-social, violent binge drinkers.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="50125-19_para2">
<a name="stpa_164">The chairman has put his finger on an extremely important issue. The nature of policing in our communities will change, and the police will be spending more time dealing with some of the most aggressive, violent and rowdy people. At the moment, such behaviour is contained within a certain period, following closing time. However, if such changes go through, that behaviour will be spread over a much longer period and the police will have to deal with more aggressive and drunk people.

In my role as shadow Minister with responsibility for young people, I probably go to more youth clubs, schools, colleges and universities than most Members do. I know from the young people I meet there that their first concern is crime and their safety. That is not surprising, because young people are more likely&#151;twice as likely as the average person&#151;to be the victims of crime than any other section of the community. They are also more concerned about crime. Their fear of crime is greater, which is not surprising, given that their experience of it is so much greater than the average. They want to be able to go out and enjoy themselves, and they want the Government to clamp down on alcohol-linked antisocial behaviour.

 Let us for once be wise before the event. The Government cannot claim that they have not been warned by Members on all sides of the House&#151;let alone by the police, the medical profession and smaller, independent, family-run licensed businesses&#151;about the consequences of the Licensing Act 2003. I hope that we can put its implementation on hold until we have a sensible strategy on antisocial behaviour and binge drinking. To do anything else would be naive to the point of negligence. Simply Europeanising our drinking habits and licensing laws will not instil in our young people Mediterranean attitudes to alcohol consumption.

<a name="50125-19_para5">
<a name="stpa_167">I want to explain what lies at the heart of my objections to this legislation, and I should first point out that I do not support the idea of a nanny state. Reference has been made the problems that exist in London&#039;s west end. Many bars in Soho and Covent Garden already have staggered licensing hours; indeed, the same is true of much of central London. The myth has arisen that this country has a pre-first world war licensing regime. The hon. Member for Selby (Mr. Grogan) referred to the brooding presence of Lloyd George in debates on licensing matters, but licensing hours, particularly in our larger towns and cities, have already developed well beyond those days. My own constituency contains a number of bars and pubs that remain open well beyond 11&nbsp;o&#039;clock; indeed, some remain open until as late as 3&nbsp;o&#039;clock in the morning. I am afraid that flexible licensing has not made a great deal of difference to much of the behaviour on our streets.

<a name="stpa_168">I must confess that I am instinctively a libertarian: I do not like imposing lots of rules and regulations. I can understand part of the Government&#039;s thinking, and it is an important part. They want to take a much more flexible attitude, and I only wish that we could rely on many of our citizens behaving responsibly. I want to discuss my own constituency not because it is entirely unusual&#151;that said, Westminster has more alcohol licences than any other borough in the country&#151;but because it underlines the point that without that sense of responsibility, we cannot ensure that we will create the sort of world in which we would like to live.

I have always believed that those who buy a property next door to a football ground or a pub have to expect a certain amount of disruption. In a previous life, I was a member of the planning committee of the royal borough of Kensington and Chelsea, which often debated such matters. It struck me then that to buy a property knowing that certain problems would arise because it was near a large entertainment venue, and then to complain about such disruption, was the

However, some 60&nbsp;per cent. of the population of Soho and some 70&nbsp;per cent. of the population of Covent Garden&#151;many thousands of people&#151;are living in some form of social housing. They have very little choice about where they live, and many of them constitute some of the most vulnerable in our society.

<a name="stpa_170">My hon. Friend the Member for Wealden (Charles Hendry) rightly referred to the debris that we see on our streets. Indeed, we see it day in, day out on the streets of Soho and Covent Garden. In addition to rubbish, urine and vomit, we sometimes come across used needles and the other detritus that is part and parcel of a &quot;good night out&quot;. When the young people living in inner-city London discover such detritus outside their schools, churches and church halls&#151;the places that constitute the very heart of our inner-city communities&#151;that creates an extremely difficult situation.

<a name="stpa_171">It is often forgotten that places such as Leicester square have a thriving residential population. Some 10,000&nbsp;people live in Soho and Covent Garden, which combined constitute an area of some two and a half square miles. We need to encourage vibrant residential populations not just within London, however, but within all our cities. For the first time in two centuries, inner-city populations are rising in places such as Leeds, Manchester and Liverpool. That is greatly to be welcomed, but we need the civilising force that a genuine sense of community would provide.

<a name="stpa_172">I am not against the alcohol trade at all. In Standing Committee, many of the Act&#039;s most vocal supporters came from the smaller, family-run outfits, who felt that they were being driven out of central London. One of the greatest pities is that the larger alcohol and entertainment businesses have little stake in our communities and therefore little sense of the needs of inner-city residential populations. As several hon. Members have pointed out, they are able to employ the most expensive lawyers to ensure that they maintain their licences.

However, the selfish and loutish behaviour evident in our towns and cities is simply unacceptable. We should try to cultivate civility, good manners and consideration. In addition, the inner cities should be places where families can thrive, as well as places where people both old and young can enjoy the available resources. We need to ensure that a sense of community runs from cradle to grave.

<a name="stpa_174">While we are in the business of exploding some myths, there are a few others that I would like to consign to oblivion. To put it charitably, the Prime Minister could be said to have been inexact in his recollection of events when he argued at last week&#039;s Prime Minister&#039;s Question Time that the Conservative party was jumping on a bandwagon, having previously supported this Act. That is not the case: we had a robust debate in Standing Committee, and we also opposed the legislation on Third Reading. We divided the Committee umpteen times, and our opposition to the Act has gained many third-party endorsements.

 I went to university in Scotland, some considerable time ago. When I first arrived, people who wanted to get a drink on a Sunday had to go to a hotel, as bona fide travellers.

<a name="stpa_182">The licensing Act 2003&nbsp;is a dreadful measure. I am glad that I voted against it. It introduces licensing flexibilities, but at an enormous cost. I have already spoken in the House about the experience of my constituent, Mr. John Crosthwaite-Eyre. He has been told that the licence for his Dunwood Manor golf club will rise from &#163;16&nbsp;to &#163;1,145. That will not secure a more flexible licence that extends opening times beyond what was previously available. The new licence will only allow the club to open as it has always done.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50125-20_para1">
<a name="stpa_183">That huge increase in cost is presumably a consequence of the shift from magistrate licensing to local authority licensing.

<a name="stpa_184">Some months ago, my wife and I had the misfortune to have to go on a mission of mercy&#151;we had to accompany a friend to casualty on a Saturday night.

We arrived in casualty to be greeted by a scene that could have been painted by Hieronymous Bosch. I could not believe it&#151;there was blood and vomit everywhere, and people were arguing and fighting. Some of the &quot;clients&quot;&#151;if one can call them that&#151;made it clear that what we witnessed was a typical Saturday night, and that impression was reinforced by the staff. Many people consider ending up in casualty on a Saturday night as part of what habitually happens. It is, to them, unremarkable that one might end a Saturday evening with a trip to casualty.

My constituency is typified by small towns&#151;for example, God&#039;s own town of Lymington&#151;in which the High street contains not only commercial premises but people&#039;s houses. It is a residential area, but those who live there have to endure the problems that arise as drinkers approach pubs, at closing time and after closing time. I do not believe that those problems will be solved if closing times are staggered so that people are not thrown on to the street at the same time.

Indeed, a number of police officers and local authorities had also questioned it. However, what we did not know at that time was that this view was also disputed by many in the Government as well and that the assurances that the Government were acting in accordance with the views of the police and their own advisers on alcohol reduction were not correct.

<a name="stpa_206">Too many of our towns and cities are already becoming no-go areas at night because of the activities of drunken yobs. Prior to the passage of the Licensing Bill, I spent a Friday night in the west end with licensing officers from Westminster city council. We visited several large clubs&#151;I believe that they are now known as vertical drinking establishments&#151;each of which was packed with more than 1,000&nbsp;people who appeared to have the sole purpose of drinking as much as possible in the time available. I also spoke to residents of Soho that evening, and my hon. Friend the Member for Cities of London and Westminster has referred to their experiences every weekend and the fact that their quality of life had been destroyed as a result. After entering the home of one resident to talk about the scale of the problem, I emerged

It&#039;ll probably be the first of three or four occasions when that happens tonight.&quot; I have also spent a night with the police in Chelmsford in my constituency. Over the course of about six hours, almost every incident that we attended was related to excess drinking and the fights, vandalism and yobbish behaviour that result from that.

<a name="stpa_207">According to the Government&#039;s figures, alcohol misuse is costing &#163;20&nbsp;billion a year. It accounts for half of all violent crime and up to 70&nbsp;per cent. of admissions to accident and emergency departments. It accounts for about 17&nbsp;million lost working days and 22,000&nbsp;premature deaths. Of course, the Government are right to say that those figures reflect the present situation and thus cannot be blamed on the relaxation of drinking hours, which is yet to take effect, but they cannot ignore the list of experts who unanimously predict that extended opening hours will make the problem worse.

<a name="stpa_216">Yesterday, we debated the Gambling Bill on Report. The Government appeared for a long time to dismiss the concerns of those who warned against the dangers of gambling addiction that could result from the introduction of mega-casinos into the UK, yet in that same Bill the Government proposed to place draconian restrictions on family seaside arcades for which no evidence of harm has ever been produced. Today, in the

<b>25 Jan 2005 : Column 213</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Licensing Act, we face an almost identical situation: the Government are pushing ahead with the introduction of extended opening hours against a chorus of opposition from the police, doctors and experts in alcohol addiction. Yet, in the very same Act, as my hon. Friend the Member for New Forest, West (Mr. Swayne) pointed out, they are forcing local voluntary sports clubs to pay massively increased fees for a licence to run a bar at the end of a game. Last week, the chairman of the Central Council of Physical Recreation said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_65">&quot;In the Government&#039;s quest to appear tough on binge drinkers, it has penalised sport and recreation organisations that do so much good in the community&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.

</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="50125-21_para18">
<a name="stpa_217">It seems extraordinary that, with the same piece of legislation, the Government are going to drive out of business many sports clubs, which play a vital part in increasing the fitness of the nation and therefore improving the health of the nation, while ignoring all expert advice and going ahead with extended opening hours, which will lead to more drunkenness, more violent crime and more alcohol-induced illness and death.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50125-21_para19">
<a name="stpa_218">In the course of the debate, we have heard extremely good speeches from hon. Members on both sides of the House. The right hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras (Mr. Dobson) is fully justified in claiming to have been consistent on the issue: he has indeed campaigned on it for many years and it is a pity that he was not listened to earlier. The hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster) made some sensible comments&#151;I often find myself agreeing with him. Like my hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. Pickles), he pointed out some of the difficulties that local authorities will have in taking advantage of the powers once the guidelines have tied their hands. However, like many of my colleagues, I found extraordinary the hon. Gentleman&#039;s confirmation of the Liberal Democrat policy of reducing from 18&nbsp;to 16&nbsp;the age at which people are able to purchase alcohol and drink in pubs. When we are facing a significant increase in under-age drinking and the problems to which it leads, to cut the age at which people are allowed to drink seems a curious solution.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50125-21_para20">
<a name="stpa_219">My right hon. Friend the Member for North-West Hampshire (Sir George Young) made some interesting observations drawn from his experience of participating in the police parliamentary scheme, and he described methods being adopted in Southampton. It is true that a co-ordinated approach is required and many of the strategies being adopted by the police in places such as Southampton bear examination. The hon. Member for Selby (Mr. Grogan) rightly pointed out that the problem is not a new one: it goes back many years. He honestly admitted that the spin put on the policy by Millbank&#039;s sending out that famous text message contributed little to the arguments in favour of it.

<a name="stpa_220">It was my hon.

Friend pointed out one or two serious problems that have since been discovered in the published guidelines&#151;in particular, the fact that a local ward councillor is considered to be biased and will therefore not be eligible to vote on the proposal to approve an application for an extended opening hours licence. As my hon. Friend said, the one person who knows the circumstances best of all in that ward is undoubtedly the ward councillor. Yet he is disqualified. Equally, parish councils are not able to make representations. The ability of local authorities to control excessive drinking will be severely constrained as a result. I hope that the Government will revisit this matter.

<p>
<a name="50125-21_para22">
<a name="stpa_221">My hon.

Given what we now know, we consider that the Government should pause. The degree of opposition from the police, the medical profession and other experts is so great that it would be foolish for the Government to press ahead without pausing and carrying out a thorough assessment.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50125-21_para23">
<a name="stpa_222">On the Gambling Bill, the Government agreed to retreat. They agreed to introduce a pilot scheme before allowing mega-casinos to come to this country.

 Along with my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary I, too, welcome the debate. It provides an opportunity to deal with what are literally shoals of red herrings swirling around the issue.

Throughout the country, alcohol-related disorder is rising. As many Members have described graphically, groups of yobs make some streets in some of our cities no-go areas at night. Too many of our young people have a drinking culture that encourages binge drinking&#151;the deliberate drinking of too much too quickly so as to get drunk.

<p>
<a name="50125-22_para3">
<a name="stpa_226">There is the question of what fuels an increase in drinking. By and large, we drink less than some of our European counterparts. There is a debate among the experts, as rigorous examination of the various research will reveal. There is a debate about price, and the price of alcohol is falling in this country. The price of alcohol in supermarkets is much less than it is in a pub. It is possible for someone to get drunk for much less money if they buy alcohol from a supermarket or from some off-licences. There is a strong body of support for the belief that that is principally driving the increase in binge drinking and alcohol-related disorder.

<a name="stpa_227">Other evidence about the impact of opening times was obviously considered. My right hon.

 I believe that there will be less drunkenness if we link the impact of flexibility and decisions made by local authorities in the knowledge of their local communities with the tough action that my hon.

 Although I agree with the main thrust of Government policy, does my right hon.

If we are going to tackle binge drinking, we need far more effective enforcement procedures in pubs and clubs.
</p>








<p><a name="st_126"><a name="50125-22_spnew3"><b> Tessa Jowell: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is right. There are two ways in which we intend to strengthen those procedures. First, it is an offence for a licensee to sell alcohol to someone who is drunk. By giving local authorities the resources for greater enforcement of the new powers, we intend to ensure that they will undertake inspections that will reveal the pubs and clubs where that is happening. We also intend to make that subject to a fixed penalty.

<p>
<a name="50125-22_para5">
<a name="stpa_228">No one is claiming&#151;I am certainly not&#151;that the Licensing Act alone will heal all the problems of alcohol and alcohol-related crime. However, we will not achieve a solution for the problems that we face without that Act, which is part of a bigger jigsaw of pieces that must be put in place if we are to make progress. The 2003&nbsp;Act directly complements the alcohol harm reduction strategy, which was published last March and aims to reduce significantly the harm that alcohol causes. By

<br>&nbsp;<br>linking the impact of the Licensing Act to public health education and to the targeted powers heralded in the alcohol harm reduction strategy for tackling disorder, we can begin to change the behaviour of young people. The strategy includes the development of a code of practice that addresses irresponsible sales promotions. Many young people drink too much too quickly as a result of promotions that encourage them to drink all they can for &#163;9.99. Those promotions are designed to do nothing but encourage drunkenness. We can make responsible conduct of premises, which involves not promoting drink in that irresponsible way, a licence condition. We can also work with the industry, the best and responsible parts of which want an end to such promotions.
</p>








<p><a name="st_127"><a name="50125-22_spnew4"><b> Ms Dari Taylor  (Stockton, South) (Lab):</b> 
 Does my right hon. Friend accept that some licensees already want to take up the mantle of responsibility? Over three nights, well over 6,000&nbsp;young people visit Stockton town centre. Licensees have made a small additional payment to the police, who have agreed to respond quickly to incidents. In two months, there has been a 21&nbsp;per cent. reduction in violent crime, and it is important that we all acknowledge that.
</p>








<p><a name="st_128"><a name="50125-22_spnew5"><b> Tessa Jowell: </b> 
 My hon. Friend makes an important point. We do not need to wait for legislation to begin to take action. To her excellent example from Stockton, for which she has been a powerful advocate, I could add BAND&#151;Burnley against Night-Time Disorder&#151;Bedford&#039;s Bedsafe, Camden&#039;s Glitterball Project, High Peak&#039;s Safer Pubs and Clubs, Leicester&#039;s NiteRIDER, Liverpool&#039;s Crystal Clear, Manchester&#039;s City Centre Safe, and Northumberland&#039;s Alcohol Awareness plus.

For the first time, democratic accountability will be at the heart of alcohol licensing. I can reassure the hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. Pickles) that he has got it wrong.

<a name="stpa_232">The Act does not just give new powers to local authorities. It empowers the community as a whole. It is astonishing that no previous Government thought to give local residents any say in how their local pub was run. We have done so. For the first time, local residents will have the opportunity to intervene not only when a new licence is being considered and any extension of hours is being proposed, but at any stage after it is granted. The Act also provides a new and expanded raft of powers to enable licensing authorities to respond to residents&#039; concerns. They will be able to add new conditions to licences, restrict the opening hours, suspend licences for one day, a weekend or up to three months, require the removal of a designated premises supervisor, remove an entire licensable activity such as selling alcohol, or as a last resort, revoke a licence.

<a name="stpa_233">The Act strengthens police powers in respect of licensing and is tougher on crime and disorder and under-age sales, all of which are contributory factors to the town and city centre disorder that gives rise to such concern. The police have been consistent in wanting resources in support of new powers, but have recognised the potential benefits of flexible opening. Our message to the police is, &quot;We are giving you the new powers and the resources. Now use them to promote the solutions to the problems that cause such concern.&quot;

The police have the power to object to a simple renewal of any licence. Local residents, councillors, Members of Parliament and area child protection authorities all have the power to object to any variation of the existing licence. Democracy is there, and I urge every Member of the House to use it. I am happy to reiterate in relation to local authorities my previous undertaking that the fee levels to fund enforcement and running the new system will be kept under constant review.

 On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. As you know, a service will be held in Westminster Hall on Thursday to commemorate holocaust day. Do you know of any Members of Parliament from our House who have been invited? Who sent the invitations out for it? As far as I know, no Jewish Member has been invited to attend.

I know that I have not been invited but, since the event would not take place in Westminster Hall without the authorisation of Mr. Speaker and the Lord Chancellor, the most productive line of inquiry probably lies with the Speaker&#039;s Office.

 The hon. Gentleman might be interested to know that the Leader of the House, the right hon.

On 1&nbsp;August, about 270&nbsp;ingredients&#151;nutrient sources&#151;that are currently used in vitamin tablets in this country will become illegal. They have been excluded from an official approved list set out by the EU in the directive. As a result, a substantial proportion of the multivitamin tablets on sale in this country will have to be reformulated by 1&nbsp;August or disappear thereafter. Some products will disappear altogether: for example, boron, which is believed by many people to be good for their bones, and vanadium, which is a product used by people with diabetes. Both 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>25 Jan 2005 : Column 225</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>are entirely excluded from the approved list. Other products such as selenium, which is widely used for women&#039;s health issues, will disappear in most of its current forms, and ironically, most of its natural current forms.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50125-25_para1">
<a name="stpa_250">The Government will say to us that the disappearance of those products is not inevitable, and that their manufacturers can submit a dossier that, if approved by the European authorities, will allow them back on to the approved list. The Minister will no doubt also tell us that the Government have secured a derogation until 2009, to give manufacturers the chance to put together dossiers. What they will not tell us is that they have already started to gold-plate that process. Nor will they tell us that the cost of putting together those dossiers amounts to tens of thousands of pounds each, and possibly hundreds of thousands of pounds&#151;not in total but for each one of the 277&nbsp;missing ingredients&#151;which means a total cost of tens of millions of pounds to an industry made up largely of small businesses. I also suspect that they will not admit that the industry says that producing such dossiers is economically viable in only a handful of cases. For millions of vitamin users, 1&nbsp;August is the day when their choice, along with the products that they currently choose, disappears.

 Is not there a certain historical echo with the time when Lord Rooker, who then had responsibility for this matter, banned vitamin B6&nbsp;as a result of some committee of wiseacres suggesting that he should?

We have a very different tradition in this country. Our vitamin tablets have always contained a much higher dosage than those in many other European countries, where the dosage may be a tiny fraction of ours.

They say that they hope safety will be the guiding principle, but they also recognise that the challenge is rather more complex, because the issues are very different in other countries. In terms of what will happen next, Members do not need much imagination to guess where the smart money lies.

<a name="stpa_268">The motion would not repeal the food supplement directive, but it would instruct the Government to renegotiate it. It expresses a willingness to repeal that and other such directives if our European partners do not work with us to find a better way. We could, for example, simply apply the directive to international trade and have a derogation for in-country sale of products. We could expand the approved list to include the missing nutrients. A variety of things could be done, with political will and leadership. We could secure amendments to the directive and ensure a better deal for British manufacturers and consumers, especially when this country holds the presidency of the EU.

It is for us to decide whether we are willing to accept or tolerate measures that the people we represent do not want. I have no doubt that in an unwhipped vote the measure would not have been passed by the House in the first place. In an unwhipped vote tonight, it would certainly be comprehensively rejected. The challenge now is for Labour Members. Whom do they represent here? Are they here to do the will of the people? No Labour Member can be in any doubt about what people outside really think. Now is our chance to start the process of getting rid of this unwanted directive. There are hundreds of thousands of people out there waiting for us to do just that. They are waiting for Labour Members to back this motion. If they do not, those hundreds of thousands of people will be ready to pay them back.

<br>&nbsp;<br>Opposition Members appear to have conveniently forgotten some of it. At the time the directive was signed, the industry recognised that it was the best achievable deal and it supported the UK&#039;s voting in favour of the directive. More specifically, three trade associations support the signing of the directive by the UK&#151;the Health Food Manufacturers Association, the Council for Responsible Nutrition and the Proprietary Association of Great Britain.

 I will come on to the history of what has happened and the issues that do and do not face us at present, but what I have told the House is accurate.

 I am grateful to my hon. Friend for his support. It ties in neatly with the point that I am about to make. The larger food supplements companies supported the directive and saw it as a commercial opportunity to expand their market across the EU&#151;now enlarged.

 One of the grounds being raised today at the European Court of Justice is proportionality. Does the hon. Lady not agree that it was pretty extraordinary of the hon.

She has been going on about collaboration among various parties, but does she not accept that the European scientific body will call the final shots and only then will the matter be referred back to the United Kingdom?

 Part of the Government&#039;s argument is about wanting to play safe, and the hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Rob Marris) referred to the precautionary principle.

However, I do not think that the demands of producing a dossier are necessarily too great for much of the industry.

 The Lib Dems will support the motion, but it was strange and even sad that although the hon. Member for Epsom and Ewell (Chris Grayling) began his speech by talking the language of cross-party consensus, he then, within a few sentences, provoked party differences for polemical reasons. I do not think that that will help the food supplement case at all. [Interruption.] Anyone who wishes to perpetuate such an atmosphere and who does not like a consensus can carry on. We will try to argue the case further without xenophobia, anti-Europeanism, ulterior motives or undue hysteria.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50125-30_para3">
<a name="stpa_292">In most advanced countries, it has been found necessary to regulate the supply, sale and production of foods and medicines. The rationale for that approach is broadly easy to grasp. Both food and medicine are generally good for us, although both have the potential to be toxic at times. Thus, most advanced states, including ours, have regulatory bodies and regulations for foods and medicines. The object of most such regulations is to set minimum safety levels for consumers and patients, and to ensure that people avoid polluted food and quack and dangerous medicines, both of which proliferated in the 19th century. Most of such regulation has the thrust of being fairly minimal in its effects, because at the end of the day, not all the effects of all foods can be known in advance. I learned very recently that the toast that I have been consuming for years is positively dangerous to me. Ultimately, nothing is safe if it is taken in excess quantities, not even water.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50125-30_para4">
<a name="stpa_293">All such regulation is always complicated by the fact that the distinction between food and medicine is as an absolute. Both are usually ingested, but food is nutritional while medicine changes a bodily state and is usually not nutritional. None the less, both are chemical in their effects, and the effects of food are never simply nutritional. Good food contains other beneficent ingredients, including vitamins and minerals, which act on the body and can be separated out as food supplements, and which are, indeed, one of the bones of contention in this debate.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50125-30_para5">
<a name="stpa_294">None the less, the case for regulating what is ingested within any market, whether it is the European or the national market, is fairly strong, broadly speaking. Such regulation is there to provide consumer protection and information, and so inform consumer choice. In a pan-European market&#151;that is what we have: the single market, as set up by Lady Thatcher in 1986&#151;the same case can also be made. I remind hon. Members that there is a debate about supplements and rules about them not only in Europe, but in the United States. Anyone who uses the web and puts the words &quot;Save our supplements&quot; into the search engine will be guided to an American debate that follows similar parameters to those of the debate that we are having here.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50125-30_para6">
<a name="stpa_295">A similar debate rages overall, but the nub of the issue is how regulation should be done. In passing, I may say that most of the debates of a European nature that we have in this country stem not from recent legislation, but ultimately from the Single European Act. In one sense, the European Union approach is precautionary. It allows nation states to uphold existing bans and sets safety hurdles for existing and new products. Clearly, the objective is relatively simple&#151;to ensure that products of a doubtful provenance or about which 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>25 Jan 2005 : Column 242</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>individual nations have doubts are not freely traded. As the hon. Member for Epsom and Ewell pointed out, however, the approach is not permissive. It does not allow products that individual nations have no doubts about to be consumed in those nations whether they get over the EU international trade hurdles or not.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50125-30_para7">
<a name="stpa_296">The argument against such a permissive approach is very weak. One could say&#151;I suppose that this is a counter-argument&#151;that tolerated remedies in one nation would easily leak on to the European market anyway, but as other hon. Members have pointed out, there is a far greater danger that unregulated substances of all kinds will get into people&#039;s homes via the internet, by international courier or whatever. There also seems to be a backstop in so far as EU regulations, as I understand them, allow individual nations to add their own bans or requirements on top of those regulations. In any case, is it not intrinsically unlikely that what is tried and tested in one country over ages will wreak havoc in another?
</p>

<p>
<a name="50125-30_para8">
<a name="stpa_297">Although many traditional remedies may be ineffective, they represent a kind of forgotten wisdom, which mainstream science sometimes rediscovers at a later date. The history of medicine is littered not only with errors, but with bouts of forgetfulness and remedies that are neglected and forgotten over time. It seems to me that dogmatism in medicine rarely pays&#151;a point that is emphasised by the history of herbal medicine. A further argument against discouraging diversity is that that suits the major drug and pharmaceutical companies and suppliers, who work to huge economies of scale, just as it harms small suppliers and producers.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50125-30_para9">
<a name="stpa_298">Not standing up for the principle of national diversity is one of the sins that one can lay against the Government and their approach, but it is only one of their sins, and it may not be their major one. Their major sin was to agree to such an unnecessarily burdensome directive. The Liberal Democrats voted against the directive in Europe, largely because it outlaws 300&nbsp;nutrients and nutrient sources that are already on the British market, which have had nothing proved against them and do very little harm.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50125-30_para10">
<a name="stpa_299">The directive sets onerous and perhaps unsupportable burdens&#151;we may debate how unsupportable those burdens are&#151;and a timetable for listing nutrients. It also ventures into the issue of current dosage without making a fair case&#151;a point to which other hon. Members have already alluded. Worse still&#151;my hon. Friend the Member for Brecon and Radnorshire (Mr. Williams) made this point&#151;other EU directives threaten to broaden the definition of medicinal products in such a cumbersome way that it may include not only food supplements, but ordinary beverages such as diet cola.

 The Minister painted a rosy picture of the Government&#039;s approach, and of what they have done so far. She talked about companies that favour the regulations and about spreading the liberal culture. She said that nothing would be banned, and mentioned all-party support. I have to say to her that her approach is totally at variance with what is going on in the real world.

<p>
<a name="50125-32_para0">
<a name="stpa_319">I listened with interest to the hon. Member for Vauxhall (Kate Hoey), who asked why the Government did not get stuck in. Perhaps I can answer that question by relaying the Minister&#039;s reply to the parliamentary question that I tabled two weeks ago about whether the Government would use the UK&#039;s presidency of the European Union to renegotiate the food supplements directive. She replied:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_82">&quot;It would not be appropriate for discussion on the food supplements directive to be considered&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&quot;&#151;</p>

</p>

<p>
<a name="50125-32_para2">
<a name="stpa_321">That is the kind of funk attitude that has brought us to this sorry pass. The Government&#039;s approach has been more akin to a moth being attracted to a flame, in that they hovered round the issue for a long time without getting close and, when they did get close, they got burned because they were badly prepared,. That is the truth of the situation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50125-32_para3">
<a name="stpa_322">The regime in this country has always been less restrictive than that in Europe. What we are supposed to have, through the directive, is a form of harmonisation, not destruction of the playing field as we understand it. For example, we are not expecting to see the destruction of many of the minor manufacturers in the market. When the Minister said that major manufacturers were on side, she neglected to say that many minor manufacturers will simply go out of business and were that will involve the loss of thousands of supplements. The point made by the hon. Member for Vauxhall about potassium is real: although there may be potassium 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>25 Jan 2005 : Column 248</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>products on the positive list, the fact is that many supplements that are now compounds or part of products and preparations that people in this country have used effectively and safely for many decades will be taken off the market, so people will have to buy a new product that they do not understand. That goes to the heart of the problem.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50125-32_para4">
<a name="stpa_323">As I said in a brief intervention on my hon. Friend the Member for Epsom and Ewell (Chris Grayling), the Government&#039;s record in dealing with this issue is poor and borders on negligent. With my hon. Friend the Member for Macclesfield (Sir Nicholas Winterton) and one or two others, I took a delegation to the Department of back in 2002. We struggled to get that meeting. Representatives of the manufacturing industry needed to see the Government about the issue, but the only reason why we got the meeting was that Ministers were being held to account the next day, when they were to come before European Standing Committee C. That was on a measure dealing with the authorisation of human and veterinary medicines, and the two Ministers present were obviously not well prepared. I suggest that a much simpler solution for the Government would have been improved labelling.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50125-32_para5">
<a name="stpa_324">The positive list has attracted much comment. In defence of the Government&#039;s position, the Minister has tried to persuade the House this afternoon that most of the products that are on the market will be included on the positive list. To return to the point that I made about the remarks of the hon. Member for Vauxhall, the positive list as constituted will not be able to include all the products that are on the market now. Estimates of the number of products that will be taken from the shelves range from 800&nbsp;upwards. The point made by several colleagues about the costs of that positive list have been ignored by the Minister. The cost of putting in dossiers is astronomical and completely beyond the scope of minor manufacturers. The market will therefore contract. Will the measure benefit larger manufacturers in the drugs industry? Yes, it will, because many of the drug companies have shares in or control the larger suppliers of vitamin supplements, so we will see a reduction in choice and the eradication of smaller companies&#151;and, of course, the consumer will suffer.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50125-32_para6">
<a name="stpa_325">It is amazing that some so-called controversial compounds such as sodium chloride, which is used to kill pests, and caustic soda, which is used to clean drains, are on the positive list, while scores of safe, non-toxic ingredients believed to benefit health are excluded. We have already heard about silicon and boron, which will be banned entirely. Naturally occurring folic acid found in spinach will also be banned, while the form sold by pharmaceutical companies will be allowed. That answers the question about whether major pharmaceutical companies will benefit.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50125-32_para7">
<a name="stpa_326">On the issue of upper safe levels, the Minister has been in danger of misleading the House. I choose my words carefully, because when she said that the European authority responsible for setting those levels had not determined what they should be, she neglected to say that across Europe, excluding the United Kingdom, the policy normally adopted is to have so-called recommended daily allowances. They tend to be lower dosages and are historically set as a result of the influence of the Americans in Europe at the end of the 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>25 Jan 2005 : Column 249</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>second world war, when the American system was largely brought into Europe. In Britain, we have always worked on the basis of maximum permitted levels. Nutritionists in the field who really know the subject, such as Patrick Holford, will say that those levels are vital for the treatment of certain conditions. The hon. Member for Bolton, South-East (Dr. Iddon) nods in agreement.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50125-32_para8">
<a name="stpa_327">If the Minister accepts recommended daily allowances that will, probably, be forced on her, that will not be in the interests of people in this country and it will be against our tradition. That is why I say to the Minister that I believe she has been tempted into misleading us.

<br>&nbsp;<br>modest motion. Of the many issues that we will debate this week and in the weeks to come, this one gives the most cause for public concern, particularly on the part of those who perhaps do not take much interest in formal party politics. I congratulate the supporters of this motion on enabling the House to debate an issue that the public genuinely want debated.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50125-33_para3">
<a name="stpa_334">Ministers need to remember that one of the phenomena of the past decade has been the appearance on the political agenda of health, nutrition and food issues. Indeed, I cannot remember a time when the public were more concerned about such issues. Those of us who are parents&#151;and who perhaps have poor diets ourselves&#151;take a particular interest in nutrition, the amount of preservatives in food and the amount of processed food available, as well as in the lack of access for our poorest communities to fresh, unadulterated food. Such concerns have led to the emergence of an interest in vitamins, minerals and other dietary supplements.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50125-33_para4">
<a name="stpa_335">In the past few months, I have received more letters, e-mails and other communications from the public about this issue than I have about many others. Ministers said that certain Members were spreading concern about it, but in fact the pressure is coming from our constituents, which is why it is important that we have this debate today. It is difficult to explain to them that they face having limited or no access to the vitamins, minerals and supplements on which they depend, when at the same time the Government are trying to introduce 24-hour drinking, despite the well known health effects of alcohol. How can we say that our only concern is to protect health when we are legislating to allow people to drink themselves into a stupor 24&nbsp;hours a day?
</p>

<p>
<a name="50125-33_para5">
<a name="stpa_336">One consequence of the directive will be to force people to purchase such products on the internet, where there are far fewer controls, inspections and guarantees of product safety. This measure is being advanced more in an effort to satisfy the interests of pharmaceutical companies than to satisfy our constituents&#039; need and desire for access to a wide range of vitamins, minerals and other supplements. I should also point out that people have been taking such products for many years, with no report of ill effects.

Ministers must consider why public opinion has moved away from Europe since 1997. It is because of matters such as this, which seem minor to Ministers but adversely affect millions of people. The public are aware that Europe intervened in this matter, but it is not clear that Ministers stood up for our people&#039;s interests.

However, Conservative Members should remember that we are in this situation because of single market regulations approved by this House under a Conservative Government.

There was probably less commonality between their experiences on the issue than on many others. They were dedicated to putting a high priority on safety, and the result is pro-choice. However, it is pro informed choice, and that is the important point. As other hon.

It is not necessary for every single product produced by every single manufacturer to be represented separately. Every licensed medicinal product is unaffected by the regulations.

 I appreciate that commercial issues will be involved.

<a name="stpa_349">Six minerals do not yet qualify subject to the evidence of their being safe, but they still could qualify if the dossiers are submitted even prior to the evidence in them being fully taken on board by the European Food Safety Authority. Those minerals are vanadium, tin, cobalt, silicon, boron and nickel. The hon. Member for Epsom and Ewell (Chris Grayling) told the House that vanadium plays a role in fighting diabetes, but I had no knowledge of that. I have taught diet and nutrition and I remember studying invertebrates at A-level and learning that only sea squirts had a biological use for vanadium. They have it in their blood. At that time, there was no other known biological function for vanadium. Similarly tin has no known biological function. Cobalt is included on the list, but it forms part of vitamin B12. Cobalt will obviously not be banned, because vitamin B12&nbsp;is allowed. Silicon, boron and nickel are trace elements that are required in the diet, but there are no recorded cases of deficiencies in them. They occur naturally in sufficient trace quantities in the diet for them to be effective as trace minerals.

<br>&nbsp;<br>we are talking about an element of faith healing and a placebo effect. I do not criticise or condemn alternative therapies, but healing or health care based on belief rather than scientific evidence is a dangerous path to go down. I am not against people taking supplements, but I am against people making claims for them that cannot be justified.

<a name="stpa_351">In my time, I have had reflexology, and I do not understand how that works. I have had treatment from a chiropractor&#151;I do understand how that works&#151;and homeopathy. Some of the elements and minerals that we are talking about occur in such small quantities that we are almost talking homeopathic quantities. Large doses are exactly what people do not want. I was particularly interested in the intervention by the hon. Member for North-West Norfolk (Mr. Bellingham) when he said that he had taken zinc. It clearly galvanised him into action&#151;a scientific joke for the House.

<a name="50125-34_para3">
<a name="stpa_352">When many of these products are in the diet to excess, they simply pass through the body and are excreted at the other end. They clearly do not perform a particularly useful function, especially in respect of the fact that people have spent their money on them. However, other products are retained in the body. For example, if carotene is taken in excess as a vitamin, it can cause discolouration of the skin and other well understood effects.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50125-34_para4">
<a name="stpa_353">The people who have the most to gain from greater sales of greater quantities of higher doses of the supplements are the manufacturers. It is like the mustard principle, because the bit left aside that does no good&#151;the excess consumed&#151;generates profits for the industry. I am not against people making profits, and more profit will be made when the products are sold to a larger market, which will be possible under the commonality of the rules that will apply throughout the European Union. However, we must ensure that there is no medical risk from the products, which is why the precautionary principle is right, and that we base our recommendations to people on daily doses of vitamins, for example, on well established scientific principles. Although I do not accuse everyone in the field or every supporter of this, an element of mumbo-jumbo is involved in the belief element of the way in which the products work, which can be dangerous in certain circumstances.

<p><a name="st_288"><a name="50125-34_spnew4"><b> Mr. William Cash  (Stone) (Con):</b> 
 I declare a past interest because during the 1970s, I was involved in the field of complementary and alternative medicine as a lawyer. In about 1973, the acupuncturists came to see me, and I later discovered that there was a vast amount of discrimination against chiropractors, homeopaths and others in such fields. In those days, it was contrary to the rules of professional ethics of the General Medical Council for a doctor to refer to an osteopath. One can thus gauge the extent of the changes that have taken place, because many doctors today practise therapies that are generally described as complementary medicine. I am sure that most people think that that is beneficial and advantageous. Indeed, if we go back to the time of the Medical Act of 1853&#151;I think&#151;people who went on to the medical register, if there was such a thing, had virtually no qualifications of any description, so I think that we have made enormous progress.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50125-34_para9">
<a name="stpa_358">I was slightly worried when the hon. Member for High Peak (Tom Levitt) said that everything would be done in accordance with well established scientific principles. I am an administrative lawyer, among other things, which is why I intervened on the Minister to ask how decisions will be arrived at. When such scientific decisions&#151;they are well outside my knowledge&#151;are taken, we need to ensure that that is done properly. Nevertheless, there is great prejudice and bias against many aspects of the field, which is reflected by what I discovered regarding osteopaths in the 1970s and what I know from having been extremely closely professionally involved with it for many years, although I am not now.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50125-34_para10">
<a name="stpa_359">In the 1980s, the British Medical Association attempted to ban alternative medicine, and was supported by the medical profession at the time. The response from 150&nbsp;Members of Parliament put an end to that sort of virulent opposition to complementary and alternative medicine. It seems to me, on the balance of the evidence&#151;looking at the experience of my constituents and of people I know who have benefited&#151;that a great deal of good has come from alternative medicine.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50125-34_para11">
<a name="stpa_360">Having said that, I ask again: how do the &quot;difficult&quot; nutrients get on to the positive list? By &quot;difficult&quot; nutrients, I mean those that are causing disputes between the various parties. That question has not yet been clearly answered. The EFSA has its own procedures and mechanisms and the point that I have been probing, but on which I have not yet received a reply, is that there appears to be a considerable body of opinion among the advisory councils that tends to be less than objective in arriving at decisions. It is important that we know who makes appointments to those bodies, the principles on which they operate, whether they are entirely devoid of conflicts of interest and what decision-making process is used in determining whether a dossier will lead to a ban. I need not enlarge on that point, as I have dealt with it in interventions.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50125-34_para12">
<a name="stpa_361">One point that I do not think has been mentioned in the debate&#151;forgive me if it has, Mr. Deputy Speaker&#151;is that today the European Court of Justice is to make a decision on the challenge passed to it by the High Court about a year ago. The case raises some important questions. If the Court decides in favour of the Government and decides that the regulations are effective, what would the Opposition be able to do about 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>25 Jan 2005 : Column 257</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>it if we took a contrary view? On the other hand, what would happen if the decision, based on the arguments advanced in the case, went against the Government and the regulations had to be repealed? The answer to the second question is simple: if the Court decides that a directive and the regulations based on it are defective or ultra vires&#151;whatever grounds it uses&#151;according to the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality, that is the end of the matter. However, it is not the end of the matter for the UK Parliament, or for the many thousands of people who want their views to be reflected in the repeal of the regulations.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50125-34_para13">
<a name="stpa_362">I was therefore delighted to see the terms of the Conservative motion, because not only does it call for renegotiation of the food supplements directive, but it indicates a willingness to


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_88">&quot;repeal the regulations if the renegotiation does not reach a satisfactory compromise to protect the interests of consumers and manufacturers in the United Kingdom.&quot;</p>

<p>
<a name="50125-34_para14">
<a name="stpa_363">We could say the same about fisheries and over-regulation. I would argue that we could say the same about the European treaties, as well. The European Union Bill is to be introduced tomorrow. The question I put to the Prime Minister the other day is: what will he do if there is a no vote in the referendum? Will he return to the issue that is before us? Will he do what is necessary to give effect to the will of the British people as expressed either in a referendum or by a vote in the House? That is the crucial democratic question that faces us all in the House and outside it. It happens to arise, as a matter of principle, under the provisions of the measures that we are discussing in the motion. The issue is whether we are able to repeal the regulations if renegotiation does not reach a satisfactory compromise. The short answer is: yes we can.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50125-34_para15">
<a name="stpa_364">I do not intend and I do not need to go through all the reasons for that. There will be time enough to consider these matters both in respect of the European Union Bill, which will be presented tomorrow, and also the Constitutional Reform Bill, to which I have tabled some amendments, which is to be discussed in a Committee of the whole House next week.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50125-34_para16">
<a name="stpa_365">The fact that we are prepared to state that we would repeal the regulations, if it becomes necessary to do so, is a fundamental constitutional matter that the House, as a whole, must address. It arises, for example, in relation to immigration and asylum. The Minister for Energy and E-Commerce, who is to reply, has a great deal of experience in this area. He knows exactly what I am talking about. There are answers to these questions and there are two bodies of jurisprudence. There is the jurisprudence of the European Court of Justice, which is considering this challenge today. It says, under the case of Costa <i>v</i>. ENEL 1964, that the European Court&#151;this is endorsed by another case called Simmentahl&#151;has the right to decide the issue of the superiority or supremacy of legislation in terms of its jurisdiction as against the laws and the constitutions of member states.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50125-34_para17">
<a name="stpa_366">On the other hand, we have a tradition, which is based on the fact that Parliament can decide by a subsequent clear and unambiguous enactment passed after the European Communities Act 1972, not only that we can&#151;this is in line with McCarthy&#039;s <i>v.</i> Smith involving Lord Denning, and Lord Justice Laws in the Metric Martyrs case&#151;make such provision as we wish but, in addition to that, the judges are under an obligation to

<br>&nbsp;<br>give effect to that law as passed by Parliament, providing that it is clear and unambiguous. The Factortame case is based on the 1972&nbsp;Act and, therefore, is within the general rubric of what I have described.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50125-34_para18">
<a name="stpa_367">We are dealing, perhaps for the first time, with a serious motion that raises the question of the Conservative party being prepared to go down the route of stating on the Floor of the House, in line with what I have been arguing for the past few years, including when I was in my previous position, that it is open to us to be able to repeal or amend legislation that is inconsistent with that which has arisen from the 1972&nbsp;Act. I do not need to enlarge on that any further. The importance of what we are discussing cannot be underestimated.

<a name="50125-35_para0">
<a name="stpa_368">This debate has been raging since I was elected in 1997, starting with vitamin B6, and coming through to where we are today. Whenever I have tabled an early-day motion on this subject or whenever I have participated in a debate on the matter, there has been cross-party liaison.

<a name="stpa_369">I cannot support the motion of the hon. Member for Epsom and Ewell (Chris Grayling) for one reason, much as I have sympathy with it. In my view, what the Conservatives are trying to do is practically impossible. This all started with the European elections on 10&nbsp;June. Until then, the issue went across the parties. On 10&nbsp;June, the Conservatives decided to bang it on their website and use this issue to recruit people. Ever since then, the Conservatives have made the issue a party political one. Since 10&nbsp;June, and even before then, early-day motions have been tabled by six Conservative Members, who did not attempt to enlist the support of members of other parties, as I did when I tabled early-day motions on the subject.

<a name="50125-35_para3">
<a name="stpa_371">Many of my patients take supplements, vitamins, minerals, food additives and so on, and, like the significant number of my constituents who have written to me about the issue, they believe that they derive great benefit from them. That has an effect on health care, as some people would rather take over-the-counter supplements and vitamins than trouble their GP, go to casualty or phone NHS Direct. The public therefore regard the majority of vitamins and supplements as a good thing&#151;so in that sense I do not oppose their use, as they serve a useful purpose in society. However, that 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>25 Jan 2005 : Column 259</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>does not mean that there are no problems, and I should like to make a couple of remarks on the subject as a practising GP. The hon. Member for North Thanet (Mr. Gale) pointed out that if supplements were not available over the counter people would resort to the internet. However, the internet is already full of drugs that should not be available in that way. I am sure that, like me, hon. Members are bombarded daily with internet adverts to buy anything from tranquillisers to drugs for erectile dysfunction and dangerous drugs to modify obesity, all of which can have deleterious effects. To say that the internet would be used as a refuge to sell supplements is a mistake, as we already have to deal with the problem. That argument only confuses the issue, and does not clarify it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50125-35_para4">
<a name="stpa_372">I am worried about the way in which some supplements are taken. They are rarely taken in a standardised form or dose. The scientific evidence on their effectiveness and side effects is often unclear. As a GP, I often suggest to a patient that they take a particular drug to modify their illness and they will ask whether it is all right to take it with the vitamins, minerals and supplements that they are already taking. The simple truth is that I do not have the faintest idea. Up and down the land, patients want to know whether it is all right to take supplements with the drugs that their GPs recommend for heart conditions, diabetes, blood pressure and so on, but we simply do not have the evidence.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50125-35_para5">
<a name="stpa_373">As a scientist and someone who feels strongly that we need scientific research and data to back up the claims that we make, I believe that anything that can improve scientific knowledge about things that people take is for the best. I cannot check drug interactions with supplements and minerals, as there are not any research papers or evidence. I can check on my computer for drug interactions, but they will not show up there; I can check the established medical directories on drug interactions, but they will not be listed there. I simply do not know whether those drugs have a deleterious effect in combination with the drugs that I prescribe. If someone comes back to me with possible side effects, I do not know whether they are caused by the drug that I prescribed or by the interaction between my drug and other things that the patient is taking, and on which I have neither data nor knowledge. It can therefore be hazardous if people take those drugs in a non-standard form, or if they do not know the recommended dose. The House has legitimate concerns about that issue, which should be flagged up.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50125-35_para6">
<a name="stpa_374">Finally, some of those minerals have side effects. I have seen at least two patients in my medical career who had taken high doses of vitamin B6&#151;certainly higher than the current recommended maximum dose&#151;and had suffered neurological side effects. Fortunately, when those two patients stopped taking vitamin B6&nbsp; the side effects went away, but at the time there were worrying side effects from the doses that they were taking.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50125-35_para7">
<a name="stpa_375">I do not wish to detain the House any further. I merely point out that there are issues, particularly as regards interactions with other drugs, which need to be considered carefully when the House makes decisions on these matters.

The matter affects an estimated 41&nbsp;per cent. of adults in the UK&#151;21&nbsp;million consumers&#151;and an industry worth &#163;335&nbsp;million. There was a petition that gained more than a million signatures and a postcard campaign, of which all of us, as constituency MPs, have seen evidence. Health food shops in every high street in the country carried posters and took the campaign on board. As my hon. Friend said earlier, this debate comes at a crucial time, with the case before the European Court today.

<a name="stpa_383">I am sure that hon. Members will, like me, have been deluged with e-mails and calls from constituents ahead of today&#039;s debate. Let me mention a few that I have received in the past few hours:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_89">&quot;This ban is ridiculous. It is a medical fact that vitamins and minerals form a vital and necessary part of our diet. As modern farming methods involve a large amount of chemicals, these naturally occurring vitamins and minerals become less and less potent.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="50125-35_para16">
<a name="stpa_384">Another constituent says:

</ul>
<p>

<p>
<a name="50125-35_para17">
<a name="stpa_385">Another says:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_91">&quot;Many people find enormous benefit to their health from supplementation, unlike the many problems caused by the pharmaceutical drugs prescribed widely.&quot;</p>

<a name="stpa_386">The representations go on and on; I have received many examples in just the past couple of days.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50125-35_para19">
<a name="stpa_387">If the directive is allowed to go through unchanged and with the full compliance of the British Government, up to 5,000&nbsp;products could be banned from 1&nbsp;August this year. As my hon. Friend the Member for Epsom and Ewell said, if there is a real fear that items are unsafe, why do the Government not remove them from the shelves now rather than wait until 1&nbsp;August? What are the dangers? We asked the Minister, but she came back with the absurd contention that we must prove the safety of an item before we have to prove its danger.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50125-35_para20">
<a name="stpa_388">What we do know is the names of the eminent clinicians on the European Commission&#039;s scientific committee on food who have prepared the directive. If one looks at some of the individual parts of the directive, one sees that it does not raise specific implications and concerns; it raises possibilities. On the basis of those possibilities, 5,000&nbsp;products are to disappear from our shelves.

 I am grateful to my hon. Friend for giving way; I appreciate that he is short of time. Will he share with the House his appreciation of the likely loss of employment both to my constituents and others from what is being done, which is so ill defined and difficult to justify?
</p>








<p><a name="st_293"><a name="50125-36_spnew1"><b> Tim Loughton: </b> 
 Absolutely. That is why I said that this was a &#163;335&nbsp;million industry, so a lot of jobs will be affected, in addition to people who use the products.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50125-36_para0">
<a name="stpa_389">What discussions took place between the Department of Health and the Commission as to the level of supposed risk and whether a full ban is appropriate for this country? How many of the 533,527&nbsp;people who died in the UK in 2002, as is catalogued on the Department of Health website, died as a result of having too much Solgar&#039;s pre-natal nutrient or popping too many folic acid pills? What recorded side effects result from direct consumption of various cocktails or quantities of any of the threatened supplements? The Minister could name none. What risk assessments have been carried out, compared with the benefits that many users, such as my sportsman constituents claim to get? What are the precedents for using the positive lists on which nutrients and nutrient sources must now feature before being permissible? When did we concede the principle that all supplements are guilty until proven innocent?
</p>

<p>
<a name="50125-36_para1">
<a name="stpa_390">The fact is that there is no evidence for this move and no proven danger in a harmless lifestyle choice in which millions of our constituents have opted to indulge for many years, unfettered by Government and allowed the freedom to make their own choices.

In Committee, we heard that that product was banned on the basis of seven cases over the past 10&nbsp;or 12&nbsp;years across the entire world. Not one single liver biopsy could be produced in evidence and the prime suspect was an 86-year-old who died in his sleep and had apparently taken a kava kava pill at some time in the past.

<a name="stpa_392">Consumers are being denied their right to take responsibility for their health by using safe and popular specialist supplements of their choice.

<a name="stpa_393">Where is the choice in this blanket ban? What is the evidence of danger to public health? What is proposed is grossly disproportionate.

</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_93">&quot;The Government are saying one thing to consumers, to industry and to Parliament, while pursuing a quite different course in its negotiations with the EU.&quot;</p>

<a name="50125-36_para5">
<a name="stpa_394">The Government are being wholly duplicitous. They have the power at least to delay implementation in the UK, or they could use the UK&#039;s presidency of the EU to renegotiate the directive, as our motion states, but they refuse to do either of those things.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50125-36_para6">
<a name="stpa_395">Whom does the directive benefit? It does not benefit the 21&nbsp;million adult users or the supplement industry, which is worth &#163;335&nbsp;million. What about the big drug companies, which are lining up in favour of the directive as they muscle out the smaller players? As today&#039;s <i>Daily Mail</i> puts it:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_94">&quot;There&#039;s a clue in the contents of that approved list&#151;by and large, vitamins and minerals produced by big drug companies are on it, while ones made by small specialist firms are not.&quot;</p>

<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="50125-36_para7">
<a name="stpa_396">The directive panders to this Government&#039;s increasing nanny state tendencies&#151;if you can&#039;t control it, ban it; if big business does not like it, restrict it; and if Europe does not want it, do not resist and comply&#151;fast.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50125-36_para8">
<a name="stpa_397">The real fear is what comes next. The Government&#039;s own submission for today&#039;s case in the European Court totally reverses the UK Government&#039;s position and states that the directive is both &quot;proportionate&quot; and a &quot;good starting point&quot;. Spinach contains high levels of naturally occurring folic acid. Surely there is a danger of overdosing on spinach, so the spinach roulade had better come off the new Labour menu. Too many Rice Krispies, which contain extra niacin, vitamin B6&nbsp;and riboflavin, will make you go snap, crackle and pop&#151;surely Rice Krispies should be for the chop.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50125-36_para9">
<a name="stpa_398">Apart from all the problems with imports and the internet, how will the directive be enforced? Can we look forward to a network of secret cells of pregnant women who get together in the dead of night to feed their now illicit habit of popping Solgar pre-natal nutrient tablets? They will have to masquerade as the modern-day equivalent of the now-defunct Tupperware party to foil the possibility of police raids&#151;Mrs. Smith from No. 31&nbsp;stands guard as Mrs. Miggins from No. 57&nbsp;smuggles in a false-bottomed Ovaltine jar containing Solgar pills, secreted in the lining of her Liberty-print maternity dress. Will we see special flying squads of supplement-busting police lining up alongside police traffic patrols to blood-test drivers for suspiciously high levels of boron in the bloodstream? Will border patrols be stepped up, with cannabis-sniffing dogs retrained to detect traces of evening primrose oil smuggled in illicitly from countries outside the EU?
</p>

<p>
<a name="50125-36_para10">
<a name="stpa_399">The trouble is that the police are too busy preparing to chase people in pink coats on horseback, knocking on doors demanding to search for red marks on children&#039;s backsides and arresting dutiful husbands who change a plug socket in their kitchen at the infinitesimal risk of harming themselves. The whole prospect is absurd nonsense, and it would be laughable if the regulations that we are debating today were anything other than a real and imminent threat to the liberty of responsible grown-ups who have chosen to supplement their diets with vitamins and other non-prescription medications, because they believe that those products do more good than harm&#151;if people believed otherwise, they would not buy such products.

The directive is a solution looking for a problem, but the problem exists only in the petty, nannying, bureaucratic, Euro-subservient minds of Ministers, who are out of touch with their constituents and what ordinary people choose to do with their own lives, and out of credibility when they discuss freedom and choice. This is dodgy science from a dodgy Government; hon. Members should have none of it and vote for the cross-party motion.

In fact, the Conservatives were quite careful in their choice of words&#151;they said that these products &quot;could&quot; or &quot;may&quot; be banned, raising fears without actually saying that they will be banned.

 Is not the problem with the Conservatives, as typified by the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham (Tim Loughton), that they completely reject the spirit of scientific inquiry?

<p><a name="st_302"><a name="50125-37_spnew5"><b> Mr. O&#039;Brien: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is right. This is to do with the extent to which we develop consumer protection. We want to do that in a sensible way that not only allows people to have a wide choice in the supplements that they use but reassures them that those products are safe. In respect of products that might fall outside one of the prescribed lists, there is a procedure that can prevent that from happening, at least until 2009,&nbsp;and in many cases, indefinitely.

</p>

<p>
<a name="50125-37_para1">
<a name="stpa_405">In the negotiations, we got much of what the industry requested. The directive is sufficiently flexible to ensure that no vitamin or mineral that is currently on sale in British shops must cease to be sold after 1&nbsp;August. Either the ingredients are on one of the two prescribed lists or a dossier can be submitted that enables them to be assessed as safe by the European Food Safety Agency, in which case they can continue to be on sale until 2009. Provided that they are found to be safe, they can continue to be on sale indefinitely.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50125-37_para2">
<a name="stpa_406">I shall consider the best approach for the industry and consumers shortly. First, let me deal with Conservative claims that we can reopen negotiations or revoke the directive. Conservative Members offer revocation as a false panacea, although I noticed that, when repeatedly pressed by the hon. Member for Stone to commit to revoking the directive, the hon. Member for Epsom and Ewell (Chris Grayling) wriggled and writhed out of promising consumers that they would do that. They propose revocation in the motion but failed to say that they would do it when asked by the hon. Member for Stone.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50125-37_para3">
<a name="stpa_407">I invite the hon. Member for Epsom and Ewell to intervene and say what he failed to say when he was repeatedly asked to do so earlier. I offer him the opportunity. He will not take it. Why has he tabled a motion that he is not prepared to defend? The answer is cynicism. It may serve the short-term purposes of the Eurosceptic Tory party in the run-up to a general election but it will cost the taxpayer and the consumer dear.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50125-37_para4">
<a name="stpa_408">If we did as the motion suggests, we would be in serious breach of obligations under the European Communities treaties and the Single European Act, to which past Conservative Governments signed up. We would attract infraction proceedings from the European Commission and taxpayers would be likely to be hit by heavy fines. Other member states could also initiate action under article 227&nbsp;and, ultimately, the UK would be obliged to enforce the directive or take the route that the hon. Member for Stone offers: withdrawal from Europe. Revocation would leave us in a weaker position because we would be unlikely to have submitted the important dossiers to keep the products on the market. Clearly, that would damage the industry in the long term.

</p>

<p>
<a name="50125-37_para5">
<a name="stpa_409">Let me consider the idea of renegotiating the directive. To do that, we would need a qualified majority of member states. The only likely qualified majority at the moment is for a more restrictive directive. The trade associations urged the UK Government to support the directive at the conclusion of the negotiations three years ago because it was clear that we had got as many concessions as we were likely to get. If we pushed any further, things would become much more restrictive.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50125-37_para6">
<a name="stpa_410">The only two countries with a similar market to that of the UK for vitamins and minerals are Ireland and Holland. Neither country has asked to reopen negotiations on the directive. Even if they were reopened, we would be faced with a vast majority of member states that sought a more restrictive outcome, not the more liberal result that the Conservatives promise. We got several concessions in the initial 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>25 Jan 2005 : Column 267</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>negotiation and Conservatives&#039; proposals would put them at risk. Consumers who rely on the supplements would be at risk because of Conservative policy.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50125-37_para7">
<a name="stpa_411">The concessions include time scales for implementation, the ability to keep products on the market until the EFSA had ruled on them, and the guarantee that the dossier presented by 12&nbsp;July need not be exhaustive. We also got a substantial lead-in time to enable our industry to present its arguments on vitamins and minerals.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50125-37_para8">
<a name="stpa_412">On the presidency, the Conservatives have left it a bit late to make their requests. The law is effective from 1&nbsp;August, a month after the start of the UK presidency. The idea that we could renegotiate a complex directive, especially when most member states would want to be more restrictive, in the suggested time scale, is nonsense. The Conservatives are leading the consumer groups, the industry and the electorate up the garden path. That is why I reject the scare stories that Conservatives peddle to appease their Eurosceptic wing. Their motion does not even reflect their policy, for which they are not prepared to stand up.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50125-37_para9">
<a name="stpa_413">Our aim is to ensure that the directive is implemented in a way that allows consumers to continue to use the products that they use now.

<p><a name="st_318"><i>Motion made, and Question proposed,</i> That this House do now adjourn.&#151;<i>[Joan Ryan.]</i></p>








<a name="time_30">
<a name="50125-39_time1"><h5>7.30&nbsp;pm</h5>




<p><a name="st_319"><a name="50125-39_spnew1"><b> Mr. Mark Hendrick  (Preston) (Lab/Co-op):</b> 
 It is an indication of the fast-changing world in the 21st century that I rise to debate a subject that 10&nbsp;years ago would not have been an issue, because the internet was in its infancy. We live in a digital age&#151;an information age&#151;that has revolutionised communications to the huge benefit of mankind. However, all new technological developments, such as nuclear power, genetic engineering and computer technology generally, can be put to bad and evil uses as well as to good ones.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50125-39_para2">
<a name="stpa_423">The internet, chat rooms and e-mail enable people who are thousands of miles apart to communicate with each other at a cost that most people can afford and with a high degree of anonymity. That means that we now live in a society in which our neighbour in the apartment next door may be less well known than someone we converse with in a chat room thousands of miles away. That has dangers as well as advantages.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50125-39_para3">
<a name="stpa_424">In addition, cyberspace has become a powerful medium in which to sell products and services. It does not respect national boundaries or national legislation and, by its very nature, it can conceal the physical location of the source of internet information and, of course, the author of such information. To legislate to regulate and control such an environment is a major challenge if we are to prevent the internet from being misused to damage people&#039;s lives and livelihoods.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50125-39_para4">
<a name="stpa_425">The use of the internet to promote suicide is a growing problem. I use the word &quot;promote&quot; advisedly, because certain websites, written publications, organisations and individuals are encouraging people to commit suicide, for whatever reason. The tragic death of 19-year-old Sarah Cherry in Lancashire late last year is the case that first brought my attention to this tragic phenomenon. Early-day motion 170,&nbsp;tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for South Ribble (Mr. Borrow), highlighted the case of Sarah who, after discussing suicide in an internet chat room, purchased a book from Amazon.com on how to commit suicide and subsequently killed herself. My hon. Friend, in his early-day motion, called for legal action to be taken against those who write, publish or sell material or distribute information on the internet about how to commit suicide. I echo that call.
</p>








<p><a name="st_320"><a name="50125-39_spnew2"><b> Mr. Lindsay Hoyle  (Chorley) (Lab):</b> 
 Our regional newspaper, the <i>Lancashire Evening Post,</i> and its campaign &quot;Stop the peddlers of death&quot; have highlighted this and other tragic cases of suicide. Does my hon. Friend agree that libraries that stock manuals to encourage suicide should remove them from their shelves immediately?
</p>








<p><a name="st_321"><a name="50125-39_spnew3"><b> Mr. Hendrick: </b> 
 I agree with my hon. Friend. I was about to come to the point he makes about libraries. In fact, Lancashire county libraries have taken the book &quot;Final Exit&quot; from their shelves. It is the same book that Sarah Cherry acquired from Amazon.com. Although it has been withdrawn from the shelves, Amazon.com has refused calls not to sell it and persists in selling it over the internet.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>25 Jan 2005 : Column 277</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50125-39_para5">
<a name="stpa_426">Although that case brought the matter to my attention, the problem is more widespread than most people imagine&#151;so much so that, as my hon. Friend said, the <i>Lancashire Evening Post</i> has taken it up. The newspaper has raised the matter with local MPs, including myself, the right hon. Member for Fylde (Mr. Jack), whom I am happy to see in the Chamber, and my hon. Friends the Members for Chorley (Mr. Hoyle) and for South Ribble.
</p>








<p><a name="st_322"><a name="50125-39_spnew4"><b> Mr. Michael Jack  (Fylde) (Con):</b> 
 Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the publicity that the <i>Lancashire Evening Post</i> afforded the campaign addresses another crucial dimension of the matter&#151;making parents aware of what their sons and daughters might be up to when using the internet? The internet offers a private method of communication, but if people have it in their nature that suicide is a possibility, does he agree that the more parents who know about the problem through campaigns such as that in the newspaper, the better?
</p>








<p><a name="st_323"><a name="50125-39_spnew5"><b> Mr. Hendrick: </b> 
 I agree with the right hon. Gentleman. Parents should be made aware of the situation and, as I shall say later, it is important for the Government to do more to make people aware. Internet service providers should consider providing filters to help to tackle the problem, as they do for illegal pornography.
</p>








<p><a name="st_324"><a name="50125-39_spnew6"><b> Mr. Paul Tyler  (North Cornwall) (LD):</b> 
 The north-west is not the only region that faces the problem. There was a tragic incident in my constituency, as a result of which an organisation called PAPYRUS&#151;I think that the hon. Gentleman will be aware of it&#151;has tried to bring together parents who have suffered such tragedies after young people have been affected by information from the internet. I know that there is national concern about the situation, which supports his initiative tonight.
</p>








<p><a name="st_325"><a name="50125-39_spnew7"><b> Mr. Hendrick: </b> 
 I concur with the hon. Gentleman. I shall cite the organisation to which he referred during my speech.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50125-39_para6">
<a name="stpa_427">I have researched the matter and it is abundantly clear that the Suicide Act 1961&nbsp;is woefully inadequate to deal with the use of the internet for the promotion of suicide. I say that for the reasons that I have outlined: cyberspace does not respect national boundaries or legislation, and both the physical location and author of a source of information can be concealed.

 I hope that my hon. Friend appreciates that 78&nbsp;hon. Members have signed early-day motion 170, which indicates the tremendous strength of feeling about the matter in the House. When he talks about cyberspace having no limits, does he agree that there are no limits on age? Young people at a vulnerable age&#151;as young as 11, 12&nbsp;or 13&#151;could access the information. It is especially depraved to target such young people.

<a name="stpa_428">Wesley J. Smith, a senior fellow at the Discovery institute in Seattle, has done much work on the matter. In an article of 12&nbsp;June 2003&nbsp;on www.suicide.com entitled &quot;Suicide Advocacy Goes Online&quot;, he notes that suicide promotion and facilitation has entered cyberspace and cites an article by Julia Scheeres from the <i>San Francisco Chronicle</i> of 8&nbsp;June 2003. Wesley J. Smith&#039;s article says:

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_102">&quot;In &#039;A Virtual Path to Suicide,&#039; Scheeres demonstrates how indifferent to the value of human life certain segments of our society have grown, and how callous they are when faced with a despairing person wishing to commit suicide. First, they bestow moral permission. Then, they teach the self-destructive person how to do it. Finally, they keep the suicidal person company until the deed is done. It is the modern version of the howling crowd yelling, &#039;Jump! Jump!&#039; at the suicidal person standing on the skyscraper window ledge.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_103">This is what happened to 19-year-old Suzy Gonzales. Despite having a full scholarship at Florida State University and a loving family, Gonzales wanted to kill herself. Her suicide was set in motion when she found an Internet site whose participants &#039;view suicide as a civil right that anyone should be able to exercise, for any reason.&#039; On the site, Scheeres reports, &#039;Gonzales found people who told her that suicide was an acceptable way to end her despair, and who gave her instructions on how to obtain a lethal dose of potassium cyanide and mix it into a deadly cocktail.&#039;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.

<a name="stpa_430">The phenomenon of so-called copycat suicides and suicide pacts is emerging more and more on the internet. In Japan, two men and a woman were victims of a suicide internet website just before the new year. The three young victims, who were not named, suffocated themselves by burning disposable barbecue coals in a car in Mitama in Yamanashi on 30&nbsp;December. The method&#151;one of the latest to circulate in the suicide internet community&#151;is disturbingly similar to the one used by a Lancashire man in August 2004. He died from carbon monoxide poisoning after suffocating himself by burning disposable barbecue coals.

<p>
<a name="50125-40_para3">
<a name="stpa_431">Japan has been hit by a series of suicide pacts formed in suicide chat rooms. A fortnight before the death of the three young people in Mitama, four men died in a Tokyo apartment following a suicide pact. Early in 2004&nbsp;another six people were found dead and nine more fell victim to an internet group suicide in October. According to Japan&#039;s police force, a staggering 45&nbsp;people committed suicide in groups after meeting online between January 2003&nbsp;and June 2004.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50125-40_para4">
<a name="stpa_432">Suicide pacts have been made over the internet since the late 1990s and have been reported worldwide, from Guam to the Netherlands. Experts say that they tend to occur in cycles, with news of group suicides sparking copycat incidents, which are discussed on websites. On new year&#039;s day this year, an e-mailer to the notorious US-based ASH&#151;alt.suicide.holiday&#151;newsgroup, where people discuss suicide methods, revealed that a 15-year-old girl had used a method detailed on an associated online list of suicide methods to kill herself.

Getting into contact with people that way is perilous, because people cannot be sure to whom they are talking via a message board or in a chat room&#151;particularly people who are vulnerable and suicidal. There may be contact with a person who gains some form of perverse pleasure from convincing someone that they should kill themselves.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50125-40_para6">
<a name="stpa_434">These cases raise a series of questions about how people should conduct themselves when using the internet and what sort of conduct should be allowable. I shall not stray into human rights, because I do not believe that there is a case to answer in terms of people having the right to commit suicide or to encourage others to do so. The human rights arguments might hold some sway in the United States, where groups claim that they can conduct such activities legally and that they are protected by the first amendment to the American constitution, which relates to freedom of speech, but the same is not true in this country. However, I do have some questions to which I hope the Minister will be able to respond.

I understand from PAPYRUS, which is an organisation that was set up to prevent young suicides, that suicide sites are not mentioned in any of the Government&#039;s relevant publicity material. Nor are suicide sites mentioned in the national suicide strategy for England. What will the Government do to discourage people from accessing suicide sites, and will they encourage people to seek help?

<a name="stpa_436">Would the Government consider setting up a regulatory body to which concerns about websites that may be offensive or harmful can be reported, and pressure the Internet Watch Foundation to act where it can? Should people be guided by the internet service providers to &quot;help&quot; websites first, before allowing access to suicide methods and information, and how can the Government persuade internet service providers to do that?
</p>

<p>
<a name="50125-40_para9">
<a name="stpa_437">Will the Government consider the case for prohibiting access to suicide sites altogether through filtering?

The legislation there includes a maximum penalty of 110,000 Australian dollars, or &#163;45,000, for an individual. The offences cover the use of a carriage service, including the internet, to access, transmit or make available materials that counsel or incite suicide.

<a name="stpa_440">I am sure that the so-called peddlers of death can hide behind internet chat rooms and carefully constructed rhetorical arguments that are meant to mask their macabre fantasies, but it is the duty of elected representatives and Government to do everything in their power to pursue, prohibit and prosecute these promoters of suicide, even if the internet environment makes that task more difficult.

 I begin by congratulating my hon. Friend the Member for Preston (Mr. Hendrick) on securing this debate on an issue which I know arouses considerable interest. That was evidenced by the fact that a number of hon. Members have contributed to the debate.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50125-40_para14">
<a name="stpa_442">The Government are well aware of the growing concern about suicide websites and chat rooms that can provide information and potential influence over vulnerable young people who may feel encouraged to take their own lives. I hope that my hon. Friend will be reassured that Ministers have already been contacted by PAPYRUS, an organisation that has twice been mentioned this evening. It is a UK charity that is committed to suicide prevention, as part of its wider campaign to raise awareness of the potential dangers of such websites.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50125-40_para15">
<a name="stpa_443">In July last year, my colleague Baroness Scotland, the Minister of State, met members of PAPYRUS and a cross-party delegation of Members to discuss their concerns. My colleague has since corresponded with them about what the Government are doing to try to tackle this complex problem.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50125-40_para16">
<a name="stpa_444">Perhaps I should emphasise at the outset that while my remarks will reflect the complex nature of the law in this area, I have the greatest sympathy for those whose lives and families have been touched by the tragedy of suicide.

<p><a name="st_329"><a name="50125-41_spnew0"><b> Mr. Tyler: </b> 
 I was a member of the delegation that met Baroness Scotland. As the Minister has said, it was a useful meeting for those of us who went with PAPYRUS. The point that she made forcefully&#151;I hope that the Minister will acknowledge this&#151;is that this is a classic case of joined-up Government. It has been necessary to deal with a number of problems. The Department for Education and Skills and the Department of Health are clearly the front Departments concerned. I hope that the Minister will acknowledge 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>25 Jan 2005 : Column 281</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>that there is an important role to be played by a number of Departments if we are to be successful in dealing with the problem.

<p><a name="st_330"><a name="50125-41_spnew1"><b> Paul Goggins: </b> 
 I agree very strongly with the hon. Gentleman, and I shall deal later with the various responsibilities that we all have.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50125-41_para0">
<a name="stpa_445">We have heard from the parents of a number of young people who have killed themselves after visiting such websites. To lose a child in such circumstances is devastating, and it is vital that we do all that we can to raise awareness of the issue and prevent other young people from taking the same course. Of course, the problem is not confined to websites. As the tragic case of Sarah Cherry illustrates, information about suicide and suicide methods is available through other media, including books. Sarah took her own life after buying a book from the internet bookstore Amazon bearing the appalling title, &quot;Final Exit: The Practicalities of Self-Deliverance and Assisted Suicide for the Dying&quot;. That publication could equally have been obtained through any high street bookstore, but the internet clearly makes it easier than ever before for people to obtain such material.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50125-41_para1">
<a name="stpa_446">I am aware of the concern expressed by the Preston coroner that such books are in circulation. My hon. Friend the Member for South Ribble (Mr. Borrow) has tabled early-day motion 170, which has so far attracted 77&nbsp;signatures. Many of the concerns about this issue have been directed at the Home Office, which has clear responsibility for the criminal law on assisted suicide as well as for policy on law enforcement relating to hi-tech crime. Other Government Departments also have a role to play. In particular, the Department of Health has responsibility for the Government&#039;s suicide prevention strategy, which was published in September 2002&nbsp;and aims to reduce the death rate from suicide by one fifth by 2010.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50125-41_para2">
<a name="stpa_447">The Department for Education and Skills, through the superhighway safety initiative, provides important advice to teachers, parents and children to reduce the risks of schoolchildren being exposed to inappropriate content and contact via the internet. The Department of Trade and Industry has responsibility for ensuring that the United Kingdom is a market leader in the e-business sector, and that the relevant legislation is conducive to that aim. The Government&#039;s clear view is that actions are legal or illegal according to their merits, rather than according to the medium used. What is illegal offline should also be illegal online. While there is not any specific legislation relating solely to the internet, a range of existing UK law covers what online or offline actions constitute an offence, including the Obscene Publications Acts, public order and harassment offences, fraud and copyright offences.

<p><a name="st_331"><a name="50125-41_spnew2"><b> Mr. Hendrick: </b> 
 How could existing legislation be used against people who propagate this stuff from another country, not just from England and Wales, to which the Suicide Act 1961&nbsp;refers?
</p>








<p><a name="st_332"><a name="50125-41_spnew3"><b> Paul Goggins: </b> 
 I will come to the Suicide Act in a moment, but my hon. Friend makes an important point. Even if we are successful in closing down websites or removing websites based in the UK that promote such material, it could be accessed from websites in other 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>25 Jan 2005 : Column 282</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>countries, which poses a substantial challenge. We must therefore work with other Governments and law enforcement agencies where appropriate to deal with the issue. The internet presents us with a global challenge, which we must meet with a global response.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50125-41_para3">
<a name="stpa_448">If an individual in the UK produces material on a suicide website, and in doing so commits an offence, the prosecuting authorities can take action against him and seek the removal of the material. The difficulty is that most material hosted on such sites, although considered distressing and distasteful by the majority, is not necessarily illegal. Suicide itself is not an offence, but section 2(1) of the Suicide Act makes it an offence to aid, abet, counsel or procure another person to commit or attempt suicide. For aiding and abetting to be proved, there must be participation in the act of suicide, as well as a knowledge of what is going to take place. Someone who counsels or procures is liable only for an act of suicide that is committed as a consequence of what he does, so there must be a causal connection between the counselling and procuring and the commission of the act. Establishing that causal link is fundamental to proving that an offence has occurred.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50125-41_para4">
<a name="stpa_449">If an individual helps someone to inject himself with a lethal drug or supplies the lethal drug knowing that it is required for the purpose of committing suicide, they could be charged with aiding and abetting. But simply providing information about suicide does not in itself necessarily amount to aiding, abetting, counselling or procuring, any more than providing information about ways to commit murder would constitute an offence. This is a crucial point. There are many works of reputable fiction which describe criminal activity, or indeed suicide, and thereby give an indication of how to commit the acts. Even though there is no intention to encourage them, they could in reality be the catalyst for someone who was on the brink.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50125-41_para5">
<a name="stpa_450">So the direct causal link must be clearly established, and it is highly unlikely that those producing these websites will participate in specific acts of suicide or know that they are going to take place. Similarly, in terms of counselling and procuring, it would be difficult to establish a causal link between the websites and the commission of actual suicides.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50125-41_para6">
<a name="stpa_451">An example of how this works in practice is the booklet published by the Voluntary Euthanasia Society, which describes the easiest and most painless ways of committing suicide. The court held that an offence would be committed only if the distributor intended that the booklet would be used by someone who was contemplating suicide, and that the individual was in fact assisted or encouraged to do so. Although the content of suicide websites, and books such as the one purchased by Sarah Cherry, may well be considered more objectionable than the Voluntary Euthanasia Society booklet, it seems likely that the same interpretation would apply to those who produce them because, in essence, they are doing the same thing&#151;giving general information about ways to commit suicide.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50125-41_para7">
<a name="stpa_452">In practice, whether an offence is committed would depend not only on the actual content, but on factors such as whether there had been any communication between the authors of the material and the person who wanted to or did commit suicide. If anything, it might be 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>25 Jan 2005 : Column 283</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>even more difficult to prove than the Voluntary Euthanasia Society case, in which specific individuals were sent copies of booklets on request.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50125-41_para8">
<a name="stpa_453">There may be a greater likelihood of an offence being committed by users of the chat rooms that can be accessed through these websites, rather than those responsible for the sites themselves. For example, if a person asks in a chat room how to commit suicide, is told by someone else how to do it, and does in fact then commit or attempt to commit suicide, that individual may be guilty of aiding, abetting, counselling or procuring the suicide or attempted suicide&#151;although, as always, that would depend on the circumstances of the case.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50125-41_para9">
<a name="stpa_454">PAPYRUS has asked whether it would be possible to further test the law by bringing a case that would confirm whether the giving of information and general encouragement, whether through a website&#039;s actual content or by the user of a chat room accessed through the website, could be held to be aiding, abetting, counselling or procuring. It is, of course, for the courts 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>25 Jan 2005 : Column 284</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>to interpret the law, but we have drawn the concerns of PAPYRUS and others to the attention of the Attorney-General.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50125-41_para10">
<a name="stpa_455">As I said earlier, it is difficult to see how the law might be amended to prohibit these websites. Even leaving aside freedom of expression issues, it would be a radical departure to make it an offence simply to give general information about something that is not in itself illegal. There might also be unintended consequences for legitimate activities&#151;for example, criminalising crime fiction, or even websites that may be seeking to offer help to those who are contemplating suicide.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50125-41_para11">
<a name="stpa_456">In conclusion, there are many things that we must do and that we can do. I chair the taskforce on child protection on the internet, and there are read-across issues there. The Department of Health has a clear role to play. The internet service providers also have a role to play. They have various policies in place to try to provide additional protection in this difficult area. It is complex, there is no quick fix, but the Government are determined to do what they can to prevent this kind of dreadful suicide.
