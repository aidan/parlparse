<a name="stpa_o2">It is well known that moderate borrowing is necessary to bridge the years of under-investment in public services, which cannot be put right quickly. It will take years of sustained investment to address that historic under-investment. The hon. Gentleman&#039;s own party is entirely responsible for the circumstances that require that borrowing.

</p>








<p><a name="st_o4"><a name="50526-01_spnew3"><b> Mr. Browne: </b> 
 I thank my hon. Friend for his welcome. He is perfectly correct that we have had an unprecedented period of stability in the economy, which has allowed us the opportunity to make the investment in public services, and that is reflected in borrowing.

 The forecasts on all aspects of the United Kingdom economy are made regularly, and are quite transparent. Since the introduction of the new framework in 1997, forecasts have on average been cautious and inexorably have turned out to be correct. In recent years, Her Majesty&#039;s Treasury&#039;s forecasts have tended to be more accurate and cautious than many who have commented on them.

</p>








<p><a name="st_o8"><a name="50526-01_spnew7"><b> Mr. Browne: </b> 
 Of course, the bills for unemployment amounted to about &#163;5&nbsp;billion, which is more than was being spent on the schools budget when we came to power. My hon. Friend is perfectly correct about the stability and transparency that we have introduced into the economy, and the fact that our regular forecasts have consistently proved to be correct.

In relation to plan B in respect of tax, he said on the Radio 4 &quot;Today&quot; programme, on 24&nbsp;September 2004, before the election:

 (Lab): What proposals for debt relief the UK plans to bring forward during its&nbsp;presidency of the G7; and if he will make a statement. [991]
</p>



<p><a name="st_o11"><a name="50526-01_spmin1"><b>The Chancellor of the Exchequer  (Mr. Gordon Brown): </b> 
 Following the European Union agreement to double aid to 0.56&nbsp;per cent. of GDP by 2010, Britain will seek European Union and G7&nbsp;agreement on a debt relief package for 100&nbsp;per cent. relief for debts owed by poor countries to the international financial institutions. We will also seek agreement on a finance facility for vaccination, which could save the lives of 5&nbsp;million children by 2015, and for long-term finance to meet the millennium development goals. I hope that there will be all-party support for those initiatives.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o12"><a name="50526-01_spnew10"><b> Mr. Khan: </b> 
 My right hon. Friend the Chancellor recently had the pleasure of visiting Tooting and meeting local faith groups who did so much in the Jubilee 2000&nbsp;campaign to help to cancel debt. What advice would he give to the churches, mosques, temples and other communities in Tooting who want to work with this Labour Government finally to make poverty history?

 I thank all the churches and faith groups, not only in Britain but throughout the world for the work that they have done so far in putting the issue on the agenda. I was pleased to visit the constituency of my hon. Friend, and I welcome him to the House. I saw him playing his part in making the case for debt relief and increases in development aid. The next few weeks are vital for those of us who wish to see a reduction in global poverty. By the time of Gleneagles, I believe that we can achieve an historic agreement that will make possible greater aid and substantial debt relief. We have persuaded a large number of countries to join us, we need to persuade other countries over the next few weeks, and if we can do so, the agreement at Gleneagles will release billions of pounds to the poorest countries.

<p><a name="st_o14"><a name="50526-01_spnew12"><b> John Bercow  (Buckingham)</b> 
 (Con): Given that many in Burkina Faso, Mali and Chad depend on cotton for between 30&nbsp;and 40&nbsp;per cent. of their export earnings, does the Chancellor agree that the continued and extortionate subsidy by the United States of its inefficient cotton sector damages massively the western central African economies&#039; chances of meeting the millennium development goals? Does he accept that he will command support from the Opposition if he can use his influence with the Americans to bring an end to those subsidies and to give the poorest people in the world the chance to compete and to grow?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o15"><a name="50526-01_spnew13"><b> Mr. Brown: </b> 
 Overseas development aid amounts to $50&nbsp;billion a year, and trade subsidies by the richest countries, which discriminate against the poor, amount to $300&nbsp;billion a year. Whether in agriculture, sugar, or cotton and textiles, as the hon. Gentleman suggests, those discriminatory subsidies do huge harm to the poorest countries. That is why we look forward not only to the Gleneagles agreement on debt relief and aid but to the Hong Kong talks of the world trade agreement. Not for the first time this week, I find myself in agreement with the hon. Gentleman.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o16"><a name="50526-01_spnew14"><b> Sir Nicholas Winterton  (Macclesfield)</b> 
 (Con): May I warmly welcome the answer that the Chancellor gave to the original question on the Order Paper? Does he agree that bilateral aid between ourselves and a particular country can be much more effective than aid given through a third party? Will he seek to concentrate more of our aid through bilateral aid agreements with individual countries, such as those to which my hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham (John Bercow) referred, rather than seeking to channel more through third parties?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o17"><a name="50526-01_spnew15"><b> Mr. Brown: </b> 
 As the hon. Gentleman knows, we have trebled aid for Africa over the last few years. I am aware that, owing to his association with the Commonwealth Parliamentary Union, he has both welcomed that and seen some of the good effects that it has produced.

<p>
<a name="50526-01_para5">
<a name="stpa_o5">This is the first time that I have heard the hon. Gentleman describe the European Union as a third party&#151;it may be due to the change that is taking place in the Conservative party&#151;but if I were to talk about third parties, I would say that he should support the work of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. I think that on this occasion at least, the Conservative party should be generous enough to support the decision made by the European Union this week. It was an historic decision&#151;that all 25&nbsp;countries would play their part in doubling European aid between now and 2010. Even the poorest EU countries agreed to move their aid budgets to 0.17&nbsp;per cent. That was a sign that even the poorer EU countries recognised their responsibilities to the rest of the world. I should have thought that at a time of reflection for the Conservatives, they would take the opportunity at least to welcome one thing that has come out of the European Union.

<a name="stpa_o6">The Americans support our initiative on debt relief, and I believe that we are closer to an agreement on multilateral debt relief than we have been at any time. In 1999, an agreement was reached on bilateral debt relief, and we and other countries removed the costs that countries in the poorer world had to pay for debt servicing. It is now possible that the other half of the debt owed by the poorest countries&#151;the multilateral debt&#151;could be written down, with all G7&nbsp;countries supporting the move. I believe that the Americans, like the rest of Europe, are ready to reach an agreement on debt relief.

<a name="stpa_o7">As my hon. Friend will know, the American Administration have proposed substantial increases in aid for HIV/AIDS and education through the millennium challenge account. One of the purposes of the Prime Minister&#039;s visit to America over the next few days is to see whether we can bring together Europe, Japan and America, so that at Gleneagles we can agree a plan for Africa, and at the United Nations special summit in September we can agree with the rest of the world that it will share the priority that we have accorded to Africa.

 I am grateful for that all-party support&#151;I believe that the Liberal Democrats and the other parties in the House will also support this initiative. It is important for Britain to signal to the rest of the world that the whole United Kingdom Parliament is united in our efforts to tackle the problems of developing countries.

</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-01_para9">
<a name="stpa_o9">The hon. Gentleman has raised again the attitude of the American Administration to the initiative, and particularly to our proposed international finance facility. Progress has been made on the facility, which involves front-loading funds so that we can do very special things early in order to be in a position to meet the millennium development goals. A number of Governments around the world, and the Gates Foundation, have come together to propose an international finance facility for vaccination and immunisation. As I have told the House, that would release an extra $4&nbsp;billion for the vaccination and immunisation of children who would otherwise not have such treatment. Between now and 2015, 5&nbsp;million lives could be saved by that one measure, and I believe that it will be endorsed at Gleneagles.

 I am glad that the hon. Gentleman supports the international finance facility both as an idea and for its practical development in vaccination and other areas. At the meeting of European Union Finance Ministers only a few days ago, all 25&nbsp;countries of the European Union agreed that we could support an international finance facility. It was agreed that we had to find a way to fund it after 2015, and further work is being done on how to guarantee that funding. However, there was a time when there were sceptics in the European Union and people in other countries thought that the proposal was impractical, but it is now accepted that we should move forward. Whatever happens and however many countries join the international finance facility, it will be established, and I am grateful that we have the support of all parties&#151;I believe that that includes the Liberal Democrats.

However, thousands of people, churches and faith groups in all constituencies around the country sent out a message not only to Britain but to Germany, France, Japan and America to take action. There is absolutely no doubt that, when large numbers of people have got together to force the issue on to the agenda, it has made a difference.

<p><a name="st_o32"><a name="50526-02_spnew3"><b> Mr. Browne: </b> 
 The Chancellor can speak for himself on those issues. The national insurance position is that we have raised it in the context of further investment in the national health service, which the country overwhelmingly supported. I remind Conservative Members that the extra money contributed towards real growth in NHS spending, which was the result of the legacy of the Conservative Government&#039;s underspend in that sector for many years.

 (Lab): It is still the case that many benefits, including incapacity benefit and the basic state pension, depend on national insurance contributions, but many women continue to find it difficult to build up sufficient credits, particularly if they have home care responsibilities. A woman looking after two elderly relatives for 15&nbsp;hours each per week is a good example. It means that, although she is working for 30&nbsp;hours a week, because each commitment is 15&nbsp;hours&#151;less than the required 16&nbsp;hours&#151;she will not receive any national insurance credits. Will the Chief Secretary undertake to look further into this problem to assess whether there is a way of widening the basis for credits in order to allow more women to build them up to qualify either for a basic state pension or incapacity benefit?

 I welcome the Chancellor back to his post. In addition to the huge figures that he has just read out for our fiscal deficit, the Office for National Statistics and others have made good technical arguments that the debt figures for the private finance initiative, the Strategic Rail Authority and even the burgeoning public sector pensions should be added to our total debt figure. That amounts to a massive figure, and one of the highest in our history. The Chancellor used to talk about prudence for a purpose. A prudent Chancellor would address this huge problem. Will he increase taxation or cut spending to deal with it?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o55"><a name="50526-03_spnew7"><b> Mr. Brown: </b> 
 We follow exactly the same rules on the private finance initiative and on the way in which we calculate debt and borrowing as the Conservative Government did. If anything, we are ready to tighten up the rules and make them more transparent in a way in which they were not prepared to do. The idea that we have more debt as a percentage of national income under the Labour Government is completely wrong. We

<b>26 May 2005 : Column 860</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>have cut debt from 44&nbsp;per cent. to just over 33&nbsp;per cent. of national income. Over the years we have reduced debt substantially, against the advice of Opposition Members.

 I would be delighted to visit Glasgow at any time. We will continue our policies of economic stability, which are absolutely central to maximising employment. We will also continue our new deal programme, which has reduced youth unemployment in Glasgow by 70&nbsp;per cent. and long-term unemployment by more than 90&nbsp;per cent. We will extend that new deal to skills to support employability for life, and that is in contrast to the Conservative party. The shadow Chancellor said in the House in January that he would abolish the new deal&#151;there is nothing new about that&#151;and leave such things to the market, whatever the consequences for individuals, communities and our society. The only intergenerational unemployment that the Labour party is prepared to tolerate is that of Leaders of the Opposition and shadow Chancellors.

 Will the Leader of the House find time to organise a debate on the excellent role that the voluntary sector can play in the provision of public services in a non-bureaucratic and flexible way? Such a debate would allow me to commend the services provided by more than 30&nbsp;volunteers at the Hemsworth and South Elmsall Home Start, providing services to more than 320&nbsp;families in 19&nbsp;villages in my constituency, and would allow me to oppose the proposals made by some consultants that would see the end of that excellent service.

 Will the Leader of the House find time to look at the provision of maternity care throughout the country and, in particular, premature baby cots? Since the closure of the maternity unit at Hemel Hempstead hospital, mothers and babies that desperately need these facilities have been sent as far as Nottingham and Yarmouth.

 A debate has broken out all over the country about respect, but can that debate be extended to this House? If so, we could discuss how our young people are engaged in our communities and look not just at what they do badly, but at what they do well. For example, young people in my constituency take part in many of the activities that are the glue of the community. They attend fetes and galas, and share memories with war veterans, ex-mill workers and those who have been engaged in the activities that make our community different. We need an opportunity to say what is good about young people as well as what is bad.

I believe that the pensions are safe under the pension protection plan and, in fairness, the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions has also said that, but only to the press and not in the House. I tabled a question to the Secretary of State on this issue on the first day that we came back, to ask whether we could have a statement on the application of the pension protection plan.

Should that money now be in the pension scheme, if the Rover directors took money to which they were not entitled? If the pension protection plan is to apply, other people&#039;s pensions will have to be levied in order to pay the shortfall at Rover, which is clearly unfair to those other people.

Even with 99&nbsp;per cent. accuracy, for every 100&nbsp;scans there will be one false match. If that is scaled up to apply to a population of 50&nbsp;million, that would mean that one person&#039;s scan would match another 500,000. Does my right hon.

 In regard to the answer that my right hon. Friend gave to the hon.

Does my right hon. Friend also accept, however, that the pendulum did not swing evenly in that election, and that it is perhaps time to consider whether our electoral system accurately reflects all the different currents within the population? Such work was carried out by the Jenkins commission during the first term of the Labour Government, and it came up with an excellent alternative vote system. However, the proposal was then ruined by trying to make it into a proportional system that would have introduced first-class and second-class MPs and taken away the constituency link from many of them. Does my right hon.

I was here for that debate, and I was straining to hear the Secretary of State for Education. I genuinely wondered whether the microphone was operating properly.

I seek your guidance, Mr.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaker, because I am concerned that the Chancellor is behaving in a thoroughly unequal and discriminatory fashion.

Gaelic is the language that made Scotland a distinct entity. We Gaelic speakers call ourselves the Gaels, and have done so throughout history. The Romans called us the Scotti, however, in the same way that the Iroquois named the Inuit Eskimos. Gaelic is now spoken by only about 60,000&nbsp;people in Scotland and I am glad to be one of them. Being bilingual has given me many benefits, not least an empathy with the Welsh, although the two Celtic languages relate to each other in the same way as the Germanic languages of English and German. My sort of Gaelic, however, is closely related to that of the Isle of Man and Ireland.

<a name="stpa_37">Off the west coast of Harris is Taransay, where, as many Members might remember, the television programme &quot;Castaway&quot; was filmed. Over the sound of Harris is Berneray, where the illustrious Prince Charles once spent a spring gainfully employed planting potatoes. Berneray is linked by causeway to North Uist, which in turn is linked to Benbecula, South Uist and on to Eriskay. There has been concern throughout Uist that the linking of the islands with fixed links, leaving no gap for tidal flow, exacerbated the effects of the storms on 11&nbsp;January, causing the sea to bank on the west coast of Uist, with devastating effects on Iochdar in South Uist and the tragic loss of five people&#151;three generations of the same family. The effects of causeways should therefore now be examined to see whether they interact with the tides and storm surges.

<a name="stpa_38">To get home to Barra from Uist, I can take the second ferry that links the constituency. The ferry leaves from Eriskay beside the silvery white beach where Bonnie Prince Charlie started his epic and, sadly, failed adventure. On Barra is the famous cockle strand, the Traigh Mhor, which in famine times 150&nbsp;years ago fed many hundreds. The beach is now Barra&#039;s airport, and when one is there, places such as London or Glasgow can feel quite remote, as one can only get to them at low tide. Transportation, and its associated costs, is a pressing problem for the islands and one of the main reasons for depopulation. Sadly, the finest scenery in the UK cannot retain people on its own. In the past 10&nbsp;years, my constituency has lost 11&nbsp;per cent. of its population&#151;more than any other in the House, I believe. That is caused not by geography, but by politics. Ireland is gaining population. Iceland&#039;s population grew over the 20th century, as did Norway&#039;s. The Faroe Islands trebled its population in the 20th century. Scotland generally suffers from not being an independent country; our Parliament does not even have the powers of the Isle of Man.

<a name="stpa_39">In the short term, beyond a constitutional change, there is a pressing need for road equivalent tariff to lower our ferry fares and give our islands the same chance, opportunities and success as those in western Norway.

 I am delighted to follow the maiden speech of the hon. Member for Na h-Eileanan an Iar (Mr. MacNeil). This is my first opportunity to mention the name of his constituency in the new Parliament. My surname may be McIsaac, but the McIsaacs&#151;pronounced differently&#151;originally hailed from the isle of Eriskay. While I may not share the hon. Gentleman&#039;s Scottish Nationalist politics, I am sure that we will continue to share a love of the islands of the west of Scotland. I pay tribute to his maiden speech, which highlighted problems that I know exist in the islands, and I hope that he does well in the House.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-10_para0">
<a name="stpa_44">Being called today made me cast my mind back to my own maiden speech, which seems a long time ago. On that day I focused on education, and particularly on primary school class sizes, a subject to which I want to return today.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-10_para1">
<a name="stpa_45">During the general election campaign, North East Lincolnshire council, which covers the constituencies of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cleethorpes and Great Grimsby, announced controversial school closures. I am inclined to go for the cock-up rather than the conspiracy theory of history, but many residents of Grimsby and Cleethorpes sense a very fishy aroma wafting from Grimsby town hall. The Liberal Democrat leader of the council stood against my&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hon. Friend the Member for Great Grimsby (Mr.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mitchell) at the election, and two of my opponents were Liberal Democrat and Conservative cabinet members. Although I do not think that that was deliberate, many people in the area do.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-10_para2">
<a name="stpa_46">Having announced the closures in the middle of the election campaign, the council has now given a closing date of 31&nbsp;May for comments. I think that that is far too short a period for parents worried about their children&#039;s education to come up with alternatives to closure. I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, South (Nigel Griffiths), the Deputy Leader of the House of Commons, will talk to education Ministers to establish whether a properly defined time limit for this part of the consultation is possible. But regardless of the time limit, my hon. Friend the Member for Great Grimsby and I believe that the closures are entirely unjustified. They do not conform to Government guidelines, and I think that education Ministers should reiterate to councils that it is not good practice to start eliminating surplus places by closing schools that are successful and, in the case of some of those earmarked for closure, over-subscribed.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>26 May 2005 : Column 884</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-10_para3">
<a name="stpa_47">Another reason why the proposed closures are completely wrong is the fact that the information used by the council is out of date. Its net capacity figures relate to 2002&nbsp;or thereabouts. Since then, many of the schools in question&#151;not just those threatened with closure, but some that are threatened with amalgamation or a reduction in the number of classrooms&#151;have taken steps to deal with the problem of surplus places. The paper produced by the council does not recognise that. The fact that the figures are out of date and wrong must be addressed as a matter of urgency before any decision is made to close a school.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-10_para4">
<a name="stpa_48">The schools themselves are challenging the figures. One of them, Bursar primary school in Cleethorpes, is close to my home. The council says that it has capacity for 243&nbsp;admissions, but its limit is actually 210, and there are currently 198&nbsp;children on its roll. That could not be described as an excessive number of surplus places. Elliston infants school and Elliston junior school are also in Cleethorpes. One of those schools is above capacity and is one of the best-performing schools in the borough, yet it too is being earmarked for closure.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-10_para5">
<a name="stpa_49">The council has come up with predictions of the size of the Grimsby and Cleethorpes population in 2009. It asserts that the population in the borough is declining and that the number of births is falling. It claims that there will be 400&nbsp;or 500&nbsp;fewer children each year. According to the Office for National Statistics, the number of live births in the area is increasing, and it predicts that the number of children of primary school age will also increase over the next few years. If the council proceeds with its plans, up to 2,000&nbsp;primary school-age children may be without places because of its severe underestimate of future numbers.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-10_para6">
<a name="stpa_50">I am deeply worried by the council&#039;s failure to announce alternatives to the closures. It simply announced in the press, in the middle of an election campaign, that schools would have to close, and told parents to come up with alternatives. Surely it would have been better practice to liaise with parents, with the schools involved, with head teachers and with unions in a co-operative way, with a view to identifying alternatives and to see what the schools themselves could suggest. Some of those earmarked for closure have no surplus places at all, and it is entirely wrong for over-capacity schools to be closed as a first step in the process of dealing with surplus places.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-10_para7">
<a name="stpa_51">My hon. Friend the Deputy Leader of the House, with whom I have sparred on many occasions&#151;I remember doing so on the issue of compensation for distant-water trawlermen when he was doing one of his earlier jobs&#151;knows that once I get my teeth into an issue, I will not give up. I shall use every opportunity to harangue Front Benchers to establish whether there are any measures that they can take. I realise that it is for the council to come up with a solution to the problem of surplus school places, but I must seriously say to my hon. Friend that I do not believe the guidelines are clear enough to councils. Because they are unclear, councils such as North East Lincolnshire can come up with controversial proposals that worry parents and teachers and, in this case, create a great deal of uncertainty.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-10_para8">
<a name="stpa_52">Now that the council says that schools will have to close, parents are wondering whether to risk sending their children to a particular school in September, and teachers are wondering whether they have to start looking for new jobs. Indeed, if there is a vacancy, how 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>26 May 2005 : Column 885</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>will head teachers recruit staff if a school is going to be open for only three or four more months? The situation is a recipe for disaster. I tell the Minister again that we need far clearer rules on how to deal with surplus places, and I shall try to arrange a meeting with education Ministers to make that point.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-10_para9">
<a name="stpa_53">Ultimately, the most serious political reason for my raising this matter before the 31&nbsp;May deadline for comments is that, just as Governments are not allowed to make announcements during an election period, there is merit in local authorities not being allowed to do so, particularly in the middle of a general election campaign when people on the cabinet of that council are putting themselves forward for election, and when their main line during the election campaign in Grimsby and Cleethorpes was to blame the Government for the closures. We must seriously examine how certain councillors misuse their position to try to gain political advantage at the expense of school children and their parents.

 This opportunity to raise matters of importance to our constituents recurs at regular intervals through the parliamentary calendar before the rather too regular Adjournments of the House. It is an important chance for Back-Bench Members to raise issues that they would not otherwise be able to raise properly and in order during discussions on legislation or, indeed, on the rare Government debates on matters of interest.

I have no idea of the rights and wrongs of the case that she mentioned. I hope that it will not be necessary for the Deputy Leader of the House to intervene in local authority matters, whichever authority that may be and whatever it may be engaged in. Having been a leader of a county council and chairman of a local education authority, I can say that there is never a right time to go about school reorganisations and there is never a way of presenting a case that does not cause a great deal of controversy locally. A wise local authority will listen carefully to the cases put on both sides and come up with the right solution to provide education for the people in its area.

<p>
<a name="50526-10_para12">
<a name="stpa_56">If I may abuse my position slightly, I will first raise two matters of concern in my constituency. The first is a serious matter that I will have to return to repeatedly over the next few months: the future of the new Frome Victoria hospital. We have been waiting since 1998, when it was announced that a new hospital would be built for the town. We were promised that it would be built by 2000. Although it benefited from huge fundraising efforts in the town&#151;&#163;500,000&nbsp;was raised towards the costs of the new hospital&#151;the situation has becalmed because the private finance scheme to fund it appears not to have sufficient money to get it built.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-10_para13">
<a name="stpa_57">That is a matter of huge concern in Frome. We have a green field where our new hospital should be. We have an excellent hospital, but it was built in Victorian times and cannot provide the necessary facilities for the people of Frome. The town has every right to expect something to be done to break the logjam and to ensure that the hospital is built. So often we hear glowing reports from hon. Members about the wonders of investment in the national health service and what that has provided for their constituencies, yet we in Frome still have a decaying Victorian hospital and an expectation that has so far not been met and we still lack a modern facility in Frome. I asked during the previous Parliament for Ministers to look into the problem and I will continue to do so in this Parliament.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-10_para14">
<a name="stpa_58">My second point is on a rather happier note. Tomorrow, I shall visit St. Louis VC Roman Catholic junior school in my constituency, where the pupils have recorded a CD, songs from which they will sing to me, in support of the Make Poverty History campaign. The fact that children are engaged in that huge issue for our time, along with a large part of the population and the Government and Opposition parties, will, I hope, result in action when it comes to the summit and the British presidency of the G8&nbsp;and the European Union. I hope that we will be able to make a difference on one of the most crucial issues facing the world, and that we can begin to change the world for the better by reducing the intense poverty that besets so many people in so many parts of the developing world.

It cannot be right for the Conservative party to gain more votes in England than the Labour party, yet have fewer seats.

I also recognise, however, that the 22,000-odd people&#151;I use the term &quot;odd&quot; in the mathematical rather than the pejorative sense&#151;who voted Conservative in the Somerton and Frome constituency at the last election have not elected anyone to represent them on the basis of the votes that they secured. There has long been trench warfare over seats in Somerset and roughly similar numbers voted Conservative in the previous election and the one before that. The trick that we need

 I am grateful for the opportunity to press the hon. Gentleman on that. I gain the biggest buzz of all in my constituency when someone approaches me and says, &quot;I could never vote for you; I could never vote Conservative; but I am really grateful for the job you are doing.&quot; I am sure that the hon. Gentleman must have experienced the same feeling and that he would accept that it is possible for every MP to do a good job for every single constituent, regardless of how they vote.
</p>








<p><a name="st_77"><a name="50526-11_spnew3"><b> Mr. Heath: </b> 
 Absolutely. One of the greatest compliments that I was ever paid came from a teller in a blue rosette who stopped me at the polling station during the previous election&#151;not this one&#151;and shook me warmly by the hand. He said, &quot;Mr. Heath, I am a Conservative, as you can see, but I want you to know that you are, in my opinion, the best Member of Parliament that we have ever had&quot;. I was grateful for that; it meant something to me&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i> Not everyone would say that, but this gentleman did. I nevertheless believe that there are electoral systems that unite the crucial principle of being connected to a community with fairness across the country.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-11_para0">
<a name="stpa_64">I recognise that there are both strongly divided and partisan views and some non-partisan views, and that all are equally strongly held. Surely, however, we have a duty, as the elected House in this country, to examine the issue on behalf of the people out there who believe that the system is not working properly or who have simply walked away from the whole process, as evidenced by the degree of abstentionism in this country&#039;s elections. There are far too many who feel that democracy is just not delivering for them, which is a very dangerous thing.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-11_para1">
<a name="stpa_65">To move on from the electoral system itself, I want to mention the integrity of the voting system and problems with postal voting. I share the view that postal voting is, in its place, a useful addition to the opportunities available to the public. There were experiments in my constituency with all-postal voting for district council elections. It had an interesting effect and marginally increased participation, although there were, equally, problems on the other side of the fence. The difficulties that we experienced were clearly identified in our debates on pilot systems for the European Parliament before the whole electoral process started. The Government&#039;s insouciance and indolence meant that the proper safeguards that should have been put in place were not put in place, even though the Electoral Commission had said that they were necessary. That is why so many people felt that the system was being abused.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-11_para2">
<a name="stpa_66">It is surely critical to our electoral process that people feel that our system has integrity. We preach the lesson abroad all the time when we monitor elections in other countries, yet there are systems in this country that would never pass my scrutiny as a member of the parliamentary delegation to the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe. If I were monitoring an election abroad, and saw some of the abuses of electoral processes that have taken place in

<br>&nbsp;<br>this country, I would write a damning report. We must revisit those problems, together with the engagement of the general public and voting opportunities, as a matter of urgency. For example, we could reflect on the possibility of voting at weekends. It is common in many other countries and it may be right for us now in an age when everyone works through the week. As we all know, having knocked on many doors over recent weeks, it is rare to find anyone in on a weekday, yet it is a weekday on which we call an election. Does that make sense? I do not believe that it does.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-11_para3">
<a name="stpa_67">Finally, we need to connect all those issues with constitutional reform. The Government must get to grips with the job that they have botched. They started to reform the upper Chamber, but have not completed it, yet such reform is integrally connected with what happens in this Chamber. It is not possible to define the form and functions of the revising Chamber until the primary Chamber can do its work of scrutiny effectively. I do not believe that it functions well at the moment. As a result of the application of guillotines and the refusal to allow enough time for important Bills on Report, far too much legislation passes through the House with only cursory examination. We should remember that Report is the only time when hon. Members on both sides of the House can raise important issues on the legislation of the day. Legislation can sometimes be critical to the life and liberty of their constituents, but if hon. Members do not have the opportunity even to speak to, intervene on or debate critical amendments, the House cannot be said to be doing the job that it is elected to do. Once again, I view that matter as critical to our electoral process.
</p>








<p><a name="st_78"><a name="50526-11_spnew4"><b> Mr. MacNeil: </b> 
 I agree with the hon. Gentleman&#039;s analysis of the first-past-the-post electoral system, which theoretically allows a party to win less than 51&nbsp;per cent. of the vote in every seat yet win every seat in the country. However, I could not support a proposal to hold elections over a weekend, and especially on a Sunday, as that would cause many of my constituents difficulty.
</p>








<p><a name="st_79"><a name="50526-11_spnew5"><b> Mr. Heath: </b> 
 I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman and applaud him for intervening so soon after making his maiden speech. That shows great confidence. I understand the sensitivities in parts of Scotland and Wales&#151;and, indeed, the west country&#151;about holding an election on a Sunday. Similar problems arise in parts of London, Manchester the other cities about holding an election on a Saturday. However, a slightly prolonged voting period would allow people with deep religious convictions not to vote on a Sunday.

If the word did not have such bad connotations, I would say democratic rearmament because we need a crusade to get the democratic system back on track. Those hon. Members who think that this discussion is academic or merely dreamed up by Hampstead liberals in their drawing rooms are wrong because it is not.

She was an Environment Minister when Margaret Thatcher was Prime Minister, and was also Chair of both the Health Committee and the Administration Committee.

The people who work at Chase Farm deserve to work in a state-of-the-art hospital. My fear is that, if we do not see more investment, we will lose many of those good people and the problems afflicting Chase Farm will only worsen. I would hate to see that happen.

<a name="stpa_85">The final issue is crime. We are told that Broxbourne has 84&nbsp;police officers, one per 1,000&nbsp;of the population, but there are lies, damn lies and statistics. What with shifts, weekends, holidays, training and sickness, that number is radically reduced. Indeed, on some evenings, there can be as few as eight police officers covering those 84,000&nbsp;people, which is only one per 10,000. Police stations are shut and calls go unanswered. I have huge respect for the brave men and women who patrol our streets, but we need to give them more support. I cannot go on telling my constituents, as the Government would like me to do, that they have never had it so good, because the reality does not match the rhetoric. We need more policemen and more visible policing before my constituents lose confidence in the service.

Only a very few make a lasting contribution&#151;Lloyd George, Winston Churchill, Clement Attlee, Margaret Thatcher and, although it pains me to say it, the present Prime Minister, because he will be recorded in history.

The Tees was the principal artery for the export of iron and steel in the industrial revolution.

<a name="stpa_99">Last December I was privileged to attend the celebration for the export of the 1&nbsp;millionth tonne of steel through Teesport from Redcar steel works. It was going to South Korea to be part of a ship being built by a company called Dongicuk. Now my steelworks has a 10-year contract to export all of its 3.5&nbsp;million tonne capacity, much of which will go through the port to a foreign consortium. This is part of the reason why Teesport has developed rapidly to become the United Kingdom&#039;s second largest port, handling 54&nbsp;million tonnes of cargo a year.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-12_para13">
<a name="stpa_100">Teesport is second only to Grimsby and Immingham and in 2002&nbsp;it overtook London. It is significantly bigger than the fourth, Southampton, overall and, surprisingly for the north-east, the port of Tyne&#151;which people would probably think of as the biggest port there&#151;is small in comparison. It deals with about 2.8&nbsp;million tonnes of cargo a year, and the other ports are very small indeed. There are 530&nbsp;direct employees at Teesport now.

<p>
<a name="50526-12_para14">
<a name="stpa_101">Teesport goes back to the industrial revolution and has gone through privatisation and a series of owners, but it started to kick off in 2000&nbsp;when it was taken over by Nikko, appropriately described as venture capitalists; then there was a sale in 2004&nbsp;and a flotation on the stock exchange. It has developed through that

<br>&nbsp;<br>series of steps, increasing container traffic, for example, from 20,000&nbsp;units in 2001&nbsp;to 90,000&nbsp;units in 2002. It has dynamic, ambitious management. In 2003&nbsp;there was a need to open a second container terminal. It was opened by the Duke of York and, with additional secondary handling capacity, Teesport can now cope with 200,000&nbsp;containers a year. It is the container traffic development opportunity on which I want to focus.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-12_para15">
<a name="stpa_102">The United Kingdom container market is expected to grow by about 5&nbsp;per cent. a year to reach over 10&nbsp;million TEUs&#151;20&nbsp;ft equivalent units. That is obviously a standard measure. The world container shipping market is growing rapidly and over the past few years has been fuelled by manufacturing in the far east, particularly in China. In the United Kingdom this deep-sea increase in volume is growing fastest. The major existing United Kingdom container ports are Felixstowe, Thamesport, Tilbury, Southampton and Liverpool. In 2003, 74&nbsp;per cent. of all deep-sea UK traffic went through Felixstowe and Southampton.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-12_para16">
<a name="stpa_103">Teesport is ambitious to share in the increase in the market. I want to emphasise that there is not a collision of interests between this northern port and the southern ports of Felixstowe, Harwich and London because we are talking about a share of a growing market. Teesport is keen to invest &#163;300&nbsp;million to expand its deep-sea container terminal to bring freight, essentially from the far east although also from elsewhere, into northern England and the distribution centres, which would be engines of job creation before the goods are sent by rail and road elsewhere.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-12_para17">
<a name="stpa_104">Interestingly, more than 2&nbsp;million of the current units of deep-sea container trade that come into the country through the southern ports of Harwich, Felixstowe and London are destined for Birmingham and further north. According to the Government&#039;s figures, 60&nbsp;per cent. of all freight traffic that comes through the southern ports is bound for Birmingham and the north. As road haulage costs, fuel prices, congestion and climate change increase significantly, there is obviously a great deal of interest in trying to change logistical patterns of that kind.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-12_para18">
<a name="stpa_105">Teesport estimates&#151;this is music to the ears of anyone who comes from my part of the country&#151;that this investment could generate up to 7,000&nbsp;jobs in Tees valley, where although the steel industry is now doing well and the chemical industry is thriving, our unemployment is still twice the national average. Teesport also estimates that it would take millions of lorry miles off the roads if northern goods were driven from northern ports rather than offloaded in the south and taken north. It would go some way to close the &#163;29&nbsp;billion economic output gap between the south and the north. It would improve access to the North sea ports. It would help end the capacity shortage at UK ports generally and it would stop what we in the north call southern discomfort, by cutting congestion on already over-congested roads and rail. It would also develop hundreds of acres of brownfield land, much of it left over from the steel industry, which I have mentioned, in my area, whereas in the southern ports some development on green belt is likely to occur.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-12_para19">
<a name="stpa_106">Sounds wonderful&#151;so what is the problem? Teesport will put in a planning application&#151;known technically as a harbour revision order&#151;very soon. The potential problem is that there is not currently a national ports

There are currently well-advanced applications to expand immediately the three southern ports that I have referred to as the major container importers and exporters, because for overall capacity needs to increase.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-12_para20">
<a name="stpa_107">Let me emphasise again that there is not really any rivalry here; there is no intent to steal jobs&#151;we are simply talking about coping with an expansion in container traffic. However, Felixstowe south has applied to increase its capacity by 1.8&nbsp;million units&#151;a very large amount indeed&#151;and has had a public inquiry. Bathside bay, which is the other side of Felixstowe, has also had a public inquiry; it has an ambition to expand to a similar capacity. It has some problems, in that parts of it would be on a greenfield site. Shellhaven, which is in London, has also put in an application to expand by 3&nbsp;million units. It will have some dredging and connectivity problems.

 I am following the hon. and learned Lady carefully and she is speaking a lot of sense. Shellhaven is a new application, on which the Minister has just put off his decision; we are waiting for that. Part of the Government&#039;s difficulty in taking these strategic decisions about the capacity of container ports across the country is the absence of an overall comprehensive strategic plan for the development of container traffic in this country. However, such a plan is very necessary. Will she join me in calling for the Government to develop such a strategic plan, so that we can minimise the number of road miles that this container traffic travels?

<p><a name="st_86"><a name="50526-13_spnew3"><b> Vera Baird: </b> 
 I thank the hon. Gentleman for that intervention. It seems to me imperative that, rather than looking individually at the three current applications and responding to them on the semi-local basis on which they would normally be dealt with, the Government should put them aside for the time being while a comprehensive strategy emerges. It needs to emerge fast, so that they do not, as it were, hijack the agenda and the strategic development of ports by just granting or not granting individual applications. So I definitely would welcome the hon. Gentleman&#039;s support because I intend to ask the Government to look very quickly at the formation of a national ports strategy.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-13_para0">
<a name="stpa_108">There has been some resistance to expansion in the locations of the southern ports. As the hon. Gentleman knows, in Shellhaven there have been complaints that no more jobs are needed there, and complaints about threats to nature reserves and important historic sites elsewhere. It makes an interesting contrast to my own cry in my local press, where the potential of 7,000&nbsp;new jobs was offered to Teesside, that this is capable of almost putting an end to our very local unemployment problems&#151;so we have it in a nutshell why some development is urgently needed. It is a rational way to expand ports without having the whole proposition jump-started by the granting of ad hoc consents.

Because we believe that the business case for Teesport is absolutely clear, our aim is to ensure that this great development&#151;which can reverse, even more fully than the Government&#039;s economic stability over the last seven years has done, the decline that my part of the country suffered under the preceding Government, and can be a huge contributor to making the economy of Tees valley much more dynamic&#151;comes about.

 It is a particular pleasure to be able to congratulate my hon. Friends the Members for Broxbourne (Mr. Walker) and for Welwyn Hatfield (Grant Shapps) on extremely fluent and excellent maiden speeches. We all remember the horror and the trauma of having to sit around waiting to make our maiden speeches, but the fluency and effortless ease with which both my hon. Friends spoke suggest that they were either on pills or have nerves of steel that I did not have.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-13_para3">
<a name="stpa_111">My hon. Friend the Member for Welwyn Hatfield will clearly be a strong voice for that constituency and I am sure that, over very many years, his constituents will benefit from his advocacy of their causes in the House. My hon. Friend the Member for Broxbourne, in a very interesting speech, was perhaps a little too modest&#151;characteristically so. He said that there were 3,000&nbsp;Members of Parliament before he arrived here and there would probably in the next century be another 3,000, and that he would play a small part in the life of this parliamentary system. I think that that is characteristically modest of him because I am sure, from the way he spoke with affection and vigour on behalf of his constituents, he will represent them excellently in all our debates in the coming years.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-13_para4">
<a name="stpa_112">I am particularly pleased to speak in this debate because I believe it is important, prior to the beginning of the Whitsun recess, that we consider the issues behind a report that was published last week, and which received some notice but not that much. I refer to the Office of Fair Trading report on care homes for older people in the United Kingdom. For every hon. Member, the care of the elderly is of crucial importance and concern.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>26 May 2005 : Column 899</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-13_para5">
<a name="stpa_113">We all believe, rightly, that elderly people must live with the dignity, respect and help, where it is needed, that they rightly deserve. Conservative Members also believe&#151; although, certainly in our debates in the last Parliament, certain uncharitable Health Ministers would not give us the credit for it&#151;that the most appropriate type of care should be given to our elderly citizens, and I am sure that Labour Members believe that, too. For many elderly people, domiciliary care in their homes, with a care package, is the most appropriate form of care.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-13_para6">
<a name="stpa_114">I hope that the Deputy Leader of the House will relay to the Department of Health the fact that I am disappointed by the latest figures, which were published today. Despite the Government&#039;s fervent claims that they are committed to providing domiciliary care, those figures show that although the number of hours of domiciliary care given to individuals has increased, the number of individuals receiving that care has been reduced yet again. That is of concern.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-13_para7">
<a name="stpa_115">The OFT report raises a number of interesting and important issues that relate to transparency. For many individuals who require residential care, their needs come all of a sudden, possibly as a result of a stay in hospital, and many of them may still be in a confused state or recovering from illness and waiting to leave hospital. They are not always best able to cope and to take what are extraordinarily important decisions about their future life. What they must decide about is the home that they will live in for a number of years&#151;we hope many years&#151;and they and their families may not be in a position of ease and understanding to take the right decision at the time. That is why is it important that as much information as possible is provided to help them&#151;of course, with advice from social services departments and the care homes themselves&#151;to take the decision that is in their best interests for their long-term well-being.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-13_para8">
<a name="stpa_116">The recommendations in the OFT report must be considered seriously. We do not need a knee-jerk reaction where we must accept everything that is proposed, but we must certainly consider such proposals carefully. We must strike a balance between the nanny state&#151;the immediate instinct of any interfering Government to throw legislation, rules and regulations at everything that is proposed&#151;and what would be a genuine and helpful improvement in the situation that would facilitate people gaining access to more information, so that they could take rational decisions when they have to do so. That is why I urge the Government not to jump on any passing bandwagon and immediately say, &quot;We&#039;ve got to do this; we&#039;ve got to do that&quot;.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-13_para9">
<a name="stpa_117">Heaven knows, most of us should have learned during the last general election campaign, when we were communicating with our employers, that the care home sector has been so overburdened during the past eight years by petty regulations and rules and by the need for Ministers to be seen to be doing something that it has crippled the ability of many homes to continue to exist and to provide the services and high-quality care that our elderly population deserves.

<a name="50526-13_para10">
<a name="stpa_118">During the past eight years, more than 80,000&nbsp;beds have been lost in care homes throughout the country. That is a disgrace. It is all right for Ministers to huff and puff, but it is deeply offensive to care home owners and their staff, who work day in, day out to provide the finest quality of care and quality of life for individuals, to hear people such as the former Secretary of State for Health, the right hon. Member for Darlington (Mr. Milburn), making accusations about elderly people being banged up in care homes, and for a previous junior Health Minister, now the Minister of State, Department for Transport, the hon. Member for South Thanet (Dr.&nbsp;Ladyman), echoing his master&#039;s voice in the same derogatory terms.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-13_para11">
<a name="stpa_119">Care home owners are not keeping their client group banged up in care homes; they are seeking to provide the highest quality of care. I am glad that the Deputy Leader of the House nods in agreement. Given that he agrees with that statement, perhaps he would like to have a word with Health Ministers to ensure that such unfortunate slurs on those people who are doing so much good for our elderly population stop being made from the Dispatch Box, so that we have no more of the clap-trap that the right hon. Member for Darlington and the hon. Member for South Thanet echoed from the Dispatch Box during the last Parliament.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-13_para12">
<a name="stpa_120">In one respect, the OFT report represents a missed opportunity. Sadly, when the OFT announced its investigation, it used very narrow criteria, although the official Opposition urged the OFT to widen its scope at the time. Part of the equation involves looking at how residential care is funded. I do not suggest that we should consider how much residential and social care is funded to the levels in such a report, but we should consider the mechanics because there is a serious problem.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-13_para13">
<a name="stpa_121">The problem is twofold. First, throughout the country social service departments use, to put it crudely, their bulk purchasing power to tell care homes what price they are prepared to pay per week, per client, and they do so on a take-it-or-leave-it basis. One often finds&#151;particularly with small, family-run homes or medium-sized homes&#151;that what is offered is, at best, equivalent to the actual cost of the care and, at worst, below the actual cost of the care. That does nothing to encourage and enhance the quality of care for those residents. It is wrong that local authorities can adopt that attitude because I should have thought that, among other things, it would be anti-competitive.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-13_para14">
<a name="stpa_122">We know that the Competition Appeal Tribunal in Belfast looked into this issue two years ago, and it believed that such practices were anti-competitive. Unfortunately, I am not a lawyer, so I do not understand how English Health Ministers can tell me that the decision of the Belfast Competition Appeal Tribunal has no relevance and cannot be translated to mainland England. Something must be done to look into the matter because it is apparently a clear case of anti-competitive practice.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-13_para15">
<a name="stpa_123">The other problem, which causes considerable confusion and misunderstanding, and which I cannot fathom properly, is that in those areas where social services departments own their own homes, they are more than happy to pay themselves infinitely more money per week, per client than they will pay the private provider to care for a client. The situation in the city of 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>26 May 2005 : Column 901</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Birmingham is a classic case in the extreme. The latest figures that I have, which relate to last year, show that Birmingham social services department was prepared to pay its own residential care homes &#163;775&nbsp;per resident, per week, but was prepared to pay the independent residential care homes in Birmingham only &#163;310&nbsp;per week, per resident.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-13_para16">
<a name="stpa_124">Those figures are extreme, but they are reflected throughout the country, although the gap elsewhere is not so great. However, in Birmingham there is now the wholesale closure of care homes that just cannot continue to provide care at the prices that they are forced to take&#151;or leave, which means closure&#151;because of the decision of Birmingham city council&#039;s social services department. That seems odd. There is a shortage of beds in the city in any case, but it has been grossly exacerbated in the past four years because of that policy. How is it that a local authority can find the money to pay its own homes so much, yet claim poverty and refuse to pay more to other care homes? That leads to an even more disturbing knock-on effect, which was highlighted in an editorial in <i>The Times</i>.

<a name="stpa_127">If the state, through social services departments, is not prepared to pay an acceptable level of fee per person, it is morally wrong that the fallback position, to stop the homes going out of business, is that people with assets of more than &#163;20,000&nbsp;have to pay their own fees and that their assets are thus diminishing every year. There is a double whammy, adding insult to injury, as they have to subsidise the local authority-paid clients because the local authority will not pay a realistic fee. That is morally wrong. That situation must be looked into and addressed, because it should not and must not continue.

<a name="stpa_129">I start by paying tribute to my predecessor, Adrian Flook, the previous Conservative Member for Taunton, who was a diligent and hard-working Member of the House during the last Parliament. His predecessor, Jackie Ballard, was the first woman to represent Taunton and the first Liberal Democrat this side of the second world war. Her predecessor was another Conservative, David Nicholson. I am in fact the fourth person to represent Taunton in the last four Parliaments and I think that I am the representative of the only constituency where the incumbent has lost at each of the past three general elections, so I hope that there will be widespread support in the House&#151;although I do not necessarily expect to find it&#151;for my campaign to bring some much-needed electoral and representative stability to the people of the Taunton constituency in the years to come.

It includes some beautiful and picturesque villages with evocative names, such as Lydeard St. Lawrence, Combe Florey, Langford Budville and Sampford Arundel.

<a name="stpa_131">The constituency is diverse. The town of Taunton is big enough to have some urban characteristics, while at the other end of the scale there are remote, rural communities which see the affairs of the nation somewhat differently from people in towns and certainly the bigger cities. Also in the constituency is Wellington, a proud and independent-minded town, which is overlooked by the famous Wellington monument. Our hope and expectation is that Wellington will become the venue for the new Taunton Deane livestock market at Chelston on the edge of the town and that that will bring great benefits not only to the agricultural community in my area but to Wellington itself.

Next month Somerset will be the host for our Australian visitors for a one-day match at the ground, and I hope that I do not sound too churlish a host when I say that I confidently expect Somerset to inflict on our guests a humbling experience that will set the tone for the remainder of the summer.

The first is the building of a multi-storey car park to ease chronic congestion and parking problems at the hospital. The second, more important, project is the completion of a cancer centre. At present, people in the Taunton constituency who suffer from cancer often have to travel, with their families, to Bristol for treatment, a round trip of about 100&nbsp;miles at a time of difficulty and stress.

I share the view expressed earlier that antisocial behaviour is a very important problem; it is the most commonly raised issue with me when I knock on people&#039;s doors. I welcome the fact that the Government have placed such emphasis on it and on what they call the &quot;respect agenda&quot; in the Queen&#039;s Speech and their programme for the Parliament as a whole. Politicians can make a number of differences in this regard. I have been very impressed, for example, by the role of the community support officers with whom I have been out on patrol in Taunton, Wellington and some of the surrounding rural areas. As long as they are not a substitute for the regular police but are an additional resource for the regular police, I would like to see their numbers expanded further to cover the other communities in my area where they do not currently serve.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-14_para12">
<a name="stpa_137">A matter that is closer to home rather than having a wider application is the consideration that I would like to be given to Somerset having its own police force. At the moment, we have an artificial construct whereby Somerset is in the same police area as Bristol, which has very different policing requirements&#151;the policing requirements of a large city whereas Somerset is a predominantly rural county. There is a widespread feeling particularly in west Somerset that the crime requirements in Bristol and the need to reduce crime on behalf of Avon and Somerset police mean that priority 

<br>&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>is not always given to Somerset and west Somerset. In time, I would like the Government to consider that issue as well.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-14_para13">
<a name="stpa_138">There are a number of issues associated with crime and antisocial behaviour that it is not possible for politicians to tackle directly through legislation. We cannot pass laws here automatically making people good mannered and considerate, but we can try to address the underlying causes of crime and antisocial behaviour. Yes that is about education, good parenting and what the Government call &quot;respect&quot; and I may call &quot;civic mindedness&quot;, but it is ultimately about making sure that people in Taunton and the country as a whole not only enjoy a good standing of living but a good quality of life. That may be something that we can all aspire to achieve and advance in our time in Parliament. That goes very much for me.

Friends the Members for Broxbourne (Mr. Walker) and for Welwyn Hatfield (Grant Shapps)&#151;have made excellent speeches. I also include the hon. Member for Na h-Eileanan an Iar (Mr. MacNeil), who is no longer in his place. I apologise to you, Madam Deputy Speaker, to the western isles, to Scotland and to <i>Hansard</i> for my pronunciation of his constituency. I also include the new Member for Taunton (Jeremy Browne).

<a name="50526-15_para1">
<a name="stpa_141">I pay tribute to the eight years of public service that my predecessor gave to The Wrekin constituency. His philosophy on life and politics remain different from my own, and his approach to matters of public policy and personalities is also somewhat different. However, I recognise that he committed eight years of his life to public service in this place and, for that indisputable fact, I pay him tribute here today.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-15_para2">
<a name="stpa_142">Public service remains a great privilege and honour, and I am grateful to my constituents in The Wrekin for allowing me to serve them in this place. Indeed, I am the first Conservative MP to be elected for The Wrekin since the major boundary changes of 1997. With the attractive market towns of Wellington, Newport and Shifnal, with&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the pretty villages of Albrighton, High Ercall, Sheriffhales and Tibberton and with the dominating geological feature of The Wrekin itself&#151;it is an area of outstanding natural beauty that towers 400&nbsp;m over the rest of Shropshire&#151;The Wrekin is rural England at its very best.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-15_para3">
<a name="stpa_143">Those Members who have visited my constituency know that, in geographic terms, it is mostly rural. That means that for many of the people whom I represent the success of the rural sector and Shropshire&#039;s rural way of life is of paramount importance if The Wrekin is to

<br>&nbsp;<br>continue to thrive not just in terms of rising living standards, but culturally and in self-confidence. That is why I hope that the Government might recognise that the success of urban England is inextricably linked with the success of rural England. Yes they are different, but they should be treated equally.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-15_para4">
<a name="stpa_144">Manufacturing also remains a key sector, and I hope that the Government will do more to ensure no further demise in the UK manufacturing sector, not least in the defence and technology manufacturing areas of the country and, indeed, in The Wrekin. In my area, that sector provides employment to hundreds of my constituents, which, in turn, creates demand and spend for The Wrekin&#039;s market towns.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-15_para5">
<a name="stpa_145">The defence sector is a key employer in The Wrekin, with RAF Cosford being one of the largest operational RAF stations in the world. It encompasses the defence college of aeronautical engineering, and there is&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;also the defence repair, supply, logistics and procurement facility at Donington, with its numerous local suppliers of support services. That means that forthcoming decisions by Ministers over matters relating to defence spending and rationalisation&#151;not least, the Government&#039;s review of the Army&#039;s supply and logistics capabilities&#151;will be of great interest indeed. The Wrekin has a proud history of working alongside the Ministry of Defence and Her Majesty&#039;s armed forces, and long may that continue. This country faces many challenges, not only in domestic policy but in international affairs. Therefore, my responsibility as a new Member, despite my fresher status, is both a sombre and challenging one.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-15_para6">
<a name="stpa_146">Britain today, as many Members have mentioned, is a world in which authority is undermined every hour of every day. It is as if &quot;authority&quot; is an unattractive word&#151;a word that dare not mention its name. We have seen authority taken away from parents, from teachers, from police officers and, perhaps as concerning, taken away from the very institution of collective government and the role of this Parliament in bringing the Executive to account. That is why I welcome Mr. Speaker&#039;s comments on the first day of this Parliament, and dare I be as bold as to paraphrase them? This House is justified in its expectation that key Government announcements should be made to Parliament first.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-15_para7">
<a name="stpa_147">The domestic challenges that face us, many of which require urgent attention, might lend themselves to hasty legislation and quick law, but decisions made in haste do not usually stand the test of time. On important issues such as health and welfare reform and pensions reform, it is time, valuable time, that many of my constituents do not have should the Government fail to get things right. That is why I have concerns about some of the Government&#039;s proposed Bills, as set out in the Gracious Speech. However, I defer to convention, and hope to raise these concerns on another occasion. Suffice it to say that the Government&#039;s &quot;apologesis&quot; of limited funding inputs from past Conservative Administrations cannot continue as a credible rebuttal given that they have been in power for eight years.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-15_para8">
<a name="stpa_148">I also hope that, in seeking to curb incitement to religious hatred, the Government will not forget to balance this worthy aspiration with the rights of an individual&#039;s freedom of speech, which British subjects have enjoyed for hundreds of years. In a free and fair liberal democracy such as ours, rigorous debate, 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>26 May 2005 : Column 906</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>challenge and scrutiny of all religions and beliefs, and indeed the right of people to have no belief, are surely signs of society&#039;s strength, not its weakness.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-15_para9">
<a name="stpa_149">Let us not forget that many people left these shores several hundred years ago for a place across the pond, arguably because of the Government of the day&#039;s interference with freedom of speech and religion. Indeed, some might suggest that the Government need to tread carefully with their necessary continuation of promoting equal rights so that they ensure that they do not create special rights that might serve only to produce intolerance and misunderstanding of the very sections of British society that they are rightly trying to protect. In nobly seeking inclusivity, the Government should be cautious not to create a new exclusivity. I have a large Sikh and Muslim community in my constituency, as well as a vibrant ecumenical movement among churches, and have committed myself to trying to protect any diminution of the right of freedom of speech. For the record, that includes political freedom of speech and the right unashamedly to promote the British national self-interest, however politically incorrect that might be today or in the future.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-15_para10">
<a name="stpa_150">During my time in this place&#151;however short or long&#151;I hope that the Government will ponder the attraction of better law, rather than more law. In so doing, I hope that they might engage the whole House, including, dare I venture, even the occasional Back Bencher from a beautiful constituency in Shropshire called The Wrekin.

<p><a name="st_92"><a name="50526-15_spnew1"><b> Mr. Greg Hands  (Hammersmith and Fulham) (Con):</b> 
 I want to speak about the threat to our local hospital in Hammersmith and Fulham: the Charing Cross. First, however, I congratulate my hon. Friends who have made their maiden speeches during this debate: my hon. Friends the Members for Broxbourne (Mr. Walker), for Welwyn Hatfield (Grant Shapps) and for The Wrekin (Mark Pritchard). I am also known as something of a polyglot, so I shall try to offer my congratulations to the hon. Members for Na h-Eileanan an Iar (Mr. MacNeil) and for Taunton (Jeremy Browne).
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-15_para11">
<a name="stpa_151">I want to say a few words about my predecessor as Member of Parliament for Hammersmith and Fulham, Iain Coleman. It would be fair to say that Mr. Coleman made most of his impact in the constituency. In fact, his surgeries became something of a legend locally as he seemed to spend his entire time in an almost perpetual surgery at all times and for all hours&#151;except during Arsenal games. Mr. Coleman has not been well for a year and I am sure that hon. Members on both sides of the House will join me in wishing him a full recovery and a return to politics as soon as possible. His predecessor as MP for the Fulham part of the constituency was Matthew Carrington, who was a popular, respected and effective MP for 10&nbsp;years. He was enormously supportive and helpful in my efforts to win back the seat on 5&nbsp;May.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-15_para12">
<a name="stpa_152">It was rather more difficult to find out about the previous Conservative MP for Hammersmith, as distinct from Fulham, because I am the first Conservative MP for Hammersmith since 1964. Probably the most famous previous Hammersmith MP was one William Bull. Mr. Bull represented the area for 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>26 May 2005 : Column 907</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>37&nbsp;years between 1892&nbsp;and 1929. He had the unusual and tragic misfortune to lose his wife to pneumonia after she had been out canvassing for him. For someone who died of pneumonia, Mrs. Bull is ironically commemorated with a sundial in Ravenscourt park in my constituency.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-15_para13">
<a name="stpa_153">Mr. Bull won his first election by only 19&nbsp;votes. While he was an MP he became a senior partner of his law firm. That is an impressive sounding achievement, until one discovers that the firm was called Bull and Bull. He was a man ahead of his time as he was in favour of votes for women and the Channel tunnel, although these days I expect that the latter is more controversial than the former. Most bizarrely, my predecessor was ordered out of the House by Mr. Speaker&#039;s predecessor for calling the then Prime Minister a traitor&#151;which these days is perhaps more in tune with east London than west London politics.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-15_para14">
<a name="stpa_154">In truth, the constituency of Hammersmith and Fulham is more famous for its elections than its MPs. I cite the East Fulham by-election of 1933, the battles of Barons Court of the 1960s and the Fulham by-election of 1986. All those have the common characteristic of being won by the Labour party. However, I believe that one of the most significant Hammersmith and Fulham election results was the one just a couple of weeks ago on 5&nbsp;May. The recorded swing of almost 7.5&nbsp;per cent. was one of the highest in the UK. The seat was the Conservatives&#039; No. 1&nbsp;inner-city target, and a new 5,000&nbsp;majority has been created. Together with the impressive results achieved in London by my hon. Friends the Members for Enfield, Southgate (Mr.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Burrowes), for Wimbledon (Stephen Hammond), for Putney (Justine Greening), for Bexleyheath and Crayford (Mr. Evennett), for Croydon, Central (Mr.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pelling), for Hornchurch (James Brokenshire) and for Ilford, North (Mr. Scott), my result shows that we as a party are making great progress in London again.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-15_para15">
<a name="stpa_155">The Labour party barely got started in the campaign. It was barely seen, barely heard and had little positive to say about its eight years in government. Meanwhile, the Lib Dems ran a candidate from Tunbridge Wells under the slogan, &quot;Give Peace a Chance.&quot; Perhaps they were more the surreal alternative.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-15_para16">
<a name="stpa_156">Hammersmith and Fulham is one of the smallest constituencies in Britain, but it is none the less one of the most diverse. It is also one of the closest to Parliament. As my hon. Friend the Member for Welwyn Hatfield mentioned, it is quite possible to get back to Hammersmith and Fulham from the House at the end of each evening. In fact, I am probably one of the few Members with a direct door-to-door bus route from just outside Big Ben to just outside his house. That sounds fantastic, until one considers that given traffic in London, it can take up to two hours to complete the journey.

</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-15_para17">
<a name="stpa_157">Prior to 5&nbsp;May, some newspapers made great play of the fact that no premiership football ground was located in a Conservative seat. Some claimed that that showed that the Conservative party was not represented in the inner cities. All that has now changed, for I represent a constituency in which not just one, but two premiership clubs are located: Fulham and Chelsea. Notwithstanding the heroic events in Istanbul last night, I was delighted to see the streets of my constituency decked out in blue last Sunday to 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>26 May 2005 : Column 908</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>welcome their new champion. I refer of course to Chelsea football club, but &quot;blue is the colour&quot; is surely the future there politically as well, even if I say that as a Fulham fan.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-15_para18">
<a name="stpa_158">Hammersmith and Fulham is also distinctive for having more tube users than any other borough in Britain and the greatest number of single women compared with single men in the United Kingdom. It is also the home of the Olympia exhibition centre and part of Earls Court. Its largest employer is the BBC, and it is the home of what is reputed to be Europe&#039;s busiest road interchange at Hammersmith Broadway. It is also the London home to dozens of hon. Members, which can make canvassing in certain streets straightforward. Many hon. Members from both major parties have cut their teeth in local Hammersmith and Fulham politics.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-15_para19">
<a name="stpa_159">The election in Hammersmith and Fulham was all about the dreaded congestion charge extension, the fact that eight out of nine muggers in my constituency go unpunished, the fact that a quarter of the borough&#039;s secondary schools are on special measures, the appalling state of the District line and high council tax.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-15_para20">
<a name="stpa_160">Perhaps the greatest concern, however, and why I wanted to speak in the debate, is the threat to the Charing Cross hospital. On the very day that the election was supposed to be called&#151;a good day to bury bad news, one might say&#151;on 4&nbsp;April 2005, an announcement was made at a meeting with the chief executive of the NHS hospitals trust that the world famous Charing Cross hospital would either be demolished or possibly have its specialised services moved to the Hammersmith hospital on the Wormwood Scrubs site. That would be a crazy move, and it is one that I have been elected in part to prevent.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-15_para21">
<a name="stpa_161">Charing Cross is a marvellous facility&#151;the centrepiece of a three star-rated hospital trust. It is a global leader in cancer care, vascular surgery, neurosurgery, plastic surgery and much else. It is the trauma centre for the whole of west London and is ideally situated just off the A4&nbsp;for any major incident at Heathrow. Most of all, it is also a local hospital, serving the needs not only of Hammersmith and Fulham, but of other parts of west London, and is easily accessible by tube, bus or car, which Hammersmith hospital is not.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-15_para22">
<a name="stpa_162">The proposal suits nobody other than the management of the trust, who are in turn driven only by meeting Government targets, which have led to huge deficits in both the local primary care trust and the hospitals trust. In classic new Labour fashion, spin doctors were deployed to deny the initial press reports in <i>The Observer</i> that the Charing Cross site would be sold off. Interestingly, however, there was no denial of the plans to move all or most of the specialised services to the Hammersmith site. I expect that more will be heard on the topic in the House, and I look forward to winning the battle with the Government to leave Charing Cross services on their current site.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-15_para23">
<a name="stpa_163">In conclusion, many people have asked me and others why the Conservatives did so well in Hammersmith and Fulham and elsewhere in London. The answer is that people in London are overtaxed and face declining public services. I predict major changes in the control of London boroughs in next May&#039;s election.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-15_para24">
<a name="stpa_164">I am delighted to become the first Conservative MP for Hammersmith since 1964&nbsp;and the first-ever Conservative MP for the combined seat of Hammersmith and Fulham.

<a name="stpa_169">Baroness Shephard rose through the ranks of the Conservative party faster than I can account for here today.

</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-16_para7">
<a name="stpa_172">My right hon. Friend debated in the House the lessons learned about rural crime and policing in the aftermath of the Tony Martin case. Like my right hon. 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>26 May 2005 : Column 910</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Friend, I am of the view that police resources are too thinly spread because the Government have focused on the wrong things. The Tony Martin case revealed people&#039;s attitudes to policing in rural areas and their ability to protect themselves in their own homes. The Government&#039;s centralised control of the police has sapped officers&#039; morale in Norfolk and elsewhere, increased bureaucracy and undermined confidence. It is time that we change direction.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-16_para8">
<a name="stpa_173">There is no doubt that we must recruit 5,000&nbsp;extra police officers each year. We must radically cut paperwork and introduce genuine local accountability through elected police commissioners, giving local people a say over police priorities. That will lead to genuine neighbourhood policing, with officers based in the locality and clearly focused on zero tolerance.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-16_para9">
<a name="stpa_174">Although recorded crime in Norfolk is down, certain categories of offences have witnessed increases. The total number of offences against the person rose in 2004&#150;05&nbsp;from 11,526&nbsp;to 12,920&#151;up by 12&nbsp;per cent. Offences of criminal damage have also increased. Such increases are above the national average, as the Norfolk regional press has noted. The Home Secretary has a seat in the county that is not too far from mine, so that should cause him enormous concern. Given my constituents&#039; real concerns about violent crime, he should display to the House in the coming weeks whether he is confident that the violent crimes Bill is not just more legislation, but will really make a difference. I am not so sure from what I have read about it that it will do the job.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-16_para10">
<a name="stpa_175">Those problems are compounded by the fact that annual detection rates in Norfolk have shown a consistent decline since 1998&#150;99. In that year, the percentage of detected crimes stood at 37&nbsp;per cent. By 2003&#150;04, that fell to a mere 26&nbsp;per cent., suggesting that such crimes remain undetected and that the figures are going in the wrong direction.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-16_para11">
<a name="stpa_176">The Conservative party made a pledge at the last election that the Norfolk constabulary would receive an additional 457&nbsp;police officers over the next eight years, of which the South-West Norfolk constituency would get an extra 63&nbsp;officers. I hope that the Home Secretary will come to the House in due course and give a pledge to my constituents that the Government will increase police numbers in Norfolk to match Conservative plans.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-16_para12">
<a name="stpa_177">We also made it plain at the election that criminals who are caught should be punished properly. Therefore, we must end the Government&#039;s early release from prison scheme and provide 20,000&nbsp;extra prison places. We must introduce honesty in sentencing so that criminals serve the full sentence handed down by the court and so that we deliver in open court the minimum time that they will serve behind bars.

<a name="stpa_180">My right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Folkestone and Hythe (Mr. Howard) said recently:

<a name="stpa_181">I support his sentiments. People think that the position we are in is absurd and they must be able to feel safe in their own homes. If a criminal breaks in, people must be able to defend themselves and, in doing so, must have no fear of the law.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-16_para17">
<a name="stpa_182">In the last Session of the previous Parliament, my hon. Friend the Member for Newark (Patrick Mercer), the shadow Minister for homeland security, proposed a Bill to give greater protection to householders who use force against burglars in the prevention of crime. My hon. Friend said that the fear of imprisonment or physical harm lay with the householder and that the intention of the Bill was to reverse that, because those fears should lie with the burglar. It is a pity that the Bill was not successful and was not supported by the Government.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-16_para18">
<a name="stpa_183">In <i>The Daily Telegraph</i> on 4&nbsp;December 2004, Sir John Stevens, the then Metropolitan Police Commissioner, argued that those who defend their families and property should face prosecution over injuries to intruders only in extreme circumstances if they can be shown to have used gratuitous violence. The Government will know that there is still considerable anxiety and confusion among my constituents and others about the degree of force that they may use legitimately against an intruder to defend themselves without finding themselves subject to prosecution.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-16_para19">
<a name="stpa_184">I should like the Home Secretary to address another problem. Does he think that the guidance issued to householders earlier this year on the use of force is sufficient to resolve their doubts? Do the Government intend to revisit this issue and consider changing the law to give householders greater protection?
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-16_para20">
<a name="stpa_185">The Government promised that 5,000&nbsp;antisocial behaviour orders would be issued every year. We have not reached that figure after six years and, of those issued, nearly half have been breached. They are effectively worthless. We need proper policing by officers on the street who are not tied down by paperwork and bureaucracy. I must ask the Home Secretary whether the Government accept that ASBOs are no substitute for real policing.

: Speaking as someone who was himself a retread, I welcome my hon. Friend back to the Chamber. Is not the point about ASBOs that when they are breached, the courts should hit those yobs hard, generally with a custodial sentence? Only that will send out the message to these people that they must respect the ASBOs and stop their offending behaviour, which is destroying our communities, and stop attacking innocent and often elderly people.

I hope that the Home Secretary will address my concerns and those of my constituents.

<a name="50526-17_para0">
<a name="stpa_186">I have tabled various questions over the past 24&nbsp;hours or so and I look forward to the answers in relation to policing in places such as Norfolk, because security in one&#039;s home, feeling safe and what one can do as an individual without facing the law in an unjust way are issues that have to come to this House in a timely manner. I hope that the relevant Bills in the Queen&#039;s Speech will address those matters and that the Home Secretary will ensure that all people in Norfolk&#151;his constituents as well as mine&#151;are better off because of the Government&#039;s plans, and not worse off.

<p><a name="st_96"><a name="50526-17_spnew2"><b> Jenny Willott  (Cardiff, Central) (LD):</b> 
 I congratulate all those who have made their maiden speeches before me, and particular credit goes to those who did so without notes. I look forward to working with new Members on both sides of the House for at least the next four to five years and, I hope, for longer. It is a great honour to make my maiden speech in such impressive surroundings and in such impressive company, in a place with so much history. I should like to claim my own small place in history today as I am the first female Member of Parliament for Cardiff, Central and the first Liberal Democrat woman in Cardiff. There has only ever been one Liberal woman MP in Wales, Megan Lloyd George, who later joined Labour. I can assure the House that history will not be repeating itself.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-17_para1">
<a name="stpa_187">This year, we had the highest ever Liberal Democrat vote in Cardiff and victory has been a long time coming. The Liberals last won in 1923&nbsp;when Sir Harry Webb was the MP. But in the year of the Welsh grand slam in the millennium stadium, in the heart of my constituency, the Liberal Democrats have won the grand slam in Cardiff, Central, winning 100&nbsp;per cent. of the seats at every level of politics. I am proud to be elected to represent the heart of Cardiff in 2005, the centenary of Cardiff becoming a city and the 50th anniversary of Cardiff becoming the Welsh capital.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-17_para2">
<a name="stpa_188">While I am not staking a claim so early on in my political career, Cardiff, Central has an impressive history of its Members of Parliament becoming Ministers. My immediate predecessor, Jon Owen Jones, was Welsh Health Minister in the run-up to devolution in 1999&nbsp;and his predecessor Ian Grist was a Conservative Minister in the Welsh Office from 1987&nbsp;to 1990. I believe that Ian Grist&#039;s predecessor, Michael Roberts, was a Conservative Minister in the 1970s.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-17_para3">
<a name="stpa_189">It is a long-standing tradition of maiden speeches that the new Member of Parliament should say something nice about their predecessor. It must be difficult losing a seat that one has represented for years and, although Jon Owen Jones and I did not see eye to eye, there were a number of issues on which we agreed and I pay tribute to his work on them. During his time in this House, he introduced a ten-minute Bill to ban the sale of junk food in school vending machines. Given the current trend of increasing childhood obesity and the associated health problems, Jon took an important stand on this issue&#151;he was, I suggest, the Jamie Oliver of Parliament and I salute him for it.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>26 May 2005 : Column 913</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-17_para4">
<a name="stpa_190">I also agreed with Jon about his opposition to the war in Iraq and commend his courage in standing up against his own party on this point of principle. Jon dedicated 13&nbsp;years of his life to being the Member of Parliament for the people of Cardiff, Central, and I am sure that many would want to thank him for that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-17_para5">
<a name="stpa_191">Cardiff, Central is a very diverse constituency, with some of the wealthiest areas in Wales as well as some areas of significant deprivation. It ranges from the prosperous suburbs of Cyncoed to the estates of Pentwyn and Llanedeyrn, and the inner-city area of Adamsdown, which is an EU objective 2&nbsp;area owing to the levels of deprivation there. Cardiff is an amazing city that is becoming progressively younger, increasingly ethnically diverse, and more and more vibrant. My constituency has five mosques, two synagogues, numerous churches and chapels and two Sikh gurdwaras, and an amazing choice of food in the local restaurants and shops as a result.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-17_para6">
<a name="stpa_192">There are four universities in Cardiff, three of which are in my constituency. Cardiff, Central has one of the largest&#151;if not the largest&#151;student populations in the UK. It has almost 16,000&nbsp;students, who significantly enhance the economic and cultural life of Cardiff, Central, particularly with the Royal Welsh college of music and drama at its heart.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-17_para7">
<a name="stpa_193">Not surprisingly, Cardiff, Central covers the city centre, with all the economic and cultural opportunity that that brings. I am fortunate in that, unlike some Members before me, I do not have to talk about the interesting sights just outside my constituency. In Cardiff, Central, we have Cardiff castle and Cathays park, representing Cardiff&#039;s history, and the jewel of Roath park, with its magnificent lake and memorial to Captain Scott. Unusually for a city seat, we are also fortunate enough to have a ribbon of parks running for miles, almost from one side of the constituency to the other.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-17_para8">
<a name="stpa_194">At the opposite end of the spectrum, we have impressive new modern buildings in the city centre. They include the Millennium stadium, which has brought huge economic and social benefits to the city. As many will know, the FA cup final was held there last weekend&#151;probably for the last time for a while, unfortunately. One of the biggest advantages of hosting such sporting events is that they encourage people who would otherwise never come to Wales to visit Cardiff. I have lost count of the number of times that friends and acquaintances, following trips to the Millennium stadium, have said to me in tones of great surprise, &quot;Cardiff&#039;s really nice, isn&#039;t it?&quot; A unique selling point that sets Cardiff, Central apart from every other constituency in Wales is the fact that it does not have a single sheep in it.

</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-17_para9">
<a name="stpa_195">Looking ahead, I am passionate about campaigning on the issues that matter to my constituents and, as part of the official Opposition in Wales, I hope to be able to make a real difference. The rebanding of council tax has hit many residents of Cardiff, Central extremely hard. More and more people want to live in my constituency&#151;presumably because it is now Liberal Democrat&#151;and house prices have risen disproportionately. Nine out of 10&nbsp;people in the area in which I live have seen their houses go up by at least one council tax band&#151;indeed, my house has gone up by two. Seven out of 10&nbsp;people in my constituency will have to pay significantly more tax, just as a result of the 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>26 May 2005 : Column 914</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>rebanding. I will do all that I can to raise the concerns of my constituents on this issue and to work towards a fairer alternative, namely the local income tax.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-17_para10">
<a name="stpa_196">One of the other great concerns during the election was the state of the local health service. We have some of the longest waiting lists in Europe and the hospitals in Cardiff are creaking under the strain. Recently, the main hospital in Wales&#151;the Heath hospital in Cardiff&#151;had to close the doors of its accident and emergency unit for 14&nbsp;hours. Ranks of ambulances full of waiting patients are not an uncommon sight outside the A and E. The situation has worsened over recent years, primarily as a result of the introduction of the Care Standards Act 2000. Over the past five years, almost every nursing home in my constituency has closed, leaving Cardiff with 200&nbsp;too few nursing home beds and 200&nbsp;too many people in hospital beds. The local council is working hard with the local health board and the Welsh Assembly to secure investment in new nursing homes, and I will do what I can to help them.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-17_para11">
<a name="stpa_197">As we would expect in a constituency with so many students, tuition fees and top-up fees are a huge issue, and not only for the young people themselves. Many parents, grandparents and employers have expressed their opposition to fees, and I only hope that the Welsh Assembly Government take on board the majority view among Assembly Members, which is opposed to variable fees.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-17_para12">
<a name="stpa_198">I have been given lots of pieces of advice over the past few weeks, some more helpful than others. One letter from a constituent really struck a chord, however. People in Cardiff, Central have long memories, and the letter harked back to Jon Owen Jones&#039;s predecessor, the Conservative MP Ian Grist. One paragraph read:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_12">&quot;If you are half as good as our old MP, Ian Grist, then that will do for me. Ian Grist was a wonderful MP for Cardiff. He made himself available 3&nbsp;Saturdays out of 4, and he got things done. Put yourself about in Cardiff and you won&#039;t go far wrong.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-17_para13">
<a name="stpa_199">That is a good piece of advice, and one that I shall endeavour to remember over the next four to five years. If all else fails, I can always fall back on the advice that my mother used to give me, and which is taken from a prayer:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_13">&quot;Grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-17_para14">
<a name="stpa_200">That is as true in politics as it is in the rest of my life. I can only do my best to follow that advice and, in so doing, I hope to make Cardiff, Central proud.

 Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker, for calling me to deliver my maiden speech before the Whitsun recess. I am particularly pleased to follow the hon. Member for Cardiff, Central (Jenny Willott), because she was one of the first new Members from the other parties whom I met when I came to the House. It is especially pleasing to follow her.
</p>

<a name="50526-18_para0">
<a name="stpa_201">I congratulate my hon. Friends the Members for Hammersmith and Fulham (Mr. Hands), for Welwyn Hatfield (Grant Shapps), for The Wrekin (Mark Pritchard) and for various other constituencies, who delivered their speeches today. I am sure that the House will be much the better for the return of my hon. Friend the Member for South-West Norfolk (Mr. Fraser). It is 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>26 May 2005 : Column 915</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>an honour to serve as the Member of Parliament for Putney, because Putney is my home. Before I talk about the area, however, I would like to pay tribute to my predecessor, Tony Colman. Both as a candidate and now as an MP, I have a huge amount of respect for him. He has been extremely successful not just in politics&#151;he was leader of Merton council before becoming Member of Parliament for Putney&#151;but in business. He helped to found the Topshop chain and certainly did his bit to push forward the UK economy during the &#039;80s.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-18_para1">
<a name="stpa_202">Tony Colman also delivered a huge amount to the House of Commons. He was a member of the International Development Committee, and he played a key role in ensuring that international development rose rapidly up the political agenda in this country. He spent a great deal of time touring countries to see for himself the issues that people face. Locally in Putney, Tony Colman was an assiduous campaigner on aircraft noise, which is something I shall talk about later. It is of great concern to many constituents, and to my fellow residents who live near the Thames in Putney. He did a huge amount for the constituency, and I wish him well in his future career.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-18_para2">
<a name="stpa_203">It is perhaps particularly fitting that I deliver my maiden speech today, because we have spent a fair amount of time discussing electoral reform and proportional representation. Many hon. Members will know that Putney was the site of the Putney debates, which took place at the time of the English civil war. Oliver Cromwell and his generals camped in Putney for a while, and they used that time to talk about the future shape of the country and how Parliament should operate. They had a decapitation strategy in place long before the right hon. Member for Ross, Skye and Lochaber (Mr. Kennedy) came up with the idea and, dare I say, it was a lot more successful.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-18_para3">
<a name="stpa_204">If the House will indulge me, I shall talk wistfully about my constituency of Putney. In many respects, the constituency name is a misnomer, because Putney comprises many communities, and like many constituencies in London, it is full of vibrant communities and residents&#039; associations. In summary, Putney can be classed as Putney, Roehampton and Southfields. Putney itself sprang up as a crossing point on the Thames to get from Putney to Fulham, and a vibrant business community has developed on the Upper Richmond and Lower Richmond roads and Putney high street ever since.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-18_para4">
<a name="stpa_205">I encourage Members to join me in attending the university boat race, which starts in Putney every year. We are blessed with some of the most wonderful open spaces in London on our doorstep. I am delighted that I have about half an acre of Wimbledon common in my patch. We are bordered by Richmond park, so I took a keen interest in the Queen&#039;s Speech when the Queen noted that there will be legislation to improve and update the management of common land. As Member of Parliament for Putney, I shall be keen to participate in discussion of the legislation to ensure that it safeguards the open spaces that people in my constituency value so much.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-18_para5">
<a name="stpa_206">Elsewhere in Putney, we have Southfields, which was established by the Quakers. The Southfields grid is an amazing network of roads that criss-cross one another 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>26 May 2005 : Column 916</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>built many years ago by the Quaker community. An extraordinary sense of community lives on in Southfields today. Earlier this week, I attended the Southfields Grid residents association annual general meeting, which was well attended. It shows that, even now, when people are switching off more and more from politics, at the grass roots, people still want to get involved with their local community and to do everything that they can to fight on its behalf. I look forward, as a Member of Parliament, to joining the Southfields Grid residents association for its yearly carol singing outside Southfields tube station. We raised &#163;300&nbsp;for the Trinity hospice last year, and I could not decide whether people were giving us money so that they could walk away quickly, or whether they appreciated our carol singing&#151;probably the former rather than the latter.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-18_para6">
<a name="stpa_207">In my constituency, Roehampton faces perhaps some of the greatest challenges. Although many Members might think that Putney is a leafy London suburb, and in many respects, I believe, it offers the best of London living, combining close proximity to the centre of London with a leafy suburb that is amenable to living in, it contains one of the country&#039;s largest council estates. I make the pledge today to residents on the Alton estate that I will work tirelessly with them to address the growing concern of drugs and antisocial behaviour. None of the estates in my constituency are sink estates, and I will make sure, if I do one thing as MP, that none of them become sink estates. We need the Alton estate to be an estate of which people can be proud, and many residents have lived there since it was built in the 1950s. I will work with them to make it a place that they can remain proud to call home.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-18_para7">
<a name="stpa_208">There is much of which to be proud elsewhere in my constituency. In this time of much protracted discussion about health care reform, I have on my patch a world-class hospital, the Royal Hospital for Neuro-disability in West Hill, which has done incredible research and provides outstanding care to patients with some of the most challenging neurological and physical medical conditions in the country. It is an independent hospital providing outstanding treatment to NHS patients, of whom its staff take so much care. We should therefore be conscious that local health care can deliver an amazing service outside of the NHS but working with NHS patients. If for no other reason, we must get rid of the political dogma that people who care about health care work only in the NHS. There are many such people in this country who work in independent trusts and charitable foundations such as the Royal Hospital for Neuro-disability.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-18_para8">
<a name="stpa_209">I and my constituents are extremely concerned about many issues, however. Although I recognise that there are now police community support officers across the country, and increasing numbers of fully trained officers, that is not the case in my area of Wandsworth. Over the past eight years, since the current Administration came to power, we have seen fewer police. It is vital that we work together to put more trained officers, who can arrest people, back on the streets of my constituency, and above all, in places such as the Alton estate, which is increasingly blighted by antisocial behaviour.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-18_para9">
<a name="stpa_210">The District line also raises issues, which the hon. Member for Hammersmith and Fulham (Mr. Hands) has already discussed. As the only tube line feeding my 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>26 May 2005 : Column 917</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>area, on which many of my constituents depend to get to work every day, it is vital that it runs safely and reliably. It is also vital that something called public transport, which, clearly, the District line is, is accessible to the public. I always joke that one must practically abseil down the steps into Southfields station in winter, but it is impossible for women with prams and the elderly to use the steps. We must address that as a matter of urgency.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-18_para10">
<a name="stpa_211">Finally, aircraft noise is an issue, which I have mentioned. My predecessor worked assiduously to help to ban night flights and I will continue that fight and work with other Members who are similarly affected by the issue. It is high time that we recognised that, as with the development of the green belt, a balance needs to be found between quality of life and the noise with which people who live close to airports must put up day to day. We simply cannot continue to develop Heathrow until it bursts at the seams. At some point, we must draw a line in the sand and say, &quot;Thus far and no further.&quot; I believe we have reached that line and, in many respects, crossed it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-18_para11">
<a name="stpa_212">When I became the candidate in Putney, I was told that it was a bellwether seat. Perhaps I am living proof that that may not be true, as I am the first Opposition Member of Parliament for Putney for several decades. One of the things that I have already learned during my time in politics is that, although people may be on different sides of the political fence, no political party in the country has a monopoly on good intentions. I will therefore do my best to contribute to the House through strong debate, which I think produces strong legislation that will deliver for people outside the Chamber&#151;people in the country who depend absolutely on the quality of the work done here every day on their behalf.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-18_para12">
<a name="stpa_213">I hope that I can play my full role here over the coming years, both in the Chamber and in the Committees that support it. I will do my utmost to be the very best constituency Member that I can be for Putney, Roehampton and Southfields, and I look forward to the coming years of debate with Members who are present today.

I may be accused of bias, but I believe that it is a fantastic place to live. The distinct areas that make up East Dunbartonshire retain a strong sense of community spirit. Situated just 20&nbsp;minutes from the bustling cosmopolitan city centre of Glasgow and a similarly short distance from the lush beauty of Loch Lomond, it really does enjoy the best of both worlds. Hence it is a lovely place to visit, and I encourage hon. Members to do so, though perhaps not with the purpose that several right hon. Labour Members had when they visited earlier this year.

In Bishopbriggs, the main post office has been under threat, although I am now optimistic that, thanks to the support of thousands of local people, the facility will be kept in the town centre.

We must ensure that our economic record continues in order to win fourth and perhaps even fifth terms in office. The benign economic environment has meant that voters, particularly Labour voters, have forgiven the Government for other less popular policies. Even I have disagreed with Ministers and the Government on some issues.

<a name="stpa_232">We must keep the economy strong. The truth is that we are now facing rather more difficult times. Forecasts have been made in the newspapers both today and yesterday of the difficult times that lie ahead unless we take appropriate action. Growth has long been driven primarily by consumer spending and economic demand. That has been based, in turn, on rising asset values. Since the collapse of the exchange rate mechanism in 1992, house prices have risen and there has been a surge in stock market values. Growth was so strong that it accommodated a substantial appreciation of sterling in the late 1990s&#151;much to my surprise, I must say, because I had thought that such an appreciation would damage economic growth. That did not happen and we sailed through it, just as we sailed through a sharp fall in the stock market subsequently.

<a name="stpa_233">Such events may have been expected to throw us off course, but the economy has continued to grow. House prices have been the basic reason for that. As they have continued to rise, so have the asset values that matter to most people&#151;their own homes. Particularly for working people, the price of their house is more significant than the state of the stock market. That is not true of other countries, but it is certainly true of Britain.

 Does the hon. Gentleman agree that one of the main consequences of the incredible inflation of house prices is the lack of affordable housing in this country? Does he also agree that it is now urgent for hon. Members on both sides of the House to find some methodology whereby new entrants to the housing market could afford to buy their properties? Perhaps we should also revisit the opportunity to increase the stock of rental housing in the council sector.

 I largely agree with that, and I and other Labour Members who belong to the parliamentary council housing group have urged the Government to build council houses in the traditional way, to provide decent homes for working people who cannot&#151;or who do not choose to&#151;own their own homes.
</p>








<p><a name="st_104"><a name="50526-20_spnew2"><b> Chris Grayling: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman is making an important point, but I am sure that he will agree that the rate of construction of affordable housing fell 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>26 May 2005 : Column 922</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>dramatically after 1997. Had this country continued to build affordable housing at the pre-1997&nbsp;rate, our housing stock for people who cannot afford to buy their own homes would now be several hundred thousand greater than it is at present.
</p>








<p><a name="st_105"><a name="50526-20_spnew3"><b> Kelvin Hopkins: </b> 
 Even before 1997, the rate of house building was too low. Over decades, Conservative Governments provided heavy subsidies for council house sales, which led to a depletion of the housing stock that has caused terrible problems in my constituency. I have urged the Government to put a brake on council house sales in Luton, but so far without success. I think that such a brake is essential, and that council house sales must be conducted according to their market value rather than their subsidised value. Even then, the proceeds should be used to provide other houses for renting in the same area.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-20_para0">
<a name="stpa_235">The housing crisis is serious, as the Government now recognise. My right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister has talked about how the problem might be tackled, but helping more people become owner-occupiers without increasing the housing stock is not the solution. The result of that might only be still further house price inflation, when what we really want is more stock, as the hon. Member for Epsom and Ewell (Chris Grayling) rightly said. We need more houses in the right areas, and more in the public rented sector available for people who cannot afford to buy.

 I agree entirely with my hon. Friend, whose constituency is in the same county as mine. I am aware of the problem that he describes.

 I thank my hon. Friend for giving way, as I want to sidetrack him in a slightly different direction. He suggests that we should build more council accommodation, which would require a significant increase in Government borrowing unless other areas of public expenditure were to be reduced. What is his assessment of the likely impact on the economy of that increase in borrowing?
</p>








<p><a name="st_111"><a name="50526-20_spnew9"><b> Kelvin Hopkins: </b> 
 Borrowing for investment is separate from borrowing to finance the economic cycle, which 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>26 May 2005 : Column 923</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>goes to pay for unemployment and so on. As long as the borrowing can be funded&#151;from rents, or possibly Government subsidy&#151;there is no problem. Gross borrowing is at very low levels, and long-term interest rates are low, which makes borrowing cheap. A difficulty might arise if the economy and the construction sector were to overheat, as that might cause the building of more houses to lead to prices being bid up. We must therefore ensure that houses can be built without overheating.
</p>








<p><a name="st_112"><a name="50526-20_spnew10"><b> Mr. Love: </b> 
 The reputation of my right hon. Friend the Chancellor is built on his fiscal rules. The sustainable investment rule, which deals with borrowing for investment rather than for current expenditure, is universally recognised to be very tight. Would not an increase in borrowing risk breaking that rule, and pose a challenge to the Chancellor&#039;s reputation?
</p>








<p><a name="st_113"><a name="50526-20_spnew11"><b> Kelvin Hopkins: </b> 
 I do not think so, but I might have a debate with my right hon. Friend the Chancellor about it. We should perhaps have a higher level of gross borrowing. We have low levels by international standards, and provided that he borrows for investment and it is fundable&#151;in the sense of the return on the borrowing&#151;it would not be a problem. If one simply wanted to borrow for current spending, it might be a problem and could lead to budget deficits and even inflation. One has to keep current spending at an appropriate level. However, borrowing for investment in the long term, provided it can be funded, is not a problem. It is important to separate current spending and capital spending when it comes to borrowing limits.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-20_para2">
<a name="stpa_237">The house price surge has started to reach its limits. People are warier about borrowing against the rising value of their houses, and that is inevitable. We pull in our horns when we think that house prices might not rise much more. We say, &quot;Well, we&#039;ll put off buying the car this year and we won&#039;t have so many meals out.&quot; We can choose not to spend, but if we all did that, we could quickly move into a recession or at least an economic slowdown. That is what we have to avoid, and we should look to the instruments of macroeconomic policy to ensure that economic demand is sustained in the long term at an appropriate level to maintain employment levels and growth. Those instruments are monetary policy, fiscal policy and the exchange rate.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-20_para3">
<a name="stpa_238">On monetary policy, the chief economist at Capital Economics said that the Bank of England will soon have to cut rates below the 2003&nbsp;record low of 3.5&nbsp;per cent. to ensure that monetary policy is not too tight. I was a little concerned when the Chancellor chose to reduce the target for the RPI(X) measure of inflation from 2.5&nbsp;per cent. to 2&nbsp;per cent. I see nothing wrong in raising that target to 2.5&nbsp;per cent. again as a 0.5&nbsp;per cent. inflation difference is not significant compared with the inflation rates that we have had in the past. If the economy would be damaged by keeping the target at 2&nbsp;per cent., but would be healthier if it were 2.5&nbsp;per cent., I would choose a 2.5&nbsp;per cent. target. The record of interest rates since 1997&nbsp;shows that the average level of inflation&#151;the RPI(X)&#151;over that period is about 2.5&nbsp;per cent. It is certainly nearer 2.5&nbsp;per cent. than 2&nbsp;per cent. We have had a strong economy in that period and there is nothing 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>26 May 2005 : Column 924</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>fundamentally wrong in having a slightly higher inflation target. We became terrified of inflation because of high rates, but the era of high inflation is long past. The economy is not now naturally inflation prone and we could easily adjust the tight inflation targets slightly.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-20_para4">
<a name="stpa_239">The second instrument is fiscal policy. As the economy moves into recession&#151;if we are approaching that part of the cycle&#151;it is natural to spend more. Indeed, one has to spend more if unemployment starts to rise and tax revenues start to fall. It is a natural tendency to spend more during that period, but I urge my right hon. Friend the Chancellor to use public spending, as we have traditionally done in the past, to ensure that the economy keeps growing and unemployment stays low. We have been petrified of public spending because it did get out of control when we had high levels of unemployment in serious recessions. We had two such recessions during the period of Conservative Government and, inevitably, public spending got out of control. It is inevitable because the unemployed have to be looked after and tax revenues collapse. We are not in that situation now and I urge the Chancellor to use public spending wisely as a tool to ensure that we keep the economy growing.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-20_para5">
<a name="stpa_240">Finally I come to the exchange rate. Fortunately we are not in the eurozone, so we can adjust our exchange rate to meet the needs of our economy. The exchange rate is too high. The evidence for that is our structural trade deficit. If it is permanent and goes on year after year, something is wrong with the exchange rate: the price at which we sell our exports and the price we pay for our imports. We have reached the point when we should think seriously about intervening in the markets to bring down the exchange rate relative particularly to other developed nations.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-20_para6">
<a name="stpa_241">There is much talk about competitiveness. It can be affected by many factors, but above all by the exchange rate. If the exchange rate is, for example, 20&nbsp;per cent. too high, clearly one is less competitive. I believe that it is too high and we should now intervene. There are techniques of intervention that could bring down the exchange rate, which were suggested by, among others, Gerald Holtham, former director of the Institute for Public Policy Research, such as intervening in the bond markets.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-20_para7">
<a name="stpa_242">Our great advantage in fiscal policy, monetary policy and the exchange rate is that we have control over our own economy. That is because we are not a member of the eurozone. The Chancellor has been wise to steer us clear of it for eight years. During the general election the Prime Minister said that he thought it unlikely that we would join during this Parliament. Even he has accepted that it is not sensible. It is certainly not possible because people will never vote for it.

</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-20_para8">
<a name="stpa_243">Our economy is relatively strong compared with that of Germany, which has the opposite problem. It cannot control its economy because it has no control over its macroeconomic levers. If it could disentangle itself from the euro and operate those levers, it could recover and perhaps even build a healthy economy like ours, with full employment and strong growth. Indeed, if I were a Back-Bench social democratic member of the Bundestag, I would urge the Chancellor to disentangle Germany from the euro and re-establish the deutschmark. It would be a sensible policy and can be done.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>26 May 2005 : Column 925</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-20_para9">
<a name="stpa_244">Currencies can be separated. There is evidence for it. When the Czech Republic and Slovakia were set up as separate countries, they established separate currencies. They varied their values with each other. A closer example is the Irish punt. It used to be tied rigidly to the pound, but then it became a separate currency and now Ireland has the euro. There is absolutely no reason why the German economy could not disentangle itself from the euro. Understandably, there would be certain political ramifications. It would cause a few shockwaves round Europe, but the policy would be a sensible one. If Germany had a strong economy again, the whole of Europe would be stronger economically. It might even have an economy as strong as that which has been built on the good sense of our Chancellor of the Exchequer.

I vividly remember the huge excitement when the then Prime Minister swooshed in, followed by the Ministers and various MPs whom we recognised, and of course we were captivated for the 20&nbsp;minutes of Prime Minister&#039;s Question Time. However, not knowing the procedure in those days&#151;I confess that I still do not&#151;we were very surprised when the Prime Minister and all the Ministers swooshed out again after 20&nbsp;minutes, and we then had to sit through about an hour and a half of a forestry debate. An hour of a forestry debate may not have been enough to deter me from wanting to take my place in the House, but I have to say that none of my colleagues who were with me that day has shown any interest.

<a name="stpa_251">Unlike many of the big cities such as Manchester, Birmingham or Liverpool, we do not use the name of an area for Leeds, North-West because there is no area that could claim to be the notable area of my seat. Indeed, the local Conservative association still has not worked out that the seat is called Leeds, North-West, and its members refer to themselves as North West Leeds Conservatives. But that is something of a faux pas, and one piece of advice I would give hon.

At present nothing is being done to address the ever-worsening problems of congestion, because we are still waiting for a decision from the Secretary of State for Transport.

 I congratulate all the Members who have spoken in the debate, especially those who gave their maiden speeches today. They brought to life the places they represent in a way that almost makes me want to visit those areas, but I am happy with the constituency of Bedford and Kempston that I have the honour to represent. The maiden speeches we have heard showed a remarkable balance of clarity, humanity and intelligence. We have certainly heard generosity, too, from several speakers, including the hon. Member for Leeds, North-West (Greg Mulholland) in his remarks about Harold Best, who was one of the kindest people I met in the House and will be much missed.

<a name="stpa_263">I apologise for not being in the Chamber from the beginning of the debate. Prior business prevented me from being in my place, but I have listened to several speeches during the last hour or so.

<a name="stpa_264">I had hoped to make the contribution that I am about to make during the debates on the Queen&#039;s Speech, although it is understandable that I was unable to do so due to the need to give priority to maiden speeches. I want to talk about council tax, an issue of considerable and growing concern to most of the people I represent, and one that the Government are determined to tackle.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-22_para2">
<a name="stpa_265">Although specific legislation was not brought forward in the Queen&#039;s Speech, I have no doubt that in the months ahead the House will spend much time talking about council tax, revaluation and the recommendations of the Lyons review of the financing of local councils. I am sure that I am not the only Member who is eagerly awaiting a special Christmas present&#151;the publication of the Lyons review. I understand that it is on schedule to report, as required, by December.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-22_para3">
<a name="stpa_266">Although concern about council tax is expressed throughout the country, it is understandably acute in Bedford and Kempston and throughout Bedfordshire. Band D council tax in Bedford is now &#163;1,323.71, having risen 81&nbsp;per cent. from &#163;731&nbsp;in 1997. Despite the fact that Bedfordshire county council has received a real-terms increase of 33&nbsp;per cent. in Government grant since 1997, in stark contrast to the real-terms cut of 7&nbsp;per cent. during the last four years under the Conservatives, it has managed to become the third-highest taxing authority in the country. To compound that felony, the council has been found consistently to be the worst performing. From being judged &quot;poor&quot; in the comprehensive 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>26 May 2005 : Column 929</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>performance assessment, it has now made some recovery to &quot;weak&quot;. Its children&#039;s services have been placed under special measures and a few days ago Ofsted found that its youth services were unsatisfactory on all counts.
</p>








<p><a name="st_116"><a name="50526-22_spnew1"><b> Kelvin Hopkins: </b> 
 As I am from the same county, my hon. Friend&#039;s remarks are of interest. Does he agree that Luton was extremely wise to separate itself as a unitary authority?
</p>








<p><a name="st_117"><a name="50526-22_spnew2"><b> Patrick Hall: </b> 
 As a former member of Bedfordshire county council, I confess to some sadness when Luton took that step eight years ago, but I can understand why it did so. For people living in Bedfordshire, that draws attention to the potential advantages of unitary authorities rather than to the situation we face at district and county council level.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-22_para4">
<a name="stpa_267">The county council is run with a rod of iron by the Conservative party. For the past eight years, until the recent elections, the ruling Conservative group had only a small majority, yet it refused to allocate places on the executive and other structures to the Labour and Liberal Democrat groups. The poor performance and high taxing of Bedfordshire is thus entirely down to the Conservatives. They can blame no other group, and certainly not the council staff. The Conservative group in Bedfordshire bears full responsibility for what is happening, so guess what happened at the county council elections three weeks ago? The demonstrably failed Conservative group, which had increased its overall majority from one in 1997&nbsp;to three in 2001, was gratefully rewarded by the people of Bedfordshire for being pretty useless by an increase in its majority to 20.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-22_para5">
<a name="stpa_268">Surely that is one of the most bizarre election results of all time. Perhaps Bedfordshire Conservatives could let us into their secret. Do they have a Blarney stone hidden in the bowels of county hall, or do they perform the darks arts in some way to mask what they have really done to the people of Bedfordshire? I add in haste, however, that the people of Bedford and Kempston did not come under that spell to the same extent as those elsewhere in the county. In the constituency that I have the honour to represent there are only three Conservative county councillors out of 11, and six of them are Labour. The residents of Bedford and Kempston understand that the council tax is a Tory tax made worse by a Tory council. They also understand that a Labour Government are most likely to bring about the necessary changes in the funding of local councils and to make funding fairer, more transparent and more effective.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-22_para6">
<a name="stpa_269">Although a high-taxing authority such as Bedfordshire county council puts an added burden on local residents, it has to be said that there are systemic weaknesses with the council tax itself, and I shall now turn to those. First, it is inherently regressive and that is reflected in the fact that although a person on band H pays three times more than someone on band A, the band H property is valued at eight times more than the property on band A.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-22_para7">
<a name="stpa_270">Secondly, there is the gearing effect due to the fact that the council tax raises about 26&nbsp;per cent. of local council budgets. That means that if a council wishes to raise its budget by an extra 1&nbsp;per cent. from the council 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>26 May 2005 : Column 930</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>tax, the tax has to go up by about 4&nbsp;per cent. Above-inflation increases are very difficult to avoid and will always tend to make the council tax stand out as a big tax unless we make radical changes.
</p>








<p><a name="st_118"><a name="50526-22_spnew3"><b> Kelvin Hopkins: </b> 
 Does my hon. Friend agree that the gearing problem could, to some extent, be overcome if the Government chose to return a business rate to local authorities?
</p>








<p><a name="st_119"><a name="50526-22_spnew4"><b> Patrick Hall: </b> 
 Indeed, I am just about to come to that, because it follows logically from what I have just said. My hon. Friend picked that point up instantly. The business rate is the one area of radical change that we could consider and make. I hope that the Lyons review will come up with a careful assessment of that possibility.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-22_para8">
<a name="stpa_271">The business rate was nationalised by the Conservative Government in 1990, and that leaves the domestic council tax payers as the only significant source of revenue open to the decision of local councils. Even that is constrained by Government capping powers, and I would like to mention them. I was a councillor in the past, but I would not attempt to be a councillor and a Member of Parliament at the same time. That is a matter for the hon. Member for Leeds, North-West to resolve in the weeks and months ahead. Good for him if he can do it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-22_para9">
<a name="stpa_272">I am uncomfortable with capping. I believe that decisions about locally raised revenue are best taken locally and that, if levels of local taxation are judged to be excessive by local people, the local electorate should cap the councillors by booting them out of office. That is the best way to deal with the issue. However, in exceptional circumstances, I accept that there may be a need to use reserve powers and that what I have said does not appear to apply to the people of Bedfordshire as a whole who continue to return Conservatives to the county council.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-22_para10">
<a name="stpa_273">When the business rate was nationalised, it was pegged to inflation, but the council tax was not. Therefore, over the years, the share of local council budgets carried by businesses and local residents has shifted significantly on to the shoulders of residents. While the business rate contribution has dropped from 29&nbsp;to 22&nbsp;per cent. over the past 12&nbsp;or 13&nbsp;years, that from council tax has increased from 20&nbsp;to 26&nbsp;per cent. In effect, that means that the council tax payer is subsidising the business ratepayer, a situation that is unfair and unsustainable. We need to address that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-22_para11">
<a name="stpa_274">It makes sense to return the business rate to local councils if we want a fair share of the cost of local council services to be paid and to reduce the gearing effect, although that would not be an automatic panacea.
</p>








<p><a name="st_120"><a name="50526-22_spnew5"><b> Mr. Love </b> 
: My hon. Friend&#039;s argument is a little inconsistent. Surely the problem with the business rate is that it has been pegged to inflation. It would not be necessary to abolish the unified business rate because we could simply urge business to pay its proper proportion to achieve what he wants.
</p>








<p><a name="st_121"><a name="50526-22_spnew6"><b> Patrick Hall: </b> 
 It would be difficult for a centrally determined level of business rates to take account of the 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>26 May 2005 : Column 931</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>varying conditions throughout the country with which locally elected councils deal. If we want councils to play a strong role in our civic society, there must be some scope for variation because otherwise they lack the power to do what we want them to. I am not in favour of a nationally applied rate because it leads to the situation in which we demonstrably find ourselves, with the burden unfairly carried.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-22_para12">
<a name="stpa_275">Re-localising the business rate would not be an automatic solution to the problems of the council tax. There would have to be understanding and support from the business community. I also think that a measure of protection would be needed because although residents have a vote, businesses do not, so they could reasonably argue that such protection would be needed because there would be no immediate electoral kick-back from a council&#039;s decisions to increase the local business rate, as there would be from a council tax increase. We would certainly need to retain a national equalisation mechanism to redistribute business rate yields because they might be high for some councils and low for others. None the less, on balance there is much to commend in the re-localisation of the business rate.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-22_para13">
<a name="stpa_276">If property tax is to remain as the source&#151;or indeed a source&#151;of locally raised revenue, which is likely even if we consider the possibility of adding a local sales tax or indeed a local income tax to the armoury as a result of the Lyons review, it is crucial that it is based on accurate information about the value of property. Such information must then be fed into a robust system that can be regularly updated so that revaluation exercises are sensible and effective. The Government have made it clear that the revaluation exercise for England that is about to begin will be revenue-neutral. The value of the council tax bands will be uprated to reflect house price inflation, but that should result in the overwhelming majority of properties remaining in the same band. However, achieving that will pose difficulties due to not only strong regional variations in house prices, but large variations within regions.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-22_para14">
<a name="stpa_277">I understand why people in England express fears about the possible effects of revaluation because the experience in Wales was that 40&nbsp;per cent. of properties ended up at least one band higher. We must make it clear that revaluation is not about raising revenue, learn from what happened in Wales and approach the process in a more measured way than was the case there. We have time to get the system right before the new bills hit the doormats in April 2007. I am delighted that the Lyons review is on the case and that it will advise Ministers on this crucial matter.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-22_para15">
<a name="stpa_278">I ask the Government to be open-minded about options for funding local council services. I hope that they will be prepared to consider changing the number of bands and the possibility of introducing regional variations for both the number of bands and the payment proportions among them. Although it will be controversial, I hope that the Government will be open minded about the re-localisation of the business rate, for the reasons that I mentioned. We also need to ensure that we learn from the Welsh experience and deliver an English revaluation that is revenue-neutral.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>26 May 2005 : Column 932</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-22_para16">
<a name="stpa_279">Finally, we all need to be clear about the overall purpose of the reform of local council funding. It should be about underpinning and strengthening local government to create a framework in which local government and local democracy flourish and should make a difference to our towns and communities throughout the land. Councillors should be able to respond to the wishes of residents and to have freedoms and responsibilities. That will make the job of being a councillor worth while and, therefore, more likely to attract new people who want to serve their communities in that way, as well as perhaps achieving a higher turnout at local elections. To achieve all that, the way in which councils are funded must be fair and easily understood and funds must be easy to collect.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-22_para17">
<a name="stpa_280">Surely, if we are to retain a property tax, the aim should be that householders with comparable incomes pay roughly the same local council tax if they live in broadly similar house types anywhere in the country, and there should be a reasonable span of bands nearly everywhere, with band A, for example, applying to houses that are cheap by local rather than national standards. If we do not do that, we will end up keeping and reinforcing the current situation in which 60, 70&nbsp;or 80-plus per cent. of properties in many northern towns and cities are in band A.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-22_para18">
<a name="stpa_281">Those are important issues for the Government and Parliament. They are certainly important to my constituents, whose message to me is clear: the current situation cannot be sustained and council tax must be reformed.

<a name="stpa_282">You and I made our maiden speeches in the same year, Mr. Deputy Speaker. I sat two Benches back from the Dispatch Box, on the Government side of the House.

I also note that the usual courtesies in debates no longer seem to be entirely observed, which is disappointing.

He is one of four British citizens detained&#151;or should I say &quot;banged up&quot;?&#151;in prison in Cairo. The other Members of Parliament who have constituents there are my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell), and the hon. Members for East Ham (Mr. Timms) and for West Ham (Lyn Brown).

<a name="stpa_295">My constituent has now been in prison in Cairo for three and a half years, so he has already done three and a half years of a five-year sentence. The members of the Foreign Office team who have been dealing with this case are very courteous and, no doubt, when the Minister responds he will reassure the House that Ministers have done everything that they possibly can on the issue. Well, I am no longer convinced that they have been terribly effective. Considering the relationship between the Labour leader and President Mubarak, I am certain that, with a bit more tenacity, we could get some real movement on the issue of these four detainees.

<a name="stpa_296">When I visited my constituent in prison in Cairo, I found the conditions grim, to say the least. Some of my colleagues would doubtless say that that is as it should be, but I believe that the detainees are not guilty of the crimes of which they are accused and that there has been a great miscarriage of justice. Majid Narwaz is a young man, and his mother came to see me at my surgery on Friday. She advised me that inmates from the prison&#039;s criminal wing&#151;not the four British detainees&#151;had smuggled in a mobile telephone and that, as a result, all the inmates had been punished. They were not allowed out of their cells to exercise, and food from their families was not allowed into the prison. The situation is very grim indeed. My constituent is allowed out of his cell for only two hours.

This morning, I was delighted to receive a letter from the Egyptian ambassador. I shall not read it all out to the House because I understand that a number of my hon.

It is ridiculous for people to call for more and more police officers&#151;I know some of my colleagues will grimace: fancy a Conservative Member of Parliament saying that!&#151;when what is needed is a well-managed police force.

However, we have lost too many experienced police officers, who for all sorts of reasons have taken early retirement. That has happened not just in the police service but in the teaching profession and among health professionals. We have lost a huge number of experienced policewomen and policemen, and we are now paying the price for losing all that experience. I suggest to the Minister and to my colleagues that we need more police officers, but we also need common sense. Our police officers should be properly trained.

: I do not think that any Opposition Member would disagree with my hon. Friend. We want to ensure that police officers do the job that they are supposed to do in the force, but the bureaucracy put upon them by this Government has prevented them from doing so. As the Conservative party said at the election&#151;and Conservative Members have said the same since&#151;although we want more police officers on the streets, we also want the officers who are there to do the job that they are paid to do.

 I quite agree with my hon. Friend. The Government&#039;s strategy is to have many people in uniform, and the public regard some of them as police officers. Those people&#039;s powers of arrest, however, are no more than anyone else&#039;s: they can talk to someone and detain them for about half an hour. Such things trouble me greatly.

I unashamedly use this opportunity to persuade the Government that we should invest more in such policing. Drugs misuse is the biggest challenge that we face in this country. The problem is everywhere. One of the causes of offending is undoubtedly the misuse of drugs.

It was a huge mistake by the Government to reclassify cannabis. If their Back Benchers are honest, I think they also feel that way. However, the Labour leader told my hon.

I challenge Ministers who are not convinced on this point to talk to the victims: people who have lost loved ones as a result of drug misuse. &quot;2&nbsp;Smart 4&nbsp;Drugs&quot; has a programme aimed at 11&nbsp;to 13-year-olds, which has three elements: a game show format packed with drug information; an upbeat current song adapted to have drug information lyrics; and an open discussion session about peer pressure and how to handle a situation in which a mate says that it is all right to take drugs. I applaud that initiative. The organisation is short of funds, and reaches out to the whole of Essex, including the constituencies of my hon.

Dealing with that cost &#163;8&nbsp;million. We need a retaining wall, and to provide that and sort out the remainder of the cliff would cost &#163;35&nbsp;million, so we are talking about huge sums of money.

 It is a delight to be able to take part in this debate and especially to follow my hon. Friend the Member for Castle Point (Bob Spink), who is an excellent and assiduous Member of Parliament. He was self-effacing, but he should not be, because he speaks with such passion for the constituents whom he represents so well.

<a name="50526-25_para0">
<a name="stpa_331">It has also be a great pleasure to listen to the maiden speeches today. It does not seem so long ago that I made my own maiden speech, but time passes quickly as one gets older. I look into the mirror and no longer see the same slim young man of eight years ago. He has been replaced by this rather grizzled figure. I am also made to

<br>&nbsp;<br>feel old by how young the new Members look, although we also have some more senior Members. I was impressed by the enthusiasm of those who made their maiden speeches and their passion for being here. I hope that that stays with them, because after eight years as an Opposition Member, I have to say that a certain cynicism sometimes creeps up on me. I have been invigorated by that enthusiasm and I hope that I can recapture the fresh-faced enthusiasm that I had all those years ago.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-25_para1">
<a name="stpa_332">These debates are one of the better kept secrets of Parliament, and I hope that the new Members who have taken part realise that. The secret has been almost too well kept today, but it is good to see the same faces here. Such debates are a regular occurrence and I am delighted to be able to take part. As my hon. Friend the Member for Southend, West (Mr. Amess) said, we have been in our constituencies during the election and this debate gives us a great opportunity to raise some of the matters that were brought to us as we went around.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-25_para2">
<a name="stpa_333">I do not wish to detain the House too long&#151;there is only so much it can take&#151;but I do wish to raise a couple of points, linked by a transport theme. My hon. Friend the Member for Putney (Justine Greening) mentioned Heathrow and the noise suffered in her constituency. I pay tribute to her predecessor, Tony Colman, who was assiduous in raising matters that affected those who live closer to the centre of London than those who live in Uxbridge and the borough of Hillingdon. Heathrow is in our borough and while it brings benefits, it also brings many problems. Alongside the current plans for a third runway, I notice that a sixth terminal is now creeping, worryingly, into the discussions, even though the Government have said that that is not in their plans. Anybody who knows the situation will realise that a third runway would mean a sixth terminal. That worries many people because in many instances it would destroy some villages, as would airport expansion wherever it is. That is why I have never in this House advocated not building at Heathrow and favoured somewhere else. We have to look seriously at our aviation needs.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-25_para3">
<a name="stpa_334">I was concerned earlier this week when a new lobby group was launched called Project Heathrow. I do not have a problem with people creating lobby groups. That is their right and I am pleased that they do it. This group is headed by a former Member of this House, now Lord Soley. I was concerned that the Secretary of State for Transport went to the meeting. I know this because on television I saw a cream cake land on him thrown by someone who was not too impressed by the idea of expansion. I do not condone that behaviour. My concern was caused by a lack of even-handedness. Many organisations that are opposed to further expansion of Heathrow and I have been trying to meet the Secretary of State to express our views, but unfortunately we have not been granted the same access as the lobby group was on Monday. The Minister is a fair-minded gentleman and I ask him to pass that on, so that when I write asking for a meeting it is borne in mind that even-handedness is a good thing at this level.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-25_para4">
<a name="stpa_335">We have a few problems with buses. I will not blame the Government for that because it is not their responsibility, but many of my constituents are concerned. By raising this on the Floor, I hope that those with responsibility will realise how seriously I and others take the matter. The London bus service has 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>26 May 2005 : Column 943</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>unquestionably improved greatly. People are using the buses more and more. In fact one of the problems results from more people using the buses&#151;larger buses have been introduced. Two buses cannot pass each other in some of the smaller roads in my constituency, particularly Cleveland road in Cowley and Wise lane in West Drayton, without mounting the kerb, which they do regularly. Obviously that is a great danger to pedestrians. Many students go along Cleveland road to Brunel university and schoolchildren go to Uxbridge high school and Bishopshalt school. That causes great concern to residents. We do not want to lose the bus service, but something must be done.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-25_para5">
<a name="stpa_336">These debates are for local issues and my next item narrows the debate down to one particular bus stand in my constituency. It has caused more justifiable complaints than many other issues in the past few months. Because Hillingdon hospital has redeveloped and built houses on what was part of its site, the buses can no longer stand in order to stop and turn round where they used to. They now go down past residential homes&#151;the very homes that were newly built. This has happened since Christmas. Other houses are also affected by this problem. You can imagine, Mr. Deputy Speaker, that from the early hours of the morning until late at night, just outside the houses, not only are buses stopping and going&#151;before anyone says that this happens everywhere, I should say that there is a bus stop outside my house and I do have that noise but it moves on&#151;but engines are left running, so the residents suffer from fumes as well as noise.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-25_para6">
<a name="stpa_337">The residents also have something that I never thought about until I looked into the matter. It is a practical problem that should be looked at, because the bus drivers do not have proper facilities for relieving themselves after driving for some time. I want to discuss this with the union because I am sure that the union would want such facilities for its members. As you can imagine, Mr. Deputy Speaker, this is not exactly enhancing the area, and one of the places that the bus stand affects is actually a residential home. The noise and all these other activities are causing a great deal of distress.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-25_para7">
<a name="stpa_338">At first we thought that we could get this problem sorted out fairly easily. We have been trying to get various people together, including the hospital, Brunel university and the London borough of Hillingdon&#151;and Transport for London, which seems a little elusive in spots; I understand that that is not uncommon, but I am working on it and I hope that we can get it to resolve this matter. Meanwhile, the residents have become increasingly frustrated, and have started to mount peaceful protests. I have noticed that the buses have been delayed, shall I say, for 10&nbsp;minutes or so, causing problems. I do not know whether there is such a thing as a normal protester, but if so these residents could not be described as such; they are just so frustrated by what is going on.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-25_para8">
<a name="stpa_339">We hear a lot, have heard a lot and are going to hear a lot more about respect. That theme has come up recently and I think we have all noticed that it is lacking in society. I read somewhere, and I think it is probably a better word, that what is actually lacking to a large degree in today&#039;s society is consideration for others. 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>26 May 2005 : Column 944</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>That may show itself as antisocial behaviour in a community, as described by many hon. Friends and hon. Members, or lack of consideration by a company, which I would say is what we are seeing in this case. The company does not particularly want the problem but it is not moving fast to remedy it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-25_para9">
<a name="stpa_340">I am raising this matter, which is of great concern to my constituents, on the Floor of the House today, in the hope that we will be able to speed up the process and get the problems sorted out.

<p><a name="st_127"><a name="50526-25_spnew1"><b> Mr. Andrew Love  (Edmonton) (Lab/Co-op):</b> 
 I congratulate the hon. Member for Uxbridge (Mr. Randall), who is now leaving the Chamber, for the brevity and balance with which he outlined his local issues. I apologise to you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, for the fact that I could not be present for the whole debate. I also apologise to other Members, but especially to those who gave their maiden speeches this afternoon. I understand that there were some excellent, even bravura, performances. I apologise to all those whose speeches I was not able to hear.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-25_para10">
<a name="stpa_341">I did manage to catch the maiden speech of the hon. Member for East Dunbartonshire (Jo Swinson), who tells us that she is the youngest Member of the House. She gave a very mature performance, which I think will serve her well for the future. I also heard the new hon. Member for Leeds, North-West (Greg Mulholland). Listening carefully to the content of his speech, I would not be surprised if he receives an invitation to become an honorary member of the Campaign group of Labour MPs on the left of the party.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-25_para11">
<a name="stpa_342">Like my hon. Friends the Members for Luton, North (Kelvin Hopkins) and for Bedford (Patrick Hall), I had originally intended to speak in the Queen&#039;s Speech debate, but for obvious reasons&#151;because of the large number of new Members&#151;was unable to do so. I wanted to raise an issue from that speech that has ramifications locally. What triggered it in my mind was the introductory speech by the Liberal Democrat spokesman, the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath). I have heard much about the impact of the election and the issues and concerns that have been raised in various quarters, but I want to explain to the House the experience of my constituents and the concerns that a number of them have raised about the&nbsp;election.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-25_para12">
<a name="stpa_343">I shall deal first with the national debate that has been going on for some time. The hon. Member for Somerton and Frome referred to postal voting, about which great concern has arisen because of the recent case in Birmingham. Although my view is that the judge who heard that case rather over-egged what had happened in his comments about a banana republic, there are serious concerns for democrats and we need to look carefully at them. The judge was more rightly criticised because he extrapolated the limited investigation in part of Birmingham to the rest of Birmingham. He even made comments that could be extrapolated to cover other parts of the country.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-25_para13">
<a name="stpa_344">We must be careful to set in context what happened in Birmingham and how we put that right, but I want to draw a comparison with what happened at the election in my constituency, where 76&nbsp;per cent. of postal voters 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>26 May 2005 : Column 945</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>actually voted and about 58&nbsp;per cent. of others voted. There seems to be a great advantage in providing people with the option of postal voting. I hope that, in whatever we do to strengthen the postal voting procedures, people will not lose the ability to make use of postal voting to increase turnout at elections.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-25_para14">
<a name="stpa_345">The second issue that has been raised nationally&#151;<i>The&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Independent</i> has been running a campaign on this&#151;is, of course, proportional representation, and it does not surprise us that that issue has been raised by the Liberal Democrats. I happen to have just a little sympathy with that issue, but when people start to talk about a democratic deficit&#151;although some issues relate to that&#151;they should also consider some of the other existing deficits that are as important. Indeed, I should like to talk about those deficits in relation to my constituents.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-25_para15">
<a name="stpa_346">When I was out and about knocking on doors during the election&#151;we do not get the opportunity during normal times to knock on as many doors as we do during a general election&#151;I discovered that in some of my polling districts up to 20&nbsp;per cent. of houses had no one on the electoral register. Indeed, in some streets in my constituents, every second house had no one registered to vote. When I worked out a total, I realised that about 5,000&nbsp;houses in my constituency had no one on the electoral register. That is the first democratic deficit that existed at the election.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-25_para16">
<a name="stpa_347">The second democrat deficit is that a lot of my constituents who thought that they were on the register and had voted at previous elections found that they were not on the register at the last election. Of course, they had been removed because they had not filled out and signed the form that they now need to return. That legislation was introduced by this Government. I accept the need for that safeguard, but we need to look carefully at ensuring that people understand that that is what they must undertake to secure their registration to vote at elections.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-25_para17">
<a name="stpa_348">The third deficit is that a lot people in my constituency have come to live in this country. After they have been here for a period, they become citizens and therefore have the right to vote. Most of them come from European countries, but others come from all parts of the world. When they received their electoral registration form, it asked whether they were from various other countries, and quite a lot of my constituents innocently ticked that box and were therefore not considered to be British citizens. When they turned up to cast their vote they discovered that because they had said they were Greek or German they had no vote and could not vote in national elections. That applied to quite a large number of people.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-25_para18">
<a name="stpa_349">I was not entirely surprised by some of those things. Before the election, because of my concerns about the failure of the registration process to reflect the people who live in my constituency, I contacted the Library for information. From the research that the Library undertook, I discovered that a comparison of the 2003&nbsp;register, the latest edition at the time, and the 2001&nbsp;census showed that about 9,650&nbsp;people were missing from the register. My local authority told me that those people could not vote because they were from another country or were not British citizens. As my constituency is part of the Greater London area, a significant number of people are in that situation. The 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>26 May 2005 : Column 946</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Library also told me that between 1996&nbsp;and 2003, 6,200&nbsp;electors were lost from the register in my constituency. That is a significant democratic deficit for a large number of people.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-25_para19">
<a name="stpa_350">Why did that happen? There have been a number of reports on the subject. Recently, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister issued a report on registration and turnout. I shall take London boroughs as an example, but I will come on to others. The report showed that although the mean expenditure per elector on electoral registration was about &#163;1.60, the figure varied across London boroughs from just over &#163;4&nbsp;at best down to 35p at worst. There seems to be a failure in that regard. As a capital city, London has particular difficulties compared with local authorities in other parts of the country, so it spends more on electoral registration than almost anywhere else&#151;but we need to look into the organisation of electoral registration throughout the country.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-25_para20">
<a name="stpa_351">My local authority is no different from those in other London boroughs or other parts of the country. When I asked how it ensured that everyone was included on the register, I was told that only 77&nbsp;per cent. of my constituents had been personally canvassed&#151;so no one knocked on the door of 8,730&nbsp;homes in my constituency and asked the occupants to fill out a registration form. In the most disadvantaged area of my constituency, 61&nbsp;per cent. of homes did not receive a knock on the door.
</p>

<p><a name="st_128"><a name="50526-26_spnew0"><b> Shona McIsaac: </b> 
 I am interested in what my hon. Friend is saying. Indeed, from work I have done in my constituency I found that electoral registration is much lower in the most disadvantaged areas. Such areas have higher problems as regards literacy, so it is vital that councils carry out not just one canvass, but two or possibly three to ensure that as many people as possible in disadvantaged areas are registered to vote.
</p>








<p><a name="st_129"><a name="50526-26_spnew1"><b> Mr. Love: </b> 
 I entirely agree.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-26_para0">
<a name="stpa_352">To conclude the point that I was making, the number of doors knocked on rose as the area became more affluent; indeed, in the most affluent part of my constituency the number reached 95&nbsp;per cent. The net effect is that there is an inverse relationship between the numbers missing from the register and the number of doors that are knocked on. To return to the point made by my hon. Friend, the opposite should be the case. It is critical that we knock on doors in disadvantaged areas for the reasons that she gave.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-26_para1">
<a name="stpa_353">I am not drawing conclusions solely about my local authority because I think these things happen across the board, but when I asked my local authority why that situation had come about I was told that it had difficulty in getting people to canvass and often canvassers receive abuse on the doorstep. When we look more closely, however, we find that canvassers are paid less than the minimum wage for the hours they work&#151;significantly less in the case of my local authority. Furthermore, the payments that they receive are based on the number of people that they put on the register. Therefore, there is an in-built incentive to canvas in affluent areas where registration is high. There is an absolute disincentive to go into the areas where the canvassers are needed most. If that is taken together with poverty pay and the perverse incentives of the system, one can understand why it is difficult to get canvassers.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>26 May 2005 : Column 947</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-26_para2">
<a name="stpa_354">That brings me to the issue at the core of the debate. The Electoral Commission and the Opposition parties tell us that we need to move to individual registration. I asked the Electoral Commission and my local registration officer what would happen to the register under current circumstances if we moved to individual registration, and I was told that it would decimate the register. I appeal to the Minister to take back to the Department for Constitutional Affairs the view that we need to stand firm against individual registration. We need the maximum number of electors on our electoral registers.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-26_para3">
<a name="stpa_355">I would also like to make a number of practical suggestions that are important to the discussion on how we overcome the democratic deficit. I know that a Bill will be heading to the House in the near future, so I would like to make some suggestions as to what should be included in it. First, we must be much more transparent. It is a devil of a job to find out how much money a local authority spends on electoral registration and, of course, they are always stuck for money. We must ring-fence the money. If the money is ring-fenced and endorsed by the Electoral Commission, any political interference with the registration process will be minimised.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-26_para4">
<a name="stpa_356">Secondly, we must ensure that we have best practice. Electoral registration offices and officers are often parked at the back of a building or in an outhouse. The officers are left entirely to their own devices and communicate with no one. They need to communicate with each to ensure that we have best practice. Copies of the best practice must be made available so that we ensure that everyone follows it. It is also necessary to ensure that the implementation of best practice is taking place, and one of the ways to do that is through performance review. Carrying out such a review would be an ideal role for the Electoral Commission, which would be able to ensure that things are done properly.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-26_para5">
<a name="stpa_357">An issue that has caused contention in the past is the advertising of elections and encouraging the idea that it is important for the public to vote. I suspect that all of us would say that we should do that, but electoral registration officers and departments often feel that such activity falls into the grey area between what is political and non-political in the election process. Any Bill that comes forward should make it clear that urging people to vote is not a political act, and the sponsoring of higher turnouts should be a permanent feature of electoral registration departments.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-26_para6">
<a name="stpa_358">A slightly more controversial issue is that of tapping into the information that undoubtedly exists at a local level about who lives where. A number of databases are held at local authority and other local levels that would assist in ensuring that all the people qualified to vote are on the electoral register. I understand that data protection safeguards are necessary, but we should make better use of local information,
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-26_para7">
<a name="stpa_359">It is, and has been for a long time, an offence not to return an electoral registration form. However, how many prosecutions take place as a result of that? A report from the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister says that there have been one or two&#151;that is the extent to which that happens. I understand why local authorities might think that it would not be terribly good publicity 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>26 May 2005 : Column 948</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>to prosecute people for not returning electoral registration forms, but it is important for someone to take responsibility. If we do not think that returning the electoral registration forms is a good idea, we should do away with them, but if we think that that is sensible, we must make arrangements to ensure that a prosecution will proceed if the requirement is flagrantly breached.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-26_para8">
<a name="stpa_360">Elections in the UK are safe and secure, despite the recent publicity, and they are certainly fair. I hope that they are accurate, although I have cited problems today. The challenge from the last two elections is not about postal voting or other worries that have been raised, but to address the fact that only 59&nbsp;per cent. of the electorate turned out in 2001. Although we edged that figure up to 61&nbsp;per cent. in 2005, none of us can be proud of the fact that we are still at the lowest level for the past 100&nbsp;years.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-26_para9">
<a name="stpa_361">Of course there is an even greater challenge. We often talk about the Americans getting a turnout of less than 50&nbsp;per cent. in their elections, but that figure takes account of not only those who did not turn out, but those who were not registered. If we included the people who were not registered in this country when calculating the turnout, we would get a much greater surprise, and the shock would lead us to take action. That is where the real democratic deficit arises. When the electoral administration Bill comes forward, I hope that the Government will accept that we require action to start to deal with such problems.

<p><a name="st_130"><a name="50526-26_spnew2"><b> John Mann  (Bassetlaw) (Lab):</b> 
 I wish to speak about something that needs to be a key theme for the Government over the next three, four and five years and will certainly be a key aspect of my work in my Bassetlaw constituency: raising aspirations, especially those of young people. Over the past four years in my constituency, the foundation blocks that allow aspirations to be raised have been laid. We have the top health facilities and services in Britain, according to the Government&#039;s audited statistics. No other constituency in Britain can match our 11&nbsp;out of 12&nbsp;health star ratings. However, we need more, and following what has been promised I anticipate that we will get more, including four new health centres, the building of which is due to be started this year.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-26_para10">
<a name="stpa_362">Bassetlaw has some of the best housing stock in Britain. The former Coal Board housing is extremely good and the new housing that has been built over the past 10&nbsp;years, with a range of sizes and prices, is good, popular and gives people a varied choice. The &#163;62&nbsp;million that we have secured to achieve the decent homes standard for public housing will consolidate that position and give us an above-average housing stock compared with the rest of the country.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-26_para11">
<a name="stpa_363">On education, starting at the end of the year we will get more private finance initiative money per pupil than anywhere else in Britain to rebuild our secondary schools as new, which will provide another vital block to build aspirations.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-26_para12">
<a name="stpa_364">The final block is employment. When I made my maiden speech four years ago, I was faced with the 4,500&nbsp;redundancies that had taken place in the six months before the election. I am now facing the problems associated with full employment and a labour shortage. The problem is not so much a skilled labour 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>26 May 2005 : Column 949</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>shortage, although there is some of that, but an unskilled labour shortage. We have not had to tackle such problems in my area for generations, so I welcome tackling them because they are problems that are due to a successful economy.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-26_para13">
<a name="stpa_365">Those bedrocks of success, however, will not in themselves increase people&#039;s aspirations. A culture of low aspirations goes back many generations in mining communities. Until recently, our education systems defined people&#039;s ability in two ways: for males, the choice was to work underground in the pit, with a job for life; for females, it was to be a housewife and sometimes a textile worker. Those were the choices. Educational standards and success were often perceived in terms of the school that had the best football team and best culture of sport, rather than the one that produced pupils who were capable and able to move onward and upward in life, with a wider range of choices.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-26_para14">
<a name="stpa_366">In terms of tackling the deep-rooted problem of low aspirations, the key thing that Parliament and Government can do is to consider ways in which a wider world is brought to people. There are simple and basic ways of doing that, such as the twinning of schools. One small sub-theme of the new plan for Africa is to twin schools in traditional white communities, such as mine, with schools in Africa so that they have an exchange of views. Over time, in this technological age, that exchange will take place via electronic communication and the schools will learn from each other. That could make a great difference in communities like mine.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-26_para15">
<a name="stpa_367">I thank the Holocaust Educational Trust, which this week agreed to take six pupils from my constituency to Auschwitz. That will be a tremendous learning opportunity for them. Such an opportunity has not been offered to people in my constituency before. EDF Energy, which owns the two big power stations in my constituency&#151;West Burton and Cottam&#151;has excelled itself in taking primary school children&#151;from year 6&nbsp;in particular&#151;to the Palace of Westminster over the past four years, and it has agreed to do so again. When I took those young people around the Houses of Parliament, I found to my surprise not how few of them had visited London, but how few had been on a train or to the south of England. Just the visit from some of my schools to London is one small step in raising aspirations. I commend that company for being far-sighted.

<a name="50526-26_para16">
<a name="stpa_368">This March, we had another big breakthrough with Provident Financial, which took a group from one of my most underprivileged schools to a youth hostel in the Peak district for an outward bound course. Again, that gave a group of young people opportunities that they had never considered before, and those opportunities will increase the life chances of some of them. They will realise that different options are available to them and that life does not begin and finish on their estates, but can be much wider, wherever they choose to go in their lives. That has to be an undercurrent of the debate.

<p>
<a name="50526-26_para17">
<a name="stpa_369">I commend the Youth Hostel Association, which celebrates its 75th anniversary this year. It was established precisely to allow working-class young people to get to understand, enjoy and benefit from the wider world outside their work and home community. It remains as relevant in its ethos and work today as it did when it was first established in the 1930s. I am delighted that this summer the Government will provide finance

<br>&nbsp;<br>to allow those from less-well-off backgrounds the opportunity to take a break outside their community and for the outdoor pursuits arena to be open to them. I hope that that will be a recurrent funding stream from the Government during the four or five years of this Parliament.

<p>
<a name="50526-26_para18">
<a name="stpa_370">Another theme that I hope to see emerging is a plan on which we have been working on for some time in my constituency, and that is beginning to come to fruition. We are looking to build the equivalent of the first teaching hospital, but a teaching hospital for sport. We would like to replace one of our pupil referral units as a whole with a teaching sports academy, where not just those who have been excluded from schools, but those who are doing well and those who are beyond school&#151;such as their younger siblings, parents and grandparents&#151;can come. It will be funded on an economic model using the social enterprise that is now well developed in the east midlands through the East Midlands Development Agency.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-26_para19">
<a name="stpa_371">Any money made will go back into the community. We will be running the equivalent of a leisure centre, but with everyone within it striving to become sporting coaches and leaders, and we will be looking at the vocational routes that can come from that. This model can create an option of bringing higher education into Bassetlaw for the first time by linking with one of the universities that has degrees in sports and leisure. We hope that it will be a model for providing facilities to the community as well as increasing aspirations, and it is a model that will succeed.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-26_para20">
<a name="stpa_372">The project goes further than that in its uniqueness. We are looking not simply at sport but at health and education simultaneously. Money has been spent in my community on healthy living, but this is precisely the kind of vehicle that can create healthy living. That is why I am pleased to see the primary care trust, the LEA and the police contributing to the thought processes as to how we will develop this project into something sustainable.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-26_para21">
<a name="stpa_373">The other strong aspect is the voluntary sector and I am delighted that the Prince&#039;s Foundation for the Built Community, the Prince&#039;s Trust, the Coalfield Regeneration Trust, Sport England, Sporting Chance, the Football Association, the Football Foundation and many other groups have contributed towards creating what could be a beacon for other areas in the country to copy in terms of raising aspiration and improving the health of the community.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-26_para22">
<a name="stpa_374">Some of our definitions of neighbourhood renewal are rather bureaucratic and we need to liven them up in a way that provides vision and ownership. As well as fusing together health, education, employment and vocational training, it is young people who are taking the lead. The consultation on the project is not by me or by aging professionals paid by the Government to consult. It is the young people&#151;the teenagers&#151;who are showing the enthusiasm and drive. They recognise that the fusion is important and that whatever is created needs to be cross-generational.

</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-26_para23">
<a name="stpa_375">The example those young people give most strongly is their desire to have a dance studio, which they point out can be recreational and educational, can lead to vocational skills, and can be part of a healthier living programme. Parents, grandparents, great-grandparents, babies and toddlers can go to a dance studio.

<p><a name="st_131"><a name="50526-27_spnew0"><b> Mr. Geoffrey Clifton-Brown  (Cotswold) (Con):</b> 
 I am delighted to have been able to catch your eye, Mr.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deputy Speaker. I am grateful to Radio Gloucestershire for alerting me to a matter concerning the merger of the Gloucestershire, Avon and Wiltshire ambulance services, which was put out to consultation by the Government and put to consultants by the strategic health authority. I am told that there is to be a meeting tomorrow morning in the Forest of Dean. This will be the first public meeting to review the consultants&#039; recommendation that a full-blown merger should take place. That recommendation is causing great anxiety to my constituents and to the people of Gloucestershire.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-27_para0">
<a name="stpa_377">I held an Adjournment debate on this subject in Westminster Hall on 9&nbsp;February 2005, and the then Minister who responded to it&#151;the hon. Member for South Thanet (Dr. Ladyman)&#151;said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_19">&quot;I want local people to produce the best strategy for themselves and to decide how best to improve services throughout the area and not only in one part of it.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-27_para1">
<a name="stpa_378">I wish that that were true. It was quite clear from the tone of the Minister&#039;s reply to my debate, and from my meeting with the chief executive of the Avon, Gloucestershire and Wiltshire strategic health authority, that the Government and the SHA had already embarked on a course of action that would lead to a full-blown merger of the three ambulance trusts.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-27_para2">
<a name="stpa_379">I believe that this exercise is all about improving the efficiency of the Avon ambulance trust in particular. Gloucestershire is a two-star trust; the Avon and Wiltshire trusts have no stars at all. I believe that this is about trying to bring those two services up to the standard of the Gloucestershire service. At the end of his speech, the Minister also said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_20">&quot;The status quo is still an option, as is rationalising the management organisation&quot;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="stpa_380">that is, merging the management&#151;

</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-27_para4">
<a name="stpa_381">I believe, however, that the Government had already embarked on an agenda that would lead to a merger.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-27_para5">
<a name="stpa_382">That is particularly stupid because, 18&nbsp;months ago, the Government initiated a project involving a tri-service site in Quedgeley, just outside Gloucester. This involved having the police, the fire service and the ambulance service all on the same site, at a cost of &#163;6.3&nbsp;million. If this proposal goes through, that site is likely to be scrapped. So &#163;6.3&nbsp;million of public money will have been completely wasted. This follows the Government&#039;s decision to regionalise the fire service; we already know that the fire service is being taken away from the site.

</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-27_para12">
<a name="stpa_389">I should like to emphasise how good the Gloucestershire Ambulance Service NHS Trust is by quoting from a speech that I made on 9&nbsp;February:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_28">&quot;It is one of the country&#039;s leaders in some of the new treatments. For example, in pre-hospital thrombolysis treatment, modern IT enables the electronic kit to be attached to somebody&#039;s body and the information to be transmitted to a specialist sitting in a hospital, who can then see exactly what phase the heart is in and administer the drug at precisely the right time. That saves lives. 

<br>&nbsp;<br></ul>



<b>26 May 2005 : Column 953</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br><ul>Not only does it save lives, but it is an example of how people might be kept out of hospital, thereby saving the NHS even more money. An efficient ambulance can treat people on the spot. They do not necessarily have to go to hospital; it might be more suitable for them to go into a nursing home, or even to stay in their own home with proper treatment from an occupational nurse.</p>
</ul>
<p>




</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_29">Running down the ambulance service makes no sense. Apart from the pre-hospital thrombolysis initiative, the Gloucestershire ambulance service is one of the most innovative in the country in forming partnerships with other first-responder groups, such as the fire brigade. Indeed, the protocol with the St. John Ambulance brigade was so good that that brigade is now using it nationally.&#151;[<i>Official Report, Westminster Hall</i>, 9&nbsp;February 2005; Vol. 430, c.&nbsp;444WH.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-27_para13">
<a name="stpa_390">That is an enormous tribute to the people who work in the Gloucestershire Ambulance Service NHS Trust and other brigades, who drive ambulances in often difficult conditions.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-27_para14">
<a name="stpa_391">There is a further twist in the argument. We are having great difficulty in Gloucestershire with the out-of-hours service at night and at weekends. I have already had a constituency case in which somebody has died because they have not been admitted to hospital in time. There is no doubt that given the problems with the out-of-hours and weekend service, more and more people will rely on a swift and efficient ambulance service. I believe that the only reason for this merger is financial. That is an appalling way to run our national health service. My constituents want to be reassured that at some of the most difficult times that we may unfortunately have to face we can get an ambulance fast and efficiently. The drivers and ambulances in Gloucestershire currently provide that service, and there is great and deep unease about the Government&#039;s proposals.

As the Government begin their third term, they will have to get to grips with the fact that all around the country, primary care trusts and hospital trusts are on the verge of bankruptcy if not already beyond it. Doctors are saying that they will lose the ability to refer patients to hospitals later this year because the money is not available to pay for treatment.

<a name="stpa_405">From the hon. and learned Member for Redcar (Vera Baird) we heard something of a rerun of her speech earlier in the week, but she is a distinguished figure on the Government Benches. She is a powerful orator, and her contributions are always welcome.

<a name="stpa_406">We heard another maiden speech from my hon. Friend the Member for Hammersmith and Fulham (Mr.&nbsp;Hands). He too will clearly be a highly effective representative of his constituents. As he said, he is the first Conservative representative of the constituency for a number of years, and he is the first Conservative Member of Parliament for Hammersmith for a rather longer time.

<a name="50526-28_para14">
<a name="stpa_407">We heard another very effective and thoughtful speech from my hon. Friend the Member for The Wrekin (Mark Pritchard). He, too, will be an effective defender of his constituents. He did well to remind the Government that, after eight years, they cannot always blame what happened before they came to office for the things that are going wrong in his constituency. He talked with great effect about the rural nature of his constituency and the importance to town dwellers of maintaining the fabric of our countryside.

</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-28_para15">
<a name="stpa_408">I was delighted to hear the contribution by my hon.&nbsp;Friend the Member for South-West Norfolk (Mr.&nbsp;Fraser). I was not in Parliament when he was here previously but I know of him and I know that he will be welcomed back to the Conservative Benches. That said, we are disappointed, and I am sure that he is too, that his predecessor has left this place. She was a tremendous contributor to the House of Commons, and a distinguished member of the previous Government. I was personally very disappointed when she left the Front-Bench team; she was a great loss. She has moved to another place, where I have no doubt she&nbsp;will continue to make distinguished contributions. She has been one of the major political contributors to this House and to this country over the past 20&nbsp;years, and will be much missed.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-28_para16">
<a name="stpa_409">My hon. Friend the Member for South-West Norfolk picked up on one of the themes that has been consistently discussed this afternoon: the absence of adequate policing in too many parts of our country, and the prevalence of antisocial behaviour. Too many police officers are not able to do their job properly because they are tied down by paperwork and by the lack of numbers on the streets on a Friday and Saturday night in particular.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-28_para17">
<a name="stpa_410">I speak with passion about that matter because, in my constituency on a Friday and Saturday night, there are just not enough police officers out on the streets. If a couple of police cars are covering the whole area, we are lucky. That is the absurd situation even in a city such as Manchester, where perhaps only a dozen officers are on duty at any one time on a Saturday night. It is simply not good enough and the Government have to get to grips with the problem over the next four or five years.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-28_para18">
<a name="stpa_411">I particularly welcome the hon. Member for Cardiff, Central (Jenny Willott) to the House because we have much in common. She is the sixth councillor from the London borough of Merton to be elected to the House in the past few years. She and I were both newly elected councillors in Merton in 1998. We were perhaps not as assiduous in our council duties as we might have been, as we moved quite quickly to new political lands&#151;she to Cardiff to fight the Cardiff, Central constituency in 2001, I to Epsom and Ewell. Merton has been an effective starting point for the political careers of many in the House. Her generous tribute to Jon Owen Jones was appropriate. Although we had our differences, as we all do, Jon Owen Jones, whom I knew from serving on many Committees, was an excellent Member of Parliament. I regret his departure. I enjoyed his company and I hope that the hon. Member for Cardiff, 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>26 May 2005 : Column 958</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Central can live up to the precedent that he set. It was probably a wise choice to move on from Merton to Cardiff as West Barnes ward, which she served, is Conservative again. There are no Liberal Democrat councillors in the London borough of Merton and, of course, Wimbledon has a Conservative MP again, so I suspect that she is better off where she is now.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-28_para19">
<a name="stpa_412">On the subject of Merton councillors, my congratulations go also to my hon. Friend the Member for Putney (Justine Greening), both on her maiden speech and on her success at the election. She was instrumental in reducing the number of former Merton councillors in the House by defeating Tony Colman, who was leader of Merton council. Rightly, she talked generously about him, but I am tremendously pleased that she is now in the House. She carved a name for herself on election night and I am sure she will continue to do so in the years ahead.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-28_para20">
<a name="stpa_413">My hon. Friend took us on a fascinating tour of her constituency and talked about some of the charitable, voluntary and community work that she has been involved in. In that connection, she brings valuable experience to the House and I am delighted to see her here. She will also be an important champion for the District line, which, as she knows, and as I know as a former Wimbledon resident, needs some effective champions.

</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-28_para21">
<a name="stpa_414">The hon. Member for East Dunbartonshire (Jo&nbsp;Swinson) is the youngest Member of the House. She has two things in common with her party leader: he was the youngest person in the House when he was first elected and, as she said, the west highland way links their two constituencies. I am disappointed that she did not follow in the tradition of representatives of her constituency by calling for the resignation of the Secretary of State for Scotland. She urged us all to visit her constituency and hoped that we would not go for political purposes.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-28_para22">
<a name="stpa_415">I suspect that there will be some who seek to wrest the seat back from her, and when they come knocking on her door, it will not be entirely to see the sights in her constituency, but I wish her well in the House. She is absolutely right to talk about the importance of engaging young people in the political process and of having hon. Members of different age groups in the House. It is clear from the results of the election that age diversity in the House is increasing, which can only be for the better.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-28_para23">
<a name="stpa_416">The hon. Member for Luton, North (Kelvin Hopkins) made an interesting speech, which I interpreted as the first frost. When a Labour Member rises to express concerns about the economy, to call for the relaxation of inflation targets, to declare that the era of high inflation is long past and that we should intervene in the currency markets, I take that as a sign that Government Members are beginning to get a little jumpy about what has happened in the last eight years. They built on the foundations provided by the last Conservative Government and it seems that the economic tide may not be as one way as Labour Members have claimed in recent years.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-28_para24">
<a name="stpa_417">The hon. Member for Leeds, North-West (Greg Mulholland) provided the last maiden speech today. He spoke effectively about his constituency and how he came to be here. His point about his involvement in the business of the House through its education programme 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>26 May 2005 : Column 959</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>was telling. It is beholden on us all to support the education programme and to encourage young people who are interested in politics to visit and see what we do. We should be open in explaining how it all works and try to make it more transparent than it can sometimes appear. We also need to encourage the next generation, which will come on behind us, to be as active and interested in politics as we have been ourselves.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-28_para25">
<a name="stpa_418">The hon. Member for Bedford (Patrick Hall) spoke about the problems and unfairnesses in the council tax system. We have received mixed messages from the Government about what they propose to do with the council tax system. I do not believe that the alternative offered by the Liberal Democrats is the right one&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i> Indeed, we do not really know what their policy is nowadays. I certainly believe that we have to reduce the burden of council tax on our pensioners, which is what Conservatives sought to do at the general election. I hope that the Government will listen to that message on local government finance and act to help our pensioners in the years ahead.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-28_para26">
<a name="stpa_419">My hon. Friend the Member for Southend, West (Mr.&nbsp;Amess) made a characteristically powerful speech about a variety of issues in his constituency. I offer him my best wishes for Saturday and my best wishes to his daughter for tomorrow. I have a son who is an active football player and I know how proud parents can be on the touchline. I wish him well. My hon. Friend the Member for Castle Point (Bob Spink) also made some powerful points about Teen Challenge UK and I hope that he is successful in securing funding.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-28_para27">
<a name="stpa_420">My hon. Friend the Member for Uxbridge (Mr.&nbsp;Randall) spoke in broad terms about the challenges facing his constituency. When he described himself as &quot;grizzled&quot;, I thought that he was being hard on himself. We in the House simply regard him as timeless. He speaks as the voice of Uxbridge in more ways than one, as anyone who tuned into local radio stations over London in the past few months will have heard. He talked about the challenge that the growth in demand for travel will present in his constituency. It will be difficult to achieve the right balance in this country over the next few years. We must be wise and listen to the voices of caution about the need to strike the right balance between supporting our economy and recognising the interests of residents in constituencies such as my hon. Friend&#039;s and that of my hon. Friend the Member for Putney.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-28_para28">
<a name="stpa_421">We have had a good debate, Mr. Deputy Speaker, in which many issues have been brought to the fore. It has revealed to the House how much commonality there is across the country in the challenges that we all face over policing, the future of the health service and transport services. There is an important lesson to be learned from this afternoon&#039;s debate. Although the general election led to the loss, either through retirement or defeat, of many valued colleagues on both sides of the House, our new intake of hon. Members has enriched this place with clear, articulate and effective contributions to our proceedings.

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>26 May 2005 : Column 960</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>contributions that have been made today. There have been some maiden speeches of the highest quality, and quality contributions from both sides of the House.

</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-29_para0">
<a name="stpa_422">I want to pay tribute to the hon. Member for North-East Hertfordshire (Mr. Heald), the former shadow Leader of the House, for his work, courtesy and co-operation. I wish him well in his new post, as I do the&nbsp;Minister for Local Government, my hon. Friend the Member for Oldham, East and Saddleworth (Mr.&nbsp;Woolas).
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-29_para1">
<a name="stpa_423">I begin by associating myself with the generous tributes paid to former Members of the House who have now left: Harold Best, Peter Bradley, Iain Coleman, Tony Colman, Adrian Flook, Melanie Johnson, John Lyons, Calum MacDonald, Jon Owen Jones, Marion Roe, Gillian Shephard and Tony Worthington. Each made a significant contribution to the House, as they did to their constituencies.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-29_para2">
<a name="stpa_424">Ten impressive maiden speeches were made today, the first of which came from the hon. Member for Na h-Eileanan an Iar (Mr. MacNeil). He spoke with great feeling about the avoidable deaths of some of his constituents, and about his attempts to improve transport and other links to ensure that that does not happen again. He reaffirmed his and his party&#039;s solid commitment to independence. I think that that is a bit of a relic in Scotland in this century, but one has to admire the hon. Gentleman for being true to his convictions.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-29_para3">
<a name="stpa_425">The hon. Member for Broxbourne (Mr. Walker) spoke with passion about the great sport of fishing, a passion that he shares with many hon. Members, not least among them my hon. Friend the Member for Worcester (Mr. Foster). My hon. Friend is a former champion at a pastime that is probably Britain&#039;s most widely practised sport today. The hon. Gentleman also spoke about poverty in this country. His constituency is home to Britain&#039;s largest private-sector employer, and I look forward to working with him to improve educational opportunities and to eliminate poverty in the UK.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-29_para4">
<a name="stpa_426">Education was also the theme adopted by the hon. Member for Welwyn Hatfield (Grant Shapps), who highlighted the issue of town versus gown. That is a perennial issue among hon. Members representing university constituencies. The hon. Gentleman also showed his knowledge when he conjured up the memory of the great George Bernard Shaw&#151;a GS praising a GBS. He was eloquent in his praise of the voluntary work done by local people in respect of learning disabilities, the area in which my own background lies. He also stressed policing matters and antisocial behaviour, and I am pleased that, since 1997, the force servicing his constituency has acquired 376&nbsp;extra officers.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-29_para5">
<a name="stpa_427">Policing was a common theme, and it was adopted by the hon. Member for Taunton (Jeremy Browne) in a highly impressive and effective maiden speech. He strongly supported the community support officers who complement the work of the local force, and I am sure that he will want to congratulate the local chief constable&#151;if not the Home Secretary&#151;on supplying a further 410&nbsp;officers to his force since 1997.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-29_para6">
<a name="stpa_428">I welcome the hon. Member for South-West Norfolk (Mr. Fraser) back to the House. His predecessor was, like him, a person of special ability and great courtesy in

</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-29_para7">
<a name="stpa_429">The hon. Member for The Wrekin (Mark Pritchard) spoke about the need to link respect for authority with society. He stressed the need for better laws rather than more laws. As a former DTI Minister championing the cause of business, I agree with that. Indeed, I hope that the hon. Gentleman has learnt the lesson from the 51,699&nbsp;regulations that were brought in between 1979&nbsp;and 1997, and that we can work together on a common agenda.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-29_para8">
<a name="stpa_430">I welcome also the contribution from the hon. Member for Hammersmith and Fulham (Mr. Hands). It was an historical tour de force on his constituency. It was not just the Cook&#039;s tour, but almost a Doctor Who style speed through time. He spoke, as several right hon. and hon. Members did, about the need to improve transport and in particular, in his case, the tube. He also spoke about a threat to a local hospital, and I am sure that that will have been noted. The hon. Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath) echoed that theme and also spoke about electoral reform, which was mentioned by other hon. Members, too. He spoke about how to strengthen democracy, an important theme to which we will no doubt return.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-29_para9">
<a name="stpa_431">Care homes were the main theme for the hon. Member for Cardiff, Central (Jenny Willott) in an impressive maiden speech, although she touched on other themes. The issue of care homes was also taken up by the hon. Member for West Chelmsford (Mr. Burns), who spoke of the frustration that many hon. Members feel on behalf of their constituents when care homes have funding problems. Relatives find that heavy pressure hard to bear.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-29_para10">
<a name="stpa_432">The hon. Member for Putney (Justine Greening) made health the key issue of her speech. She praised the world-class service that the Royal Hospital for Neuro-disability provides, and I praise her for her work in raising money for a hospice. That was also emphasised by the hon. Member for Castle Point (Bob Spink). On a personal note, when I took time out during the election to visit a hospice in my constituency, the Marie Curie clinic on Frogston road, I met a constituent whom I had canvassed some years before. She was bravely fighting a disease that will by now have claimed her life. It was a sobering meeting for a Member of Parliament for a marginal seat. Some people lost their seats on that Thursday, but many others were bravely fighting diseases such as cancer and lost the ultimate fight. That puts into perspective the difference in importance of the battles we have in this House and elsewhere. I was delighted that my constituent also praised the staff of the national health service, and I join her in that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-29_para11">
<a name="stpa_433">Like the hon. Member for Putney, the hon. Member for Uxbridge (Mr. Randall) raised the issue of aircraft noise, which was reinforced by the hon. Member for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown). It is a serious issue and hon. Members made balanced points, accepting the importance to Britain of commercial airlines and their business.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-29_para12">
<a name="stpa_434">The hon. Member for East Dunbartonshire (Jo Swinson) spoke impressively on fair trade, a subject close to the hearts of many hon. Members, including 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>26 May 2005 : Column 962</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>mine. I helped to found Scotland&#039;s first fair trade organisation many years ago and I was delighted that that issue has also been taken forward in Leeds, North-West. I praise the hon. Member for Leeds, North-West (Greg Mulholland) on his work for the Catholic Agency for Overseas Development.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-29_para13">
<a name="stpa_435">I also praise the work of the local government service. On 5&nbsp;May, I celebrated the fact that it was 25&nbsp;years since I was first elected to a local council. Local councils do a tremendous amount of good work. One of our drives must be to ensure that all council services are brought up to the levels of the best.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-29_para14">
<a name="stpa_436">I praise the hon. Member for Southend, West (Mr.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amess) for his speech. He raised, as he assiduously does, the case of a constituent detained abroad. He knows that this poses particular problems in particular countries. My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary is personally aware of the case and I believe that he has raised it with the authorities more than once. He will want to study the additional information that the hon. Gentleman gave us today.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-29_para15">
<a name="stpa_437">The hon. Gentleman spoke about the threat that he sees posed by Iran. I am not sure what action he was urging, but doubtless there will be plenty of time in this Parliament for that subject to be debated so that we can hear his views. I join him in congratulating St. Bernard&#039;s school on coming through a competition of thousands of people of talent. The talent of young people is important. My hon. Friend the Member for Bassetlaw (John Mann) used the word &quot;aspiration&quot; and spoke of how we all try to drive up people&#039;s aspirations to give them the job, the education, the apprenticeship or the opportunities that they deserve and, indeed, need.
</p>








<p><a name="st_142"><a name="50526-29_spnew0"><b> Patrick Hall </b> 
: Does my hon. Friend agree that we should not let it go unnoticed that today is learning at work day? Learning at work representatives have encouraged tens of thousands of people at work to improve their skills and confidence, and the Government have backed that initiative. Does he agree that there is more to be done on that constructive theme?
</p>








<p><a name="st_143"><a name="50526-29_spnew1"><b> Nigel Griffiths: </b> 
 Yes, and I am grateful to my hon. Friend for giving me the chance to reinforce his message. I praise the work of the Trades Union Congress and the Confederation of British Industry in driving the skills agenda forward in the work place and encouraging people to ensure that they have the skills and personal confidence necessary. I praise my hon. Friend the Member for Bassetlaw for raising the initiative of schools twinning with Africa. James Gillespie&#039;s high school in my constituency has done so successfully, and I commend the experience that my hon. Friend and we in south Edinburgh have had.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-29_para16">
<a name="stpa_438">More experienced hon. Members raised other issues. My hon. Friend the Member for Cleethorpes (Shona McIsaac) talked about school closures. She will join me in wondering how, when providing 28,000&nbsp;extra teachers, one is faced with unnecessary school closures&#151;some of course are necessary&#151;during an election period. I know that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Education and Skills will note her points. In all honesty, I am not sure that any moratorium of the type she suggested is practical or could be enforced. If she has further thoughts on that, I know that she will communicate them as effectively as she always does.

<a name="50526-29_para17">
<a name="stpa_439">My hon. and learned Friend the Member for Redcar (Vera Baird) spoke with detailed knowledge of the ports authority issue. She will know that the Department for Transport announced the Future of Transport White Paper. Its intention is to examine carefully the national framework of ports policy once decisions have been taken on outstanding applications for major container port development. She will track that with considerable interest.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-29_para18">
<a name="stpa_440">My hon. Friend the Member for Luton, North (Kelvin Hopkins) raised the issues of housing investment and of the economy. I know he will welcome the fact that we have tripled investment in housing capital from &#163;1.65&nbsp;billion in 1997&nbsp;to &#163;5&nbsp;billion now, and that that has helped reduce the number of non-decent houses by 1&nbsp;million in that time frame. None the less, it is clear that he has some advice for the Chancellor on how to run the economy. The Chancellor always welcomes such advice and I am sure that my hon. Friend will find a way during debates and Treasury questions to raise his views with the Chancellor, and have the Treasury specialists pore over them and see what might be gleaned and gained from them.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-29_para19">
<a name="stpa_441">My hon. Friend the Member for Bedford (Patrick Hall) raised the issue of local government funding. I have lived through several local government funding crises as well as the revaluations&#151;indeed, my maiden speech was on that very subject, which allowed me to take a seat from the Conservatives for the first time in 100&nbsp;years. That was, of course, the council tax, more popularly known as the poll tax&#151;

 The community charge; indeed. There are no easy solutions to this issue; if there were, they would have been adopted. The Liberal Democrats are thinking seriously about the policy that they put forward and I shall not criticise them for that, but it shows the difficulty of formulating a policy and getting it to stick for a length of time. Obviously, we await the outcome of the Lyons review with considerable interest.

<a name="stpa_442">My hon. Friend the Member for Edmonton (Mr. Love) said that the key to democracy was more effective participation of citizens in elections. I very much agree with what he said about our duty as democrats, and I agree that the agencies that are responsible for ensuring that every citizen can vote must register all voters. I hope that his message will be communicated to the appropriate Ministers as effectively as he communicated it to us. It is important that we do not continue to hear the tales, which I think all Members have heard, of people who should have been allowed to cast a legitimate vote at a polling station finding that they were not on the electoral register, in spite of being UK citizens.

Member&#039;s account of what happened under the present system, I must tell him that if he thinks it satisfactory that two ambulances should be skidding around, and that an off-duty GP who was merely passing was able to intervene and perhaps sustain life and certainly help, I can understand why a review has been taking place. I hope that he will not pray that example in aid, but will muster the evidence once he has had a chance to read the report, rather than pre-empt its judgment. I am sure that that is what he will do.

<a name="stpa_447">I am conscious of the fact that this Adjournment debate is the last business before the brief recess, so it is just as well, given that this is such a controversial issue, that there is a time limit on the debate, although I hope that we will be able to cover all that needs to be covered in that time.

<p>
<a name="50526-30_para6">
<a name="stpa_448">The debate relates to the application by the parochial church council, the vicar and the churchwardens in Cumnor for the Privy Council, on the advice of the Home Office, to declare the churchyard there closed. There is a long-standing disagreement between the local residents and, in particular, their representatives on the Cumnor parish council and the vicar. I happen very much to understand the point of the concerns raised by my constituents and Cumnor parish council, but no personal criticism is intended or meant to be implied in what follows of the vicar of Cumnor, who has to balance a number of issues. I have had a chance to speak to an officer of the diocese about its perspective, and I hope to speak to the vicar in due course.

<a name="stpa_449">I want to cover some background issues that relate to the shortage of space for burial, to the suggested changes to the law and in the way that we should look for more burial space and, indeed, to the timetable of action, or inaction, on this matter.

<a name="stpa_450">I am pleased to say that I have had the opportunity, albeit only today, to pass on to the Minister the details of my concerns and to raise with her in advance some of the questions to which I seek answers. I hope therefore that we can made progress on the substantive issues, but I am the first to recognise that the law involved is complicated&#151;that may be why it has taken so long to make progress towards solving the problem&#151;and that some of the issues raised by this case are also complicated. Nevertheless, I think that we can make progress because there is clearly a need to do so.

<a name="stpa_451">As the Government identified in their consultation document issued in January 2004, some seven years ago, in 1997, the London planning advisory committee, working in conjunction with the relevant burial authorities and their representatives in London, carried out research into the existing capacity for burials in Greater London. In summary, they raised the concern that there was only seven years&#039; burial capacity in inner London and 18&nbsp;years in outer London. Clearly, as those 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>26 May 2005 : Column 966</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>figures were averages, some boroughs would be very short of capacity. There is no reason to believe that the situation outside London is significantly better. Indeed, in some cases, it may be worse.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-30_para10">
<a name="stpa_452">The long-standing view of those with an interest in such issues is that the best approach to take, if we are to prevent the acquisition of land for more burial space and the associated cost, is to consider further, and then to implement, a form of the lift-and-deepen practice, whereby bodies in existing graves that are either more than 75&nbsp;years old or more than 100&nbsp;years old, for example, are exhumed to be reburied at a lower depth, so that further new burials can take place on top.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-30_para11">
<a name="stpa_453">Progress has been very slow. Clearly, sensitivities are involved, and where cultural sensitivities, perhaps moral sensitivities and spiritual matters are involved and where people have deep-seated views and various religions may differ, it is important that the matter is handled sensitively. Of course, I accept that, but that does not mean that such issues should not be handled at all and that there should be endless delay. Indeed, that may exacerbate the problems caused to people facing bereavement and the need to bury in the meantime.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-30_para12">
<a name="stpa_454">Successive Governments have acted slowly. For example, an article in <i>The Guardian</i> of 13&nbsp;May 1999&nbsp;stated, although I do not know on what basis:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_30">&quot;The Home Office is expected to publish a consultation document this summer&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-30_para13">
<a name="stpa_455">on the reuse of space in crowded cemeteries. That was the summer of 1999. No such document was produced, but an article in the Edinburgh<i> Evening News</i> of 26&nbsp;April 2000&nbsp;discussing a proposal made by Tam Dalyell, the then MP for Linlithgow, stated:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_31">&quot;The home office today confirmed it is considering the re-use of burial grounds.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-30_para14">
<a name="stpa_456">However, we still did not have even a Green Paper.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-30_para15">
<a name="stpa_457">Julie Rugg of York university&#039;s cemetery research group was cited in an article in <i>The Guardian</i> of 2&nbsp;September 2000. She said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_32">&quot;We need to know why the government is not saying anything. I think there is a fear at ministerial level that people are going to find this area quite distasteful.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-30_para16">
<a name="stpa_458">I do not dispute the existence of such fear but it is no excuse for inaction. We should proceed with sensitivity. However, although I am alleging slow progress, I do not suggest that the Minister has anything to do with that, as responsibility for the matter has only recently been transferred from the Home Office to the Department for Constitutional Affairs.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-30_para17">
<a name="stpa_459">The article quoted the Home Office as saying:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_33">&quot;We will be publishing a consultation paper, but we don&#039;t have a date for it and there is nothing imminent.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-30_para18">
<a name="stpa_460">We finally received the consultation paper in January 2004, so the Home Office spokesman was right four years before&#151;it certainly was not imminent. An article in <i>The Times</i> of 23&nbsp;June 2003&nbsp;pointed out that the Home Office had still not published its research into whether old graves should be re-used three years after the research was conducted. I do not know whether the research has ever been published, but there is certainly a feeling that not much progress has been made.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>26 May 2005 : Column 967</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-30_para19">
<a name="stpa_461">The burial and cemeteries advisory group was set up in the Home Office following a Select Committee report of March 2001&nbsp;that stated that the Government must make progress. The consultation document published in January 2004&nbsp;was the result, although the report should have been made by the end of 2002. The consultation period finished almost a year ago and we await publication of the response to the document. I hope that the Government will move swiftly to make proposals for whatever legislation is required. I certainly hope that they will adopt a policy and will not allow further delay by citing the need for more research. There is plenty of research and it is time for action. There is a shortage of burial space in local communities, including Cumnor, which brings me to the need for this debate.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-30_para20">
<a name="stpa_462">Why is the church in Cumnor seeking to have its churchyard closed? There are several motives although they may not be valid reasons for closure. The first is that the churchyard is full. I shall return to that point. The second could be to transfer the costs of maintaining the churchyard to the local authority, as that is what happens when churchyards close. I shall not discuss that motive in this debate, although it is known that some communities fear that a church facing financial difficulties and with various funding priorities is not keen to maintain churchyards and so favours their closure to save money.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-30_para21">
<a name="stpa_463">Another argument is that the church does not want to face the difficulties of negotiating over the nature of memorials. It has been made clear that that is not a legitimate reason for the Home Office to agree a closure, but, according to the vicar, it appears to be an issue in this case. In an article in the Cumnor parish news&#151;I understand that these points were made and recorded in the minutes of a working group seeking to find a compromise subsequent to the appearance of the article&#151;the vicar states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_34">&quot;In the past decade and particularly since the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, in 1997, families have become much more involved in funeral arrangements. Gone are the days (thankfully!) when people would meekly accept what the vicar said. This extends to the memorials that people want. The Diocese of Oxford has strict regulations regarding which memorials are permitted in churchyards. These are to maintain the character of the churchyard&#151;to ensure that the churchyard is a pleasant and peaceful place to be in for all visitors. The PCC felt that it would become increasingly difficult to enforce these regulations without causing significant hurt to families who wanted a memorial that was not permitted. Statistics from other churchyards and burial grounds indicate that this is the case, and, indeed, you may have heard of such stories in the media in recent months.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-30_para22">
<a name="stpa_464">Under a paragraph with the heading &quot;Legal Closure&quot;, the article continues:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_35">&quot;The PCC therefore decided to seek to legally close the churchyard.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-30_para23">
<a name="stpa_465">That implies that, as well as the assertion that the churchyard is full, the one motive was that the vicar&#039;s pastoral duties would be undermined by disputes&#151;one can see his point&#151;with family members about memorials. If this is happening up and down the country, there may need to be clearer and more consistent rules, but it is not an argument for closing churchyards.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>26 May 2005 : Column 968</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-30_para24">
<a name="stpa_466">The real argument is whether the churchyard is full, and this is one of the key questions. A letter that I have seen from the parish council to the Home Office of 26&nbsp;November 2003&nbsp;points out:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_36">&quot;During the course of its discussions members of the Working Party (including the Vicar) visited the churchyard and identified an area that could be used for new burials.</p>
</ul>
<p>




</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_37">It is the Parish Council&#039;s contention that if the Vicar accepts that further burials could take place in the churchyard then it is perverse to argue for closure on the grounds that there is no proper room for new graves.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-30_para25">
<a name="stpa_467">Cumnor parish council is of the view that there could be proper space in the churchyard for new graves.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-30_para26">
<a name="stpa_468">One of the key questions is whether, when talking about the potential space for burials, the church is talking about reburials and the Home Office does not recognise that as an option. I would be grateful for clarification from the Minister on that. It is the view of some people to whom I have spoken that existing ground&#151;particularly consecrated ground&#151;that has been used for burials could be used again for reburials after a period of time. It is not clear on what basis the Home Office argues in some of its correspondence that it is not permitted, allowed or lawful for reburials to take place. The Burial Act 1857&nbsp;precludes the digging up of human remains except with a licence from the Home Office, and those licences or exemptions&#151;or a faculty granted on the ecclesiastical side of the law&#151;are often granted when churchyards need to be changed for new road construction or development. It is not clear why such an exemption cannot be granted in the case of permission to rebury.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-30_para27">
<a name="stpa_469">We have been made aware in the parish of other cases&#151;specifically that of Brightlingsea town council. The judgment in that case referred to the fact that, in the diocese of Bath and Wells, reburial is the policy before closure is considered. It seems to me peculiar that that should be the position in that case.


</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-30_para28">
<a name="stpa_470">I quote from the judgment:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_38">&quot;In Re West Pennard Churchyard 1992.1.WLR 32&nbsp;Newsom Q.C. Ch. held:</p>
</ul>
<p>




</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_39">&#039;But I should point out that no churchyard is full and ripe for closure until all parts of it in which reburial is possible have been buried over again at least once. Again, until closure, all legal burial rights continue. Over the centuries churchyards have been buried several times over and it cannot be said that a churchyard is nearly full considering only the areas which have never been used for burials. When there are no unused spaces, parishes sometimes seek to apply for closure in order to pass the expense of running the churchyard to the local authority&#039;&quot;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-30_para29">
<a name="stpa_471">that relates to the motive of the transfer of cost that I raised earlier.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-30_para30">
<a name="stpa_472">The judgment continues:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_40">&quot;It is the standard practice in this diocese (Bath and Wales), and has been so for at least the last ten years, to advise parishes that the Department of the Environment will not allow closure of a churchyard except after careful enquiry as to how far areas already used for burial can be used again&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-30_para31">
<a name="stpa_473">If that is the case in that example, it seems strange that the Home Office has made it clear that it does not generally consider the possibility of reburial after any period&#151;even in consecrated ground, and thus under ecclesiastical law in some way&#151;to be valid grounds for resisting an application to close a churchyard.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>26 May 2005 : Column 969</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-30_para32">
<a name="stpa_474">When determining whether the churchyard is full, we must ask the basis on which it is considered to be full. The vicar made the following point in the article in the Cumnor parish news a few years ago:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_41">&quot;The churchyard has been full for the past thirty-three years. That is, there have been no burials of bodies (except in existing family graves) during this period, since there have been no unused plots.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-30_para33">
<a name="stpa_475">If that is the basis of the argument, I suggest, as the parish council certainly argues, that one would need evidence before asserting that that demonstrated that the churchyard was full.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-30_para34">
<a name="stpa_476">After a similar contentious debate during the Brightlingsea case, the Home Office refused the application for closure because there was evidence that the churchyard was not full. I would like clarification from the Minister on a question that was put to me by a clerk of Cumnor parish council: where is the burden of the evidence?
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-30_para35">
<a name="stpa_477">The parish council argues:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_42">&quot;in the light of the Brightlingsea decision the Home Office asked Cumnor Parish Council the wrong question. In essence, they asked us if we knew of any areas in the Churchyard that were unused.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-30_para36">
<a name="stpa_478">The parish council is not an expert on the use of the churchyard, so it answered in the negative. The Home Office should perhaps have asked the parish council whether it knew for sure that the churchyard was full, or whether the church authorities, which wished to secure the closure, could provide evidence that it was full. A geophysical survey was done in the Brightlingsea case to try to identify whether there were unused spaces. I do not think that it is sufficient to consider such a contentious matter simply on the basis that there were no burials because it was judged that there were no unused plots.

</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-30_para37">
<a name="stpa_479">The parish council has tried to identify other burial grounds in my constituency, but it has not been successful, despite quite a lot of effort. I argue that it would be&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;inappropriate to allow the closure while the Government&#151;and, I hope, Parliament&#151;are considering whether reuse would be possible, given that no one is arguing that that would not be likely to create a source of space in the existing churchyard. Indeed, previous vicars are on record as supporting that idea. Additionally, the closure would be inappropriate given that the applicant has not provided evidence that the churchyard is full.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-30_para38">
<a name="stpa_480">Will the Minister reassure me that whoever is in charge of the matter&#151;I guess that it is her Department&#151;will not grant the closure application, at least for the time being? I urge her to press on with all speed with producing proposals for legislation to increase the ability to reuse space in burial grounds that has not been used for many decades and, indeed, for more than 100&nbsp;years.

<br>&nbsp;<br>general issue across the board, as well as the specific case in the village in his constituency. In doing so, he has shone a light on something that hon. Members do not rush to discuss. None the less, we all know that it is of great importance.
</p>

<a name="50526-31_para0">
<a name="stpa_481">Burial grounds are a source of strong community feeling, especially in rural areas, but also in my constituency in London. The upkeep and maintenance of our local cemetery in Nunhead is a keenly felt local issue. There were also strong local feelings when we planned to build social housing on the site of an old church, which had a churchyard with remains in it. I know well the issues that he raises.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-31_para1">
<a name="stpa_482">In commenting on the general position and what the Government are doing about it, I hope to reassure the hon. Gentleman that things are happening and that progress is under way. One of his concerns is that the Government are dragging their feet and not enough is happening. I also want to deal with his concerns about the Cumnor burial ground.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-31_para2">
<a name="stpa_483">The hon. Gentleman is right that in 2001&nbsp;the Environment Sub-Committee investigated the country&#039;s burial arrangements and delivered its report on our cemeteries. It found a number of shortcomings, in particular the way of setting and enforcing standards, long-term problems regarding the maintenance and provision of burial space, a need to find the appropriate balance between the utilitarian and aesthetic aspects of burial grounds, and a need to review our antiquated and inconsistent burial laws.

</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-31_para3">
<a name="stpa_484">The Government have undertaken much work since&nbsp;then to tackle the issues. To assist us, we set up an advisory group, drawn widely from people involved in burials, religious organisations, groups with environmental and historical interests, and others. We commissioned and published the findings of a research study into cemetery management, and last year we published a consultation paper on a review of burial law. We have initiated a survey of all burial grounds in England and Wales. We have also worked closely with those involved in burials to draft advice and guidance to burial ground operators on the management of cemeteries, and on ensuring the safety of memorials within burial grounds. We hope to issue those documents a little later this year.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-31_para4">
<a name="stpa_485">We are considering the detailed comments received on the burial law consultation paper. We also need to take account of the burial grounds survey that was launched earlier this year. There is a wide range of issues to address, but the re-use of old burial grounds for new burials and other matters is one of the most significant and sensitive concerns.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-31_para5">
<a name="stpa_486">For the past 150&nbsp;years, that has not been a problem. Where churchyards and other burial grounds have become full, additional land has been acquired by the church or the local council, and burials have simply taken place in another location. That option is no longer so easy, especially for urban communities. There is competition from other land uses&#151;such as housing&#151;and the price of land has increased, if any suitable land is available in the first place. The result has been to create new burial grounds away from the focus of the 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>26 May 2005 : Column 971</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>local community. In some cases, they are physically distant and far less convenient for the community to which they relate. It is also harder to find the necessary funds to maintain burial grounds that are unused.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-31_para6">
<a name="stpa_487">The hon. Gentleman questioned our approach and raised a number of the issues that came to light in response to the consultation paper. The questions include: can we can continue to create new burial grounds indefinitely; is that the best use of land in short supply; and, even if we did want to allocate extra resources to buy land to create more burial spaces, would they be too far away and do we not have better uses for the land? We were also asked whether we should be doing what the hon. Gentleman suggested&#151;lifting and deepening, which provides more space vertically in a burial ground. Would that policy be compatible with our commitment to sustainable development?
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-31_para7">
<a name="stpa_488">We raised those questions in the consultation paper, which we published last year. The responses varied widely. Most of the people involved in the burial business were in favour of re-using burial grounds in some way. Most of the individuals who responded were seriously concerned about that suggestion and not so happy with it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526-31_para8">
<a name="stpa_489">Many individuals want to retain their local parish churchyard as an essential part of their community life, but many others believe that respect for the dead and, ultimately, for the living demands that human remains be allowed to lie undisturbed in their final resting place. Even within a village, there are people who want to keep using the churchyard and others who feel that the respect of the community must be given to its deceased members, so the yard must not be disturbed. We have to 

<br>&nbsp;<br>

<a name="stpa_490">I should like now to come to the question of the Cumnor churchyard. Whether a churchyard is full is a question of fact. Therefore, there is a question of evidence as to whether it is full or not. If it is asserted and not challenged that it is full, that might be regarded as an adequate basis for the Secretary of State to accept that it is full and to accept a closure. In the case of Cumnor, the argument is that the churchyard is not actually full, although there is a desire to close it. Therefore, the question of its being full having been challenged, it is important for officials in my Department to look closely at the basis on which they will gather the evidence as to whether it is full in order to make their recommendation to the Secretary of State for him to make his decision.
