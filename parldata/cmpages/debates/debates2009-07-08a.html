The hon. Member for West Chelmsford (Mr. Burns) referred earlier to the almost &#163;100 million that has been spent on the legal costs of the Saville inquiry. That is a genuine issue of real concern to the House, but we must recognise that those who advocate open and public inquiries also have to come to terms with the fact that many people who come before such inquiries will want legal representation. Although we will try to bear down on the costs of legal representation, as we have done through the Inquiries Act, we cannot deny people fair representation and justice.</p>

 The right hon. Gentleman will know that all the figures are set out in the Budget book. Our commitment is clear: we are making public investment now to help to back up the economy, get through the recession and ensure that it is shorter and shallower than it would otherwise be. That means backing businesses, protecting people&#146;s jobs, helping the unemployed and ensuring that people do not face repossession. We are taking action. The right hon. Gentleman wants to concentrate on numbers to avoid facing up to the fact that the Opposition have proposals to cut public investment now&#151;<i> [Interruption.] </i>They have proposals to cut public investment this year, just when the economy needs investment most.

 Perhaps the Leader of the House could spend 100 per cent. of the next minute trying to answer the question she was asked about what the Prime Minister meant by a &#147;zero per cent. rise&#148;. Is it not now clear that every single word of the assertion that he made last week is wrong&#151;that total spending will not rise, and there will not even be a &#147;zero per cent. rise&#148;, as he bizarrely called it, in 2013, but that the figures in the Government&#146;s books, which the Leader of House mentioned, show that there would be a fall? As so many supporters of the Government are now calling for honesty about spending, should she not find it in herself to do what the Prime Minister refuses to do: admit the facts of the Government&#146;s figures? Will she come down on the side of reality and say that, on the Government&#146;s figures, total spending is set to fall?</p>

 I think the right hon. Gentleman knows full well that the reason for the figures is our bringing forward capital spending. We are not cutting capital spending&#151;we have increased it and we are bringing it forward because, given that, for example, the private sector construction industry is facing dire times, we think it right to bring forward capital investment in public construction, not only for the sake of the children&#146;s centres, schools, hospitals and homes that will be built, but for the jobs that that will create. The truth is that there is a big distinction: while we are investing in bringing forward that capital investment, the Opposition would pull the plug on the public sector just when the private sector is struggling.</p>

 The Leader of the House&#146;s statement &#147;We are not cutting capital spending&#148;, when the Government&#146;s figures show it declining from &#163;44 billion to &#163;22 billion, is exactly the sort of statement that damages the credibility of politics and the Government. It is no wonder that they are abandoning their numeracy strategy when Ministers will not admit that 22 is half of 44. Is the right hon. and learned Lady aware that figures from the Institute for Fiscal Studies show that capital spending from 2013 as a proportion of national income would be below the average for the whole 18 years of Conservative Government? That is the capital spending that the Government intend to deliver. Is it not also true that, on the Government&#146;s figures, the huge increase in debt interest and the rise in unemployment mean it is an indisputable fact that their projections lead to departmental spending falling heavily in the next few years? Why can she not admit the facts?</p>

 The right hon. Gentleman mentioned capital spending, and I have made it clear that we are bringing it forward. He also mentioned unemployment, and we are taking action to protect people&#146;s jobs. Unemployment would be growing if we had made the cuts that he is suggesting. When it comes to the estimates on unemployment, our estimate is that if we had not taken the action that we have taken to back up business and protect people&#146;s jobs, 500,000 more people would have lost their jobs. Once again, he talks about figures in 2013 and 2014, but the action that we are taking now will ensure that the public finances are in a better position, because we will prevent the recession from being deeper and longer.</p>

 If the right hon. and learned Lady believes that capital spending is not being cut and that unemployment is not growing, it is no wonder the Government are so deeply out of touch with the people of this country and with the condition of the economy. Is it not the case that any Government elected at the next election will inherit public finances that are in an unbelievable mess, after 12 years of a Prime Minister who spent everything in the boom, who thought that the bust would never occur and who believed that he had abolished the economic cycle? Now capital spending is being cut, total spending is being cut and departmental spending is set to be cut. Those are the Government&#146;s own plans. Are those not Labour cuts being brought in by a Labour Chancellor that have been made necessary by the actions of a discredited Labour Government over the past 12 years?</p>

<h3 align="center">Reforming Financial Markets</h3>
<a name="ordayhd_0"><a name="90708-0004.htm_ordayhd0"><a name="09070881000623"><h5 align="left">12.33 pm</h5>
<p><a name="st_o96"><a name="09070881000157"><a name="90708-0004.htm_spmin0"><a name="09070881000753"><b>The Chancellor of the Exchequer (Mr. Alistair Darling):</b>
 With permission, I shall make a statement on the Government's proposals for reforming financial markets. Copies of our proposals are contained in a document that is available in the Vote Office.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o14"><a name="90708-0004.htm_para0"><a name="09070881000158">The world economy has been hit by a severe financial crisis, which has resulted in the worst economic downturn for well over 60 years. Its origins lie in failures in the banking system around the world. Financial institutions in many countries simply took on too much risk. They became over-reliant on wholesale funding and too exposed to particular products, and irresponsible pay practices made banks take unnecessary risks.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o15"><a name="90708-0004.htm_para1"><a name="09070881000159">It is also clear that some financial institutions appeared to have little appreciation of what was going on inside their own businesses. However, regulators and Governments too must learn from the events of the last two years, and understand better the risks that come from rapid globalisation in the financial system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o16"><a name="90708-0004.htm_para2"><a name="09070881000160">Our economy has a clear need for well-managed, well-functioning banks and financial institutions to perform a vital set of functions, channelling investment and helping people to save and plan for the future. The financial services industry is also a major employer in this country&#151;of over 1 million people&#151;and it will continue to generate wealth for our country in the future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o17"><a name="90708-0004.htm_para3"><a name="09070881000161">Our central objective must be to ensure that, as we come through the downturn, we reform and strengthen our financial system and rebuild it for the future, with consumers that are better informed, financial institutions that are better managed, and markets that are better regulated. The proposals that I will set out today build on our previous reforms to provide a new settlement that is open, competitive and effective and able to meet the needs of both business and families; that inspires trust and confidence on the part of businesses and consumers; that ensures robust regulation that reduces the likelihood of failures without preventing innovation; and that provides effective mechanisms for dealing with the failure of financial institutions should they occur.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o18"><a name="90708-0004.htm_para4"><a name="09070881000162">I want to take steps to help consumers make better informed choices. To ensure that they are given access to free impartial financial advice, we will legislate to introduce a national money guidance service and impose a levy on the financial sector to help fund it. We will also legislate to consolidate Financial Services Authority resources to provide separate independent consumer education, setting up a lead provider of consumer information and personal finance education. Consumers will also get more protection, along with a greater right of redress and access to compensation if things go wrong. We will also improve arrangements for depositor protection, including legislation to pre-fund and expand the role of the Financial Services Compensation Scheme.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o19"><a name="90708-0004.htm_para5"><a name="09070881000163">Because of the events of the past two years, there are fewer firms in the market providing financial services. It is essential that we retain competitive markets, as they play a key role in providing consumers with value and choice. We want to see greater competition and greater choice for consumers, as well as a bigger role for mutuals and building societies, so the Office of Fair Trading and  <br>

<notus-date day="8" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>8 July 2009 : Column 970</b><br>
the FSA will ensure that we maintain competition in the market for financial services. As we come out of this downturn, we need to promote a competitive market that enables new entrants&#151;which may include non-banking institutions&#151;and innovation to benefit consumers and businesses. In that way, we will see better informed consumers who have greater choices in a more competitive market.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o20"><a name="90708-0004.htm_para6"><a name="09070881000164">We also need banks and financial institutions that are better managed. We need a change of culture in the banks and their boardrooms, with pay practices that are focused on long-term stability, not short-term profit. The FSA now has powers to penalise banks if their pay policies create unnecessary risk and are not focused on the long-term strength of their institutions. From now on, I will require the FSA to report every year on how financial institutions are complying with their new code of practice for remuneration, and how it will deal with firms that do not comply.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o21"><a name="90708-0004.htm_para7"><a name="09070881000165">Bank boards and institutional investors must also become better equipped to do the job and understand their businesses, with more effective risk management and greater independence of non-executives, who must not be afraid to ask searching questions. Next week, Sir David Walker will report on measures that will deliver improved corporate governance at financial institutions, ahead of his final report in the autumn.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o22"><a name="90708-0004.htm_para8"><a name="09070881000166">Building on reforms already made, my proposals today will strengthen regulation of the financial system. They will cover three areas: first, new regulatory powers to allow tougher regulation of individual firms; secondly, measures to deal with the potential failure of institutions that could have a significant impact on the economy; and thirdly, a strengthened framework for financial stability to deal with system-wide risks in today&#146;s more complex and global markets. We will continue to work with other countries to deal with what is, at heart, a global problem.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o23"><a name="90708-0004.htm_para9"><a name="09070881000167">I asked Lord Turner to make recommendations, which the FSA is now implementing, to strengthen the regulatory regime and increase the intensity of supervision. They will strengthen the rules to ensure that banks hold enough capital as a buffer against losses, to introduce a back-stop power ensuring that banks do not over-extend themselves by lending too much when they do not have the strength to do so, and to increase the focus on bank liquidity so that they are able to carry out their business at all times. Those measures will help ensure that financial firms are stronger, more resilient, and better able to serve the needs of our economy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o24"><a name="90708-0004.htm_para10"><a name="09070881000168">I will also introduce legislation in the autumn to give the FSA a new statutory objective for financial stability, and extend its powers to ensure that it has the appropriate rules to deal with different risks in individual banks, and tougher powers and penalties against misconduct, and that it can take account of new developments in the financial sector&#151;including expanding regulation where necessary, for example for systemically important hedge funds.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o25"><a name="90708-0004.htm_para11"><a name="09070881000169">We need to ensure our resolution regime can deal with financial institutions of all sizes, including banks that are very large or complex. As these banks are often global, we also need an international mechanism for resolving large multinational banks, and we will bring forward proposals to G20 Finance Ministers when they meet in London in the autumn.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o26"><a name="90708-0004.htm_para12"><a name="09070881000170">At home, we can better deal with risks by ensuring that safeguards are in place&#151;for example, by making banks hold capital at a higher level that reflects not only the possibility of failure, but its cost. By introducing higher standards and transparency, the FSA can also improve the functioning of key markets, such as the derivatives markets, so that problems in one institution are less likely to spread through the entire system. The FSA and the Bank of England will make institutions put in place practical resolution plans that can be deployed in the event that they get into difficulties.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o27"><a name="90708-0004.htm_para13"><a name="09070881000171">There is, of course, a debate to be had about whether Governments should restrict the size of banks or separate different types of banking, as happened in the United States in the 1930s. I believe that that is a simplistic solution, which fails to take into account the complexity of today&#146;s financial system. Small banks as well as large banks can threaten financial stability, as in the case of Northern Rock. Equally, both retail and investment banks, in different parts of the world, have failed in the past year, and it is not only banks that can affect stability, as we saw in the example of the American insurance company AIG. In addition, the approach of one regulator for one category of institution deemed to be systemically important and another regulator for the rest seems to me to miss the point, because what is systemically important can change rapidly, as we have seen in the past two years. Instead, the regulatory system has to recognise and respond to the complexities of individual institutions, and that is what we are doing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o28"><a name="90708-0004.htm_para14"><a name="09070881000172">We also need to strengthen the framework for financial stability. That is a question not only of institutional powers and responsibility, but of better understanding what is happening in the markets. No simple fixes&#151;no institutional reform&#151;could have prevented these problems from occurring. There are different institutional frameworks in countries across the world, but no one model has been successful in insulating a country from the current crisis. Although regulatory arrangements were not the cause of the current problems, we need the right institutions to maintain financial stability and we must ensure that they have the right tools to do the job.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o29"><a name="90708-0004.htm_para15"><a name="09070881000173">The move in this country to a single regulator 12 years ago addressed problems with the previous regime of multiple self-regulators, which did not reflect the changing nature of financial markets, and our approach has been adopted by many other countries. However, 10 years on, the world had moved on again; some of the global problems of the past two years went beyond the scope of existing regulation, while others were simply not given sufficient attention by regulators and central banks. In this country, the authorities have been able, over the past year, to deal quickly and effectively with a number of financial stability issues, such as those relating to the Dunfermline building society and Bradford &amp; Bingley, but further reform is now needed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o30"><a name="90708-0004.htm_para16"><a name="09070881000174">We will therefore legislate to set up a new council for financial stability, which will bring together the Bank of England, the FSA and the Treasury. It will not only deal with immediate issues, but will monitor system-wide financial stability and respond to long-term risks as they emerge. That needs to be done on a formal statutory basis. The council will draw on the expertise of the FSA and the Bank, which are and will remain independent of  <br>

Government, by looking at their regular reports&#151;the financial stability report and the financial risk outlook&#151;and formally responding to their recommendations. In that way, when risks or threats to stability are identified they will be addressed. This body will do that in a way that is transparent and accountable&#151;so that people can see how and why decisions are made&#151;with the regular publication of minutes. The council&#146;s responsibilities will be set out in law, with published terms of reference. In discussion with the Treasury Committee and the House, we will consider how to increase accountability through greater parliamentary scrutiny.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o31"><a name="90708-0004.htm_para17"><a name="09070881000175">We have already taken significant steps to improve the way in which we monitor and manage risks to the financial system as a whole, through more systematic use of stress testing of financial institutions, for example. The proposals that I am making today will further strengthen our ability to identify and deal with systemic risks, and will ensure that the authorities can be held to account for their actions. We also need to consider what further counter-cyclical measures are needed, in order to allow us to lean against the credit cycle and prevent the build-up of risks that could threaten the stability of the financial system. The principle of leaning against the cycle is easy to agree, but deciding what action to take and when to take it is far more complex. At the moment, there is no clear consensus here or abroad, but I believe that central banks will have an important role to play in that area.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o32"><a name="90708-0004.htm_para18"><a name="09070881000176">Today&#146;s global market for finance means that new measures can be effective only if they are implemented on a broad international basis, so under our presidency of the G20 we will continue to press for measures to strengthen the international regulatory architecture, building on the proposals agreed in April. In Europe, too, we will argue for enhanced monitoring of system-wide risks, while retaining the crucial link between national regulators and Governments. By working internationally, our efforts can help us deliver more effective supervision of global banks, stronger international standards, and a more responsible global financial services sector.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o33"><a name="90708-0004.htm_para19"><a name="09070881000177">We intervened to stabilise the banking system, while retaining a clear view that banks are best managed and owned commercially and not by the Government. We intend to return our stakes in the banks to the private sector, in a way that brings best value to the taxpayer, promotes competition and maintains stability, and we will use the proceeds to cut Government debt. We are empowering consumers, supporting better corporate governance and strengthening regulation, so that our financial sector can continue to be an engine of prosperity. I commend this statement to the House.</p>

 I thank the Chancellor for his statement, although frankly almost all of it was splashed over the front pages of today&#146;s newspapers. Once again, Parliament comes last, instead of coming first.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o34"><a name="90708-0004.htm_para20"><a name="09070881000179">Of course, there are some elements of the White Paper that we welcome: the improved consumer advice; David Walker&#146;s report on corporate governance, to which we look forward; a much better resolution regime for failed banks, which is clearly necessary; and the Chancellor&#146;s remarks on pay and bonuses, although he could have set a better example with the pay and bonus package for the chief executive of RBS.  <br>

<notus-date day="8" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>8 July 2009 : Column 973</b><br>
However, in most part, this White Paper is a totally inadequate response to what has happened over the last two years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o35"><a name="90708-0004.htm_para21"><a name="09070881000180">For a start, the White Paper contains no serious analysis of what went wrong. I received a copy of it only 20 minutes ago, during Prime Minister&#146;s questions, but the only admission that I can see of any responsibility for what happened is the sentence that states that</p>
<a name="90708-0004.htm_brev0"><a name="09070881000599"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;the crisis has shown that aspects of prudential and macro-prudential supervision...were insufficient.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o36"><a name="90708-0004.htm_para22"><a name="09070881000181">That is the understatement of the century, given that half the British banking system has had to be nationalised. It also ducks every difficult question that needs to be addressed if we are to protect our society and our economy from a repeat of the mistakes that have caused such trouble. How do we replace the failed tripartite regime? What tools do we need to stop the excessive debt levels that did so much damage to our economy? How do we ensure that we have a banking system that competes across the world, and offers families and small businesses in this country the services that they are currently denied in this credit crunch, without the British taxpayer picking up the bill for the mistakes that are made? None of those difficult questions is properly addressed today; every single one is left to the next Government to deal with. It is more of a white flag than a White Paper&#151;a complete surrender of this Government&#146;s responsibility to fix the system for regulating the City that they created and which so spectacularly failed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o37"><a name="90708-0004.htm_para23"><a name="09070881000182">Let me press the Chancellor on some specifics on the conduct and content of regulation. First, on the tripartite regime, he must see how dysfunctional it has become. Institutional jealousies and blurred lines of responsibility mean that everyone gets involved but no one is in charge. Let us remember where this all began&#151;with the arrogant decision from the new Chancellor in 1997, without warning or consultation, and in the teeth of the opposition of the late Eddie George, to remove banking supervision from the Bank of England. My right hon. Friend the Member for Hitchin and Harpenden (Mr. Lilley), the then Shadow Chancellor, warned from this Dispatch Box that it would leave no one responsible for the liquidity of the banking system or guarding against systemic collapse. Sadly, that prophecy turned out to be all too true. No one was responsible for liquidity. No one was looking at systemic risk. Even the FSA itself admits that it took its eye off prudential supervision. When the crunch came over Northern Rock, no one knew who was in charge. Almost two years later, we still do not know who is in charge. The Chancellor should have come here today to bury the tripartite system, not to praise it. The only thing that stops him is the vanity of the Prime Minister who refuses to admit that he made such a fundamental mistake.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o38"><a name="90708-0004.htm_para24"><a name="09070881000183">The same applies to the content of regulation. The first half of Lord Turner&#146;s report contains the most damning critique of what went wrong with this Government&#146;s economic policy. He points to the &#147;major and continued macro-imbalances&#148; in the British economy. He says that the failure to spot this was</p>
<a name="90708-0004.htm_brev1"><a name="09070881000600"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;one of the crucial failures of the years running up to the financial crisis&#148;,</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o39"><a name="90708-0004.htm_para25"><a name="09070881000184">and he says that the</p>
<a name="90708-0004.htm_brev2"><a name="09070881000601"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;vital activity of macro-prudential analysis...fell between two stools&#148;.</p>
</ul><br>

<p><a name="stpa_o40"><a name="90708-0004.htm_para26"><a name="09070881000185">What does this White Paper propose to do with that vital activity in future? It puts it between two stools again. After two years of thinking in the Treasury&#151;wait for it&#151;we are going to have a council on financial stability that will bring together the Treasury, the Bank of England and the FSA. I thought that that was what the tripartite regime was supposed to be about all along. We do not need another divided committee. We do not want more divided responsibilities. We need clear lines of accountability that run all the way to Threadneedle street. They do not exist at present.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o41"><a name="90708-0004.htm_para27"><a name="09070881000186">Instead of clarity, what we get from the Government is confusion. The Governor of the Bank of England appeared before the Select Committee on the Treasury two weeks ago, and he said:</p>
<a name="90708-0004.htm_brev3"><a name="09070881000602"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;We were given a statutory responsibility for financial stability in the Banking Act, and the question...to which I have not really received any adequate answer from anywhere, was: what exactly is it that people expect the Bank of England to do?&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o42"><a name="90708-0004.htm_para28"><a name="09070881000187">We are none the wiser after this White Paper. Perhaps it would have helped if the Chancellor had shown the White Paper in draft to the Governor of the Bank of England two or three weeks ago instead of in recent days.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o43"><a name="90708-0004.htm_para29"><a name="09070881000188">Is it not absolutely clear that the Bank of England now has to be given not just the responsibility but the tools for macro-prudential regulation? Can the Chancellor confirm that there is not a single new power for the Bank of England in the White Paper? The Bank of England should have the power to call time on debt, as we suggested almost a year ago; it should be able to set counter-cyclical capital rules in conjunction with other countries&#151;and, by the way, that would be a much better use of international co-operation than the current proposals from the European Commission, which are ill conceived and damaging to the UK&#151;and it should have the statutory powers to intervene when the structure of a financial institution threatens the whole economy, so that, in the Governor&#146;s words, it can force its &#147;sermons&#148; to be listened to.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o44"><a name="90708-0004.htm_para30"><a name="09070881000189">The Bank of England cannot do any of those things unless it has the experience and knowledge of their day-to-day regulation. Let me make it clear to the Chancellor today that the next Conservative Government will abolish the tripartite system, and let me tell Parliament first&#151;unlike his policy&#151;that we will put the Bank of England in charge of the prudential supervision of our banks, our building societies and our other significant financial institutions. We have learned from this crisis the old truth that one cannot separate central banking from the supervision of the financial system and that sound regulation is not just about a checklist of rules but about the authority to exercise judgment and to see the bigger picture.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o45"><a name="90708-0004.htm_para31"><a name="09070881000190">Sitting alongside a stronger Bank of England we will have a powerful regulator to protect consumers&#151;a regulator with the clout and focus not just to add more health warnings alongside the acres of small print that already come with financial products but to stamp out unfair practices such as mis-sold payment protection insurance and excessive bank charges. We will set out the details of that in our own alternative White Paper later this month. Will not the choice be clear then?</p>

 The hon. Gentleman seems to be trying to reduce this debate to a football match between the Bank of England and the FSA. It is not a matter of which institutions do what. It is about ensuring that the regulatory system delivers on making sure that it has tougher regulation. The hon. Gentleman argues that the Bank of England should take over the prudential supervision and regulation of what he calls important banks, building societies and insurance companies. That is not a power that the bank is seeking at the moment, but he is entitled to hold that view. I have said on many occasions that we can argue about where to draw the line as to who does supervision of banks, who does supervision of building societies and who does consumer protection, but the key issue is ensuring that regulators can do their jobs properly, that they have the tools to do their jobs and, crucially, that they bring to bear the right judgments whenever problems arise.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o47"><a name="90708-0005.htm_para1"><a name="09070881000193">The hon. Gentleman will recall that, 10 years ago, one of the reasons why we ended self-regulation was that, quite simply, it did not work. He will recall, too, that in the past there had been criticism of the Bank&#146;s regulation of BCCI and Barings. The fact that there have been mistakes in institutions is not a good reason for saying that we have to tear everything up. I believe that we should build on the strengths of the system that we have. It does not matter where we draw the line&#151;when it comes to a crisis and to identifying problems in the future, we will need the Bank, the FSA and, because a cost will inevitably be involved, the Treasury at the same table.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o48"><a name="90708-0005.htm_para2"><a name="09070881000194">I believe that the present system of co-ordination between the Bank, the FSA and the Government needs to be strengthened, reformed and put on a proper basis. Why do I say that? When the Bank of England next warns that there is a risk building up or that perhaps there is too much credit flowing, someone needs to react to it and to do something about it. That is why we have to have both the Bank and the FSA at the same table. That is why I believe that the arrangements between the three institutions need to be strengthened and that is why I am making these proposals.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o49"><a name="90708-0005.htm_para3"><a name="09070881000195">I do not believe that what the hon. Gentleman is proposing&#151;that one can somehow say that some institutions are systemic and some are not&#151;would work. For example, three years ago people would not have argued that Bradford &amp; Bingley, Northern Rock or the Dunfermline building society would have been of systemic importance to this country. However, the truth is that when they got into difficulties they were systemic. That was why we had to do something about them to stop the problems from spreading wider. I do not believe that the divisions that the hon. Gentleman is proposing are workable. I believe that the measures that we have at the moment need to be strengthened and improved to ensure that in future, when these warnings are seen, they can be dealt with and the people who are charged with the responsibility can be held to account.</p>

 I acknowledge that there are many things in the paper that can be welcomed&#151;which, indeed, we have advocated in the past&#151;but their implementation has a timeless quality, as if we are on a kind of progression from White Paper to Green Paper to blank paper. Almost all of the important recommendations would happen after the next general election.

Will that be clarified?</p>

However, does the Chancellor buy the argument of the European Commissioner, Neelie Kroes, who said that, if we are to have real competition in British banking, banks must be broken up and subdivided, and in particular the Lloyds-HBOS merger might have to be unscrambled? Does the Chancellor agree?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o55"><a name="90708-0005.htm_para9"><a name="09070881000202">The big issue, as the Chancellor rightly emphasised, is the major question about the banks that are too big to fail, too big to supervise and too big for the taxpayer to underwrite. He correctly said that small banks as well as big banks can go wrong&#151;that is absolutely right&#151;but is there not a fundamental problem that when very large interconnected banks try to be the biggest investment bank in the world, the exposure to the British taxpayer is then wholly unacceptable? Therefore, these banks have to be subdivided for that reason.</p>

a central reason for that is that the Government are so desperate to get the publicly owned banks back into the private sector quickly that too little attention is being given to defining the public interest.</p>

 On the last point, I think that most hon. Members agree that we need to toughen up the regulatory system significantly. We need to make changes, but we must not lose sight of the fact that this is an industry that employs over 1 million people in this country, more than half of them outside the south-east of England. It is important that we do not give the impression that we would rather be shot of it, because it is quite important. In the past nine years, it has contributed more than &#163;250 billion in tax revenues&#151;quite a useful sum. When it recovers, I hope that it will continue to make a contribution in the future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o58"><a name="90708-0005.htm_para12"><a name="09070881000207">The hon. Gentleman asked about selling. If he looks at the White Paper he will see that we make it clear that we will sell when we think that the time is appropriate. We do not have an artificial time scale and we are not under any pressure to sell, but it will not have escaped his notice that just at the moment the shares in the two banks that we own are worth slightly less than we paid for them. He therefore need have no fear of being confronted with a quick sale: we will do what is right to achieve the best value for the taxpayer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o59"><a name="90708-0005.htm_para13"><a name="09070881000208">On lending, I agree with the hon. Gentleman that it is important to try to get credit flowing in the economy again. That is a key part of what we are doing. Mortgage lending and the availability of lending for mortgages have increased but more needs to be done in certain sectors of business lending, such as to small and medium-sized enterprises, and especially to the medium-sized ones. For example, I welcome today&#146;s announcement by Prudential of a fund worth &#163;1.5 billion specifically geared to medium-sized companies. That is an example of a non-bank bringing together pension funds, local authorities and its own funds to make money directly available to medium-sized firms, and it is a useful step in the right direction.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o60"><a name="90708-0005.htm_para14"><a name="09070881000209">The hon. Gentleman made some broader points, and one of them had to do with the &#147;too big to fail&#148; argument. I understand where he is coming from, but I said in my statement that we must take into account the cost to the taxpayer as well as the wider effects of failure, and that we must regulate accordingly. However, there is a flaw in his argument&#151;I heard him being asked about this on the &#147;Today&#148; programme at 10 past 7&#151;and it is that he seems to back off from the consequences of telling a large bank that it is too big. In response to that, the bank might say, &#147;We&#146;re too big, so we&#146;ll go somewhere else.&#148; Alternatively, dividing such a bank into lots of different companies, as was the case with Lehman Brothers, does not solve the problem. When Lehman Brothers went down, the whole shooting match went down, not just one aspect of it.</p>

obvious place for it, but I come back to the point that I made to the shadow Chancellor: wherever the lines of responsibility are drawn, we need a regulator who is able to look at the wider prudential supervision of the system, and the wider financial stability.

 The Bank of England has a statutory duty in relation to financial stability as well as monetary policy. The hon. Gentleman will know that the Banking Act 2009 gave it powers to deal with a bank that has failed. The FSA deals with the individual supervision of banks, and I announced today that it can now have different rules for different individual banks. That is quite an important change, especially with regard to the matters raised by the Liberal Democrat spokesman, the hon. Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable). We have one body looking at the overall system, and one looking at the particular. They need to work together and, as I said, whether one likes it or not, the Treasury needs to be at the table because of the fiscal consequences of any action that might have to be taken.</p>

Gentleman knows, the problem that we had 10 years ago was that the Bank of England never regulated all aspects of financial services. It regulated the banks, but throughout the 1990s it was obvious that many banks had many other interests, such as insurance, that were regulated by other bodies. Such duplication and complication did no one any good. Indeed, the entire self-regulatory regime was pretty discredited by the mid-1990s. As I said to the shadow Chancellor, we can argue for ever and a day about where we draw the line. When the bank or the FSA is doing something, what matters, as the hon. Member for Gosport (Sir Peter Viggers) put it so succinctly, is that a distinction is made between the general supervision of the system, the financial stability, and an organisation that says to each individual, &#147;This is what you should be doing&#148;, drilling down into the nuts and bolts of it. The structure that we have is right. It needs to be strengthened and built on, and that is why I make my proposals today.</p>

 Chapter 9 of &#147;Reforming financial markets&#148; touches on the future regulation of credit unions in Northern Ireland. Does the Chancellor accept that for change to work, the FSA will have to have a strong and active regional interface, which we have not had before? Does he accept that that applies equally to the wider banking market in Northern Ireland, which has very different features from the banking market on this island? If the future arrangements for industrial and provident societies are to work, can we afford to leave the savers of the Presbyterian Mutual Society as casualties by the wayside?</p>

 On the latter point, the answer is quite simply that investment banks are systemically important, as we have seen in this country and in America. As we saw in America prior to the banking collapse in October, simply letting them go has potentially disastrous consequences. Indeed, it was the collapse of some of those American banks that immediately precipitated the problems. On the wider point, banks need to be properly regulated, but if my right hon. Friend is getting to a point where he can say that there should be some sort of veto from the regulators, I would say to him that that might be more difficult. It is better to have a system that regulates risk within institutions, rather than one that is wider than that.</p>

That is why I welcome the announcement today by Prudential that it intends to lend to medium-sized companies.

if one were to give more powers, the Bank would be the obvious place to go. I honestly do not see the advantages of saying that the Bank should also start to involve itself with the hundreds of different banks, building societies, insurance companies and other financial institutions, because all that that would do is simply move a large chunk of the Financial Services Authority into the Bank, and I do not think that that institutional change would benefit people at present.

<p><a name="stpa_o72"><a name="90708-0007.htm_para1"><a name="09070881000276">In addition to the subject of the title of the Bill, I propose to discuss sheltered accommodation. I am pleased to be able to present this Bill today and delighted to have received so much cross-party support for what it outlines from colleagues, including the shadow spokesmen for animal welfare and for elderly people. The issue touches every constituency throughout the UK and, given a growing elderly population, will need to be addressed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o73"><a name="90708-0007.htm_para2"><a name="09070881000277">Superficially, the issue appears to be about animal welfare, and I should say that have been involved in animal welfare organisations for even longer than I have been a member of the Labour party, which is 40 years. Indeed, Alexander Solzhenitsyn once made the relevant connection, saying:</p>
<a name="90708-0007.htm_brev1"><a name="09070881000604"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Nowadays we don't think much of a man&#146;s love for an animal; we laugh at people who are attached to cats. But if we stop loving animals, aren&#146;t we bound to stop loving humans too?&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o74"><a name="90708-0007.htm_para3"><a name="09070881000278">Separate from that, however, I see the issue as one about the right of elderly people to live their lives as they wish, without too much well meant regulation of every detail from the moment that they leave independent accommodation to the moment that they move to sheltered accommodation or care.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o75"><a name="90708-0007.htm_para4"><a name="09070881000279">The problem is simply stated: when people move into sheltered accommodation or into care, there is no consistent policy allowing them to take a pet with them. As a direct result, in the most recent year for which statistics are available, 38,000 healthy pets had to be put down and a further 100,000 had to be given up by their owners. Many of those pets will have been put down after an attempt to re-home them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o76"><a name="90708-0007.htm_para5"><a name="09070881000280">Moving home is stressful for anyone. Moving from one&#146;s long-standing home into sheltered or care environments is often traumatic, as one separates oneself from independent life. If we add to that having to part from one&#146;s pet and, even, having to order it to be put down, we add distress and guilt, and there is a very clear case for Parliament to help in avoiding that if it can.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o77"><a name="90708-0007.htm_para6"><a name="09070881000281">Practice varies enormously throughout Britain, but there are numerous examples of successful schemes that allow pets to remain with their owners, and that should be the norm for sheltered housing. The fact that one is now living in a warden-aided flat should not remove one&#146;s right to make the choice to keep a pet. Pets provide an important source of physical, emotional and social support for many older people, and there is extensive evidence of improved cardiovascular and mental health and other health benefits from the relationship with a familiar animal. It mitigates the loneliness of many people in old age and provides an avenue for nurturing, caring and taking responsibility for others, and maintains the sense of still feeling useful.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o78"><a name="90708-0007.htm_para7"><a name="09070881000282">I have discovered that many older people find that when it is time to move into care, there are wildly  <br>

different practices throughout the country, making for a postcode lottery if one wants to keep an animal. There are no legal obligations on residential homes in that respect, and that is in stark contrast to other countries, including the USA, Germany, Greece, France and Switzerland, all of which have introduced legislation to ensure that older people have the right to keep or maintain contact with animals, whether those people live independently in the community, in sheltered accommodation or in long-term homes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o79"><a name="90708-0007.htm_para8"><a name="09070881000283">As far back as 1970, France legislated for pets to be allowed in all public and private housing, provided that the pet is properly cared for and not causing a nuisance. In 1983, the USA passed a national law permitting older and disabled people to keep pets in housing that received federal funding. The Society for Companion Animal Studies, supported by the Pet Food Manufacturers&#146; Association, both of which have been extremely helpful in preparing the Bill, has published research to assess the scale of the problem in the UK. It found that 65 per cent. of care homes have no formal written policy whatever. Of those that do, 29 per cent. permit pet ownership, but more than half&#151;54 per cent.&#151;specifically exclude cats and dogs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o80"><a name="90708-0007.htm_para9"><a name="09070881000284">I know from correspondence from constituents that there are genuine concerns about pets going with their owners into shared or nursing care accommodation relating to pets not mixing well and about adequate exercise for dogs; responsibility for the payment of veterinary care when it becomes necessary; and the fact that older residents might be frightened of or allergic to animals. I am not arguing for a blanket policy, stating that every pet, from an anaconda to a Rottweiler, has to be admitted; I am arguing for a basic presumption that pets be permitted&#151;subject to appropriate discussion about all the eventualities that can arise, and provided that they do not cause a nuisance to other residents.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o81"><a name="90708-0007.htm_para10"><a name="09070881000285">Care providers would be understandably and rightly concerned if an extra burden was placed on them. However, evidence from experience is that an intelligent policy allowing animals actually reduces the burden on staff; residents who would otherwise make frequent demands on staff time often focus on their companion animals for much of the day.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o82"><a name="90708-0007.htm_para11"><a name="09070881000286">Best practice guidelines are available for any authority that changes its policy. Wandsworth council has been proactive on the issue; its previous policy effectively ruled out pets in its accommodation, but its current policy makes the keeping of pets normally permissible. The feedback has been entirely positive. The council has told me that it would be glad to advise other authorities that might be considering a similar change. Organisations such as Help the Aged, Age Concern, Pathway and the Anchor Housing Trust have recommended guidelines that can help.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o83"><a name="90708-0007.htm_para12"><a name="09070881000287">The Cinnamon Trust has gone beyond that and produced a comprehensive publication of pet-friendly homes; it gives ratings to the top 500 establishments visited by the trust&#146;s assessors. I was delighted to visit Elm House nursing home in my constituency of Broxtowe. It has a five-star rating for the criterion &#147;Welcoming any owner and their pet with caring, friendly staff&#148;. I saw the dramatic effects that the home&#146;s cat, budgerigar and visiting pets have on the lives and reactions of long-term residents with physical and mental disabilities.</p>

<p><a name="90708-0007.htm_amdt0">&#145;(4) The Treasury shall, no later than the date of the Pre-Budget Report 2009, bring forward plans to replace Air Passenger Duty with a per-plane tax.&#146;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o95"><a name="90708-0007.htm_para24"><a name="09070881000300">Let me start by outlining the Opposition&#146;s overall approach to air passenger duty. We believe, and have said repeatedly, that the duty should be levied on a per-plane basis, not a per-passenger basis. That allows a stronger link with emissions and other environmental impacts; after all, we are talking about what is, or should be, an environmental tax. Furthermore, levying on a per-plane basis allows the possibility of including freight and corporate aircraft, which have environmental impacts that can be as severe as those of commercial airliners, as well as transfer passengers, who are currently exempt from APD.</p>

Instead, the only real reform&#151;the new division of the world into four bands, based on the location of a country&#146;s capital city&#151;is a botched job, drawn up by someone in the Treasury armed only with a drawing compass and no common sense.

 If a per-passenger duty were imposed on cars, it would be paid four times if four people using a car pool system went in a car together, but only once if a single person used a car; we might end up with four cars, rather than one, on the road. That is the parallel, and it makes nonsense of the Government&#146;s position.</p>

 My hon. Friend is right. That is why our amendment 1, a much more logical and environmentally friendly alternative, would mean that air passenger duty was charged on a per-plane basis.

 I understand the environmental arguments that the hon. Gentleman is putting forward.

 I thank the hon. Gentleman for that intervention. He raises two very reasonable questions, which the Government considered in their response to their consultation. Unfortunately, their response did not put forward any reasonable arguments against a move to charging on a per-plane basis. On regional airports, a lot depends on how we would assess the per-plane tax and how the administration would be run. I believe that a system could be designed that did not discriminate against regional airports.</p>

A per-plane tax might also allow tax incentives to be given for more environmentally friendly planes, which could never easily happen with a per-passenger tax.

We can agree that member states&#146; decision in October to include aviation in the EU emissions trading scheme was a significant development, but the Government have acknowledged the ongoing case for a UK tax along the lines of the ETS.

The existing two-band regime becomes the four-band version laid out in schedule 5 and new schedule 5A, with all rates significantly higher than at present. Under the status quo, the first band is currently &#163;10 per passenger for economy and &#163;20 for all other classes. The long-haul band, which includes all the territories in parts 2, 3 and 4 under the new schedule, is &#163;40 and &#163;80 respectively&#151;for economy class, on the one hand, and all other classes, including, interestingly, premium economy, on the other.</p>

It now includes the Maghreb countries and Russia west of the Urals. New part 2 territories include north America, Egypt, the middle east, eastern Russia&#151;that is, east of the Urals&#151;and Pakistan. From November 2009, those rates will be &#163;45 and &#163;90&#151;a 12.5 per cent. rise on the status quo. Returning to the point raised by the hon. Member for Brent, East (Sarah Teather), part 3, which includes the Caribbean, will be banded at &#163;50 and &#163;100&#151;a 25 per cent. rise on the status quo. That band also includes India, China, Japan and much of Latin America. The rates for part 4&#151;it is not actually defined as such but covers all the territories not in parts 1 to 3, including Australasia, Argentina, Chile, Bolivia, Peru, some other smaller south American countries and the Falkland Islands&#151;will be &#163;55 and &#163;110: a huge 37.5 per cent. increase on the status quo.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o106"><a name="90708-0008.htm_para3"><a name="09070881000321">Even more importantly, the Government are programming further big rises&#151;far bigger than those this coming November&#151;for November 2010. Part 1 charges will go up to &#163;12 and &#163;24, part 2 charges will go up to &#163;60 and &#163;120, part 3 charges will go up to &#163;75 and &#163;150, and part 4 charges will go up to &#163;85 and &#163;170. Those are huge increases. Air passengers from the UK will be cursing Labour&#146;s economic mismanagement and the fact that owing to the Government&#146;s botched reforms and failure to opt for a per-plane duty, all aviation except commercial passenger aircraft will be exempt from APD. In the next 18 months, for economy class passengers, those flying to popular destinations such as France or Spain will face a 20 per cent. tax hike, those flying to Florida will face a 50 per cent. increase, those flying to the Caribbean and India will face an 87.5 per cent. increase, and those flying to Australia will face a whopping 113 per cent. increase&#151;a more than doubling of the tax take.</p>

 The hon. Lady makes a very fair point. That is why many of those routes are called VFR routes, standing for &#147;visiting friends and relatives&#148;. They are important for that reason. Of course, tourism is very important to the Caribbean and somewhat important to India, but we should not lose sight of the fact that for many people in our communities in this country, those are important routes for family or personal reasons as well.</p>

Let us examine for a moment some of the peculiarities of the Government&#146;s new four-band regime. The existing two bands&#151;Europe and all other countries&#151;at least make some kind of sense and possess simplicity. The new bandings have no justification at all, as they are based on the distance of a country&#146;s capital city from London. The world is divided into four bands, of capital cities up to 2,000 miles away, up to 4,000 miles away, up to 6,000 miles away and beyond 6,000 miles away.</p>

We should remind ourselves that this is supposed to be an environmental tax. Because the US capital is on the east coast and within 4,000 miles of London, all flights to the US, including to the west coast, or even Hawaii or Alaska if there were direct flights there, are assessed as being in band 2. Meanwhile, as has previously been mentioned, the Caribbean is in band 3 and flights there will be subject to 25 per cent. more tax than those to the USA from November 2010. Flights to India will be taxed at 25 per cent. more than flights to Pakistan. Indeed, Bangladesh would be better off still being part of Pakistan, as APD would 25 per cent. lower.</p>

As has been mentioned, their approach has provoked uproar in the Caribbean. The Jamaican Prime Minister, Bruce Golding, whom I have mentioned, and Tourism Minister Ed Bartlett made a special visit to the UK purely about this one issue during the Committee stage, to urge against the Government&#146;s new four-zone banding scheme. They pointed out that there was no environmental or economic reason why flights to the Caribbean should be taxed 25 per cent. higher than those to Florida, or to the US or Canadian west coast.</p>

As I understand it, 60,000 members of the UK Caribbean diaspora have signed a petition against the Government&#146;s plans, which are an extremely unpopular measure.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o125"><a name="90708-0008.htm_para22"><a name="09070881000346">The reason for the climbdown is that the Government were too busy elsewhere to drive through the necessary reforms once they had started the process. It is difficult to sell to the general public a big increase&#151;a huge increase, in the case that we are considering&#151;in air passenger duty without reforming the system to make it a genuinely environmental tax.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o126"><a name="90708-0008.htm_para23"><a name="09070881000347">We want the following to be done. First, we want the duty to be linked to the pollutant&#151;the plane&#151;rather than directly to the passenger. Secondly, empty or near-empty aircraft should be taxed at the same rate as full ones. Thirdly, the tax should logically be extended to transfer passengers, who fly in and out of a UK airport. There is no logic to a system whereby the only passengers who fly in and out of the UK tax-free are those who do not live, work or visit here. Fourthly, the Government&#146;s four-band system must be axed. It is arbitrary and discriminates against important UK partners such as India and the Caribbean for no good economic or environmental reason. Fifthly, other forms of polluting aviation need to be brought into the air duty regime, notably corporate jets, parcel services and other freight. Finally, the tax should encourage a move to cleaner aircraft. Ironically, higher APD will probably make that less likely as airlines become even more cash-strapped, and less able to invest because more of their money goes towards APD.</p>

Furthermore, it faces a particular economic crisis after the collapse of its traditional commodities&#151;sugar and bananas&#151;through globalisation. Apart from providing foreign exchange and helping businesses flourish, those traditional commodities meant the employment of unskilled and semi-skilled male labour, and the Caribbean is finding them difficult to replace. The problems of systemic unemployment among young males are known even in a developed country such as ours.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o133"><a name="90708-0008.htm_para30"><a name="09070881000355">As well as the collapse of traditional commodities, which not only made money for the region but provided employment, the Caribbean also suffers from the current credit crunch and financial crisis. For example, bauxite, which is one of the main foreign currency earners in Jamaica, has collapsed. More than ever, the Caribbean is looking to tourism, not only to provide foreign exchange and not just as business, but to create work. If there is systemic worklessness among the population in countries such as the Caribbean, the ensuing social problems have the power to affect us here in Britain.</p>

The briefing that the Caribbean Council has sent to all MPs says that a family of four travelling economy to the Caribbean&#151;not club class, as she suggested&#151;will pay &#163;300 extra in 2010. That is a substantial amount of money.</p>

 We have to look at the incomes that people are earning. We are largely talking about people who are in low-paid public sector jobs or other low-paid sectors of the economy, and for them &#163;300 is a lot of money. Having to find &#163;300 extra to see their aunties or grandparents at Christmas or attend a wedding or funeral will cause real pain for families in my constituency, as well as people in Birmingham, Manchester and other places.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o137"><a name="90708-0009.htm_para0"><a name="09070881000363">The other thing to say is that sometimes an arbitrary distinction is made between tourism and travel by friends and relatives. Jamaica could not sustain itself without the money spent by relatives who go home regularly and, for example, give money for school fees or invest. The economic consequences for the Caribbean are therefore serious.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o138"><a name="90708-0009.htm_para1"><a name="09070881000364">As the House has heard, the system also seems to be wholly arbitrary; it really is a case of a Treasury civil servant with a compass. It means that people will pay more air passenger duty going to the Caribbean than they will going to Hawaii. It scarcely makes sense to have the whole of north America in the same zone, when America stretches from the Pacific to the Atlantic.</p>

 The hon. Lady is making a powerful speech. Is not one of the unintended consequences of the measure that people will fly to Miami and then change planes to fly down to the Caribbean? That will mean taking two flights and causing much more pollution, so I am not sure that the Government have thought the measure through.</p>

relatives, that the cheapest way would be to take a cheap flight to Miami and then take another flight onwards. That will not help with emissions; in fact, it will make things worse. That is another indication that Ministers need to look at the proposal again.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o139"><a name="90708-0009.htm_para2"><a name="09070881000367">The proposal has already caused much unhappiness in Caribbean countries&#151;we have heard about the Prime Minister of Jamaica and other regional leaders who are concerned&#151;and among the Caribbean community here. I have received many letters from people who have been made aware of the issue and are concerned. They cannot believe that a British Government are seeking to penalise people from the Caribbean in that way. However, I would like to put on record my thanks to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, who met a small group of us earlier this week to discuss the issue. I am glad that the Government are at least listening.</p>

To go forward with the air passenger duty in its current form would send an unfortunate signal to those in the Caribbean community about the respect and concern that the Government have for them. It is not too late to revisit the proposal. All of us in this House understand the environmental reasons behind it, but I hope that enough has been said in this debate to make the Government understand that the four-zone system is widely seen as unfair and not seriously based on environmental considerations, and that it will have disproportionate effects on key supporters and Commonwealth countries, including India and Pakistan, as well as those in the Caribbean. For the sake of my constituents, the Caribbean community in this country and Caribbean leaders, who have gone to enormous trouble to make their case, I urge Ministers to reconsider the proposal.</p>

 Thank you for giving me an opportunity to speak to amendment 1 and all the issues that are thrown up as a consequence, Madam Deputy Speaker. I congratulate the hon. Member for Hammersmith and Fulham (Mr. Hands) on the intelligent way in which he set out the arguments. I also congratulate the hon. Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington (Ms Abbott) on making in such a compelling fashion the case that I, too, wish to make.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o141"><a name="90708-0009.htm_para4"><a name="09070881000370">There are two main arguments that I wish briefly to explore. The first is about the desirability, in the view of my party, of having a system of aviation taxation based on each plane that travels, rather than on each customer who travels. It is worth momentarily setting the context for that policy preference. Aviation in the United Kingdom is an increasingly large contributor to the overall output of carbon dioxide. Six per cent. of the UK&#146;s total carbon dioxide emissions now results from aviation, and that figure is rising rapidly&#151;far faster than, for example, the contributions made by other forms of transport or by buildings to overall CO2 emissions. There is therefore an important issue to address. How can we try to ensure that the projection of rapidly increasing CO2 emissions is limited, rather than rising inexorably in the years and decades ahead? Most people accept that CO2 emissions resulting from aviation are likely to grow as a proportion of CO2 emissions overall. The key is to try to ensure that they grow more slowly and make up a lower percentage of overall emissions than they would otherwise.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o142"><a name="90708-0009.htm_para5"><a name="09070881000371">For that reason, our desire as a party is to try to find a system that allows people to fly&#151;we realise that in many circumstances, although not all, people need to fly for work or leisure&#151;but that ensures it is done as efficiently as possible. I thought that the analogy drawn by the hon. Member for Wellingborough (Mr. Bone) was a good one&#151;perhaps it is sometimes easy to think of such matters in quite straightforward terms. A car with four people in it is obviously a much more efficient way of transporting four people from A to B than four cars each with one person in. It is for that reason&#151;a reason that is, I admit, partly to do with congestion, but partly to do with helping the environment&#151;that some councils have explored the possibility of reserving lanes for cars with two or more passengers, because we need to be more efficient and intelligent in using CO2-emitting fuels.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o143"><a name="90708-0009.htm_para6"><a name="09070881000372">On the same principle, it would clearly be desirable to have planes filled to capacity, or at least to give airlines the incentive to fill them to capacity where possible. The issue is therefore about incentivising those companies, partly to make their planes fuller but partly not to continue with this strange system whereby planes are flown around empty in order to get them to different destinations&#151;that may sometimes be necessary, but it is reasonable to try to incentivise airlines to do it as little as possible&#151;and partly also to introduce more fuel-efficient planes. I recognise that the Government&#146;s policy will create those incentives. However, having a per plane duty rather than a per passenger duty will create even greater incentives than the Government&#146;s system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o144"><a name="90708-0009.htm_para7"><a name="09070881000373">The hon. Gentleman also made the point that we should try to ensure that we do not create perverse incentives for customers to avoid the system that the Government are putting in place by taking a short-haul flight and then a long-haul flight, or vice versa. One always needs to consider when looking at such systems whether people will find ways around them that may be economically advantageous to them, but which will undermine the basic environmental policy that the Government are seeking to promote. That is the background to the issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o145"><a name="90708-0009.htm_para8"><a name="09070881000374">The second part of my speech relates to the issue that has been so eloquently discussed by the hon. Members for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington and for Hammersmith and Fulham&#151;namely, the division of the world into four bands for the purpose of assessing levels of air passenger duty. The hon. Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington said that the system was arbitrary, but it is not entirely so. There is a method to it.

North and Stoke Newington and others&#151;namely, the fact that the Caribbean is in a different band from the United States.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o147"><a name="90708-0009.htm_para10"><a name="09070881000376">In an era in which anyone with a computer can put in the names of two cities and find out precisely, to the nearest metre, the distance between them, it seems strange that we need to base the system on capital cities. It would be perfectly feasible to base it on the actual distance of each flight. We could have a tax system that charged a number of pence per mile, for example. Or, if that were too complicated to administer, we could have a banding system in which the bands applied to each individual flight, rather than to the country that was being visited and to the location of the capital city in that country. The situation becomes particularly anomalous when the country in question is very large, because the capital city might be located in an area that is unfavourable to travellers&#151;or, indeed, in one that is more favourable than the rest of the country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o148"><a name="90708-0009.htm_para11"><a name="09070881000377">I wonder why the capital city has been chosen as a measure. We were talking about the United States of America earlier. Los Angeles, which is eight time zones away from London, is a much bigger city than Washington DC, so why is Washington DC regarded as the most suitable point for judging the tax level of journeys from the United Kingdom to the United States? New York would be just as good an example, or Chicago. There are any number of cities in the United States that are bigger than Washington DC, which is not a tourist destination for many people. Far more British people go to Florida, for example, which is further from here than Washington is. It is slightly strange that the Government have chosen to use capital cities as a measure, and it is reasonable to ask them to look again at whether this is the best system to use.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o149"><a name="90708-0009.htm_para12"><a name="09070881000378">I would like to suggest an alternative system. I understand that paying more tax to travel further is a reasonable proposition. I do not doubt that there are people on low incomes who wish to travel to distant parts of the world, but most of us accept the need to reflect the environmental damage done by long-haul flights. It is the anomalies in the system that people are uncomfortable with.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o150"><a name="90708-0009.htm_para13"><a name="09070881000379">I do not know whether the Minister, in the short time that she has been in her job, has had the opportunity to consult her officials and other Ministers and to consider an alternative system. If she is attached to the idea of four bands, we could keep them, but each individual flight could be assessed within those bands. There is only a limited number of destinations that one can fly to directly from the United Kingdom, and it would take very little time to assess any new routes that came into effect. In that way, the Government could retain the simplicity of a banding system&#151;they could introduce more than four bands if they wished to do so&#151;but each individual flight could be assessed within one of the bands.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o151"><a name="90708-0009.htm_para14"><a name="09070881000380">Such a system would avoid two places that were close together being banded separately. It would also avoid the even more anomalous situation&#151;the example of the Caribbean and the United States has been mentioned&#151;in which places that are much further from the United Kingdom are placed in a lower band than places that are more proximate to us. I hope that the Minister will consider that proposal, for reasons of fairness as well as for environmental reasons.</p>

 On the environmental issue, there is a further perverse effect. Most environmental damage is done on take-off and landing, so short-haul flights are, by their nature, much more environmentally damaging. They are often used as an alternative to going by rail. If we are concerned about the environment, perhaps we should be concentrating more on short-haul flights than on long-haul flights, to which there is no such alternative. Furthermore, the aircraft used on long-haul flights tend to be the most efficient.</p>

 I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for that intervention. Short-haul flights definitely do more damage per mile travelled than long-haul flights, and it is important to look at the alternatives, particularly within the United Kingdom. I accept that the islands of Scotland and perhaps places such as Aberdeen are a considerable distance from London, but it is important to ask whether people should be routinely flying from London to Manchester, for example, when it seems much more sensible to make that journey by rail most of the time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o152"><a name="90708-0009.htm_para15"><a name="09070881000383">The hon. Gentleman&#146;s intervention also raises the question whether people might feel incentivised to take a short-haul flight from the United Kingdom before taking a long-haul flight to a destination further away, in order to avoid paying these duties. That means that we will need to consider the tax regimes in nearby European countries. We must also be alert to the risk of creating a system that unfairly penalises some destinations. The example that illustrates the greatest unfairness involves the Caribbean, which is only four or five times zones from here yet is treated for the purpose of this rule as though it were much further away.</p>

 That is a hazard, but I do not want to go so far as to say that any taxes on aviation will threaten our airline industry if other countries&#146; taxes are lower. The logic of that position would be that we should have no aviation taxes at all, and I do not agree with that proposition. However, we need to have a system in place that incentivises airlines to be more environmentally efficient, and that reflects the polluting effect of flying long haul without building in anomalies that unfairly penalise some categories of passenger and some countries whose economies rely on trade and tourism.</p>

points. One was that I disagree with the Government&#146;s view that we should tax per passenger; I think that we should be taxing per plane. I hope that that concept is straightforward and easy to understand. I disagree with the hon. Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington that the system is arbitrary.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o153"><a name="90708-0009.htm_para16"><a name="09070881000388">My second point relates to the bands of 2,000 miles. Everyone can agree that the capital cities are within those bands, but I believe that that is a bad way to run the system. I was suggesting that the distance covered by each individual flight should be measured. For example, we could measure the distance between London and Kingston in Jamaica, and the distance between London and Miami. I suspect that they would both fall within the same band, under a new banding system. That would be far less anomalous than the present system, in which a flight from London to Miami is judged according to the distance between London and Washington DC. That seems to be a very strange system.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman may think is an anomalous system, but a Jamaican nurse who has saved for two years to fly home and finds that she has to pay substantially more in air passenger duty than someone who is flying all the way to Los Angeles would think the system looked pretty arbitrary.</p>

 I do not want the hon. Lady to misrepresent my position, because I am an ally of hers and it would be a great shame if she thought there was political advantage in pretending otherwise. Both she and I are trying to persuade the Government that it is unreasonable to have a system that charges people more in tax to fly a shorter distance. That is what we are saying, while the Government propose that people should pay more in tax to fly to the Caribbean than they should to fly to San Diego or Los Angeles. I think that that is a bad system and I have made that completely clear. My understanding is that the hon. Lady agrees that it would be better if we based the system on measuring the distance of each flight and taxed either per flight or had a banding system that took each individual flight into account rather than the distance from London to the country&#146;s capital city. I venture to suggest that unless the system is extremely complicated, the tax levels for Florida would be the same as for the Caribbean islands, which the hon. Lady would agree to be a fairer system.</p>

Member for Hammersmith and Fulham presses the matter to a Division. The case is clear cut and there is a genuine grievance, which has been articulated by the hon. Member for Ealing, Acton and Shepherd's Bush (Mr. Slaughter). I anticipate that he will vote with me, my hon. Friends and Conservative Members to try to make the Government think again. The case has also been articulated by the hon. Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington, who I also anticipate will join us in the Aye Lobby to ensure that the Government are made to understand that this is a great grievance for many people. We need to come up with a system that takes account of the environmental consequences of aviation but does not at the same time create unfair anomalies that penalise our constituents.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o155"><a name="90708-0009.htm_para18"><a name="09070881000393">Like many hon. Members, I met the Prime Minister of Jamaica when he came here to raise the issue of air passenger duty, so I heard the case that he, his Tourism Minister and the Caribbean Council have made about the effects of the proposed system on the Caribbean. My hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington (Ms Abbott) has gone through the case in detail, so I shall not repeat it all.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o156"><a name="90708-0009.htm_para19"><a name="09070881000394">The key issues for the Caribbean are quite simple. The first is the importance of tourism. As my hon. Friend said, the collapse of the traditional economy in the Caribbean&#151;the Jamaican Prime Minister specifically mentioned the collapse in the bauxite market&#151;has made the islands much more reliant on tourism than ever before. Anything that discourages people from flying to the Caribbean, as opposed to destinations nearby such as Florida, will have an impact on the area.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o157"><a name="90708-0009.htm_para20"><a name="09070881000395">Secondly, people living in the UK, including British citizens, whose families are still living in the Caribbean and who need to visit them&#151;I have been approached by many people in my constituency about this&#151;are also affected. Tourists have a choice about where they go and are able to weigh up the cost of fares, but the people visiting their families have no such choice; they either visit them or they do not. The only choice they might have is to go via a different route. That could mean, as was mentioned earlier, people taking a short-haul flight to, say, Paris and then flying from there across the Atlantic because it is cheaper, which would not particularly help our airline industry or do anything to deal with pollution. We should be aware that people who need to visit their families may not be at all well off. An increase in passenger duty from &#163;160 to &#163;300 in a couple of years is not an insignificant amount of money for a family of four wanting to make those journeys.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o158"><a name="90708-0009.htm_para21"><a name="09070881000396">Let me say a few words about the alternatives. I am not necessarily convinced that the amendment provides the answer; it simply proposes to move to duty per plane. We should be looking at a system more closely connected to distances of flights. I am told that such an approach would cause all sorts of administrative problems, but, frankly, I do not believe it. As was said earlier, we can look up in 10 seconds on Google the distance between any two cities in the world, and all the airlines provide the air miles when we fly&#151;presumably based on the actual distances of the flight.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o159"><a name="90708-0010.htm_para0"><a name="09070881000401">As I was saying, I do not believe that there will be serious administrative problems; it should not be that complicated. I am also told that there is the problem that the measure might be seen as a proxy for fuel consumption, because the distance travelled would correspond quite closely to fuel consumption, and it is not permitted to tax that. That seems to be the root of the problem, because I would have thought that the amount of fuel consumed must be the best measure of emissions. That has to be the case. If we based the system on that, it would cover the issue of short-haul flights, where less fuel may be used in the air, but the amount used in take-off in comparison with the rest of the journey is disproportionately high. The root of our problem is thus the inability that I am told we have to tax fuel consumption. If that is the case&#151;I assume that it is due to EU or other international regulations&#151;we should take it up and argue about it in order to secure change towards a greener tax for the future.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman is making a sensible and cogent argument. Banding of any form will produce problems and anomalies.

 It is a great pleasure to follow the hon. Member for Walthamstow (Mr. Gerrard). He made a valid and powerful point about the need to bear the per-mile damage in mind rather than opting for a banding system. If we can adopt such an arrangement&#151;or something nearer to it&#151;the position will improve greatly, because it will be environmentally friendly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o161"><a name="90708-0010.htm_para2"><a name="09070881000408">Let me begin by referring the House to my entry in the Register of Members&#146; Interests, which states that I am a non-remunerated director of a travel company.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o162"><a name="90708-0010.htm_para3"><a name="09070881000409">The Government have got themselves into a terrible tizz over APD. I think that they were right when, a year or so ago, they said that they would introduce a per-plane tax, but they got into an awful mix-up over premium and standard passengers. I remember that they discriminated against tall people last year: for some reason they thought that there were business-class-only aircraft flying around, when in fact all the companies concerned had gone out of business. The Treasury estimated that it would raise an extra &#163;5 million from a class of airliners that did not exist. Having got into a terrible muddle in trying to define the distance between seats according to whether they were standard or premium, it has now included premium and economy seats in the premium APD.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o163"><a name="90708-0010.htm_para4"><a name="09070881000410">The real question, however, is whether this measure is a stealth tax, designed purely to raise money for the Government. I fear that, in large part, it is just that. My right hon. Friend the Member for Witney (Mr. Cameron) has taken hold of the Conservative party and shaken it, as he has done in many other contexts: he has brought environmental issues to the top of the Conservative agenda. I fear that APD is not an environmental tax in any sense. If an aircraft is flying to Florida carrying two passengers, they will pay two lots of duty. If it is carrying 230 passengers, they will pay 230 lots of duty. That cannot be environmentally correct. It is as simple and as straightforward as that, and many other Members have made the same point.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o164"><a name="90708-0010.htm_para5"><a name="09070881000411">The Board of Airline Representatives in the UK, known as BAR UK, has made a point that has not featured much in the debate about passengers coming into the United Kingdom. Let us suppose that an American says to a travel agent, &#147;I want to go to Europe: where do you suggest that I fly to?&#148; The travel agent will say, &#147;It is several hundred pounds cheaper to fly to Schiphol than to fly to London.&#148; I remember that a few years ago there was much talk of Schiphol&#146;s being the third London airport.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o165"><a name="90708-0010.htm_para6"><a name="09070881000412">It is crazy to put this country at a disadvantage. The Government need to come up with a taxation system that is based on environmental considerations. I agree with the hon. Member for Taunton (Mr. Browne) that there should be a tax on airlines to help to control emissions, but it should not be one that puts our airline industry and our cities at a disadvantage. If it is too high and out of synch with the rest of Europe, it will merely be a stealth tax, but I think that that is the direction in which the Government are moving.</p>

 This may support the hon. Gentleman&#146;s argument. Surely an environmental tax should have the desired effect of changing behaviour. If the intention is simply to raise revenue, the number of passengers and flights should remain the same. It would be interesting to hear from the Government which of those two options they prefer. Do they plan to change behaviour by reducing the number of passengers and flights, or are they merely using airlines as a cash cow? Banding or a per-mile tax would not be a sensible option environmentally, but it would be a very sensible option if the Government are trying to raise more money for themselves.</p>

I have a horrible feeling that we are returning to the system that operated when I was growing up, when air travel was only for the rich. This is a tax on the poor, and it is a tax on people who want to go home to visit their friends or want their friends to visit this country. I do not think that the Government have thought it through at all. I am not sure that they really want to discriminate against people travelling home to the West Indies and to India, but that is the effect of what they have done. Many of my constituents are very unhappy about it, and I ask the Government to think again.</p>

The amendment proposes that they should bring forward plans for a per-plane tax again. I assure those who tabled the amendment that the Government decided against introducing a per-plane tax at this point only after fully considering the merits of, and evidence for, such a tax. Having considered the evidence and listened to respondents, we announced in the 2008 pre-Budget report that we would instead reform the existing APD regime and change the current two-destination band structure to a four-band structure. As has already been said today and in earlier debates, that decision recognised the need for stability in the tax system in difficult economic circumstances. The reform of APD strengthens the environmental signal of the tax, and raises revenue in comparison with the existing system.</p>

The decision to reform APD rather than proceed with a per-plane tax was taken after considering the potential impacts on regional connectivity and on air freight and the knock-on effects on employment, as well as the need to ensure greater stability in tax policy in times of economic uncertainty and to avoid the disruption and costs associated with the transition to a new tax.</p>

Both airlines will incur handling charges for processing the passenger, and it is likely that they would be passed on to the passenger. Also, a passenger taking a connected flight enters into a contract for travel to their final destination. That offers a passenger some protection against unforeseen delays or cancellations as it is the airline&#146;s responsibility to ensure that they reach their final destination. In some cases, that may mean rebooking a passenger on an alternative flight or providing, or paying for, accommodation until a flight is available. Unconnected flights do not carry that same protection, and an airline&#146;s responsibility will cease once the passenger has reached the destination specified on the ticket.</p>

 I am a frequent air traveller. Unfortunately, I sometimes take between four and six flights a week. Are this Government saying that they are going to make life even more difficult for air passengers by ensuring that they have to check in again, and by not ironing out the rough edges? Their journeys are already stressful and annoying enough. Will they get even worse now as result of the consequences of the Government&#146;s measures?</p>

 The measures do not apply within the UK. <i> [Interruption.] </i>What I am saying is in the context of passenger choice&#151;if they think that, to avoid APD, it would be cheaper and more convenient to travel via a different hub. However, it would not necessarily be so practical and easy, and it would not necessarily be so cheap. If it is a through-flight, the measures do not apply; if they are unconnected flights, they will apply.</p>

 I think that the Minister is not quite aware of the practice. Travelling non-stop&#151;direct&#151;is more expensive, and airlines will try to attract people on an indirect route. Someone may well fly with Northwest airlines to Detroit and then down to the Caribbean, and that will be priced cheaper. That is because the airline is trying to attract people&#146;s business and that break in flight is not essential. Interlining happens all the time and there is no difference in protection, because the interlining protection continues through. In practice, the Minister has not got that point exactly right.</p>

 I will certainly re-examine that, but my understanding is that the situation for two unconnected flights is different from that for a connected flight booked on one ticket.</p>

 On the incentive to use an interconnecting flight rather than a direct one, people going to the Caribbean&#151;I am thinking, in particular, of families and Caribbean diaspora nationals&#151;will find it tempting to break their flight in Miami. The Minister may not be aware that there is a large Caribbean community there. If it could be done more cheaply, it would make perfect sense to break a flight there and then go on to the Caribbean, and perhaps a couple of days could be spent visiting another set of relatives. I imagined that the environment was the underlying rationale behind the proposal, but a situation such as I have described will not help us with carbon emissions at all.</p>

 I take my hon. Friend&#146;s point, but the point that I am trying to make is that such flights will not necessarily be cheaper because there may be other costs to take into account. It may not be quite as simple as some people have suggested.</p>

 Will the Minister explain why it is sensible to have a higher tax on a flight to the Caribbean, given that such a journey can be made only by air, than on a flight to Manchester, which can be reached by train? Would it not be more environmentally sensible if things were the other way around? Has she not got it all upside down?</p>

 I disagree. I thought that we had a consensus that long-distance flights were more environmentally damaging than short-distance flights.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o179"><a name="90708-0011.htm_para0"><a name="09070881000455">Let us move on, because I wish to come to suggestions made to amend our APD system in order to avoid the anomalies. Ticketing systems are based on national territories. As such, it is straightforward to base the tax on countries, and we think that the capital city is the most coherent and principled proxy. Where it is administratively simple to divide a territory at an appropriate point, as in the case of the Russian Federation, the Government have done so. Of course it is possible to determine the exact distances of flights, and I take the point that my hon. Friend the Member for Walthamstow made about the administration of that. Such an approach would be slightly more complex because of the ticketing systems that airlines use, and any consequent increases in cost could be passed on to passengers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o180"><a name="90708-0011.htm_para1"><a name="09070881000456">My hon. Friend was right when he mentioned the Chicago convention and the fact that the distance link might be so closely tied to fuel consumption as to raise questions about legality. He asked that we should focus our attentions on that, and I assure him that the Government continue actively to support international action at the International Civil Aviation Organisation. It administers that convention, which, as someone rightly said, was signed in 1944 and created the framework. The convention has been revised frequently, but we think that it is now in need of modernisation, and that is particularly true in relation to the environment. The UK and other like-minded states believe that the current practice of exempting aviation from fuel taxation is anomalous and we have succeeded in increasing our focus on the environment, but it has not yet been possible to reach consensus in the ICAO on specific economic instruments. I assure all hon. Members that we are committed to engaging actively, together with our European partners, to press for greater action on the environmental impacts of aviation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o181"><a name="90708-0011.htm_para2"><a name="09070881000457">There will be instances in any banding system where a capital falls either just within or just outside a band, or a territory covers a large area. Calls for exceptions to be made for a specific country or group of countries can generally not be met without breaking international law principles of uniform treatment. Making changes in the banding system to change the impact on one group of countries in particular could reduce the revenue from APD, thus requiring the money to be found elsewhere. It could also undermine the environmental signals from the tax and, in addition to legal considerations, it could raise distortion issues with comparable destinations.</p>

 My hon. Friend makes some good negative points about why the Opposition proposals may not work or why, in the case of the per-plane tax, they may even be more expensive. However, she must understand that the anomalies need to be corrected. When my hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington (Ms Abbott) and I saw the Chancellor earlier this week on the matter, he said that it would be re-examined to see whether some of the anomalies, such as those relating to the Caribbean, could be addressed.

 I was about to come to that. I have asked my officials to consider the matter further. Although my hon. Friend said that my points appear to be negative, I was trying to explain the difficulties and why we have not been able to introduce the proposal until now. That does not mean to say that we are not still looking at it.</p>

 One of the arguments that the Minister made against doing anything about the zones was that to do so would reduce the revenue. I am genuinely committed to taking action on the environment and to green taxes. The Government must make up their mind about whether the measure is designed to reduce carbon emissions or to produce revenue. Leaving aside the broader question on the Caribbean, which is the thing that concerns me in this debate, I fear that if the Government devalue the notion of green taxes by using them as a cover for raising revenue, the public acceptability of such taxes in future will be much reduced.</p>

 I certainly take on board my hon. Friend&#146;s point but, as I said, we must recognise that we want the aviation sector to pay its fair share towards the public finances. The sector is not highly taxed&#151;it does not pay fuel duty or VAT on fuel&#151;and we have a joint way of ensuring that we can secure a contribution to the public finances while trying to find a sensible way of strengthening the environmental signal.

 My point is that we are trying to make our reformed APD system give a better environmental signal and better match the distance travelled. We cannot do that under the Chicago convention, which we are trying to change, if the proxy is too close to emissions. The banding system gives a better signal towards that.</p>

 Before the hon.

Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington (Ms Abbott), my hon. Friend the Member for Brent, East (Sarah Teather) and others? The Minister could explore the possibility of having eight bands, rather than four, and the determination of which band a plane journey fell in would be made on the basis of the actual distance travelled, rather than the distance from the UK to the capital city of the country. That would ensure that the bands much more accurately reflected the actual distance travelled, while being less administratively complicated than measuring the distance of each flight. We could keep a band system&#151;there would probably be more bands&#151;but the determination would be about the actual journey made, rather than the journey to the capital city. Does she think that that would be a good way forward?</p>

 We have examined many ways forward along those lines, but so far we have come up with negative reasons, as my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton and Shepherd&#146;s Bush (Mr. Slaughter) put it, as to why that is not a practical way to proceed. As I have said, I have asked my officials to continue examining the matter. We had consulted on the basis for a per-plane tax, but after careful consideration we decided not to proceed&#151;our reasons are outlined in more detail in the document. I therefore ask the hon.

 This has been a wide-ranging and extremely helpful debate on amendment 1, and we have heard from a significant number of diverse speakers on a number of different topics. A number of common themes emerged, the main one being the unworkability of the Government&#146;s clause and schedule that we are discussing. The hon. Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington spoke passionately and with great knowledge, making powerful points about Caribbean communities and the need to have a more environmental basis to this taxation that I had also made. The hon. Member for Taunton (Mr. Browne) also made a number of important points about the crudeness of schedules 5 and 5A, as well as a number of more general points with which Conservative Members agree.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o182"><a name="90708-0011.htm_para3"><a name="09070881000467">The hon. Member for Walthamstow (Mr. Gerrard) commented on the actual distance flown, which I know we discussed at the meeting of the all-party group on the Caribbean. I was interested in the Minister&#146;s response that she is looking at ways of reforming the Chicago convention. I would be grateful if she could update the House, at an appropriate time, on how those negotiations are proceeding. My hon. Friend the Member for Wellingborough (Mr. Bone) made similar points about the Caribbean and India, well illustrated with a letter from his constituent, one of the 60,000 people who have signed the petition and written to their MPs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o183"><a name="90708-0011.htm_para4"><a name="09070881000468">The reasons given for rejecting the plane tax amendment are flimsy, as we have seen from the Minister&#146;s response and the Government&#146;s consultation document. We can have no confidence in the Government&#146;s reasoning, which shows a confused logic on whether this is an environmental tax or purely revenue-raising. Several hon. Members raised serious concerns about the particulars and the generality of the Government&#146;s proposals, and we would urge a rethink before it is too late. Having said that, we had a Division on this matter in Committee and we are not minded to do so again today, given that we are already two hours into today&#146;s proceedings and there are several more groups on the amendment paper.

 I am delighted once again to make the case for bingo and speak out against the Government&#146;s damaging tax increases. We discussed this only a few weeks ago, on 13 May, and I have reread the report of the debate. The then Exchequer Secretary said:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o188"><a name="90708-0011.htm_para9"><a name="09070881000476">She was right. It encapsulated every one of the arguments that surround this issue. The hon. Member for Hammersmith and Fulham (Mr. Hands) made an important contribution to that debate, especially given the circumstances of the last week. I shall return to that point later.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o189"><a name="90708-0011.htm_para10"><a name="09070881000477">Before I make my argument in detail, I want to say how astonished I was last week when the bingo sector held a demonstration in Old Palace Yard. It was a bright, noisy, colourful demonstration, and it will probably be the first and last time that I ever see people travelling from Caerphilly and Bristol, together with Caribbean dancing girls, to protest against Government tax proposals. Those people had come from around the country, not to represent the interests of the bingo companies, but to express the passion that communities have for their bingo clubs and their desire to protect them. I was delighted that many hon. Members attended the demonstration, including the hon. Member for Llanelli (Nia Griffith). Unfortunately she voted with the Government on 13 May, but I hope that now she has seen her bingo club players and the Plaid Cymru candidate at the demonstration, she will change her mind tonight. That would be very helpful, and it would be welcomed by the many women who made the six-hour journey to attend that demonstration last week. I am sure that they will pay great attention to how the hon. Lady and many of her colleagues vote tonight.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o190"><a name="90708-0011.htm_para11"><a name="09070881000478">The key point of principle in this debate was clearly laid out on 13 May. It concerns the unfairness of taxation levels on bingo in comparison with other forms of gambling. Online bingo, casinos and poker are taxed at 15 per cent. Online sports betting is taxed at 15 per cent., as is sports betting in a betting shop. The football pools and betting exchanges are also taxed at 15 per cent. Only casinos are taxed differently&#151;on a sliding scale between 15 and 50 per cent., but I am reliably informed that if bingo clubs were taxed on the same basis as casinos, each and every one&#151;without exception&#151;would pay tax at 15 per cent. We need some fairness, and to avoid bingo being uniquely taxed at 22 per cent.</p>

 I visited Mecca bingo in Taunton on Friday and met many people who, in the past, may have considered voting Labour, although I suspect that they will not do so in future. The hon. Gentleman mentioned revenue. I am told that Mecca bingo will pay some &#163;10 million a year more as a result of being taxed at 22 per cent. rather than 15 per cent. To put that in context, &#163;10 million is the additional borrowing that the Government run up every half an hour.

<p><a name="stpa_o193"><a name="90708-0012.htm_para0"><a name="09070881000489">That is vital, because the Government argue that the sector will benefit from the removal of VAT with an increase in gross profits tax to 22 per cent. The sector and I, however, will argue that that is false because the rulings that we have had so far would tend to indicate that the Government were never entitled to levy the tax or collect that revenue in the first place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o194"><a name="90708-0012.htm_para1"><a name="09070881000490">I do not want to pre-judge the appeal, but as the Government have lost the first two rounds&#151;the VAT and duties tribunal and the original High Court case&#151;it appears to me that there is no certainty that the Court of Appeal will come to a different decision next time round. That means that we are voting on a point of principle about unfairness and, more important, on the impact of the rise of GPT from 15 per cent. to 22 per cent. on bingo clubs, communities, jobs and tax yield. I would argue, given what we have seen in the recent history of the bingo sector, that the implications of that tax have the potential, at least, to be pretty nasty in communities around the country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o195"><a name="90708-0012.htm_para2"><a name="09070881000491">Let us gently remind ourselves that the sector provides good quality community facilities and safe environments, mainly for women, in mainly working-class communities. The bingo companies invest in the clubs in those communities. That entertainment and investment might well be lost if, as we have seen, more clubs over and above the 40 that have closed recently close in the next few years. The sector provides employment and, again, the jobs are mainly based in working-class communities. If those jobs are lost now, with unemployment rising, employment falling and vacancies coming down massively, those lost jobs might be lost for good. The Government&#146;s old argument was that people who lost their jobs in bingo clubs could find new jobs elsewhere, but that becomes less valid as each day passes, as unemployment rises and as the number of vacancies comes down. We have already lost 4,000 jobs.</p>

The bingo industry has long argued that it is the only form of gambling subject to double taxation, with VAT levied on participation fees and gross profits tax on the overall profits of the industry. The industry argued for some years that it should be given parity with bookmakers, casinos and the internet, where harder forms of gambling take place, with larger sums of money, yet those are not subject to double taxation. For example, when someone walks into a betting shop to place a bet on a horse race, there is no charge involved in placing that bet.</p>

We seem to be involved in a similar argument now. There appears to be a bias against the bingo industry. In Committee on 13 May we explored the arguments, which were ably outlined by the hon. Gentleman. As a consequence, the Government undertook to remove the burden of double taxation in the Bill by removing VAT on participation fees.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o203"><a name="90708-0012.htm_para10"><a name="09070881000510">Double taxation is not the only problem facing the industry. There are other issues, which have been outlined in the House previously&#151;the general economic situation, the smoking ban and other issues, which the industry accepts and which we are not using in support of that industry. The present argument is about the level of gross profits tax and the ending of double taxation&#151;the double-edged sword of increasing gross profits tax to 22 per cent., without giving the industry time to adapt to the removal of VAT on participation fees, to see where those funding streams were likely to settle. There is an argument over the figures, as the hon. Gentleman pointed out, and there is some argument about the amount of VAT raised.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o204"><a name="90708-0012.htm_para11"><a name="09070881000511">My own constituency has suffered a bingo club closure. As I mentioned in the last debate, the remaining bingo club in my constituency has a membership of more than 20,000. These are important facilities in our constituencies. They have a large membership and it is important that we keep them as an amenity. The loss of a bingo club is a huge loss to the community, particularly if it is the only bingo club in town and a large number of people have to find an alternative leisure facility or go to another town to join another bingo club if that one remains open.</p>

 I strongly agree with the hon. Gentleman. I have experienced the same thing in my constituency, in Montrose. It strikes me that there is another aspect to the argument. Anyone watching certain TV channels will notice a huge growth in online bingo. I wonder whether it is healthy for people to sit and play bingo on a computer, rather than going to the more social setting of their local club.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman makes a valid point. I am not sure that it is healthy for anybody to sit in front of a computer terminal for any length of time, whatever they are doing. That relates to what I shall say shortly when I compare bingo with other forms of gambling. As opposed to someone sitting in front of a computer terminal at home with a credit card, playing bingo in relative secrecy, people play bingo at a club in an environment that is protected, regulated and managed. People are looked after by the management of the clubs, which by and large is good.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o206"><a name="90708-0012.htm_para13"><a name="09070881000515">As the hon. Member for Dundee, East, mentioned, gross profits tax has increased from 15 to 22 per cent. That is a 46 per cent. increase in GPT. Even without going into the mathematics&#151;even just looking at that increase&#151;one can say that the fact that there was a 46 per cent. increase in GPT after VAT was removed tends to suggest that there was some compensating on the part of the Government. With that substantial increase, they are giving with one hand and taking back with the other.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o207"><a name="90708-0012.htm_para14"><a name="09070881000516">It is on the VAT and GPT figures that the industry and the Government have once again parted company. The Government maintained, and Ministers said in a previous debate, that the overall taxation on bingo had fallen from about 34 per cent. to about 26 or 27 per cent. I think that the hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster) said that it was 27 per cent., taking into account other factors. The Government&#146;s estimate in the Red Book is that they will lose &#163;50 million of revenue in VAT losses, but will gain &#163;35 million from GPT, leaving a net gain to the industry of &#163;15 million. It is those figures that the industry disputes. It does not believe that those figures are accurate or sustainable. I understand that the Bingo Association has provided the Government with figures to try to show that there is a dispute about the Government&#146;s numbers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o208"><a name="90708-0012.htm_para15"><a name="09070881000517">The same end result&#151;an advantage of about &#163;15 million to the industry&#151;could be achieved with a much lower rate of GPT, because the VAT receipts are lower. I have in my hand figures provided to me by the Bingo Association that demonstrate that, but I do not profess to understand everything on that piece of paper. Having surveyed 592 bingo clubs across the country, the industry is saying that if we assume a VAT rate of 17.5, and not 15, per cent., and a GPT rate of 18, and not 15, per cent., main-stage bingo would raise something like &#163;20.8 million in VAT. Interval bingo would raise &#163;39.8 million in VAT. There would be irrecoverable VAT at &#163;21.7 million. That would leave an overall VAT figure of &#163;38.9 million, balanced by GPT figures of &#163;23.3 million. That would leave a balance in favour of the industry of &#163;15.6 million. Those are the figures put forward by the industry to contradict the Government&#146;s figures in the Red Book. As I shall say later, the industry would like further consideration of the VAT and GPT figures that it has provided, because it feels that it can achieve the figures in the Red Book without such a huge hike in GPT.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o209"><a name="90708-0012.htm_para16"><a name="09070881000522">Even though the Government have halted VAT on participation fees, the industry still warns of further closures, and they are continuing. That suggests that the industry is still adversely affected by the changes to the taxation regime: it still hurts the industry to the point that more clubs are closing down. That suggests in turn that the industry&#146;s figures might be right and the Government&#146;s optimistic, because it is generally agreed that the Red Book VAT receipts figure of &#163;50 million is something of an estimate. It is not that well defined. Perhaps the Government could look at the figure again, with the industry, to see whether there is a way forward.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o210"><a name="90708-0012.htm_para17"><a name="09070881000523">The industry maintains that it is more heavily taxed than other forms of gambling, as the hon. Member for Dundee, East said. His amendment seeks to retain GPT at 15 per cent. to maintain that parity, and he made a strong argument for it. Again, he mentioned casino GPT, which is on a sliding scale. If that were applied to bingo clubs, it would give all bingo clubs an effective rate of 15 per cent., because of the banding that applies to the casinos.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o211"><a name="90708-0012.htm_para18"><a name="09070881000524">The hon. Gentleman went through the reasons why we should support bingo, and I shall quickly touch on them to reinforce them, yet again, on behalf of our constituents. It is a softer form of gambling than others, such as internet gambling, casinos and so on, and it is attractive predominantly to women. Many women enjoy going to bingo clubs in groups, and sometimes with their husbands or whoever. They feel safe, it is a protected environment, they are looked after, and they cannot gamble too much of their money away. Daytime bingo sessions are sometimes the only entertainment that elderly members of our communities get in the week, and people very much look forward to going out with friends to enjoy bingo in the afternoons and so on. Those are often social occasions, and bingo clubs are a social amenity, but once they are gone there is little alternative other than, as the right hon. Member for Suffolk, Coastal (Mr. Gummer) said, online bingo in front of a computer screen, daytime TV or whatever.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o212"><a name="90708-0012.htm_para19"><a name="09070881000525">Let us compare bingo with forms of gambling that are unregulated and not subject to the same regime, such as internet gambling, poker and in-play betting. I am not opposed to in-play betting, but we see adverts in the middle of a football match and we can imagine them playing in a public house, where at half time someone comes on saying, &#147;Bet in play. You can bet on the next corner, goal or booking&#148;. If drink is involved and lads are watching a football match, a lot of money could be spent over the telephone betting, yet we are not doing anything about that form of gambling. We are, however, coming down pretty hard on bingo, and allowing closures to take place that affect a very soft form of gambling.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o213"><a name="90708-0013.htm_para0"><a name="09070881000526">I now turn to the amendments. Obviously, I support and have added my name to amendment 4, tabled by the hon. Member for Dundee, East, which would return bingo to parity with other forms of gambling and retain the 15 per cent. rate. I think that it was the hon. Member for Wellingborough (Mr. Bone) who referred to casinos, and the amount of money gambled in casinos is vast. We read in the newspapers stories of people losing tens of thousands of pounds in an evening in a casino, yet that will be taxed at 15 per cent. Bingo is a relatively modest form of gambling, yet that taxation is going up to 22 per cent. Where is the logic? The rate of tax on a form of gambling for the rich and privileged is lower than that on a very soft form of gambling for predominantly working-class people. I cannot see the logic of that. If we are to tax any gambling at 22 per cent., it should be the harder forms, including the gambling done at casinos.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o214"><a name="90708-0013.htm_para1"><a name="09070881000527">Amendment 22 would make bingo duty chargeable at 16 per cent. rather than 22 per cent., while amendment 23 would make bingo duty chargeable at 17 per cent. I should have tabled a further amendment to make it chargeable at 18 per cent., because the figures provided by the bingo industry are based on a GPT figure of 18 per cent. The industry says that, on the basis of its figures, an increase in bingo duty to 18 per cent. would provide the same amount of money as that suggested in the Red Book.

Through my amendments, I am inviting the Government to reconsider the figures, perhaps with the industry. They should consider a rate of 18 per cent., 17.5 per cent. or whatever. They should also look at the VAT figures suggested by the industry and the VAT returns, and get a more accurate prediction of how the bingo industry will be affected by the changes. The Government should try to determine a rate acceptable to the industry, to Members of the House and to our constituents. That would probably mean an end to the closures.</p>

There is room for negotiation with the industry, to find out the true figures for the irrecoverable VAT and the returns from GPT. I hope that the Government will consider the amendments and the bingo industry figures, which I feel they have in their possession. I hope that they will think again.</p>

However, I should not be imposing my views on the rest of the population. Clearly, large numbers of people get great pleasure from forms of gambling that do minimum harm, and I would have thought that bingo was one of them.</p>

In casinos, for example, people with more money than sense waste it in a way that is probably socially undesirable. Would it not be much better to increase the tax on casinos and decrease the tax on bingo? That seems an extremely logical argument&#151;so logical that it is difficult to understand why the Government have not accepted it already. However, I have to say that the Government seem to be the most illogical I have ever had to deal with; they seem unable to see simple things in a simple manner.</p>

It employs people and provides others with something that they obviously enjoy and choose to enjoy. Why on earth should they pay more for that enjoyment than people who go off to Aspinalls and other such gathering places and watering holes? There is an innate snobbishness in this Government.

I cannot believe that she really wants to subsidise the people who can afford to go to casinos by charging more to the people who go to bingo clubs, and yet she has been defending a change in the taxation system that means that the poorest people are subsiding those who are richer.

I do not like bullies of any kind; I want to stand up for the bullied rather than the bullies. This Government are constantly standing up for the people who can stand up for themselves, and not standing up for those who cannot. That is why I stand up for a lot of people whose enthusiasm I do not share, in the belief that they should be able to have it and be protected by this House in doing so. We should not only try to ensure that they pay the same level of duty as on other forms of betting but suggest that it might even be a comparatively lower one.</p>

I do not think the Government have ever really come to terms with some of the by-blows of their decision on smoking in public places. As an enthusiast for the environment, I am fed up with the fact that we have increased emissions in this country caused by outdoor heating that enables people to smoke outside pubs because nobody was prepared to take the sensible view that a room where no one was serving could be put aside for those who wanted to smoke. No, that could not be done&#151;that was against the theology of the policy&#151;so now we warm the heavens in order that people can smoke outside.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o222"><a name="90708-0013.htm_para9"><a name="09070881000538">We must also face the fact that the smoking ban has had a direct effect on bingo clubs. I rather like a former Home Secretary who got into terrible trouble for suggesting that the ban would affect his poorest constituents most. I am not arguing that case again; I am merely saying that it has had a real effect on areas where people with limited means, and often with homes that are less comfortable than those of the Exchequer Secretary and her ministerial colleagues, gather together somewhere warm, pleasant and light where they can enjoy themselves. Now they cannot smoke, which may be good for them, but if we are also going to tax them heavily on their bingo because that might be good for them, that is an aspect of the nanny state that I could well do without.</p>

The taxation should therefore at least be fair, which argues for a lower rate than forms of gambling that only people with greater resources can indulge in.</p>

If the measure goes ahead, there will be bingo online. The right hon. Member for Suffolk, Coastal (Mr. Gummer) could not have introduced that issue better or more colourfully. Casino online and poker online, sports betting in betting shops, betting exchanges and football pools will all end up with 15 per cent. tax, though that does not apply to casinos. Yet bingo will face tax of 22 per cent. That is not fair.</p>

We speak passionately in the House about the leisure facilities that we would like afforded to our young people. We focus on that appropriately. However, there are not many discussions in the House about the leisure facilities that we should support for our elderly. Indeed, I do not think that I have ever heard a discussion in the House about that. We have talked about free bus travel, which is excellent, but we are considering a leisure activity. I am talking about 400 to 500 people who twice a week go to a pleasing environment, where they meet up&#151;it is very sociable&#151;eat a good meal for a reasonable price and thoroughly enjoy the afternoon or evening.

Again, the right hon.

For me, therefore, bingo is a critical bit of kit.</p>

Bingo is an easy piece of the employment world for women to fit in with their families or their age, perhaps because their levels of activity are much more controllable in that environment than they would be in many others. We are talking about a particular group of women. They do not earn a fortune, but they earn enough to make life bearable. However, it is not just that those employed in bingo are women. Oftentimes, Mecca Bingo&#151;and, I am sure, other organisations&#151;give training. Youngsters get national vocational qualification opportunities.</p>

again; indeed, the whole House will appreciate it. Bingo is a small part of leisure activities overall and it will produce a small amount of money for the Treasury. However, that amount will be smaller if there are further club closures on top of the 90 clubs that have closed so far. Surely spending that small amount is worth while given that so many people enjoy so much from the activity.</p>

We cannot see any reasonable or logical justification for bingo to be taxed at 22 per cent. while the remainder of the gaming industry is generally taxed at 15 per cent. We would like the anomaly to be rectified as soon as time and the public finances allow it. However, rather like the hon. Member for Barnsley, Central (Mr. Illsley), we have found it incredibly difficult to get any sense out of the Treasury about its figures on either bingo or the ongoing court case, the consideration of which formed the centrepiece of our amendment in the Committee of the whole House, which took place two months and two Exchequer Secretaries ago.</p>

What is most perverse, however, is that online bingo is charged at 15 per cent., yet bingo in a club, which has so many desirable social outcomes, for all the reasons so adequately pointed out by the hon.

 I thank my hon. Friend for that intervention. We touched on that issue in the debate on clause 114, which covers the duty on online gaming. As was pointed out, there is now an incredible anomaly, in that playing online bingo will now attract far less tax. Surely we should all recognise the social benefits of bingo clubs for their clientele.

standard form of the game&#151;was some &#163;20 million. In one of her few acts during her short-lived nine-day reign in the Treasury, the hon. Member for Burnley (Kitty Ussher), the current Minister&#146;s immediate predecessor, added on 10 June that the cost of removing VAT on interval bingo&#151;the newer form that the High Court ruled on in the VAT tribunal case&#151;was some &#163;25 million. That adds up to a total of &#163;45 million. As I said in the Public Bill Committee, I therefore assumed that the remaining &#163;5 million of the &#163;50 million related to participation fees on equal chance games other than bingo&#151;principally poker.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o240"><a name="90708-0013.htm_para27"><a name="09070881000564">That is the estimate relating to the &#163;50 million in the Red Book, as I see it. In any case, the estimates for 2009-10 back up the argument that I made in the debates on clauses 20 and 112 that the industry will, in practice, pay more as a result of all the measures in the Finance Bill. We are not aware of any major operator paying VAT on interval bingo and, after the court ruling, it is hard to believe that any operator would even contemplate doing so. As I have said, a number were also withholding VAT receipts on main-stage bingo, and that number is now likely to swell. It is reasonable to conclude, therefore, that actual receipts would have been below &#163;20 million for 2009-10, before the court ruling, and that they could now be zero.</p>

Unfortunately, that leaves some confusion about whether the figures revealed in written answers subsequent to the publication of the Red Book, but before the debate in the Public Bill Committee, were rounded to the nearest &#163;5 million. I think that the implication is that they were. The Minister said:</p>

We heard in previous debates that the Government&#146;s revenue figures are based on their interpretation of the law, and not on the actual sums that they have been receiving. However, bingo operators are now suggesting&#151;this was the point raised by the hon. Member for Barnsley, Central&#151;that the Government failed to account for irrevocable VAT when producing the estimates. One industry estimate&#151;we have probably seen the same estimate&#151;put the total incremental irrevocable VAT at &#163;21.7 million a year, assuming that it returns to a level of 17.5 per cent. next January. It is possible for the Exchequer Secretary to be precise&#151;we have seen it, and she wants to be precise. Therefore, I invite her to answer right now whether the Treasury accounted for the irrevocable VAT and, if it did, what was the figure&#151;preferably not rounded to the nearest &#163;5 million&#151;that applied in that case?</p>

The Minister was thus wrong to tell us that the Government had until 30 June to make a decision on the appeal. That was wrong: she had longer and she used the longer period to make the decision. As it turned out, the Government had until this week and they have now appealed, despite the Minister&#146;s assertion about the expiry date. We understand that the case will now go to the Court of Appeal.

The Government seem to think that bingo duty should by its very nature be higher than other gaming duties, but we do not see it that way. We view the 22 per cent. bingo duty as an anomaly.

In case voting for the substantive amendment sends out the wrong signal to those who think that they can get away either with anything or with unfairness, would it not be sensible to vote for the amendment proposing to put these matters off to a later day, on which we could all agree, thereby supporting the revenue and forcing the Government to be sensible?</p>

Given, however, that we have voted through clause 112, which removes VAT on bingo and is the right thing to do, I cannot agree with my right hon.

I have visited Mecca Bingo in Taunton on a number of occasions, and I was there again last Friday, speaking to staff and customers about their pastime and about the effect that the Government&#146;s taxation of bingo would have on them as individuals. I was struck yet again by just how popular this form of activity is in my constituency, and indeed in many towns and cities across the country.

for Barnsley, Central (Mr. Illsley)&#151;that it attracts older people, generally although not exclusively, and that it is more attractive to those with lower incomes than, say, visiting a casino. That is inevitably a generalisation, because we are talking about hundreds of thousands of people throughout the country who enjoy bingo, but I think it can be said that bingo is a form of gambling that is more likely to be undertaken by women, older people, and people in lower income groups. It is extraordinary that they should be targeted for a higher rate of tax than those who engage in other forms of gambling.</p>

 My hon. Friend is right. Bingo takes place in a controlled environment, and the losses that people can make are very small compared to the almost limitless losses that can be made by those who go to casinos or engage in activities such as online poker or even online bingo. It is nonsensical to tax it at a higher rate than those other activities.</p>

 I entirely agree. I think it is safe to say that online bingo, for example, is more likely to be undertaken by younger and more affluent people than those who visit bingo clubs. It does seem extraordinary that that form of bingo should be taxed at 15 per cent. while people going to clubs will be taxed at 22 per cent.</p>

 I understand that it is. Moreover, there are no controls in the case of online bingo. Although it may be in the immediate financial interests of a bingo hall to allow a particular customer to gamble beyond his or her means, I suspect that in the vast majority of cases the owners demonstrate a degree of paternalism. They have a fair sense of how much money the regular visitors have and of what it is safe and reasonable for them to spend.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o254"><a name="90708-0014.htm_para12"><a name="09070881000587">Of course, many people do not go to bingo halls just to gamble. The gambling is often almost a secondary or peripheral attraction. Many people&#146;s main reason for visiting the hall is social: they want to meet friends, and catch up on news and developments. When I visited Mecca Bingo on Friday, it was stressed to me that there were many associated attractions, such as the provision of meals and other forms of entertainment. It seems that people regard going to bingo halls as being only partly about gambling.</p>

The Government have now done that, but, as the right hon. Member for Suffolk, Coastal rightly observed, in effect they said, &#147;Here you are; we are giving to you with one hand,&#148; but just as everyone was celebrating that great victory, the Government took away the benefits with the other. The overall effect on the bingo industry and the people who enjoy playing bingo is that the current situation is no better than it was before.</p>

clubs had closed and two had opened, which meant that there had been a net reduction of 29 bingo clubs. Some associated social factors may be at play in such closures, such as generational changes and a greater desire among people to spend more of their leisure time at home. The right hon. Member for Suffolk, Coastal speculated that the smoking ban may also have had an impact in some cases. It is, however, very hard to argue against the notion that the higher tax rate on bingo is making the situation worse, and making it harder for bingo clubs to be profitable.</p>

 Is that not what makes the Government&#146;s decision to tax bingo more than other forms of gambling so odd? If their purpose is the suppression of vice, bingo is an odd target, as I am not aware of there being any particular links with organised crime, whereas if the purpose is to increase revenue, it is likely to have the opposite effect because of the consequent reduction in the size of the industry.</p>

 Absolutely, and I should like to refer to the very subject of revenue. During yesterday&#146;s debate, we talked about beer duty. The problem in that regard is that because more and more pubs are going out of business on account of beer duty going up, the base from which the Government are collecting revenue is therefore falling. That is the case with bingo as well. If there is only one bingo club in a town&#151;a seaside resort, let us say&#151;and it is no longer profitable and therefore closes, the customers do not have an alternative place to take their custom. Many of them are unlikely to gamble online, and even if they did so, they would be taxed at a lower rate. The Government therefore forgo revenue as a result of that club closing.</p>

 Has not the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath) given the clue to this? He says that the purpose may be the suppression of vice. He will, no doubt, remember that in the 19th century there was a Society for the Suppression of Vice and people added to its title, &#147;For those with an income of less than &#163;5,000 a year,&#148; because it was not interested in that cause otherwise. This Government have, therefore, carried on a noble 19th century tradition.</p>

 Let me return to that theme in my concluding remarks, because that is an interesting observation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o257"><a name="90708-0014.htm_para15"><a name="09070881000594">As I have said, not only will the Government lose revenue when clubs close, but we should remember just how small the sums involved are. It has rightly been said that the total sums of money gambled on bingo are not great, so in the grand scheme of things the percentage tax take is not very significant. I am told that Mecca Bingo generates profits of only about &#163;150 million a year. Therefore, the additional tax in respect of the differential between the rate that the Government have set and the figure that would be generated were bingo taxed in line with other forms of gambling is only a matter of a few million pounds a year. When one sets that against the backdrop of a public sector deficit this year of &#163;175,000 million, it seems hard to argue that if the motivation behind this tax proposal is to plug the public finances, the Government will get very far using that particular plug.</p>

 In many ways, this is an excellent continuation of the debate that we had on 13 May. Indeed, we have heard some of the old favourites&#151;the excellent introduction by the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Stewart Hosie) and the passionate speech by the hon. Member for Barnsley, Central (Mr. Illsley). There has also been some welcome new blood in the debate&#151;not least the right hon. Member for Suffolk, Coastal (Mr. Gummer), who, I suspect, will be bitterly disappointed by those on his Front Bench in a few minutes when we come to vote.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o272"><a name="90708-0015.htm_para4"><a name="09070888000022">Two things have been a common theme in the debate this evening. First, there is total incomprehension among people on both sides of the House of what the Government are proposing to do about bingo. Not a single person so far has spoken in support of what they advocate, whereas there has been a great deal of support for the variety of amendments before us. Secondly, it has come across loud and clear that not only do people oppose what the Government are doing but there is genuine passion for recognising the importance of bingo clubs in our communities and supporting them. Everyone who has spoken has shown understanding of the importance of what the roughly 600 bingo clubs provide in our communities. They provide much-loved entertainment&#151;largely, as my hon. Friend the Member for Taunton (Mr. Browne), who spoke from our Front Bench, has pointed out, for women, older people and people who are less well off. As we have all said, it is crucial to try to maintain that soft form of gambling so that we do not drive people into much harder forms.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o273"><a name="90708-0015.htm_para5"><a name="09070888000023">The other thing that has come out in the debate is the fact that there is some surprise at the Government&#146;s incompetence as regards getting the figures right. Let us look, as many have done already, at page 153 of the Red Book. It is very clear what the Government think will happen. There is the very welcome removal of VAT on participation&#151;incidentally, may I be the only one to pay tribute today to the Government for helping bingo by increasing the number of machines that clubs can have? However, that removal of VAT, the Government  <br>

claim, will save the industry &#163;50 million in the first year rising to 60 million in 2011-12. The bingo industry will then lose, through the increase in bingo duty, from 15 to 22 per cent. Many people have pointed out that those figures are meant to be an estimate; frankly, they are total fantasy. We know what is happening as a result of the Government&#146;s loss at the EU tribunal in respect of duty on interval bingo, gaming bingo and so on. Many of the companies are not paying that duty. The Government&#146;s figures are way out of order.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o274"><a name="90708-0015.htm_para6"><a name="09070888000024">We have not yet had an answer to the question that the hon. Member for Hammersmith and Fulham (Mr. Hands) asked the Minister about whether the Government have taken account of irrecoverable VAT, but on the assumption that they have not, which I suspect is the case, that is a further example of the figures being way out of line.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o275"><a name="90708-0015.htm_para7"><a name="09070888000025">The Government have done something that is incomprehensible because it will cause further damage to the bingo industry. Thirty clubs have closed in the past year, and more than twice as many since 2007. Only last week Gala, one of the major companies, announced that a further five clubs would close, and it explained to the Treasury that that was largely because of the taxation issue. No one can understand why the Government are doing something that could be so damaging to something so loved by people in our communities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o276"><a name="90708-0015.htm_para8"><a name="09070888000026">The right hon. Member for Suffolk, Coastal, among others, made it clear that there is another matter about which there is total incomprehension. Why have the Government failed to grasp the nettle of dealing with the different issues raised by the various forms of gambling in this country? Soft forms of gambling like bingo lead to very little addiction, but the harder forms like online gambling lead to high levels of addiction. Why can we not have a differential taxation policy, with a lower rate for soft forms of gambling and a higher one for the harder forms?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o277"><a name="90708-0015.htm_para9"><a name="09070888000027">My hon. Friend the Member for Taunton was wrong about one thing. He said that online bingo was taxed at 15 per cent., but the truth is that it is rarely taxed at all, because the vast bulk of it is run through offshore websites that pay no tax in this country. Even if they are subject to European Economic Area regulation, or whitelisting, they do not contribute to the process. They certainly do not make any contribution, as they should, to the costs of research, education and treatment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o278"><a name="90708-0015.htm_para10"><a name="09070888000028">We need a differential tax regime. We certainly should not put the tax up to 22 per cent.; it should stay at 15 per cent. As the protesters in Trafalgar square and Westminster said recently, &#147;One and five, keep bingo alive!&#148;</p>

The principal aim has been to simplify bingo taxation; as we know, the industry has been asking for that for many years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o280"><a name="90708-0015.htm_para12"><a name="09070888000031">Alongside the removal of VAT on bingo in this Budget, the bingo duty rate of 22 per cent. represents a reduction from a level of around 35 per cent. in 2003. We have to look at the effective tax rate which, on a comparable basis, was estimated at 24 to 25 per cent. before the Budget. The basis of that estimate was explained in some detail to the industry, which accepted it in correspondence with the Treasury before the Budget. However, the industry has since argued that the Red Book costing of the removal of VAT from gambling participation fees was wrong.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o281"><a name="90708-0015.htm_para13"><a name="09070888000032">Some hon. Members have mentioned the High Court case. We have made it clear in previous debates that costings were based on the law as it stood at the time of the Budget. Key assumptions in the costings came directly from information provided by the industry, so they are not a fantasy. That information from the industry included detailed modelling on the impact of extra irrecoverable VAT, as well as detailed information from smaller clubs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o282"><a name="90708-0015.htm_para14"><a name="09070888000033">I have listened carefully to the concerns expressed by hon. Members today and in Committee, and I have read the transcript of the debate in the Committee of the whole House. I recognise the importance of bingo to local communities that has been pointed out by all those who have spoken this afternoon, and that is why we acted to simplify the regime, removing VAT and lowering the effective tax rate to 22 per cent. That is down from the 35 per cent. that was in place as recently as 2003, and it is below the 24 to 25 per cent. range in the pre-Budget report. Let me stress again that that figure was agreed with the industry at the time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o283"><a name="90708-0015.htm_para15"><a name="09070888000034">That is not all that we have done. The Gambling Act 2005 removed the 24-hour rule and the old membership requirements. It also allowed bingo operators for the first time to retain stakes, to be paid out as prizes at a later date. The bingo sector has also benefited from changes to gaming machine law, so it is not true that we are not helping it&#151;and of course, the help that we are giving is ongoing. Despite my short tenure in this post, I have already met representatives of the industry, and that consultation will be ongoing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o284"><a name="90708-0015.htm_para16"><a name="09070888000035">All taxes are kept under review, but decisions are taken in the round at PBR and Budget time. All the amendments before us today would cost money&#151;up to &#163;35 million a year, depending on the amendment. That would have to be found from tax increases elsewhere or cuts in public expenditure.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o285"><a name="90708-0015.htm_para17"><a name="09070888000036">I will continue to engage with the industry. I have already asked for evidence and data from its representatives on the points that they have raised, some of which has been received and some of which we still await. The information will be rigorously analysed, as hon. Members would no doubt want us to ensure that the figures are accurate. We can assure hon. Members that we will continue to have discussions on the state of the sector and the impact of taxation in the run-up to the next PBR and Budget. I am afraid I cannot support any of today&#146;s amendments, but on my assurance that we will continue to work with the industry, I ask hon. Members to withdraw their amendments.</p>

 We have had a good debate again. We should have these bingo debates more often. They seem to engender real information and real passion from real Members from real communities, which is always a good thing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o286"><a name="90708-0015.htm_para18"><a name="09070888000038">The hon. Member for Barnsley, Central (Mr. Illsley) delivered another excellent defence of bingo clubs and communities, and an excoriating critique of the Government&#146;s assessment of the proposed tax changes. The right hon. Member for Suffolk, Coastal (Mr. Gummer) deduced that the Government have a new doctrine&#151;to tax the poor to help the rich. The hon. Member for Stockton, South (Ms Taylor) made a gentle and thoughtful speech, and rightly made the case that the Government should think again.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o287"><a name="90708-0015.htm_para19"><a name="09070888000039">The hon. Member for Hammersmith and Fulham (Mr. Hands) was right to say that there was no justification for a 22 per cent. tax on bingo. He knows that the Government&#146;s VAT assessment is flawed. We have just heard the weakest defence of it from the Minister in her summing up. The hon. Member for Hammersmith and Fulham knows that it is likely that the Revenue was never entitled to levy the tax in the first place, he knows that it takes cognisance, wrongly, of irrecoverable tax. He must not be conned by the Government&#146;s attempt to obfuscate. It will be shameful if the Conservative Front-Bench spokesman refuses to back one of the amendments today, when the only person supporting him is the Government Whip. That is how bad the Tory Front-Bench position has become.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o288"><a name="90708-0015.htm_para20"><a name="09070888000040">The hon. Member for Taunton (Mr. Browne) drew attention to the sheer staggering ineptitude of the Government in not seeing the trouble coming down the track. He was right. He also said with some sympathy that the Minister had been given an impossible hand to play. The hon. Member for Wellingborough (Mr. Bone) spoke about the Flutters bingo club in Rushden. I feel as though I have been in it; the description was so intense and detailed. I am delighted that he said that he would support the amendment. The hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster) was right to say that not one speaker backed the Government in the debate, either today or on 13 May, and he expressed total incomprehension of the Government&#146;s actions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o289"><a name="90708-0015.htm_para21"><a name="09070888000041">The Minister said that the effective tax rate for bingo had fallen. I am not convinced. Even if that is true, I am convinced that it leaves a profound unfairness&#151;22 per cent. as opposed to 15 per cent. across the board. The only question is whether I should ask that we delay this for a year, or whether we should stick to the principle of fairness in the entire gaming sector. I think we must stick with the principle. I hope the Tories will find some principle in the next two minutes, and I seek leave to press amendment 4 to a Division.</p>

 Clause 25 creates a legal framework to enable any institution that has taken part in the arrangements set out in subsection (2) voluntarily to waive its tax losses. The clause was required to deal with the particular situation of the Royal Bank of Scotland, which agreed to forgo a certain element of its tax losses  <br>

as part of its agreement to enter the asset protection scheme. Interestingly, the Government chose to encourage it to forgo its tax losses rather than some of the tax planning activities that the bank carries out on behalf of its customers. I am sure that the Government will be able to justify that later.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o292"><a name="90708-0016.htm_para0"><a name="09070888000422">This framework has been put in place to deal with the price that RBS will pay to go into the asset protection scheme. It is worth noting that when I tabled a parliamentary question asking about the amount of losses that RBS would forgo, the Economic Secretary gave a vaguely worded answer that rather suggested that no one quite knew. Of course the reason for that is that the agreement on the APS is yet to be signed. It may be some months before that happens, and I suspect that the losses to be forgone will not be finalised until that point.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o293"><a name="90708-0016.htm_para1"><a name="09070888000423">However, my concern is not so much that RBS has agreed to enter into the APS at a price&#151;that is a deal struck between it and the Government&#151;but about the breadth of clause 25. Subsection (2) creates a situation whereby if a company enters into an arrangement with any Government Department&#151;not just the Treasury&#151;it can forgo its tax losses if there are any guarantees, indemnities or payments. That potentially covers a wide range of schemes. It may cover the guarantees offered to the automotive sector for loans it is seeking from the European Investment Bank. Under subsection (2)(b)(iv), even the scrappage scheme may be covered, as it contains the phrase</p>
<a name="90708-0016.htm_brev0"><a name="09070888000531"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;gives other financial support or assistance to P or another person (whether in money or otherwise).&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o294"><a name="90708-0016.htm_para2"><a name="09070888000424">So even an arrangement in kind could create a situation whereby a company could agree with the Government that in return for such assistance it would forgo its tax losses.</p>

<p><a name="st_o298"><a name="09070888000425"><a name="90708-0016.htm_spnew1"><a name="09070888000924"><b>Mr. Redwood:</b>
 Perhaps my hon. Friend will permit me to go back to RBS. Is he aware that although it would be good news in future if the company had to pay more corporation tax, at the point of sale of the shares back into the private sector taxpayers would get a lot less money because they would get the tax losses forgone knocked off a rather big multiple? This gives rise to a rather difficult situation relating to whether taxpayer value is being protected.</p>

 My right hon. Friend, who has a great deal of experience in the City, makes an important point that we did not touch on in Committee: what is the value of the losses forgone, and how will they be valued in the market? That is a point to bear in mind for the future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o295"><a name="90708-0016.htm_para3"><a name="09070888000427">As I said, my concern is not so much about RBS as about the breadth of the scheme. My amendment would narrow its breadth by tying it back to the Banking Act 2009, which the Economic Secretary and I spent many happy hours debating in Committee. I sought to link my amendment back to the part of the Act that relates to the provision of financial assistance. That would narrow the range of events in which a company could forgo tax losses to those that relate to any banking bail-outs. That would cover RBS in the context of the APS, but it would not cover, for example, guarantees from the Government for loans made to the automotive sector from the EIB.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o296"><a name="90708-0016.htm_para4"><a name="09070888000428">That is the rationale behind my amendment. When we debated this in Committee with the first of the three Exchequer Secretaries that we had to deal with during the course of our proceedings, the hon. Member for Wallasey (Angela Eagle) said:</p>
<a name="90708-0016.htm_brev1"><a name="09070888000532"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;This is a narrow provision and must be agreed between the company that is asking for support and HMT.

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o297"><a name="90708-0016.htm_para5"><a name="09070888000429">My amendment would make it narrow from the outset and limit the range of transactions that could be entered into that could lead to a firm giving up its tax losses. That would make it much clearer what the clause is meant to do, and potentially protect companies from undue pressure being placed on them by the Treasury and other Departments to forgo their tax losses in return for a particular scheme or set of arrangements that the Treasury or other Department might wish to encourage them to enter into.</p>

<p><a name="st_o300"><a name="09070888000430"><a name="90708-0016.htm_spmin0"><a name="09070888000926"><b>The Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Ian Pearson):</b>
 Clause 25 ensures that an agreement reached between a company and the Treasury will be effective for tax purposes if the company relinquishes its right to use tax losses as part of an agreement to access Government financial assistance. The clause will apply to arrangements forming part of an agreement under the asset protection scheme but, as the hon. Member for Fareham (Mr. Hoban) noted, it could be used in other situations, particularly if Government assistance is required to maintain financial stability and restore confidence. It is essential that when such an agreement is reached, we have provision in tax law for the agreement to have the intended effect.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o298"><a name="90708-0016.htm_para6"><a name="09070888000431">As the hon. Gentleman pointed out, the amendment is intended to limit the scope of the clause to arrangements made in accordance with section 257 of the Banking Act 2009, thus making implementation of the clause subject to the laying of a statutory instrument. It is similar in purpose to amendments that he tabled in Committee.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o299"><a name="90708-0016.htm_para7"><a name="09070888000432">On the technical aspects of the amendment, it has been pointed out previously that a statutory instrument would delay the resolution of the terms of any agreement, which could reduce rather than boost market confidence. If a company&#146;s agreement to give up its losses were contingent on subsequent parliamentary approval, there would need to be provision in the agreement itself to revisit its terms if that approval were not given. Such terms would mean that the agreement would not have the necessary certainty to achieve its aim of restoring confidence and stability to the markets.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o300"><a name="90708-0016.htm_para8"><a name="09070888000433">The hon. Gentleman made the point that he wanted to narrow the scope of the clause. It is important to bear in mind that it can apply only if a company has agreed to relinquish its losses and if that agreement is pursuant to the company&#146;s accessing financial assistance from the Government. He referred to comments that have been made previously about a potential paradox, in that the clause may be seen to be necessarily wide-ranging but will be applied only in narrow circumstances. We believe that limiting the scope of the clause is unnecessary, and that the resulting extra layer of scrutiny would be  <br>

potentially destabilising. It may mean that deals would need to be struck with absolute certainty and in a very short time scale.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o301"><a name="90708-0016.htm_para9"><a name="09070888000434">My experience of Governments is that they tend to prefer cash to an agreement on tax losses. It would be up to a company that wanted financial assistance to agree voluntarily to relinquish its taxes, and it would be up to the Government to agree that that was in the best interests of taxpayers. In the normal scheme of events, Governments would much prefer to have cash than tax losses, so I do not believe that the clause will be used substantially. When it is necessary to use it in future, it will be right to do so. The amendment would unnecessarily restrict it and be potentially destabilising in the circumstances in which it is likely to be used. For those reasons, I ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw it.</p>

 I am not entirely convinced by the argument about the delays that would be caused by agreeing a statutory instrument. If the Economic Secretary looks back over the history of the past few months, he will see that the Government have taken action to deal with Bradford &amp; Bingley and the Dunfermline building society, for example, and taken measures that require statutory instruments to be approved. They have gone ahead with that quite happily, but now they claim that they cannot act without a statutory instrument that the House of Commons has approved. It is not the Government&#146;s strongest argument.</p>

We must, therefore, be wary of Ministers&#146; reassurances. However, in this case I will take them at face value. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

way&#151;by direct recovery of funds, plea bargaining before passing papers to the prosecuting authorities, or a variety of civil actions, which HMRC increasingly takes as a substitute for criminal sanction. That gives us pause for thought. There is currently no clear policy for applying those sanctions, many are much more serious penalties than those in criminal law, and they are applied without due process&#151;without being put before a court.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o325"><a name="90708-0016.htm_para33"><a name="09070888000462">I therefore contend that people who interact with HMRC in that way need to know that the rules are applied equitably and fairly across the piece, how HMRC will interpret its extensive powers, and what they can expect from HMRC. I want to illustrate that with a particular case of a company in my constituency, which involves the vexed question of carousel fraud. I do not want to spend time explaining the intricacies of carousel fraud, which is a complex form of VAT fraud, working across international boundaries. We could spend much time discussing the details of that. That is not my purpose; rather, my purpose is to address the way in which HMRC chooses to deal with companies that it suspects of having been involved in carousel fraud.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o326"><a name="90708-0016.htm_para34"><a name="09070888000463">The company with which I have had dealings in this respect is Third Dimension Ltd in Milborne Port. It deals in a commodity in which, in HMRC&#146;s view, companies involved in carousel fraud trade&#151;namely, mobile phones&#151;and provides a platform for the international market via the internet, enabling traders to trade across international boundaries in the mobile phone market.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o327"><a name="90708-0016.htm_para35"><a name="09070888000464">I have no truck with fraudsters. I want those involved in fraud to be interdicted and prosecuted. I certainly do not believe that fraud&#151;either against the individual or, in the case of VAT, against the state&#151;is a victimless crime. It is not, and I have always argued in this House that we should take it extremely seriously and impose appropriate sanctions. My constituents feel exactly the same way and they have expressed that view to me. They certainly do not want people getting away with VAT fraud.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o328"><a name="90708-0016.htm_para36"><a name="09070888000465">I also ought to say that I am neither a forensic accountant nor a VAT expert. If anyone asks me difficult questions, I will probably not know the answers, because we are dealing with a complex area. However, I have dealt with the criminal justice system over many years in this House and my gut feeling is that there is something inherently wrong with the system that seems to have developed, in that everybody who has any connection with a particular area of trading is treated as though they were guilty and has sanctions applied to them irrespective of any evidence of guilt.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o329"><a name="90708-0016.htm_para37"><a name="09070888000466">Indeed, one difficultly has already arisen in the courts in respect of how HMRC has interpreted its brief. The Financial Secretary will know of the Livewire judgment before the High Court chancery division, which has fundamentally undermined HMRC&#146;s assumption that every trader in that area is tainted by fraud, not least because of the observations of Mr. Justice Lewison. He looked at the previous case that was relevant&#151;the Kittel case, with which I am sure the Minister is also familiar. In particular, he looked carefully at the translation from French to English, which is a pretty rudimentary matter. His observation was that HMRC&#146;s incorrect translation changed the emphasis to</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o331"><a name="90708-0017.htm_para0"><a name="09070888000468">HMRC misinterpreted the Kittel case, assuming that anybody with a passing connection with the trade was necessarily up for involvement, rather than applying the higher burden of proof implied in the original French of the Kittel judgment, which requires evidence of direct involvement. That case is now being challenged in the European Court of Justice and we may have a ruling in due course. Irrespective of that judgment, however, surely we do not allow collective punishment in British law for the crimes of a person or persons unknown, yet that appears to be how HMRC currently operates.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o332"><a name="90708-0017.htm_para1"><a name="09070888000469">Since early 2006, HMRC has adopted what is described as an extended verification process for every trader involved in the industry, which means that it has effectively ceased paying VAT input tax refunds. A substantial amount of money is being withheld and we are now in the third year of withholding it. This has been done by a deliberately extended process, in my view. First, there is a delay in responding to requests for refunds. At the very point at which that matter reaches judicial review&#151;sometimes only a matter of hours beforehand&#151;there is a denial, which results in a further delay before a tribunal can consider the matter. That is followed by an HMRC appeal. That is a deliberate policy to withhold funds that are legally in the ownership of the companies, without judicial process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o333"><a name="90708-0017.htm_para2"><a name="09070888000470">When such cases have got as far as the tribunal or the High Court in chancery, there have been mixed results for the companies appealing. In some cases, the appeal has been upheld by both; in others, there has been a mixed result from the tribunal and the High Court; or the company has lost in both cases. I would be interested to know how much is currently withheld in relation to VAT reclaims, and how much is earmarked for eventual refund when the appeals are successful. My suspicion is that a very large amount is involved.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o334"><a name="90708-0017.htm_para3"><a name="09070888000471">The second method that HMRC has chosen to use as a means of reprisal against assumed fraud is illustrated in its dealings with overseas banks. HMRC uses its undoubted muscle to affect the way in which overseas banks are used. My constituent&#146;s company had funds held by the First Curaçao International Bank. The bank has effectively been closed down by HMRC, and the administrators have been told that they must not allow any funds to be given to those who have funds invested in the bank. No charges have been brought against the bank, under British jurisdiction or any other; this is simply a case of pressure being put on it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o335"><a name="90708-0017.htm_para4"><a name="09070888000472">A list has apparently been provided to the bank&#146;s administrators of the people to whom funds may not be made available, and of anyone having dealings with those people. That is a pretty extraordinary state of affairs. Those people have not been brought before any court. They have not been found guilty of any crime, yet they have had their funds frozen on suspicion and, in the case of the First Curaçao International Bank, in a foreign jurisdiction. I am led to believe that, in this context, we are talking about billions of pounds in funds held by companies, many of which must be innocent of any fraud.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o336"><a name="90708-0017.htm_para5"><a name="09070888000473">The third instance of intervention is the pressure that has been applied to UK high street banks. Again, companies engaged in this area of trade have had their  <br>

accounts closed on the recommendation of HMRC. They, too, are companies against which no evidence has been adduced, no prosecution brought and no conviction obtained. I would be interested to know how many companies have been closed in that way and, against that figure, how many have actually been prosecuted.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o337"><a name="90708-0017.htm_para6"><a name="09070888000474">I suspect that what is happening is a substitution of a criminal legal process by a civil legal process that is entirely within the hands of HMRC, and I do not believe that the House has ever sanctioned such a process. Extra-judicial action by HMRC in the absence of any evidence is not something that we would normally countenance. If we were to do so, we would certainly place limits on the sanctions that could be applied&#151;just as we place limits on the sanctions to be applied in criminal cases&#151;rather than simply giving HMRC a free hand.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o338"><a name="90708-0017.htm_para7"><a name="09070888000475">What we have here is an arbitrary exercise of power by HMRC without any due process. It is an exercise of guilt by association that is foreign to British law in any respect, either historically or currently. It involves the substitution of the opinion of HMRC for a judgment, and the testing of that judgment by probative means, in court. I have to say that HMRC opinion is not unquestionable and it is not by definition correct. If it were, these companies that are so strongly suspected of being involved in VAT fraud would not have been given VAT registration in the first place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o339"><a name="90708-0017.htm_para8"><a name="09070888000476">The amendment is designed to make transparent a process that seems to have developed. If it is believed right and proper for HMRC to use civil process in this way to deal with unquestionably serious matters of fraud, these issues should be put before Parliament and agreed here. We should apply proper tests of evidence, proper judicial process and appropriate sanctions in the case of the felony, for that is what it would be if the case were proven. Instead, we have seen an incremental approach by HMRC, which I do not believe is satisfactory.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o340"><a name="90708-0017.htm_para9"><a name="09070888000477">To conclude, I have no evidence whether the company in my constituency or any of the other companies have been involved in fraud. How could I possibly know? What I am saying is that while I want HMRC to be rigorous in its approach, I also want it to be transparent and lawful. I do not believe that the actions currently taken by HMRC are, frankly, lawful. We have due process in this country and it should be transparent. I invite the Minister to answer my points if he can, as I would be grateful to know the answers, but I would also like to hear him accept the principle that such processes should be open, transparent and agreed by Parliament, rather than somebody in the recesses of HMRC deciding that they have a means by which they can exercise their powers without judicial process.</p>

 It is a pleasure to follow the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath), who has raised a number of important points, which I hope to touch on in the context of the HMRC charter and amendment 6. The group of amendments is rather lengthy, so I shall try to run through my amendments as quickly as possible.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o341"><a name="90708-0017.htm_para10"><a name="09070888000479">Clause 92 and schedule 46 relate to the senior accounting officer and the new responsibilities placed on him. We debated the matter in Committee of the whole House  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="8 July 2009">

<notus-date day="8" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>8 July 2009 : Column 1053</b><br>
and, indeed, in the Public Bill Committee. My hon. Friend the Member for Fareham (Mr. Hoban) pointed out on a number of occasions how the proposals were produced in the Budget and the Finance Bill without any consultation, yet there are concerns about their impact on large companies and about the scope of the clause.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o342"><a name="90708-0017.htm_para11"><a name="09070888000480">We are grateful that the Government have tabled amendment 43, which applies the measures not to &#147;large&#148; but to &#147;qualifying&#148; companies. That is a step forward, but we none the less have a number of doubts, particularly about the lack of clarity on the administrative costs to affected companies. No proper regulatory impact assessment was done prior to the announcement because the necessary consultation did not happen, so some doubt necessarily remains.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o343"><a name="90708-0017.htm_para12"><a name="09070888000481">We know that the Government estimate that about &#163;140 million will be raised by the measures, but there remains a degree of doubt about whether that will be the case. We have tabled two amendments which I think will help the House to assess the effectiveness of the proposals. Amendment 32 is a simple sunset clause and would enable the provision to fall after four years. If after four years it emerges that it is not causing a disproportionate cost to businesses to establish that the senior accounting officer can sign off the accounts, fair enough. If it proves that substantial amounts of revenue are being raised as a consequence of the provision, there will clearly be a strong case for renewing it, but if not&#151;I have to say that at this stage we cannot be confident one way or the other&#151;it will be dropped.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o344"><a name="90708-0017.htm_para13"><a name="09070888000482">Amendment 33, which relates to schedule 46, would require the commissioners to prepare a report on compliance with the new provisions and the additional tax raised. It would enable us to have a much better view of whether the measure was proving to be effective, given that consultation was not carried out in advance and its origin remains something of a mystery.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o345"><a name="90708-0017.htm_para14"><a name="09070888000483">Clause 95 and schedule 48 relate to the extension of information and inspection powers. We have tabled two technical amendments. Currently, there are powers to inspect property for valuation purposes, which relate to a number of taxes, including stamp duty reserve tax. The Law Society has questioned how those powers will be used, and I should be grateful if the Minister explains how they will be relevant to SDRT.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o346"><a name="90708-0017.htm_para15"><a name="09070888000484">Let me put amendment 8 in context. The tribunal may not approve an inspection under the new powers unless certain conditions apply. They include the ability of the relevant taxpayer to make representations, the ability of the occupier of the premises to make representations, and the supplying of a summary of the representations to the tribunal. Those conditions are disapplied if the occupier of the premises cannot be identified.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o347"><a name="90708-0017.htm_para16"><a name="09070888000485">It is reasonable for the requirement to supply a summary of the representations to the tribunal not to apply if the occupier cannot be identified, but why should it not apply if the taxpayer is able to make representations? If the taxpayer makes representations, there will be no obligation for a summary to be supplied to the tribunal. That seems somewhat strange. We seek to amend schedule 48 so that the occupier would not be given an opportunity to provide representations, but a summary could still be provided if the taxpayer has made representations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o348"><a name="90708-0017.htm_para17"><a name="09070888000486">Paragraph 15 of schedule 51 provides, broadly, for a 20-year time limit for assessments in a case involving a loss of tax attributable to a failure by a person to make a return under the stamp duty land tax legislation. Normally, the time limit is six years. The Law Society has told us that the period should be extended from six to 20 years only when failure is deliberate, rather than inadvertent and careless. Consequently, we have sought to address that in amendment 9, and similarly in amendment 10 tabled to paragraph 16 of schedule 51, by making the requirement a deliberate failure.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o349"><a name="90708-0017.htm_para18"><a name="09070888000487">Clause 99 and schedule 52 relate to the recovery of overpaid tax, setting out circumstances where a claim is disallowed. One of those&#151;case A&#151;is if a mistake is made in a claim, election or notice. The Law Society made the point that a mistake that gives a right of recovery against HMRC could result in a mistake in a claim, and therefore the unfortunate situation could arise that a mistake by HMRC leads to a mistake in a claim which then, in turn, means that the claim is disallowed. The second concern raised with us by the Law Society is what exactly a mistake means in those circumstances. The Minister might be able to help on those points, which relate to amendment 11.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o350"><a name="90708-0017.htm_para19"><a name="09070888000488">Amendment 12 highlights the fact that there is a separate regime for mistakes relating to capital allowances. Will the Minister explain why capital allowances are singled out? Finally in terms of schedule 52, amendment 13 relates to case F, which excludes amounts paid, or liable to be paid, in consequence of enforcement action. Why are proceedings for enforcement relevant to HMRC&#146;s liability under the schedule?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o351"><a name="90708-0017.htm_para20"><a name="09070888000489">Clause 101 and schedule 54 relate to repayment interest on sums to be paid by HMRC. Amendment 14 seeks confirmation that repayment interest is not taxable. Will the Minister respond to that point? Amendment 19 essentially asks why the repayment interest start date should be on 31 January next, following the year in which the loss is incurred, rather than at the end of the accounting period in which the loss is incurred, which is what we have sought to achieve in amendment 19.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o352"><a name="90708-0017.htm_para21"><a name="09070888000490">Clause 105 and schedule 55 relate to the penalty for failure to make returns. Paragraph 25 of the schedule states that where a representative partner fails to make a partnership return, a</p>
<a name="90708-0017.htm_brev0"><a name="09070888000535"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;penalty in respect of the failure is payable by every&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o353"><a name="90708-0017.htm_para22"><a name="09070888000491">person who was a partner in the partnership at any time during the relevant period. Amendment 20 would ensure that aggregate penalties are limited to the amount that could have been assessed on one partner. Otherwise, penalties could be more harsh where a partnership is late in making a return than where a company of equivalent size is late in equivalent circumstances. There does not seem to be any particular logic as to why the regime should be harder on a partnership as a whole than a company.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o354"><a name="90708-0017.htm_para23"><a name="09070888000492">Clause 106 and schedule 56 relate to the penalty for failures to make payments on time. Amendment 21 would delete what I believe to be a typo. The Minister is a reasonable man and I assume he will accept it; if he does not, I am perfectly prepared to divide the House, but I am sure he will not make that necessary. The current wording of the schedule is as follows:</p>
<a name="90708-0017.htm_brev1"><a name="09070888000536"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;that person fails to make or deliver the return on or before by the date by which it is required to be made or delivered&#148;.</p>

That ensures that any penalties arising after a taxpayer&#146;s approach to HMRC will be suspended.</p>

It is striking that every year we generally extend HMRC&#146;s powers in this area as part of a process relating to powers, deterrents and safeguards. We spend a lot of time scrutinising the powers and deterrents, but very often the argument for the safeguards is that they will be set out in the HMRC charter. We debated the charter in Committee&#151;the first draft of it caused considerable concern, but I acknowledge that the Government have moved on it. There remain some discussions to be had on this important document, and it is important that the House scrutinises how HMRC works and the safeguards that exist for the taxpayer. That is, in essence, the argument made by the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o358"><a name="90708-0017.htm_para27"><a name="09070888000496">The fact is that the House has very little oversight of the HMRC charter. We have had an opportunity to debate it in our consideration of the Bill and I dare say that we will be able to do much the same when we consider future Finance Bills. Amendment 6 would allow the House to debate the charter again before it is published and before it is finalised, so that the views of right hon. and hon. Members can be expressed and there is an opportunity to raise the concerns of constituents. Constituents have also come to me to discuss how they are treated while the Government and HMRC seek to address carousel fraud. That is but one example, and I am sure that hon. Members can identify others. It is important that the House has an opportunity to debate them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o359"><a name="90708-0017.htm_para28"><a name="09070888000497">I have covered, as quickly as possible, a large number of amendments, some of which are technical, others of which are broader in nature. I reiterate that it is important that the House scrutinises HMRC and that we ensure that the right balance is found between the powers, penalties and deterrents available to HMRC and the safeguards available to taxpayers. I press the Government to share that view, and I hope that we have future opportunities to debate the HMRC charter.</p>

 I just wish to make a few comments on the charter and the senior accounting officer. These wide-ranging amendments cover a variety of issues, both technical and probing, and I am sure that the Minister will respond to them. I am grateful to my hon.

Democrat colleagues and I tabled a new clause entitled &#147;Taxpayers Charter&#148;. Of course, it did not succeed, but we are grateful that something similar has appeared in this Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o360"><a name="90708-0017.htm_para29"><a name="09070888000499">It is important that taxpayers&#146; statutory rights, including the basic right of appeal against actions or decisions, is enshrined in some way, and the same applies in respect of taxpayers&#146; statutory duties&#151;I am thinking of provisions relating to notice period requirements, documents that HMRC has a right to access and penalties for failure to comply. We are very happy about that arrangement, but clause 91 would insert a new section into the Commissioners for Revenue and Customs Act 2005. This clause only pays lip service to the call for a charter. In reality, it provides little or no protection or certainty for the taxpayer and, indeed, pays the taxpayer little regard. The charter cannot be independent if HMRC is solely to decide its content. I appreciate the amendment that the official Opposition have tabled to ensure that the House debates that issue, because it is important.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o361"><a name="90708-0017.htm_para30"><a name="09070888000500">We would have liked the Government to consult on the content of the charter well before now. We have spent quite a lot of time consulting on stricter penalty regimes and very little on protecting the taxpayer. As I understand it, the charter will not be in statute&#151;only the power to create a charter. That is a slight disappointment. The Bill says that the standards and values are to be &#147;aspired&#148; to, but there will be no way of requiring HMRC to meet and maintain the standards that it should already have achieved. The review of HMRC&#146;s adherence to the charter would not require any consequential action. If HMRC fails to meet the aspirations in the charter, there is no provision to discipline it or enable parliamentary pressure to be applied,</p>

In fact, the Government have spun reforming ideas around to suit the interests of HMRC, rather than to protect the taxpayer. We do not have a taxpayers charter, but an HMRC charter&#151;not what was envisaged at all. Some of our concerns are shared by professional bodies. The Institute of Chartered Accountants says:</p>

Everything has been going HMRC&#146;s way, and this was an opportunity to try to redress the situation, but the Government have failed to do so.</p>

I can understand the Government&#146;s approach, which would identify someone who would be responsible for ensuring that the accounting systems are adequate and accurate for tax reporting. It refers to the preparation and submission of returns to HMRC, not tax figures in financial statements. The SAO must ensure that tax returns are timely and procedures are adequate for accurate tax reporting. The adequacy of the systems must be certified annually, because the tax code changes with alarming regularity. Systems have to be changed almost annually to ensure that the data in returns are accurate. The SAO will be personally liable for a penalty of up to &#163;5,000 for  <br>

careless or deliberate failure to comply with the rules. According to the impact assessment, some 2,000 individuals will need to comply with this new regime.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o365"><a name="90708-0018.htm_para1"><a name="09070888000504">The regime is supposed to target large companies, but the definition of large is not exact. Indeed, the Government have tabled some technical amendments to try to address that issue and ensure that we are targeting the right sort of large companies. That lack of definition is slightly disappointing in provisions that will charge individuals with some heavy responsibilities, for which the penalties can be significant&#151;not only in financial terms, but in professional terms, because a person&#146;s ability to retain their job or get another one might be limited if they were found liable in this respect. It is important that the Government have tight definitions and an understanding so that those individuals&#151;it has been assessed that there are about 2,000 of them&#151;have clear and accurate information about what their responsibilities are and what they have to do, and do not find themselves falling foul of inaccurate definitions or definitions that can be construed or introduced in different ways that could disadvantage them in their work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o366"><a name="90708-0018.htm_para2"><a name="09070888000505">Finally, on the issue of cost, although I can understand why the Government are formulating this proposal, there are serious concerns that businesses will face quite a considerable increase in costs, bearing in mind the potential of the expected yield. Do we have real proportionality? Will the costs incurred by businesses up and down the country be proportionate to what the expected yield might ultimately be? I would be grateful if the Minister could comment on that.</p>

 This group of amendments relate to the tax administration elements of the Bill. The formation of HMRC and the merger of the previous separate bodies provided a lot of opportunities to deliver more consistency and clarity for taxpayers and businesses. We are taking advantage of those opportunities in this part of the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o367"><a name="90708-0018.htm_para3"><a name="09070888000507">The package has been the subject of extensive consultation. The key elements replace myriad complex penalties and surcharges with a more effective and proportionate penalty structure with improved safeguards; replace the confusing old range of interest rates and formulae with a new regime based on recompense, fairness and simplicity; make it easier for taxpayers to pay what they owe on time, so supporting HMRC and tackling effectively those who pay late; extend the compliance checking introduced in the Finance Act 2008 to other taxes, clarifying where visits can be made and what time limits reply; and pave the way for the launch of the new HMRC charter by the autumn. The hon. Member for South-East Cornwall (Mr. Breed) just commented on that, and the charter will play an important role in the relationship between HMRC, taxpayers and agents, setting out taxpayers&#146; rights and responsibilities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o368"><a name="90708-0018.htm_para4"><a name="09070888000508">The hon. Member for South-East Cornwall quoted criticisms from the Institute of Chartered Accountants of England and Wales.

<p><a name="stpa_o369"><a name="90708-0018.htm_para5"><a name="09070888000509">That tax administration package runs in parallel with measures to protect tax revenues. There has been a lot of discussion with interested parties on these measures and I want to place on record my thanks for the help that we have received.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o370"><a name="90708-0018.htm_para6"><a name="09070888000510">Amendment 3, which was moved by the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath), is not really about the charter, as I think that he would accept. He has taken the opportunity to raise perfectly fair points about the HMRC approach to carousel fraud. This is probably not the place for an extensive discussion on that subject. However, he acknowledged that the scale of such fraud was vast. We were threatened with a loss of more than &#163;5 billion in 2007-08, and that level of fraud obviously requires HMRC to take every reasonable and proportionate step to prevent it. I would suggest to the hon. Gentleman that the response has been proportionate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o371"><a name="90708-0018.htm_para7"><a name="09070888000511">HMRC will withhold repayment where there are reasonable grounds to suspect knowledge of fraud. That approach is being supported by the courts when it is challenged. Such fraud is perpetrated by criminals seeking to steal vast sums of public money. It is complex and orchestrated by criminal gangs using what often look like legitimate trading companies, but the fraud only works if there is complicity in the supply chains, which often are very long. I suggest that it is not unreasonable for HMRC to expect companies to take steps to satisfy themselves that their transactions are not part of a fraudulent supply chain.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o372"><a name="90708-0018.htm_para8"><a name="09070888000512">If HMRC could use only criminal proceedings to prevent fraudulent repayments, I am afraid that the criminal justice system would rapidly grind to a halt. It is right that HMRC has civil powers to tackle fraud where the risk to the Exchequer is as significant as it is in this case. The powers that HMRC is using to protect taxpayers from organised crime exist already and are not new.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o373"><a name="90708-0018.htm_para9"><a name="09070888000513">Safeguards are in place, and I should be very happy to discuss our approach with the hon. Member for South-East Cornwall separately, but I do not think that the HMRC charter is the vehicle to address this problem. None of the representative bodies that we consulted suggested that this specific point about fraud should be in the charter.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o374"><a name="90708-0018.htm_para10"><a name="09070888000514">Amendment 6 would delay the charter coming into effect until it had been approved by a resolution of the House. I do not think that that would be the right thing to do: the charter is intended to be a document that can be easily updated, and an advisory panel with a majority of external members will monitor performance. It would not be appropriate for approval by the House to be necessary whenever the wording of the charter was updated.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o375"><a name="90708-0018.htm_para11"><a name="09070888000515">Amendment 32 would impose a four-year time limit on the application of clause 92. That would imply that, in four years&#146; time, large companies no longer needed to maintain tax accounting arrangements. That would be a mistake. As the House will be aware, we have significantly amended clause 92 to include the reference to materiality that the hon. Member for Fareham (Mr. Hoban) first suggested. I do not think that we should have a sunset clause to constrain it further.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o376"><a name="90708-0018.htm_para12"><a name="09070888000516">Amendment 33 would require an annual report on the impact of the measure, but it strikes me that reviewing the benefits of one measure in isolation would be of  <br>

limited value. HMRC looks at the tax compliance position of large businesses, and its relationship with them means that it takes a wide range of factors into account. I do not think that it would be helpful to divert HMRC resources into an annual assessment of one measure in isolation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o377"><a name="90708-0018.htm_para13"><a name="09070888000517">Government amendment 43 is a consequential amendment to align the terminology in clause 92 and changes the reference to &#147;large&#148; companies in schedule 46 to &#147;qualifying&#148; companies. I am grateful to the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire (Mr. Gauke) for welcoming that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o378"><a name="90708-0018.htm_para14"><a name="09070888000518">Amendment 7 would remove stamp duty reserve tax from the narrow list of taxes to which the new aligned power to inspect property for the purposes of valuation applies. HMRC has to undertake valuations for stamp duty reserve tax, because the consideration for shares on which the tax arises may be in the form of property. The value of the property affects the value of the transaction, and the new power replaces existing individual powers for each tax, including stamp duty reserve tax. The powers being replaced took different forms and had different safeguards, and the new power has been welcomed because it has stronger safeguards. It is proportionate and necessary and includes improved taxpayer safeguards, so I hope that amendment 7 will not be pressed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o379"><a name="90708-0018.htm_para15"><a name="09070888000519">Amendment 8 relates to the valuation inspection power more generally. In Committee, I was pleased that Opposition Members appreciated that the clause providing for property valuations contained considerable improvements in the safeguards for taxpayers. The importance of that provision is recognised across the House, because the strongest possible safeguards should apply. The amendment would strengthen those safeguards, so I am content to accept it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o380"><a name="90708-0018.htm_para16"><a name="09070888000520">Sadly, I cannot be as helpful with amendments 9 and 10, both of which relate to stamp duty land tax. They would restrict to four years the time limit for HMRC to make assessments where the taxpayer has failed to notify it of a land transaction, unless that failure was deliberate. The provisions that we have reassure the majority who pay their taxes that those who try not to pay them will have to do so in the end. It would not be fair on the compliant majority if, after a period, people who failed to notify did not have to pay the tax because the limit had elapsed. I hope that those amendments will be withdrawn.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o381"><a name="90708-0018.htm_para17"><a name="09070888000521">Amendments 11 and 12 seek to widen the scope for HMRC to accept a claim for repayment by removing some of the exceptions, but the capital allowances system is designed to give taxpayers very wide flexibilities and choices. Businesses have made it clear that they value those flexibilities and choices and would not want them to be curtailed. If a claim is out of time and it is not appropriate to extend time limits under the existing rules, there would be no reason to allow a claim under this provision to achieve the same end. I hope those amendments will not be pressed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o382"><a name="90708-0018.htm_para18"><a name="09070888000522">Amendment 13 seeks to remove an exclusion which applies where HMRC started court proceedings to recover a sum and either obtained court judgment or the taxpayer agreed to settle the matter. By the end of the process, the taxpayer will have had every opportunity to contest  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="8 July 2009">

the amount due. HMRC will have had to satisfy the court that the debt is due or the taxpayer will have had to agree to settle HMRC&#146;s claim in order for the exclusion to apply. To allow taxpayers the possibility of further disputing the amount would seriously weaken HMRC&#146;s ability to recover tax liabilities from defaulters.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o383"><a name="90708-0018.htm_para19"><a name="09070888000523">On amendment 14, as each tax is brought into the new interest regime, consequential changes to existing legislation will be made by regulations, using the powers in clause 103. These changes will ensure that the result that the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire is seeking will be achieved. On amendment 19, the hon. Gentleman explained the effect of the proposal. The position is provided for in schedule 54 and is in line with the general rules that apply when repayment interest starts to run. Amendment 19 would be inconsistent with those rules and I must therefore resist it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o384"><a name="90708-0018.htm_para20"><a name="09070888000524">Amendment 20 relates to schedule 55, which creates an aligned and modern penalty regime to deter failures to submit tax returns. It is right that where an obligation to submit a return exists, failure to do so should result in a penalty. However, we consider every proposal on its merits. I agree that amendment 21 corrects a minor drafting error. I am grateful to the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire for drawing the attention of the House to it, and I am happy to accept amendment 21.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o385"><a name="90708-0018.htm_para21"><a name="09070888000525">Government amendments 44 to 46 in clause 107 and Government amendments 51 to 53 in schedule 56 correct technical deficiencies that could lead to taxpayers not being able to benefit from the suspension of late payment penalties in the way that was intended. I believe they will find favour across the House.</p>

 I congratulate the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire (Mr. Gauke) on having won two amendments in a Finance Bill&#151;quite a proud record. I am grateful to him for his support for some of my contentions, as I am to my hon. Friend the Member for South-East Cornwall (Mr. Breed).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o386"><a name="90708-0018.htm_para22"><a name="09070891000022">With reference to the Minister&#146;s comments on my amendment, we agree about the seriousness of the fraud, the potential loss to this and other jurisdictions, and the need for effective interdiction and penalty. I make it plain, however, that I still have concerns. The Minister says that the response of HMRC is reasonable and proportionate. Clearly, it is reasonable and proportionate to take those confiscatory measures in the case of somebody who is perpetrating a fraud, but by its actions HMRC seems to be extending that to anyone who is associated with a trade in which fraud has taken place, and I am not sure that it is reasonable and proportionate to take confiscatory action against a person or company who is trading in that environment if they, in turn, have taken measures which are reasonable and proportionate to make sure that they are trading lawfully and not encouraging or permitting fraudulent behaviour by others.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o387"><a name="90708-0018.htm_para23"><a name="09070891000023">The &#147;reasonable suspicion&#148;, which the Minister says is the test, is of course put to the test only when the case is before a tribunal or the High Court. The way in which matters have been&#151;I was going to say &#147;prosecuted&#148;, but that is exactly the wrong term to use&#151;carried out hitherto suggests that that finding of fact happens at a very late stage in the process. According to information that I have received, a large number of those cases are not found to be based on reasonable suspicion when a  <br>

tribunal or, more particularly, the Court, has had a chance to adjudicate. That is what worries me. Having heard what the Minister said, I still feel that there is an extra-judicial process going on; it is perhaps necessary in some cases, but in others it is excessive.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o388"><a name="90708-0018.htm_para24"><a name="09070891000024">The Minister has found me out, in the sense that he has realised that amendment 3 was a probing amendment to enable me to raise essential matters on behalf of my constituents and others. I would be most grateful if, having looked again at my remarks, he would write to me to explain the Government&#146;s position, perhaps in slightly more detail than is possible in a speech. I may well then take him up on the suggestion that we discuss the matter privately.

 This group of amendments relates to real estate investment trusts, or REITs, which were introduced with effect from 1 January 2007. Their introduction was, in part, a response to Kate Barker&#146;s review of housing supply and the need to promote greater efficiency and flexibility in the UK property investment market. Two and a half years after their introduction, it is possible to make some evaluation of the effectiveness of the new REIT regime. It is clear that large property groups have obtained REIT status, but there have been no new REITs, and in particular none covering residential property. It would be fair to say that the economic climate has not been ideal for the creation of new REITs, but there is clearly a debate to be had on whether the fact that REITs covering residential property have not come into effect is down to the economic problems or defects in the tax system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o398"><a name="90708-0019.htm_para0"><a name="09070891000037">Paragraph 245 of that report states:</p>
<a name="90708-0019.htm_brev0"><a name="09070891000178"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;It is difficult to conclude that this partial failure is wholly due to the economic circumstances and not also in part to structural defects in the system. Moreover there has been little attempt to respond flexibly or significantly in their design to the difficult economic context.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o399"><a name="90708-0019.htm_para1"><a name="09070891000038">The group of amendments that we are considering is an attempt to encourage the Government to respond flexibly and significantly. Indeed, the Government have made some progress on that front. In Committee, I raised possible ways of providing some flexibility in design, based on proposals made by the British Property Federation. Since that date, the House of Lords Select Committee has recommended that the Government</p>
<a name="90708-0019.htm_brev1"><a name="09070891000179"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;look again with greater sympathy at the proposals by the representative bodies.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o400"><a name="90708-0019.htm_para2"><a name="09070891000039">To assist, we have today tabled four amendments, which, as I say, are based on the British Property Federation proposals. We are pleased to see that in one case the Government have followed suit, at least partially, and tabled an amendment seeking to address one of the concerns that we identified.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o401"><a name="90708-0019.htm_para3"><a name="09070891000040">Broadly, we seek in our amendments to address two issues. The first issue relates to the current requirement that REITs distribute 90 per cent. or more of property income, because in the current economic circumstances it is very helpful if companies can retain cash. Credit is clearly difficult to access, and companies need to build up balance sheets&#151;in particular, to keep banks lending to them. If and when the property market picks up, a REIT with sufficient cash might be able to make several acquisitions.</p>
<a name="ordayhd_20"><a name="90708-0019.htm_ordayhd0"><a name="09070891000211"><h5 align="left">6.30 pm</h5>
<p><a name="stpa_o402"><a name="90708-0019.htm_para4"><a name="09070891000041">Amendment 17 seeks to address the issue of a mandatory distribution of 90 per cent., which has to be done in one year, by deferring it for four years. It would be only a temporary measure, and any profits arising in accounting periods ending after 31 March 2010 would be subject to the current distribution rules, but it would provide REITs with flexibility.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o403"><a name="90708-0019.htm_para5"><a name="09070891000042">Amendment 18 would provide for distributions to be paid by new shares rather than by cash, and there should not be a revenue implication: shareholders receiving a stock dividend, which is a distribution for these purposes, would be automatically subject to tax, as they would be with a normal property income distribution in cash. We therefore press the Government to look sympathetically at the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o404"><a name="90708-0019.htm_para6"><a name="09070891000043">Amendment 16 is a less radical proposal, but it addresses the same area and would retain the 90 per cent. test. Any breach of it would not result in the risk of expulsion from the REIT regime, as that would be expensive for the REIT, but would involve corporation tax being paid on the undistributed profits. The argument that the Government tend to make against all such proposals is that there is an issue of investor protection, but when institutions are looking for investors to invest in a REIT, there is strong commercial pressure to make use of such provisions only when necessary. It is a commercial judgment that, one might strongly argue, could be left to the REITs rather than to the regulations, so we would be grateful for the Government&#146;s response to those points.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o405"><a name="90708-0019.htm_para7"><a name="09070891000044">The second issue relates to the profit-financing cost ratio. Property income distributions are subject to a withholding tax of 20 per cent., unless the recipient is a UK charity, pension fund or corporate. Payments of interest by a REIT, however, may not be subject to withholding tax, and there is therefore the clear possibility of a REIT distributing income through interest payments as an avoidance measure. The profit-financing cost ratio is an attempt to address that. It is an anti-avoidance provision aimed at preventing REIT investors from structuring their investment as a loan.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o406"><a name="90708-0019.htm_para8"><a name="09070891000045">Broadly, the PFCR rule provides that the amount of a REIT&#146;s tax-exempt profits must be at least 1.25 times the size of the financing costs that are related to the REIT&#146;s tax-exempt business. There are, however, a couple of problems with that. First, a REIT might hedge market value movements in a debt with a derivative contract. The PFCR rule does not take into account any profit on debt, but it does take into account a matching loss on the derivative. The loss is counted as a financing cost so the REIT might breach the ratio as a consequence of market movements.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o407"><a name="90708-0019.htm_para9"><a name="09070891000046">Secondly, the aggregate of all movements in a derivative contract is deferred until closing out occurs, and that could lead to a distortion of the ratio in one particular year. Amendment 15 seeks to address those specific problems.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o408"><a name="90708-0019.htm_para10"><a name="09070891000047">As I mentioned earlier, Government amendment 47 addresses the issue of the profit-financing cost ratio by allowing HMRC to waive rules in particular circumstances&#151;when a REIT is in severe financial difficulties, the circumstances arose unexpectedly and the company could not reasonably have taken avoidance action. I have communicated with the British Property Federation, which welcomes movement on the issue but is concerned that the particular circumstances that I have mentioned are somewhat restrictive, difficult to interpret and vague.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o409"><a name="90708-0019.htm_para11"><a name="09070891000048">As a consequence, Government amendment 47 may not be effective enough in addressing what both sides of the House agree is a potential problem. I would welcome comments from the Minister on that, because we think that amendment 15 would provide REITs with greater certainty and clarity and address the specific problems raised by the British Property Federation, rather than having the apparently broader flexibility involved in HMRC&#146;s waiving the ratio, although in restricted circumstances that would be difficult for the REIT to understand. The Minister may well be able to provide guidance and clarity on the issue; as it stands, however, we are not sure that Government amendment 47 is as successful as amendment 15.</p>

<p><a name="st_o312"><a name="09070891000049"><a name="90708-0019.htm_spnew0"><a name="09070891000224"><b>Ian Pearson:</b>
 We believe that Government amendment 47 will be effective, and I shall explain why in a moment. As the hon. Gentleman will know, the British Property Federation and others have welcomed the amendment, which has arisen as a result of continued discussion with the industry in the post-Budget period. It makes a further change to the regime to ensure that its rules on financing costs achieve their original objectives without creating any unintended effects.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o410"><a name="90708-0019.htm_para12"><a name="09070891000050">Government amendment 47 will allow the charge to tax to be waived when the commissioners of Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs think that a company is in severe financial difficulties and that it could not reasonably  <br>

have avoided breaching the profit-financing cost ratio owing to unexpected circumstances. That ensures that the tax charge can be waived if a REIT that has not borrowed excessively breaches the profit-financing cost ratio because of a fall in its profits and/or an increase in its financing costs that have led it into severe financial difficulties.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o411"><a name="90708-0019.htm_para13"><a name="09070891000051">The amendment does not seek to define &#147;severe financial difficulties&#148;. However, in case extra clarity should be needed, it provides HMRC with a power that may be used to specify in regulations criteria to be applied by commissioners in determining whether to waive the charge. The hon. Gentleman will be aware that currently there are 21 companies in the REITs regime. We believe that that number is manageable. However, if &#147;severe financial difficulties&#148; needs to be defined, the powers are there. We believe, however, that the phrase is pretty broadly understood.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o412"><a name="90708-0019.htm_para14"><a name="09070891000052">Opposition amendment 15 would relax the requirements of the profit-financing cost ratio by bringing in credits in respect of debtor relationships and by excluding financing costs that are considered</p>
<a name="90708-0019.htm_brev2"><a name="09070891000180"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;exceptional due to their size or incidence.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o413"><a name="90708-0019.htm_para15"><a name="09070891000053">However, it is not clear to the Government why the size or incidence of a financing cost should be considered to make it exceptional and why that would make it an appropriate item to exclude from the profit-financing cost ratio. We also believe that the Government amendment, by seeking to protect the ratio while ensuring that it does not lead to any unintended consequences for companies in severe financial difficulties, is a more targeted and preferred measure.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o414"><a name="90708-0019.htm_para16"><a name="09070891000054">Amendment 16 concerns the requirement of the REIT to distribute 90 per cent. of its profits from the property rental business to shareholders by way of a dividend. That helps to protect the investor and the Exchequer by ensuring that profits are distributed to shareholders who pay tax on them. The amendment seeks to ensure that if a company in financial difficulty fails to meet this distribution requirement it would not be treated as a &#147;serious breach&#148; of REITs rules. REITs legislation states that the consequences of multiple serious breaches of the rules are that REIT may be given notice by HMC to leave the regime. In the context of the distribution requirements, &#147;serious&#148; is not defined. However, if a company is in financial difficulties there is scope under the legislation for that to be taken into account in deciding whether to issue a termination notice. We therefore believe that there is no need for the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o415"><a name="90708-0019.htm_para17"><a name="09070891000055">Amendment 17 also relates to the 90 per cent. distribution requirement. Its purpose would be to allow a REIT to issue stock, instead of cash, in order to meet the 90 per cent. requirement. Allowing a REIT to issue stock, rather than cash, as part of this requirement could risk harming the investor, particularly if stock is issued to shareholders on a mandatory basis. A mandatory issue of stock as part of the distribution requirement would reduce the size of the cash dividend received by each shareholder without increasing the value of their shareholding. There would also be a risk of imposing a tax charge on shareholders that could not be covered by the cash part of the distribution. If stock is issued on an optional basis, those electing to receive cash could still see their shareholding diluted by those electing to receive stock. However, I understand the point that the  <br>

 In the Budget, we announced a restriction of higher rate tax relief for the pension contributions of people with the highest incomes from April 2011. The House well understands why we had to introduce anti-forestalling rules in the meantime to protect an estimated &#163;2 billion of tax that could have been at risk otherwise. The arrangements were designed to be fiscally neutral in the interim period between Budget day and April 2011. The principle that we adopted was to maintain higher-rate relief for continuing regular pension contributions over this interim period but to restrict the relief when contributions were additional to the regular pattern.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o427"><a name="90708-0019.htm_para29"><a name="09070891000071">We have defined regular contributions as those made quarterly or more frequently&#151;an established pattern of pension savings where it is readily possible to identify the typical level of contributions. The level is also likely to be consistent, as part of a contract with an employer or with a pension scheme direct, so it is relatively easy to isolate forestalling as distinct from normal pension saving. It is harder to identify as &#147;normal&#148; contributions that are made less frequently, particularly when that requires looking back over previous years, not least because the A-day changes made three years ago have altered pension saving habits. Irregular contributors have a much more limited track record on which to base judgments on typical levels of contributions, and the payments tend to vary more in size.</p>

The regime includes an annual savings limit of &#163;20,000 on which people are entitled to receive higher-rate relief. For some people&#151;a relatively small group&#151;&#163;20,000 will be less than they have tended to contribute to their pension in the years since A-day.

I welcome the Opposition&#146;s support for that approach. The difference between us, not surprisingly, is what the limit should be.

We estimate that setting the limit at &#163;30,000 will extend full protection to many annual contributors and to more than three quarters of all those affected. Only the highest quarter of contributors will be constrained at all, and they will see their limit for higher-rate pensions tax relief increased by half as much again, so they, too, will benefit.</p>

Setting the level at &#163;50,000, on the other hand, would raise costs by &#163;130 million, nearly twice as much. The Opposition amendments would also potentially, though I imagine unintentionally, open a loophole for people with several pensions to have an annual limit of &#163;50,000 on each.

On amendment 30, I have received representations on the subject of flexibility for those who change provider. I have thought about it, and I accept that we can be more flexible so that if somebody changes pension provider and carries forward exactly the same pension arrangements, they can retain their protected pension contributions. There is a risk, though, of inadvertently opening up significant avoidance. I would therefore like to take the matter forward through regulations, after consulting the industry on draft regulations. I accept the argument that lies behind the amendment, but I hope that on the understanding that I want to deliver that aim, the Opposition will not press it.</p>

Removing the three-year rule would put at risk a significant amount of tax revenue&#151;we estimate that it could be &#163;100 million in the two years to April 2011.

 Schedule 35 has caused much concern to many people, including pension providers and the self-employed. They are concerned about the hasty way in which it was introduced, without consultation, the rough edges that it creates and its discrimination against people who do not make regular contributions&#151;quarterly or more frequently. People have made many representations and sought ways of amending the schedule so that the rules apply more reasonably.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o437"><a name="90708-0020.htm_para2"><a name="09070891000082">The Financial Secretary, today and in Committee, emphasised a willingness to get the schedule right. However, he tempered that from time to time with a focus on the Revenue cost. He argued today and in Committee that some people are in a position to renegotiate their contracts to alter their package, thus taking advantage of amendment 29. However, some people who earn relatively low sums of money this year will have earned a large sum in the first year. I had an e-mail from a member of the public who earned little in the past two years but suddenly landed a contract this year and earned more than &#163;150,000. <i> [Interruption.] </i>He may well have e-mailed other Members, too. That is the joy of e-mailing prolifically. Other examples have been given of other people who have received income in lumps. I want to ensure that the Government, in their pursuit of tax avoidance, do not create too many rough edges in the scheme so that people who are not in a position to manipulate their tax affairs lose out. That is why I tabled amendment 29.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o438"><a name="90708-0020.htm_para3"><a name="09070891000083">I am grateful to the Financial Secretary for recognising the strength of the arguments behind amendment 30. Several people have mentioned not only a change in the provider of the scheme&#151;obviously people do not want to lose the benefit of protection under the scheme if the business for which they work decides to change pension provider&#151;but what happens when the scheme itself changes. I wonder whether the Financial Secretary could reassure me by saying that he will deal with that through regulation or that it is already covered in the schedule. It would be helpful if he listened to me rather than his neighbour.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o439"><a name="90708-0020.htm_para4"><a name="09070891000084">We know that several large employers are closing down their defined benefit schemes and moving to defined contribution schemes. I had an e-mail from someone who was in a defined benefit scheme and was concerned that they would lose the benefit of the protected pension input amount provisions in schedule 35. Could the Financial Secretary say a little about how people in that situation would be protected? If someone remains in the same employment, with the same broad employment package, but the employer closes down the DB scheme and the employee is therefore forced to move to a DC scheme, will the protection remain? Given the changes that are likely to happen in the next couple of years and the number of DB schemes that are closing, that will be of interest to many people.</p>

In Committee we looked at either increasing the special allowance from &#163;20,000 to &#163;50,000 across the board or averaging the previous year&#146;s contributions. We decided that we wanted to take a hybrid approach, and clearly the Treasury has been thinking along the same lines. We welcome the fact that the Government have moved some of the way, by introducing a &#163;30,000 limit, which is not where I thought they were heading in Committee, when I thought that they were considering simply keeping the &#163;20,000 limit. However, I am still not convinced that they have moved far enough in recognising the difficulties for those who are self-employed who make irregular contributions to their pension funds. I would have preferred a more generous limit, although I take on board the Minister&#146;s comments about the cost of the &#163;50,000 limit compared with the cost of the &#163;30,000 limit.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o441"><a name="90708-0020.htm_para6"><a name="09070891000086">In conclusion, I will not press amendments 29 or 30 to a vote. I am pleased that the Government have taken on board the thrust of amendment 30 and come up with a more elegant and cheaper version of amendments 25 to 28. If the Minister had tabled those amendments rather sooner than the Friday before debating them, I might have tabled a more elegant amendment of my own to change &#163;30,000 to &#163;50,000. However, the Government have moved somewhat, thanks to the pressure from both inside and outside this House. I do not think that the proposed measure is perfect by any stretch of the imagination. Some people will still suffer from the sharp edges that the proposed anti-forestalling measure will introduce, but schedule 35 is certainly in better shape than it was when the Finance Bill was published a few months ago.</p>

 I wish that I could talk about the Bill with the same degree of conviction as the Financial Secretary. He has referred to what appeared to be a cornucopia of goodies, but I have to say that this has been a relatively uncontroversial Finance Bill. It has ducked the main issues. Although we have the legislation to establish the 50p rate, the measure to set the rate is deferred to another day; there are measures aimed at fiscal consolidation, such as the anti-forestalling measures on pension contributions, but the increase in national insurance contributions announced in the pre-Budget report is not in the Bill. That has rather limited the areas of heated debate between those on the two Front Benches.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o456"><a name="90708-0020.htm_para21"><a name="09070891000103">As ever with Finance Bills, the areas of controversy have been principally those on which the Government have not consulted beforehand&#151;the measures that were slipped into the Bill in the days and hours leading up to the Budget. We have had debates about the role of senior accounting officers, and about pensions anti-forestalling rules, for example. In both areas the Government have been widely criticised for failing to consult industry. That lack of consultation undermines the competitiveness of the tax system and creates uncertainty for businesses. It sends out a message that businesses cannot be sure that measures announced in the pre-Budget report represent the full sum of the technical measures to be introduced in the Finance Bill. That causes business a great deal of concern.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o457"><a name="90708-0020.htm_para22"><a name="09070891000104">Once the Government had bunged those measures into the Bill, they had to retreat and listen to the forceful arguments put forward by us and by those outside the House.

to modify the rules on senior accounting officers in a way that leads us to ask what the measure is actually for. Will it simply impose additional costs on business but bring in no real return to HMRC?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o458"><a name="90708-0020.htm_para23"><a name="09070891000105">Those are not the only areas in which the Government have been prepared to listen. My hon. Friends the Members for South-West Hertfordshire (Mr. Gauke) and for Hammersmith and Fulham (Mr. Hands) have either had amendments accepted by the Government or provided the inspiration for amendments that have been accepted. The Government might say that that shows that they are a listening Government, but it also demonstrates the value of consultation and discussion, as opposed to acting first and thinking later.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o459"><a name="90708-0020.htm_para24"><a name="09070891000106">The Bill also demonstrates a lack of political will on the part of the Government, and a failure to push forward with difficult reforms. They have abandoned proposals for a per-plane duty as a replacement for air passenger duty. With political will, those proposals could have worked; instead the Government have introduced banded air passenger duty, which will affect many from the Caribbean community who will end up paying more for their flights. A lack of nerve has meant that sensible environmental tax changes have been abandoned.</p>

The reforms to the taxation of foreign profits should make Britain a more attractive place to do business. I hope that it will stem the outflow of businesses from the UK seeking to re-domicile their headquarters overseas, but it should be a salutary reminder to the Government that they cannot afford to neglect the competitiveness of the UK&#146;s tax system. That is why my hon. Friend the Member for South-West Hertfordshire tabled a new clause asking the Government to produce an annual report on the measure. Government neglect of the competitiveness of the UK tax system not only risks businesses from this country moving elsewhere, but acts as a barrier to the inward investment that we will need to restart the economy when the recession is over. Businesses are mobile and tax competition can erode our tax base as businesses move overseas, forcing tax rates to go up.</p>

As a country, we are borrowing an extra &#163;480 million every single day&#151;a level of borrowing that is without precedent and clearly unsustainable in anything more than the fairly short term. That big backdrop required a Government who had big, bold measures in order to address the magnitude of the situation. Instead, we were given a very small Finance Bill containing many micro-proposals. In the last few days, for example, we have discussed a small above-inflation increase in the duty on beer at a time when pubs are closing, breweries are struggling and beer consumption is falling. The amount of extra revenue raised will be tiny, if it exists at all. Only this afternoon, we discussed further punitive measures affecting the bingo industry at a time when bingo halls are closing. Again, the amount of extra revenue will be tiny, if any money is raised at all.</p>

Even the measures that have been sold to the public as big, headline, dividing-line issues, such as the 50p income tax rate&#151;a broken Labour manifesto promise&#151;turn out, when subjected to closer scrutiny, to be raising very little money in the grand scheme of things, and possibly no additional revenue at all.</p>

The tragedy is that with debt approaching &#163;1.6 trillion, with net investment due to fall from &#163;44 billion to &#163;22 billion and with employment rising&#151;we have seen the largest-ever single monthly rise this year&#151;all that we are seeing is tinkering around the edges.</p>

 The debate has come about because of an unexpected reduction in the available pension commencement lump sum suffered by one of my constituents, whom I shall refer to simply as Dr. Robert, after he retired. I have corresponded with the Treasury about the matter, and I would not normally seek to detain the House by debating an issue that might otherwise be handled by means of an exchange of letters with the Minister. I do so on this occasion for the following reasons.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o476"><a name="90708-0021.htm_para4"><a name="09070891000128">First, Dr. Robert&#146;s case has exposed what I believe to be an anomaly in schedule 29 of the Finance Act 2004 as it relates to tax-free pension lump sum allowances. His case cannot, therefore, be remedied at an individual level; it can only be remedied by the will of the House in future legislation. Secondly, although the majority of pensioners will not have been affected by the injustice that I believe Dr. Robert has suffered, his case is far from unique. While I suspect that very few who have been affected by the anomaly in the regulations will have been able to articulate the fact with the same mathematical clarity as my constituent, they will have felt no less bewildered and cheated than he has.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o477"><a name="90708-0021.htm_para5"><a name="09070891000129">My third reason for raising the matter in the House is that in his letter to me of 19 November last year, my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary to the Treasury acknowledged the real problems that had been created by the lump sum rule. He even acknowledged that my constituent had proposed</p>
<a name="90708-0021.htm_brev15"><a name="09070891000206"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;solutions that overcome these effects by taking account of the actual amounts of pension commencement lump sum paid in each case.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o478"><a name="90708-0021.htm_para6"><a name="09070891000130">Unfortunately, the letter proceeded to justify not adopting those solutions on the grounds that they would add administrative complexity. That cannot be right; injustice cannot be excused on the basis of administrative convenience.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o479"><a name="90708-0021.htm_para7"><a name="09070891000131">Having set out my reasons for bringing the matter before the House, I must now present the detailed arguments relating to the tax rules. I apologise in advance that they are necessarily technical and complicated, but I will try to reconcile simplicity with accuracy as best I can.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o480"><a name="90708-0021.htm_para8"><a name="09070891000132">Since what the Government chose to call A-day, 6 April 2006, there has been a lifetime allowance, known as an LTA, of &#163;1.5 million. That is the limit imposed not on an individual&#146;s pension fund itself, but on that element of the cumulative pension fund from which an individual can withdraw or crystallise a lump sum without incurring a lifetime allowance charge. The figures are indexed each year, but if we talk in 2006 money, an individual is entitled to take a tax-free lump sum called a pension commencement lump sum, or PCLS, of up to &#163;375,000, which is 25 per cent. of the standard LTA of &#163;1.5 million.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o481"><a name="90708-0021.htm_para9"><a name="09070891000133">My constituent had a pension in progress at A-day that had a capital value of &#163;250,000, with 25 per cent. crystallised lump sum rights of &#163;62,500. He also had an NHS pension with a capital value of &#163;1.2 million,  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="8 July 2009">

<notus-date day="8" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>8 July 2009 : Column 1078</b><br>
where, under the NHS scheme, the lump sum entitlement was limited to 13.04 per cent. rather than the Government figure of 25 per cent. He also had four other uncrystallised pension funds totalling &#163;580,000 in capital value, and a scheme lump sum entitlement of 20 per cent. amounting to &#163;145,000. Finally, he had a post-1987 freestanding additional voluntary contribution scheme worth &#163;60,000. That scheme, although allowing him to take a lump sum of &#163;25,000, would under Treasury rules not be allowed to count as part of his VULSR, which is Treasury-speak for valuation of uncrystallised lump sum rights, and could therefore not be calculated towards the total lump sum rights minimum figure of &#163;375,000, at which point he could register for primary or enhanced lump sum protection in accordance with RPSM03105070.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o482"><a name="90708-0021.htm_para10"><a name="09070891000134">Dr. Robert registered for enhanced&#151;dormant primary&#151;transitional protection of his LTA. His declared LTA if needed later for primary protection was 139.33 per cent., which equates to &#163;2.09 million rather than the &#163;1.5 million. The reason he could not apply for enhanced lump sum protection was that his total lump sum rights on A-day did not quite reach &#163;375,000. We should remember at this point that he had crystallised &#163;62,500 already and had a further &#163;156,480, which represented the 13.04 per cent. of his NHS pension, as well as a further &#163;145,000 which represented 25 per cent. of his four pensions with a capital value of &#163;580,000, and zero from his post-1987 freestanding AVC.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o483"><a name="90708-0021.htm_para11"><a name="09070891000135">Dr. Robert chose to crystallise his NHS pension shortly after A-day and received a PCLS of &#163;156,480. When added to his pre-commencement pension, this meant he had used up 96.66 per cent. of a standard LTA. However, because he had registered for enhanced&#151;dormant primary&#151;protection, he knew he had, in fact, got 42.67 per cent. of LTA still remaining. On deciding shortly thereafter to crystallise his four private pension plans, he was told that although he had crystallised only 58.4 per cent. of his available lump sum rights, he could now crystallise only &#163;12,500 tax-free&#151;or 3.34 per cent. of &#163;375,000&#151;before he would exceed his PCLS allowance. The Treasury deemed him to have used up 96.66 per cent. of his tax-free lump sum allowance when, in reality, he has used only 58.4 per cent. of it. The reason for that is because the way in which the lump sum rule operates does not recognise that the amount he could take as a lump sum from his national health service pension was limited to 13.04 per cent. of its capital value.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o484"><a name="90708-0021.htm_para12"><a name="09070891000136">The lump sum rule, as defined in schedule 29(2) of the Finance Act 2004, tracks the decrementing &#147;available portion&#148; of PCLS remaining, after &#147;benefit crystallisation events&#148;, from an individual&#146;s PCLS lump sum entitlement, called the &#147;applicable amount&#148;. The &#147;applicable amount&#148; is not the problem here; the problem is in the way the decrementing &#147;available portion&#148; is calculated after each progressive lump sum crystallisation event. The available portion is initially defined in schedule 29(2) and RPSM09104510 by the formula: &#147;available portion&#148; equals the current standard lifetime allowance indexed to the year in question minus the aggregate of amount crystallised&#151;AAC&#151;for each proceeding benefit crystallisation event, all divided by four.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o485"><a name="90708-0021.htm_para13"><a name="09070891000137">The rationale behind the formula is that it progressively tracks the decrementing available portion to zero, thus ensuring that no excess PCLS is paid out by pension administrators. However, it makes the extremely unfair assumption that each individual crystallisation that goes  <br>

to make up the AAC actually represents 25 per cent. of the PCLS. That assumption, represented by the use of four as the divisor in the formula, is simply unfounded, as is shown in the case of Dr. Robert, whose scheme did not allow him to crystallise more than 13.04 per cent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o486"><a name="90708-0021.htm_para14"><a name="09070891000138">Thus far, I am confident that the Exchequer Secretary to the Treasury accepts that what I have said is accurate, both factually and with regard to the calculations.

<a name="90708-0021.htm_brev18"><a name="09070891000209"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;there is no hindrance in the tax rules preventing the maximum pension commencement lump sums from being paid. It is, quite rightly, a matter between pension schemes and their sponsors and members whether they pay out less than the permitted maximum of 25 per cent.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o490"><a name="90708-0021.htm_para18"><a name="09070891000142">That claim might have had a brighter ring to it were it not for the fact that the Government&#146;s own civil service pension scheme did not enable full commutation to 25 per cent. until 1 October 2007. Furthermore, the NHS pension authority delayed until 6 April 2008, some two years after A-day.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o491"><a name="90708-0021.htm_para19"><a name="09070891000143">Those two pension schemes represent the majority of the UK&#146;s public sector employers. In the light of that, I consider the idea that the Government can absolve themselves of a duty to get the lump sum rule right by blaming the pension fund&#146;s sponsors as wide of the mark. The Government have a duty to legislate for the world as it is, and as they know it to be, not to put pensioners on some Procrustean bed and chop them to the same size, regardless of the actual rules of their pension fund, especially when the Government operate two such non-compliant funds themselves, employing millions of public sector workers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o492"><a name="90708-0021.htm_para20"><a name="09070891000144">In his letter, my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary declined to resolve the anomaly in the lump sum rule on the grounds that to do so would add administrative complexity. He says:</p>

And post-A-day pension schemes simply pass on details of the unused lifetime allowance available to an individual, and not this information plus details of pension commencement lump sums paid to date.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o493"><a name="90708-0021.htm_para21"><a name="09070891000145">I point out that given that HMRC has already had to develop efficient &#147;application for protection&#148; and &#147;event report&#148; schemes, the additional work involved in tracking the actual rather than the assumed PCLS crystallisations of those individuals eligible for an enhanced LTA over their lifetime should not be greater than that already required for those who register lump sum rights greater than &#163;375,000 in respect of primary or enhanced protection.</p>

Friend also failed to indicate that pension schemes are also required to maintain precise records of pensions paid, including PCLS, for six years after A-day. Indeed, since A-day, they have been obliged to complete detailed annual electronic returns online to HMRC, using APSS300, which covers 20 wide-ranging event reports pertaining to transfers and payments made from the scheme to individual scheme members. Those events are detailed in RPSM12301010-12301220 and S.I.2006/257. Within APSS300, only event reports 6, 7 and 8 require consideration for the PCLS in relation to the anomaly in the lump sum rule. There is no specific event report at present for a PCLS paid to an individual with enhanced LTA who does not have additional PCLS rights greater than &#163;375,000. A small amendment to the APSS300 reporting requirements of event 6 would go a long way to remedying the anomaly.</p>

attention of the House. I know that his constituent has already been the subject of some highly technical correspondence with HMRC, which, I understand, is ongoing. I do not think that this is the place for that detailed technical discussion of the finer workings of the pension legislation, but it would be helpful if I responded to my hon. Friend by considering the issues in broad terms.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o503"><a name="90708-0021.htm_para31"><a name="09070891000157">As my hon. Friend is aware, under the new pension rules a pension scheme member can receive up to 25 per cent. of their pension fund as an initial tax-free lump sum when their pension starts to be paid. The total amount that individuals can save in a pension tax-free is subject to a lifetime allowance, which currently stands at &#163;1.75 million. That limit is a maximum, within which pension funds may decide how best to provide benefits to their members. However, the Government need to ensure that the system is used fairly and remains affordable for the taxpayer, so there are limits on the amount of tax relief available to an individual.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o504"><a name="90708-0021.htm_para32"><a name="09070891000158">If there were no limits to the amounts of tax relief available on pension savings, some people might use them as general savings accounts and would put away far more than was necessary simply to provide a retirement income, instead using pensions as a way to avoid income tax. In that case, the cost to the Exchequer in tax relief could be open-ended.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o505"><a name="90708-0021.htm_para33"><a name="09070891000159">The cap on the size of tax-free lump sums therefore ensures that the tax relief available for pensions is kept to the level intended by Parliament and allows the Government to monitor the cost of tax relief to the taxpayer. As I said, the lifetime allowance is the maximum tax advantaged pension benefits an individual can accumulate, other than under transitional rules. That limit is an optional maximum, within which pension funds may decide how best to provide benefits to their members.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o506"><a name="90708-0021.htm_para34"><a name="09070891000160">When the individual has more than one pension fund, the maximum tax-free lump sum that an individual can take is based on the lower of 25 per cent. of the money held in a particular pension fund and 25 per cent. of the lifetime allowance available. As each pension scheme comes into payment, the lifetime allowance is reduced by the value of the total benefits taken. Therefore, if one pension scheme pays a lump sum of less than 25 per cent., that will mean that the total lump sum from all schemes will be less than 25 per cent. of the value of all the pension funds as no pension can provide a lump sum bigger than 25 per cent. of the funds held by the individual in that scheme.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o507"><a name="90708-0021.htm_para35"><a name="09070891000161">A similar issue arises in connection with the enhanced protection rules.</p>

<p><a name="st_o327"><a name="09070891000162"><a name="90708-0021.htm_spnew4"><a name="09070891000239"><b>Barry Gardiner:</b>
 My hon. Friend is absolutely right to make that point. However, does she not consider it wrong that there should be an assumption that runs absolutely counter to the fact of what the actual payment is? Is it not wrong that there should be an assumption that the full 25 per cent. has been paid out when, in many cases, it will not have been?</p>

<p><a name="st_o328"><a name="09070891000163"><a name="90708-0021.htm_spnew5"><a name="09070891000240"><b>Sarah McCarthy-Fry:</b>
 There is not a requirement for schemes to allow 25 per cent&#151;I think that that is where we are getting a bit confused&#151;rather it is the maximum tax-free lump sum permitted in tax rules.</p>

 Indeed, that is the case&#151;it is the maximum admissible&#151;but, as my hon. Friend will know, the two pension schemes that I quoted and many others do not allow that and did not allow that. Millions of workers in this country are affected by the limitation of those schemes, and a correction to the regulations could avoid their being penalised.</p>

<p><a name="st_o330"><a name="09070891000165"><a name="90708-0022.htm_spnew1"><a name="09070891000242"><b>Sarah McCarthy-Fry:</b>
 Very few pensioners will have pensions anywhere near the lifetime allowance, and we have to take that fact into account. We must also take into account the fact that it would add complexity, a point that I will develop later. Our rules must balance what will affect a few individuals against the complexity that would affect many more pensioners. The decision about going to the maximum 25 per cent. is a matter for individual pension schemes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o508"><a name="90708-0022.htm_para0"><a name="09070891000166">I sympathise with my hon. Friend&#146;s concerns on this matter, but the current rules work well for the vast majority of people. Pension simplification was intended to introduce rules that are simple, clear and certain. Using a scheme upper limit of 25 per cent. achieves that: it benefits pension schemes by reducing administrative burdens, and individuals by making the rules easier to apply.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o509"><a name="90708-0022.htm_para1"><a name="09070891000167">The Government considered this issue when drawing up the framework that was eventually introduced on A-day, and it was recognised at the time that some individuals may not be able to claim the full 25 per cent. tax-free lump sum. Alternative methods that attempted to measure the size of multiple pension funds and calculate the relevant 25 per cent. lump sum would require pension schemes to maintain records of pensions savings before A-day. Opting for that method would require a complex and unrealistic approach to valuing pensions. Members would have to obtain or retain the values and dates of payment of all lump sum payments over a period that may be five, 10 or more years before April 2006.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o510"><a name="90708-0022.htm_para2"><a name="09070891000168">That would be a costly and time-consuming exercise. Schemes are required to keep records for only six years, and finding that information would be either impossible or costly. Our experience of other pension law, such as trivial commutation, is that such record keeping would represent significant administrative burdens. Most schemes do not have complete records and it would be unrealistic to expect members to provide that information. That is why a simple formula based on a percentage was used.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o511"><a name="90708-0022.htm_para3"><a name="09070891000169">It is also important to bear it in mind that the tax rules do not guarantee that the maximum tax-advantaged benefit can always be paid: they simply provide a framework within which a pension scheme and its members are free to order their affairs as they wish. In some circumstances, that will mean that a member will not be able to obtain the maximum tax advantages.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o512"><a name="90708-0022.htm_para4"><a name="09070891000170">The legislation deliberately does not prescribe the level of the tax-free lump sum. Instead, it provides a framework within which pension funds and individuals must operate, and that means that pension funds have the freedom to determine the appropriate package of benefits that they offer to their members. Legislating that pension schemes must provide a 25 per cent. lump sum, or allowing individuals to take a higher percentage from one fund to make up a lower percentage from another, would effectively remove the ability for pension funds to manage their affairs.</p>

It is for the pension scheme to decide what benefits it wants to pay and for the individual to decide how to take them, within the framework that the legislation provides.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o514"><a name="90708-0022.htm_para6"><a name="09070891000172">As I said, the tax rules have to cater for a large number of individuals and different circumstances.

<p><a name="stpa_o515"><a name="90708-0022.htm_para7"><a name="09070891000173">Of course the Government keep all tax policy under review, but the rules cannot cater for all circumstances and it would be unrealistic to change them to try to do so.
