 I congratulate the Secretary of State on his elevation, or whatever it is. When he does visit the Parliament, could he find out&#151;by means of a bit of detective work, perhaps&#151;why all Scots get free eye tests, whereas in England that applies only to the elderly, the very young and those on benefits? Is it because the Scots have worse eyes?

<p><a name="st_o4"><a name="60509-01_spnew3"><b> Mr. Alexander: </b> 
 I thank my hon. Friend for his generous words welcoming me to the Dispatch Box. I share his pride in the decision to ban smoking in public places north of the border. As he knows, I recently had an opportunity to visit his constituency, and to see the excellent hotel facilities in Irvine. That hotel struck me as a classic example of the type of hostelry that will benefit from the change that the Scottish Executive have announced.

We have huge problems in Scotland, not least in relation to cancer, stroke and heart disease. I believe that the Scottish Executive&#039;s decisive and bold step&#151;endorsed by the Scottish Parliament&#151;in introducing a smoking ban was definitively a step in the right direction.

<p><a name="st_o5"><a name="60509-01_spmin1"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland  (David Cairns): </b> 
 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State and I regularly engage with a wide range of organisations in Scotland, including the Disability Rights Commission, whose members I expect to meet again in the near future.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o6"><a name="60509-01_spnew4"><b> Mr. Clarke: </b> 
 Is my hon. Friend aware of the recent statement by the Disability Rights Commission that it costs three times as much to bring up a disabled child as it does to bring up a non-disabled child, and that 84 per cent. of the mothers of disabled children are unemployed? Will he continue to promote, with the DRC and others, the Government&#039;s view that employment is pivotal to dealing with the problem of child poverty&#151;including poverty among disabled children&#151;as one of the most positive aspects of the Government&#039;s achievements?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o7"><a name="60509-01_spnew5"><b> David Cairns: </b> 
 I am happy to endorse what my right hon. Friend has said. It is, of course, owing in no small measure to his campaigning work over many years that we have a Disability Discrimination Act&#151;the 1995 Act&#151;and the Disability Rights Commission, which has done tremendous things in promoting the basic human and civil rights of disabled people.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-01_para4">
<a name="stpa_o4">My right hon. Friend is right to point out that work is the best route out of poverty for everyone. We should concentrate less on people&#039;s disability or incapacity, and more on the capacity that they have. When we are trying to reform incapacity benefit, it is important for us not to write off disabled people, but to work with them to find out what meaningful work they can do.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-01_para5">
<a name="stpa_o5">My right hon. Friend is also right to refer to the higher costs incurred by families bringing up disabled children. The Scottish Executive have an excellent scheme involving relatively modest but very helpful grants for families. The overall budget for the scheme is about &#163;2 million, which I think constitutes recognition of the facts mentioned by my right hon. Friend.

<p><a name="st_o8"><a name="60509-01_spnew6"><b> Malcolm Bruce  (Gordon)</b> 
 (LD): Will the Minister reflect on the fact that last week was deaf awareness week? Finland, whose population is comparable to Scotland&#039;s, has more than 600 sign language interpreters, whereas Scotland has fewer than 30. What will the Minister do to promote training in and greater use of sign language, so that those for whom it is the primary language&#151;a minority British language&#151;will be able to use it much more frequently?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o9"><a name="60509-01_spnew7"><b> David Cairns: </b> 
 I pay tribute to the hon. Gentleman for the work that he has done in connection with this issue, and for raising what is a serious and important matter. I have no specific information about the number of sign language interpreters, although I do not quibble with what the hon. Gentleman said. Of course, such matters are primarily a matter for the Scottish Executive, but in creating the new commission for equality and human rights the Government intend to put them at the top of the political agenda, and to give disabled people and others a strong voice that will be heard much more clearly throughout society when they work in concert. I am sure that the commission will want to take up the issue of what help and support are available to deaf people.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o10"><a name="60509-01_spnew8"><b> Mr. David Marshall  (Glasgow, East)</b> 
 (Lab): While I welcome the creation of the new commission for equality and human rights, there are considerable and legitimate fears in some quarters that it will dilute the voice and influence of disability rights campaigners. What reassurances can my hon. Friend give the House that the concerns of disabled people will be at the heart of the new commission&#039;s work?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o11"><a name="60509-01_spnew9"><b> David Cairns: </b> 
 My hon. Friend raises an entirely genuine and perfectly valid issue. Of course, as I said a moment ago, the whole point of creating the new commission for equality and human rights was to raise the profile of the agenda for all the various bodies that will be part of the commission. In order to recognise the central importance of the rights of disabled people, the commission will have a specified disability committee, 50 per cent. of whom will be disabled people, and one of the commissioners will be a disabled person. So the work that the Disability Rights Commission has set out will be taken up by the new commission, and although I accept that the dilution to which my hon. Friend referred is a genuine fear, we do not expect it to occur.

<p><a name="st_o13"><a name="60509-01_spnew10"><b> Miss McIntosh: </b> 
 It would be helpful to know what issues the Advocate-General considered.

</p>





<p><a name="st_o14"><a name="60509-01_spnew11"><b> David Cairns: </b> 
 On the hon. Lady&#039;s first point, of the 102 devolution issues intimated to the Advocate-General, 69 were civil proceedings and 33 were devolution minutes intimated in criminal proceedings. On her main question, this matter is before the courts and I am not going to comment on it.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o15"><a name="60509-01_spnew12"><b> Mr. Alex Salmond  (Banff and Buchan)</b> 
 (SNP): I welcome the Secretary of State to his new post. Can the Minister say whether the Advocate-General is going to look at the flow of judicial information from the Home Office to the Scottish Executive? First, the Executive were kept in the dark about the &quot;most wanted&quot; list; then, we were told that Mr. Malkovs was one of the 79 most dangerous people in the country. Now, the sheriff at Peterhead has refused deportation on the ground that Mr. Malkovs has no serious criminal convictions. What on earth is going on, and will any Minister in the Home Office, the Scotland Office or the Scottish Executive&#151;full-time or part-time&#151;take charge of this shambles in order to restore public confidence?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o16"><a name="60509-01_spnew13"><b> David Cairns: </b> 
 I have said on more than one occasion that there should have been greater and better communication between the Home Office and the Scottish Executive. That was one of a number of things that went wrong in the Home Office in respect of this issue, and such communication is now taking place at official level and with the police. It should have taken place before any statement being made in this House, and I am not in any sense attempting to downplay that point. To restore confidence in the system, it is important that now and in future we ensure that foreign nationals who are convicted and sent to prison in this country expect to be deported at the end of their sentence. That does not happen at the moment, even if the system is being administered perfectly. I sincerely hope that the hon. Gentleman&#039;s party will lend its support to any measures that have to be taken, to ensure that what the public expect to happen does happen: that foreign nationals who commit crimes and end up in prison are sent back to their home countries.

 (Con): I, too, convey my best wishes to the new Secretary of State. I am in a unique position, having faced not only him in this House but his redoubtable sister in the Scottish Parliament. Do the Minister and the Secretary of State agree with me that the Advocate-General has a limited legal role to play in dealing with the apparently ever-increasing number of differences between Holyrood and Westminster? Will the Minister therefore agree to establish a review of intergovernmental arrangements, given the increasing likelihood of there being Governments of different persuasions at Holyrood and Westminster?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o18"><a name="60509-01_spnew15"><b> David Cairns: </b> 
 It might help if I remind the hon. Gentleman that the role of the Advocate-General is to advise the UK Government on issues relating to Scots law, so it does not come into play in the hypothetical case that he mentioned. Of course, what does more to 

<br>&nbsp;<br>

<p><a name="st_o20"><a name="60509-01_spnew17"><b> David Mundell: </b> 
 Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I am disappointed that even under the tutelage of the new Secretary of State, the Minister is sticking to the old tune and the complacency that such issues can be dealt with under Labour&#039;s old boys&#039; network. Is he aware that the independent Social Science Research Council has identified the need to ensure that the general machinery of intergovernmental relationships works, along with the necessary transparency and accountability? When will he and the Secretary of State deliver that?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o21"><a name="60509-01_spnew18"><b> David Cairns: </b> 
 I believe that that is exactly what we have. This Government created the Scottish Parliament&#151;a legitimate demand of the Scottish people that his party denied for many years&#151;and he campaigned against its creation. We will not take any lessons from him on how the Parliaments should relate to each other, given his wholehearted lifelong opposition to the Scottish Parliament.

However, we should not forget that the oil and gas industries are not the only ones generating economic prosperity and growth, in the north-east of Scotland and across the country as a whole.

 My right hon. Friend and I regularly meet ministerial colleagues and discuss a range of issues. The universal service obligation for postal services in Scotland is a matter for the postal services regulator, Postcomm.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o48"><a name="60509-03_spnew0"><b> Sir Robert Smith: </b> 
 I am concerned that the Minister has not looked further into the figures; he would then have realised that if we are to maintain a post office network to serve our constituents in rural Scotland it cannot be done on the back of the Royal Mail&#039;s universal service obligation, which has only a minimal base. It will be crucial for the Government to ensure both that business can still be done over the counter for the collection of benefits and pensions and the survival of the Post Office card account.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o49"><a name="60509-03_spnew1"><b> David Cairns: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman is aware that no decisions have been taken about the size and shape of the post office network, following either the 2006&#150;08 period or the end of the Post Office card account in 2010. The track record of the Government,

When my hon. Friend meets colleagues at the Department of Trade and Industry, will he discuss seriously the withdrawal of that proposal? It will save some money for the Department for Work and Pensions, but will cause deep offence and concern to the pensioners in our society.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o52"><a name="60509-03_spnew4"><b> David Cairns: </b> 
 The facts of the matter are that more than 70 per cent. of those who have a Post Office card account also have a bank account and that all the Scottish banks offer basic bank accounts through the Post Office. If individuals still wish to receive their benefits at the Post Office using some form of basic bank account after POCA, there is absolutely no reason why they cannot do so; but of course, the shape and future of the Post Office will be driven largely by the approach of consumers to such things. We must reflect the change in the way that consumers do their shopping and gain access to services, but we have invested massively in the post office network, and we will continue to do so, because we believe in the value of it.

<p><a name="st_o53"><a name="60509-03_spnew5"><b> Mr. Mike Weir  (Angus)</b> 
 (SNP): The Minister continues to show incredible complacency in respect of the Post Office, when he says that no decision has been made. Decisions are being made daily: the removal of benefits, the ending of support for POCA and the removal of TV licence and Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency business from the Post Office are causing post offices to close now, because their business is disappearing. It is no good saying that there is a universal service obligation if there is nothing to sustain it. Will he make sure that the Government take action to stop business going from post offices and that sub-post offices remain to ensure that that service obligation can continue?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o54"><a name="60509-03_spnew6"><b> David Cairns: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman is confusing the universal service obligation on postal services with services that are available across the counter. We are not withdrawing benefits or ending people&#039;s ability to pay their road tax at post offices. What we are doing is giving people the choice. We are allowing people to exercise that choice. If he had his way, the Post Office would wither on the vine, because he would not make the investment that we have made in sustaining it and allowing it to gain access to universal banking. I am afraid that his solution would simply consign the Post Office to history.

 My hon. Friend makes a very important point. More women are going into the legal profession, but they do not necessary rise up the profession, partly because the way the Bar works is very difficult to combine with family responsibilities. The solicitors&#039; profession has the same problem with women going into the profession but not necessarily rising to partnership. It is not just a question of the numbers, but of where women are in the system and ensuring that they can contribute at all levels of the legal profession.

 In 2004&#150;05, the level of unpaid fines, costs and compensation was 19 per cent.

We have increased the level of payments to 83 per cent., but there is still a long way to go.

Secondly, a    non-attendance conviction should attract an incremental payment if the offender does not pay by the due date, just as is the case for on-the-spot fines, parking fines and so on.

 My hon. Friend is right. I hope that he will see the change in the machinery of government as one of the smooth transitions that we in the Labour party are so keen on.

 As the provisional calendar for the remainder of this Session was announced in November last, the authorities have now made their maintenance plans, and right hon. and hon.

It would therefore not be feasible to reinstate the September sitting for this year, although I hasten to point out that the House has to make its decision on that and has yet to do so.

Had he chosen to do that on 26 July, it would have been 76 days before any Member of the House could have questioned the new Government. Does the right hon.

What the House has to appreciate is that there is a choice between having September Sessions and short vacations for half-terms, or having no September sittings and no vacations for half-terms. There are 11 weeks between the end of July and early October. It would be unacceptable if the House ended up sitting for less time than it did under the previous arrangements. It is a matter for the House. These decisions are made on a motion that is not before the House, but will be shortly. For this year, the matter is done and dusted.

Obviously, we carry out our duties in our constituencies&#151;casework and the rest of it&#151;but we are not allowed during that time to carry out the main job for which we were elected.

 On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. As you will know, the Identity Cards Act 2006 received Royal Assent on 30 March this year. The Government described it as one of their &quot;flagship Bills&quot;, which was designed to protect us from and to deter all manner of crimes, such as terrorism, benefit fraud, identity fraud, breaches of immigration law and other serious crime. Now is not the time to rehearse the arguments that I deployed against that piece of legislation in the time permitted to us by the Government since last June. Have you, Mr. Speaker, received a request not from the old Home Secretary, but from the new Home Secretary to make a statement to the House explaining the Government&#039;s incompetence in repealing by means of the Identity Cards Act 2006 section 5 of the Forgery and Counterfeiting Act 1981, under which it was an offence punishable by up to 10 years&#039; imprisonment to possess with intent to deceive forged passports and other travel documents, money orders, postal orders, postage stamps, Inland Revenue stamps, share certificates, cheques, travellers cheques, bankers drafts, debit and credit cards and certified copies of entries in certain registers such as those for births, deaths and marriages?

<a name="stpa_1">This is yet another sad tale of a failing Home Office. This time, it is failing to protect people from the misuse of crystal meth, which is seriously bad news for individuals who use it and for society at large.
</p>

<a name="stpa_3">He bases his view on hard evidence and experience. UK Sky TV news coverage showed the drug&#039;s impact on individuals and called for Government action before use of this nasty drug becomes endemic. But the Home Office says that it is not yet very prevalent in the UK and that, in effect, they will reclassify when a greater number of people have been damaged and communities are suffering more serious consequences. That is hardly the precautionary approach that the public deserve. It is hardly the action of a Government who care about their young people or want to minimise the impact of drug abuse on society.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-06_para5">
<a name="stpa_4">Methylamphetamine is one of a group of psychostimulant drugs called amphetamines that act on the brain and nervous system. It is produced in tablet, powder or crystalline form. It is taken orally, snorted or injected, but unlike amphetamine, it can be smoked.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-06_para6">
<a name="stpa_5">The term &quot;crystal meth&quot; is often used for the purer crystalline form. The drug&#039;s street names include &quot;yaba&quot; for tablet form, &quot;ice&quot;, &quot;glass&quot;, &quot;Tina&quot;, &quot;Christine&quot; and &quot;Nazi crank&quot;. It was first developed in 1919 and used by troops to keep awake. It was rumoured that Hitler injected it twice a day, hence the name &quot;Nazi crank&quot;. The chances of getting hooked are incredible compared with other illicit drugs. Psychological and physical dependence happens quickly. It affects the brain reward pathways. Users must take more to achieve the same effects, as tolerance quickly builds up. Using the drug by intravenous injection or smoking is especially likely to cause addiction. Smoking the purer, crystalline form produces an intense rush, similar to that of crack cocaine, but much longer lasting&#151;not only minutes but four to 12 hours. That is highly reinforcing and becomes highly addictive. The higher potency, especially when smoked, makes the drug a greater threat. It is, all too often, a one-drag-and-you&#039;re-hooked drug.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-06_para7">
<a name="stpa_6">The drug&#039;s effects are appalling. They include agitation, paranoia, confusion and violence, usually against innocent bystanders. It damages more than those who take it. It can bring on feelings of exhilaration and produces increased arousal and activity levels. It causes a rapid rise in heart rate and blood pressure, and the higher the dose, the greater the effects.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-06_para8">
<a name="stpa_7">The risks are enormous. Methylamphetamine-induced psychosis has been widely reported in countries where use has become endemic. High dosages lead to strokes and pulmonary, renal and gastrointestinal disorders. Coma and death can and do follow. It is a much more serious drug than the class A ecstasy that

<p>
<a name="60509-06_para9">
<a name="stpa_8">Methylamphetamine is often injected, with sharing of paraphernalia and all the consequences of infection. The drug also increases libido and risky sexual behaviour, thereby increasing blood-borne virus transmission. Home Office research shows that the drug is especially used by the homosexual community. It is disastrous for that group to reduce sexual inhibitions or undertake ever more risky behaviour.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-06_para10">
<a name="stpa_9">Methylamphetamine is currently a class B drug under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971. That historical classification results from the drug&#039;s chemical association with amphetamines, which were all classified B. The Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs, which reports to and advises the Government on the classification of drugs, is as dysfunctional as the Home Office. It meets just twice a year with a quorum of only seven, but comprises 38 people, some of whom are caring, knowledgeable, professional and sensible. However, too many represent a neo-liberal, politically correct rag-bag, who appear to make decisions without excessive reference to the evidence and the consequences.

However, that undermines one of the key tenets of the United Kingdom&#039;s drug laws, which is that the more dangerous drugs should be placed in higher, not lower, categories because of the greater risks attached to them.

So I call on the new Home Secretary to bring forward that review urgently, and to change the drug classification system to a more consistent and rational one.

 I will not keep the House for long, but I have to comment on the farrago of nonsense that we have just heard. The hon. Member for Castle Point (Bob Spink) has a very old-fashioned view on this matter.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-07_para0">
<a name="stpa_20">Of course the Government cannot control the precursors of methylamphetamine, because they are used for a multitude of purposes. Controlling them would be entirely impractical. The hon. Gentleman has drawn to our attention a drug that is very little used in this country, and given a highly coloured account of its effects. Like many other drugs, including medicinal drugs, it certainly can have those dangerous effects in some cases, but in other cases it does not. It is used as a recreational drug, and, as the hon. Gentleman rightly said, it was used as a medicine for a number of years after it was first invented, particularly in the services.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-07_para1">
<a name="stpa_21">However, the hon. Gentleman has failed to make the case relating to the connection between the category in which the drug is placed and the uses of the drug. He naively believes that if we put the drug into a higher category, its use will decrease, but that is entirely untrue. The categories were created in 1971, when there were 1,000 people addicted to heroin and cocaine in Britain. 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>9 May 2006 : Column 170</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Heroin and cocaine have been class A drugs ever since then, yet the number of addicts now stands at 280,000. If we were going to place all harmful drugs in an appropriate classification, we should put alcohol and tobacco into class A because of the harm that they cause.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-07_para2">
<a name="stpa_22">The hon. Gentleman seems to believe the great myth that was prevalent in 1971, when the United Nations decided that it was going to get rid of drugs all over the world. There was to be a great united effort from every country. However, the result was entirely perverse. In the subsequent years, we have seen a great increase in the use of drugs throughout the countries that signed up to the United Nations convention. We are now supporting a convention established by the UN in 1998, which states that we will aim for the &quot;elimination&quot; of all drug use, and of the growing of poppies and the plants for cannabis and cocaine production, within 10 years. That period ends in 2008, yet the world has made absolutely no progress towards achieving that aim.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-07_para3">
<a name="stpa_23">People believe that prohibition works, but we need only to consider our own experience in Afghanistan, where the British taxpayer has spent &#163;115 million to eliminate poppy growth. The evidence suggests that next year will see a record growth of heroin poppies there. In Colombia, the Americans have spent $4.7 billion on Plan Colombia, but next year will see a 20 per cent. growth in the coca crops there.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-07_para4">
<a name="stpa_24">The lesson for this Bill is that prohibition of drugs does not work; it creates a market, which enriches itself through greater sales. We should not change the classification, which will have no effect. The hon. Gentleman speaks with disrespect of the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs, but it said that cannabis should change category, which resulted not in an increase in cannabis use in Britain but a decrease. He must accept the logic of that. He is saying that we should carry on with a failed policy from the past, but what we should do is learn from the experience of those such as the Benelux countries, Germany and Australia, but principally Portugal, which in 2001 de-penalised all drugs. As a result, the number of drug deaths in Portugal is now half what it was in 2001. The Bill is misguided.

That this House notes the current financial crisis and associated job losses, ward and bed closures and service reductions in the NHS; believes that these are consequences primarily of the failures of management at the Department of Health; further notes the Secretary of State for Health&#039;s denial of responsibility for this situation and her failure to recognise the realities within the NHS; sees a lack of leadership within the Department of Health; and, in addition to turnaround teams in NHS Trusts, calls on the Government to appoint a turnaround team to the Department of Health.
<br>



<p><a name="st_15">With all the difficulties that the Government have experienced, it is good to see, in the first line of their amendment, that they still have a sense of humour. I welcome new Ministers to the Department of Health. I bid farewell, although I do not think that they are present, to the right hon. Member for Liverpool, Wavertree (Jane Kennedy) and the hon. Member for Birmingham, Hodge Hill (Mr. Byrne), who have gone in different directions. Although we have not agreed on policies, we have always enjoyed good personal relations. I thank them for the tasks that they performed at the Department of Health.</p>





<p><a name="st_16">I welcome the Minister of State, Department of Health, the hon. Member for Leigh (Andy Burnham) and the Under-Secretary of State for Health, the hon. Member for Bury, South (Mr. Lewis) to their posts, but I warn them that it is not a happy ship. The Secretary of State has lost the confidence of hard-working NHS staff. She and her team have lost the trust of the British people to manage the NHS effectively. The public want value for money, and they want an NHS that is given the freedom and responsibility to deliver quality services for them. Instead, the Secretary of State and her team have created confusion, instability and inefficiency. The Government, by the same measure that they apply to NHS trusts, are failing. The time has come for them to put a turnaround team into the Department of Health, just as they have imposed such teams on NHS trusts. That is the purpose of the motion.</p>





<p><a name="st_17">In May last year, when the Secretary of State took up her job, she said that she would listen to patients and staff. She visited five hospitals in five weeks, and then for eight months failed to visit any hospital outside London at all. Is it any wonder that she lives on a different planet from the staff of the NHS? When she says that it is the best year ever for the NHS, they say, &quot;Has she any idea of what&#039;s going on?&quot; [Hon. Members: &quot;Who says that?&quot;] The NHS staff say that. They have said it loud and clear.</p>

They know that hospital infections are as bad as ever; that the obsession with targets has cost millions and distorted patient care; that there are fewer district nurses and health visitors to deliver care closer to home; that despite that, beds are being closed, job vacancies frozen and jobs cut in local hospitals; that newly trained nurses and physiotherapists cannot find jobs; that the number of managers has doubled while financial management remains poor; that key new screening programmes are being delayed; that public health targets are being missed; that health inequalities are widening; and that there is utter confusion over further NHS reorganisation.</p>

They know, for example&#151;the Government mention it in their amendment&#151;that the use of statins and stents can reduce the number of deaths from coronary heart disease.

People in Oxfordshire are really angry.

<a name="stpa_29">I want to make it clear to the House that this is not just a recent problem; there has been a catalogue of failures under the Secretary of State&#039;s stewardship. In July, the NHS chief executive sent out instructions for strategic health authority and primary care trust reconfiguration, which, he said, were in line with the Government&#039;s policy of separating commissioning from the provider role. By November, however, the Secretary of State was apologising for that and making it completely unclear whether PCTs would be provider bodies.

However, within two weeks she was in hospital, having the operation that she needed. She is also diabetic, and the treatment that she received was impeccable: the hospital ensured that the treatments for her diabetes and for her breast cancer were in harmony. Does the hon.

 It is worth bearing in mind the fact that the hon. Gentleman and his party have voted against extra money for the NHS on every occasion. Is it a fact that the general deficit for the NHS for the year just gone was around 1 per cent., and in 1996&#150;97 it was 1.5 per cent.? Deficits under this Government have been lower than under the Tories.

<p><a name="st_41"><a name="60509-09_spnew1"><b> Mr. Lansley: </b> 
 It is a fact that in the year of the 1997 general election NHS bodies started spending money virtually without constraint, in the expectation that a Labour Government would bail them out. My right hon. Friend the Member for Charnwood (Mr. Dorrell) might recall that. The hon. Gentleman is also right to say that the deficit for the year just gone probably will be about 1 per cent. of NHS resources. However, the NHS is a body that is voted a certain sum of money by Parliament, and for it to spend more than that is serious. In my book, several hundred million pounds is very serious.

<a name="stpa_33">It is also true that between 1997 and 2002 there were no system-wide deficits in the NHS, but hospital trusts in England finished the year before last with an accumulated deficit of some &#163;300 million. They finished 2004&#150;05 with a deficit of some &#163;600 million, and they will have finished the last financial year with a deficit of some &#163;1.1 billion. The hon. Gentleman and many other Labour Members will be wondering why strategic health authorities are cutting a third of their additional allocation to primary care trusts this year to hold the sum as a reserve.

If they are asked, albeit rather arbitrarily, to increase efficiency savings from 1.7 per cent. for the previous year to 2.5 per cent. this year, that constitutes an effort to try to deliver greater efficiency, although it has not been accompanied by any measures to help it to happen. What many staff of NHS trusts object to is that the tariff is being manipulated at the same time, so that last year they had a 7.1 per cent. uplift for pay, prices and costs, and a 5.3 per cent. increase in tariff. This year they will have a 6.5 per cent. uplift for pay, prices and costs but only a 1.5 per cent. increase in tariff. That is why hospitals in many parts of the country find that they have no alternative. Their PCTs will not send them any more patients, and say that there is a limited financial envelope for their activity. The tariff being paid does not reflect the costs that the Government have imposed.

 The present NHS deficits are a major issue, but senior members of my hospital in Shrewsbury came to see me as early as autumn 2004 to tell me that they were facing huge deficits in the future.

 I visited that hospital with my hon. Friend and can vouch for the fact those problems were emerging at that time, but we do not need to speculate about how the Government were trying to cover things up in the run-up to the election. The present Secretary of State for Work and Pensions was a health Minister before that election, and in March 2005 he said, &quot;Don&#039;t worry about it. At this time of year they&#039;re always predicting deficits and it always turns out all right.&quot; After the election, the red ink was all over the books.

 I am very interested that my right hon. Friend should raise that point, as I want to deal with happened in respect of pay and contracts in December. When the pay review bodies reported, the Prime Minister said that he was proud to be paying NHS staff more, but Labour Members will recall that the Secretary of State met those bodies in December. Although the Department of Health had stated in September that it accepted a pay rise of 2.5 per cent. for NHS staff, she wanted the pay increases for nurses and doctors to be reduced to 2 per cent. and 1 per cent., respectively.

 I have always made it clear that we support payment by results and a national tariff, but the hon. Lady asks an interesting question. In the three months leading up to the end of the last financial year, the tariff could have been amended in a way that would have assisted the NHS dramatically. In December last year, some hospitals had capacity. However, the PCTs that were running out of money told hospitals to delay treating patients until the end of the six-month waiting time, with the result that operating theatres and staff sat idle. Why could not the national tariff be amended to allow hospitals and their local PCTs to agree marginal pricing arrangements? When we debated the 2003 legislation in Committee, we argued for such flexibility, as my right hon. Friend the Member for North-West Hampshire (Sir George Young) will confirm, but the right hon. Member for Barrow and Furness (Mr. Hutton) and the Government resisted it. We asked whether, if a hospital could offer marginal capacity at a marginal price, the NHS should be able to buy it. The answer was &quot;No&quot;. That is ridiculous and damaging, but that was the Government&#039;s policy.

If a hospital restores itself to recurrent financial balance, with prospective financial stability, and can meet the authorisation criteria to become a foundation hospital, the Government should be prepared to turn past deficits into public dividend capital for a new foundation hospital.

<a name="stpa_64">The hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley) spent the past 40 minutes telling us about everything that he thinks he is wrong with the national health service. A year ago, he was telling people that he believed in the patients&#039; passport&#151;taking money out of the NHS to put into private care. He says now that he has changed his mind and that he really believes in the NHS. Four years ago, he voted against more money for   the NHS. Now he and his right hon. and hon.

<a name="stpa_66">That was under the Conservative Government. In 2006, no patients were waiting on trolleys for hours on end. There was a maximum wait in accident and emergency of just four hours. That is a turnaround. It is a target that the Conservative party said could never be met and should never be set. It is another example of what the Conservative party describes as Government interference. However, it is a target that NHS staff&#151;more of them than ever before&#151;are delivering. There is a new hospital to be built at Queen Mary&#039;s in addition to 81 new hospitals since 1997, and there are many more to come.

 The title of the debate relates to management of the NHS. Does the Secretary of State agree that promises given by the Government should be fulfilled? One was that when hospitals merged, their debts would be wiped out. Ministers in the right hon. Lady&#039;s Department have confirmed that that is the case. However, when Shrewsbury merged with Telford the existing &#163;3 million debt was not wiped out and was instead brought forward. Will the right hon. Lady look into that, because it is causing terrible problems for my hospital?
</p>





<p><a name="st_70"><a name="60509-12_spnew1"><b> Ms Hewitt: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman and I have discussed that matter before. He needs to accept, as do other hon. Members, that these so-called historic deficits are simply previous years of overspending. All too often, that overspending has been matched by underspending in far poorer parts of the country. The hon. Gentleman must face the fact that if a deficit is to be wiped out in one organisation, the money must come from somewhere else.
</p>





<p><a name="st_71"><a name="60509-12_spnew2"><b> Mr. Crispin Blunt  (Reigate) (Con):</b> 
 The right hon. Lady knows that the Surrey and Sussex trust has suffered the most disgraceful political interference and has not been allowed to manage its own affairs. The deficit has been about &#163;10 million a year to keep Crawley hospital open as a full functioning hospital. Her Department approved the reform plans put forward by the trust, but then placed a moratorium upon them. 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>9 May 2006 : Column 185</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>It is to be hoped that the local managers will be given the opportunity to manage. There have been five years of political interference in the interests of the Labour party. This is an absolute disgrace, and the right hon. Lady should apologise.

 No doubt the hon.

I believe, and the people of Crawley believe, that there should be a community hospital in Crawley. That is exactly the plan that the local primary care trust is working on.

 No, I will not. I wish that the hon. Member for Reigate (Mr. Blunt) had acknowledged that in the East Surrey PCT, where more than 600 people used to wait more than 13 weeks for their first out-patient appointment, there are no patients now waiting for such an appointment. There used to be more than 500 people&#151;in fact, there were once more 1,000 people&#151;waiting more than six months for an operation, but now no one waits for an operation for more than six months. That is turnaround.

<a name="60509-12_para0">
<a name="stpa_67">We know very well how much more there is to do, because we created the NHS in the teeth of Conservative opposition, and we believe in it. We know, too, that we need investment and renewal to meet the growing needs of an ageing population, to exploit all advances in medical knowledge, to match the scale of rising expectation, and to match our ambitions for the health service. That is why we made the difficult decision to ask people to pay higher contributions to fund record investment in the NHS&#151;money that the Opposition voted against.
</p>





<p><a name="st_78"><a name="60509-12_spnew8"><b> Mr. Owen Paterson  (North Shropshire) (Con):</b> 
 On higher contributions, two patients with early-stage breast cancer in the Royal Shrewsbury hospital receive Herceptin. That treatment is funded by the British taxpayer, but those patients have paid taxes all their lives and I wish them luck. Someone with early-stage breast cancer who has a Shropshire address must find &#163;47,000 on top of all the taxes that they and their family have paid throughout their life, or they face the prospect of dying. Will the Secretary of State meet some of those ladies? I wrote to her three times in the past month, but she would not reply. Thanks to the prompting of the previous Leader of the House and a written question, I received a reply from the Minister of State, Department of Health, the hon. Member for Doncaster, Central (Ms Winterton), but she did not answer the question. Will the Secretary of State meet those ladies?
</p>

 The hon. Gentleman knows that treatment for women with breast cancer is faster and better than it was under the Opposition. He knows very

<br>&nbsp;<br>well&#151;he should know&#151;that death rates from breast cancer have fallen faster in this country than in almost every other country. He knows, too, that as Herceptin has not been licensed or evaluated for treatment of early-stage breast cancer, those difficult decisions must be made by the local NHS. However, we have speeded up evaluation by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence and independent experts&#151;not by Ministers&#151;to ensure that treatments for NHS patients are available everywhere.

 One of the right hon. Lady&#039;s reforms could be very helpful, as it proposes to use more private treatment centres offering specialist services to provide high-quality fast treatment. How far will that extend, and how many treatments will there be in, for example, two years&#039; time?
</p>





<p><a name="st_81"><a name="60509-12_spnew11"><b> Ms Hewitt: </b> 
 As the right hon. Gentleman knows very well, we have indeed used independent sector treatment centres, just as we have used spare capacity in the private sector to ensure that NHS patients receive the fastest possible care, all of it free at the point of need. The ISTC programme will continue, and I estimate that when we complete wave 2, about 10 per cent. of elective treatments will be carried out in the independent sector, all of that free at the point of need.

 On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. The Secretary of State will know that when a petition is presented to Parliament it is usual for the Government Department and the Minister responsible to reply. I presented a petition on the loss of thousands of jobs in Staffordshire, but I did not receive a reply. I have presented thousands of letters to the Minister&#151;

 Order. I suspect that that is a point of debate disguised as a point of order, however skilfully, or otherwise. The hon. Gentleman should seek an opportunity to catch my eye so that he can make his point in a different way, and not as a point of order.
</p>





<p><a name="st_86"><a name="60509-12_spnew15"><b> Ms Hewitt: </b> 
 We are making record investment in the NHS, above all in our staff. We have 330,000 more NHS staff than we had in 1997. We have 85,000 more nurses, 10,500 more consultants and more than 32,000 more doctors and hospital dentists. We have more staff delivering faster and better care for more patients than ever before.

<a name="60509-12_para1">
<a name="stpa_68">But renewing the NHS after nearly 20 years of underfunding and neglect by the Conservatives was never going to be easy. That is why I want to tackle head on the financial difficulties that have arisen. The majority of hospitals and primary care trusts are improving patient care, hitting the targets that we have set, and employing more staff and paying them better than ever before, which the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire seems to oppose, and they are doing all that within their budget.

<b>9 May 2006 : Column 187</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>25 April, the then Under-Secretary of State for Health, now the Minister for Policing, Security and Community Safety told me that he would need to &quot;consider what action to take&quot; in response to the threatened closure that I highlighted of the Nuffield speech and language unit, a centre of excellence for 35 years, providing for children with some of the most severe speech and language disorders. Can the right hon. Lady, free of party politics, tell the House what she will do to safeguard that vital national resource? If it is lost, it will not come back.
</p>





<p><a name="st_88"><a name="60509-12_spnew17"><b> Ms Hewitt: </b> 
 I will write directly to the hon. Gentleman on that matter.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-12_para2">
<a name="stpa_69">Although a majority of NHS organisations are making all the improvements I have outlined within their increased budget, a minority are overspending, and some very seriously. Because of that, in the financial year just ended, the NHS as a whole will have overspent by around 1 per cent. of its total budget. That cannot continue, particularly in the 7 per cent.&#151;just 7 per cent., or about 40 organisations&#151;that account for more than 50 per cent. of the deficit.

Can the Secretary of State tell me why it is being asked to cut its budget, when it has always operated within its financial parameters?

<p><a name="st_90"><a name="60509-13_spnew0"><b> Ms Hewitt: </b> 
 I shall come to that point in a little more detail in a moment.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-13_para0">
<a name="stpa_70">The problem with the minority of organisations that are overspending, including many across Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire, is that those problems have an impact on other parts of the NHS, including the mental health trust to which the hon. Gentleman refers, which have been living within their budget.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-13_para1">
<a name="stpa_71">Of course, restoring the NHS to financial balance entails difficult decisions. Nobody wants redundancies, and every hospital and primary care trust will do everything that it can to avoid making a staff member, particularly a front-line clinical member of staff, redundant. Behind almost every story on redundancies, every scare-mongering headline and every figure that the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire uses&#151;he did it again this afternoon&#151;is a hospital that is sensibly cutting back on temporary staff from expensive private agencies, like West Hertfordshire Hospitals Trust. It has a deficit of &#163;28 million and an agency bill of &#163;17 million, and it is going to get that down.
</p>





<p><a name="st_91"><a name="60509-13_spnew1"><b> Mr. Shailesh Vara  (North-West Cambridgeshire) (Con):</b> 
 The Secretary of State speaks of temporary staff not being replaced. What about permanent staff who are leaving and not being replaced in the various institutions?
</p>





<p><a name="st_92"><a name="60509-13_spnew2"><b> Ms Hewitt: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman must decide whether he wants hospitals to become more efficient and effective, and whether he wants more day case surgery, 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>9 May 2006 : Column 188</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>more patients looked after in the community and more emergency admissions avoided, or will he stand in the way of change and progress, and refuse to support hospitals making difficult but right decisions?
</p>





<p><a name="st_93"><a name="60509-13_spnew3"><b> Mr. Lansley: </b> 
 If it is all about agency staff, will the right hon. Lady explain why, over the last two years, the proportion of the NHS pay bill spent on agency staff has declined at the same time when the deficits have ballooned? If it is all about treating patients closer to home, why are intermediate care beds being closed and why are there fewer district nurses and health visitors? Why are these objectives&#151;they are not new to the Secretary of State, as they started with the right hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras (Frank Dobson) in 1998&#151;not being fulfilled?
</p>





<p><a name="st_94"><a name="60509-13_spnew4"><b> Ms Hewitt: </b> 
 Of course spending on agency staff has started to go down, but it has not gone down enough. Does the hon. Gentleman really think that the Barking, Havering and Redbridge hospital, for example, should not reduce its &#163;34 million bill for temporary and agency staff? Does he really think that the Royal Free hospital, which he mentioned, should not reduce its agency bill or reorganise its wards and the use of its permanent staff to give patients more effective care with better value for money?
</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-13_para2">
<a name="stpa_72">Let me provide another example. South Tees hospitals trust has already reduced staff by 300 as it has become more effective, and with just three compulsory redundancies. While it did so, the number of people waiting more than six months for treatment fell from more than 470 to zero. Sandwell and West Birmingham hospitals trust has already cut its costs by &#163;10 million, the equivalent of 200 jobs, but with only one compulsory redundancy. The number of people waiting more than six months for treatment in that trust fell from 23 to zero.
</p>





<p><a name="st_95"><a name="60509-13_spnew5"><b> Mr. Andrew Tyrie  (Chichester) (Con):</b> 
 The right hon. Lady seems to be portraying the whole of the deficit problem as if it were the fault of the hospitals. My constituency has one of the most efficient hospitals in the country and, if it were paid at the full tariff, it would be in surplus. It is in substantial deficit, even though it was viewed as the third best hospital in the country and the best in the south-east last year. Indeed, it has been in the top 40 hospitals in every one of the last six years. It is the only hospital in the country to achieve such a record, but guess what is happening? It is being cut back sharply, so what possible logic can there be in any system of health delivery that does that to such a successful institution?
</p>





<p><a name="st_96"><a name="60509-13_spnew6"><b> Ms Hewitt: </b> 
 We expect every hospital, right across the NHS, to go on becoming more effective and efficient and to go on using all the extraordinary advances in medical technology that enable them to do so. In each area of the country that receives fair funding for its population we expect the NHS to deliver the best possible care for all patients&#151;outside as well as within hospitals&#151;within their allocated budgets.
</p>





<p><a name="st_97"><a name="60509-13_spnew7"><b> John Pugh  (Southport) (LD):</b> 
 Is the Secretary of State seriously suggesting that all the deficits can be wiped out without cutting back on any clinical activity?
</p>





<p><a name="st_98"><a name="60509-13_spnew8"><b> Ms Hewitt: </b> 
 What I am suggesting, as is confirmed by virtually every hospital chief executive and clinical 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>9 May 2006 : Column 189</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>director to whom I have spoken, is that as more day-case surgery is done, patients can be treated better and faster with fewer acute beds and therefore fewer staff in certain jobs. That is not worse care for patients, but better care for patients and better value for money.
</p>





<p><a name="st_99"><a name="60509-13_spnew9"><b> Kali Mountford: </b> 
 I am somewhat surprised to see the Opposition in today&#039;s debate blocking the reform that is so badly needed. Opposition Members used to talk in the past about the reforms that needed to be made to secure value for money. My right hon. Friend has pointed out some very good examples of where change has taken place with minimum disruption. It is important to assure people working in the NHS about their futures and their ability to deliver the best possible service to our population. Will my right hon. Friend share her information with all trusts, so that those experiencing change can do the best they possibly can with it?
</p>





<p><a name="st_100"><a name="60509-13_spnew10"><b> Ms Hewitt: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is right. That is exactly what we are doing through the Modernisation Agency and the NHS institute for improvement. As staff change jobs, and particularly as more services move from hospitals and into the community, we need to support those staff, particularly where they need to change their skills.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-13_para3">
<a name="stpa_73">Let me give the House an example of exactly how the NHS is making those changes in Dudley, where I recently met several of its patients. One is Ron Lane, a gentleman in his 70s who has severe heart disease. He told me that his community nurse now gives him tests and treatment in a couple of hours in his own home that just two years ago used to require an emergency admission and several days in hospital. He told me that his quality of life has been transformed thanks to those community nurses. In just 12 months, thanks to the NHS community nurses in Dudley, 120 patients like Mr. Lane have had more than 500 fewer admissions to hospital.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-13_para4">
<a name="stpa_74">The new acute hospital in Dudley has fewer beds than the old hospital. It needs fewer staff in many of those jobs, and the local NHS is underspending on its hospital budget, so it has more money to put into other improvements for other patients, which provides better care for patients and better value for money. The reforms that we are making, which the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire has said that he supports but has also attacked, and the changes that we are making, with stronger commissioning from GP practices and primary care trusts, will give every part of the NHS the incentive to do what Dudley and many other places are already doing.

 Given what the Secretary of State has just said about the importance of shifting services towards the community, will she take this opportunity to clear up a major policy mix-up for which her Department is responsible? Last July, she announced that it was her policy for PCTs to divest themselves of responsibility for service delivery. Is that still her policy?
</p>





<p><a name="st_102"><a name="60509-13_spnew12"><b> Ms Hewitt: </b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>9 May 2006 : Column 190</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>will continue to employ staff in the community and to provide services. That is a matter for them and for their patients and users, and there is no requirement for them to divest.
</p>





<p><a name="st_103"><a name="60509-13_spnew13"><b> Tom Levitt  (High Peak) (Lab):</b> 
 I can confirm that the Secretary of State gave me that answer on 25 October. Will my right hon. Friend confirm that when Labour entered office, one of the problems that we had to address was that areas in which health needs were greatest were, relatively speaking, underfunded compared with more affluent areas? We have been addressing that problem, and it would be wrong to continue a system where health surpluses in areas of high health treatment need were subsidising more affluent areas, which was the case in the past.
</p>





<p><a name="st_104"><a name="60509-13_spnew14"><b> Ms Hewitt: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is absolutely right. When we reviewed the funding formula a couple of years ago, we found that some of the poorest areas in the country with the worst health problems were anything up to 20 per cent. below their target funding, while other healthier and wealthier areas were between 15 and 25 per cent. above their target funding, and we are changing that situation. In the old NHS, over-spending in one place was simply compensated for by underspending elsewhere. As my hon. Friend said, that was not only unfair, but utterly ineffective, because overspending areas had no incentive to put their houses in order. Our changes and reforms have not created those problems, they have revealed them, and now they are helping to correct them.

 While many of us would agree with some of the health reforms that the Government are proposing, particularly as regards delivering health care in the local community, how is it that they are bringing back cuts in the district general hospital in my constituency, the Princess Royal, while at the same time cutting back on the very community hospitals through which they are suggesting that they want to deliver their reforms?

 On community hospitals, I made it very clear in the White Paper in January that any local NHS that was proposing to cut or close a cottage hospital or community hospital should look again at that decision in the light of strategy to get more services not only into community hospitals but into people&#039;s own homes. I am glad to say that those changes have already been made in some parts of the country.

 The right hon. Lady says that she called on local primary care trusts to turn around any decisions that they may have taken locally to close community hospitals for purely financial reasons. Will she have a particular word with the Kennet and North Wiltshire PCT, which is consulting on closing seven community hospitals? Its chief executive has said that she is determined to close them, despite what the Secretary of State says, because she is the Margaret Thatcher of the national health service, and the lady is not for turning.

 As the hon. Gentleman knows full well, every part of the NHS that is proposing such changes has to consult its local patients and users and to seek the approval of the strategic health authority. We have already promised a new generation of at least 50 community hospitals, because some existing cottage hospitals are not providing the right services, are not in the right buildings, and will need to change.

Rather than being the salvation of the NHS, as we heard in the speech of the hon.

<a name="stpa_89">Many of the reforms are not inherently bad; the idea that the NHS should know what its costs are seems entirely good. However, the reforms have not been co-ordinated, planned, phased and staged; they have come helter-skelter, all at once, and have not been effectively implemented. One example of that is the failed implementation of the new tariff for children&#039;s specialist services, about which, it is reported, the former Minister of State, the right hon. Member for Liverpool, Wavertree (Jane Kennedy), resigned, although I do not know whether that is the case, and I am happy to be corrected. We have raised the issue of specialist children&#039;s hospitals, such as Alder Hey, Great Ormond Street and others, which are saying that the amount of money that they get for doing the clever things that they do for sick children is not sufficient to meet their costs.

 My right hon. Friend the Member for Liverpool, Wavertree (Jane Kennedy) did not decide to leave the Government because of Alder Hey. It was a completely separate issue, to do with the independent appointments to NHS posts. On the subject of Alder Hey and specialist children&#039;s hospitals, however, let me make something absolutely clear. More work is needed on the specialist tariffs, and we are doing that work in conjunction with the children&#039;s hospitals; but the top-up to the tariff that we give those hospitals has been increased. Last year it was 53 per cent. over and above 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>9 May 2006 : Column 197</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>the normal tariff, and this year the figure will be 69 per cent. We shall go on working with Alder Hey and the other outstanding children&#039;s hospitals to ensure that their essential work continues.
</p>





<p><a name="st_150"><a name="60509-16_spnew3"><b> Steve Webb: </b> 
 I shall be delighted if that proves to be the case, but the letter issued by Alder Hey and others only weeks ago suggested that there were multi-million-pound deficits because of the inadequacy of the tariff. The situation is extraordinary; the new tariff is being introduced very rapidly, people are not having time to adjust to it, and there is a threat to valuable front-line services. What is worrying, and what angers people about the Secretary of State, is that she appears to be out of touch with what is going on.

<p><a name="st_151"><a name="60509-16_spnew4"><b> John Pugh: </b>

 My hon. Friend, who is relatively local to Alder Hey, has raised an important point. What we need are long-term efficiency strategies, long-term reform and structured change. What we are getting are emergency cuts packages, and that is not a rational way in which to run the health service.

 I am grateful to my hon. Friend for making that pertinent point, which is at the heart of my argument. None of us is saying that the health service is perfect, that nothing should change and that no job, once created, should ever go, but we are saying that change should be measured, rational, planned and undertaken according to a long-term strategy. The preventive work to which my hon. Friend referred&#151;smoking cessation and work on childhood obesity&#151;tends to have a long-term payback. It is the first thing to be cut, therefore, because it provides no immediate, tangible benefit.

<a name="60509-16_para5">
<a name="stpa_94">My concern is that so many of the cuts that we hear about are part of emergency cuts packages. When the Secretary of State says that in many cases, these problems have existed for decades and are only now coming to light, she is right, but the answer to solving decades-old problems is not to try to solve them in weeks. The point is not that nothing should ever be changed, but that the Government are trying to make changes at breakneck speed because someone somewhere is in a hurry for a legacy.

<a name="60509-16_para6">
<a name="stpa_95">The Government consistently blame local health services for overspending and inefficiency, yet general practitioner costs, consultants&#039; costs, the tariff and practically all the targets are centrally determined. However, if the numbers do not add up at the end, the fault, apparently, lies at a local level. How can we square that argument? The Government cannot work this one out; what is their responsibility and what is not? If a community hospital closes, it is a local decision; if one opens, it is Government policy. Which is it? They need to decide.

<p><a name="st_161"><a name="60509-16_spnew14"><b> Tim Farron  (Westmorland and Lonsdale) (LD):</b> 
 The Government initially allocated &#163;2.3 billion for the &quot;connecting for health&quot; project, but by their own admission, they are likely to spend &#163;6.2 billion on it. Indeed, experts project that the figure could be as high as &#163;30 billion. Given NHS deficits of some &#163;600 to &#163;800 million and the impact on my constituents of the potential closure of the coronary care unit at Westmoreland general hospital, does my hon. Friend agree that there is a juxtaposition to be made between what are relatively small deficits and vast Government overspending on administrative projects?

<p><a name="st_162"><a name="60509-17_spnew0"><b> Steve Webb: </b> 
 My hon. Friend makes an important point. When a centrally imposed cost falls locally and upsets the financial balance, the cause of the problem is somehow deemed to be local mismanagement. There is a story to be told about the Government&#039;s information technology projects in general and the NHS project in particular, to which we will doubtless return.

<p>
<a name="60509-17_para0">
<a name="stpa_96">Another key issue that has arisen in this debate is waiting. With the best will in the world, I caution the Secretary of State against talking about the Government&#039;s abolishing waiting, because if she does so she will cause real distress and anger. On 13 December, she said:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_24">&quot;By the end of 2008, we will effectively have abolished hospital waiting lists.&quot;</p>
</ul>

<a name="stpa_97">With the greatest of respect, she should think carefully before she repeats that phrase. In many areas of the health service, that assertion is at total variance with people&#039;s experience, and if she goes on making it, she will make herself look a fool.

 I sometimes think that the Government are more interested in spin doctors than real doctors. Last November, the Prime Minister promised that nobody would wait more than six months for an in-patient operation. However, the number waiting for such an operation has been growing month by month.
</p>





<p><a name="st_164"><a name="60509-17_spnew2"><b> Steve Webb: </b> 
 The Government mean something very specific when they use that phrase; however, some people are having to wait much longer than the Government are saying. For example, a lady who came to see me on Friday was told that she will have to wait three and a half years for fertility treatment. Now the Government will say that that does not count, because they are not talking about that sort of waiting list. But if they keep saying that they are getting rid of waiting in the NHS and thousands of people are waiting long times

 I acknowledge that pressure on audiology services is causing problems with waiting times for hearing aids, but we should put the hon. Gentleman&#039;s remarks into context. Will he acknowledge that the investment in digital hearing aids has been good, the investment in hearing testing for newborn babies has been an excellent innovation and the extra demand that has been caused by the popularity of digital hearing aids is partly responsible for the stress on audiology services?
</p>





<p><a name="st_166"><a name="60509-17_spnew4"><b> Steve Webb: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman cannot have it both ways. I do welcome the extra investment in digital hearing aids, but if people have to wait longer because of induced demand, the Secretary of State cannot claim that the Government are abolishing waiting in the NHS.

<p>
<a name="60509-17_para2">
<a name="stpa_98">A case of what waiting is doing to people was drawn to my attention only this week. A consultant at Guy&#039;s and St Thomas&#039; hospital wrote to a lady&#151;who sent a copy of the letter to me&#151;about a genetic blood test for breast cancer. The consultant wrote:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_25">&quot;You remember that testing your blood within the NHS will take somewhere between 6&#150;9 months&quot;.</p>

<p><a name="st_167"><a name="60509-17_spnew5"><b> Anne Milton  (Guildford) (Con):</b> 
 The hon. Gentleman raises an important point about the confusion over waiting lists. There is a huge gap between the Secretary of State and the general public. The Government say that waiting lists are falling, but they are not talking about the sort of issues that constituents come to see me about. Does the hon. Gentleman agree that there is a huge problem not only with waiting lists, but with people being refused tests or treatment? Constituents have been told by the hospital that they need procedures such as PET scans or other tests for Parkinson&#039;s, but that the PCT is not funding them at present. Those people are not waiting, but they are being denied treatment that they need.
</p>





<p><a name="st_168"><a name="60509-17_spnew6"><b> Steve Webb: </b> 
 The hon. Lady raises the important issue of what the NHS does and does not do, which is separate from the issue of waiting. If some people cannot get treatment at all, it is another facet of that problem.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-17_para6">
<a name="stpa_102">We should also talk about what needs to be done. I listened in vain for nearly 45 minutes to the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire for any suggestions, and there is nothing in his motion about what needs to be done. A constructive and effective Opposition says what needs to be done, so I shall point out several measures that need to be taken.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>9 May 2006 : Column 201</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-17_para7">
<a name="stpa_103">The first is that if one accepts the Government&#039;s logic, the NHS should be given greater time to adjust. If one believes in a market directed by incentives&#151;including incentives to be more efficient&#151;it needs time to adjust. Incentives do not work over night. If the NHS is to be restructured, new units built and old ones closed, the effect will take time to be felt. The logic of the Government&#039;s position is that we should not have wholesale reform all at once to be implemented quickly. Instead, change should be phased, staged and managed, but that is not what is happening. One cannot sort out the problems of decades in weeks.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-17_para8">
<a name="stpa_104">The second key aspect is the need, at the very least, for the infamous level playing field between the NHS and the private sector. All too often, the independent treatment centres, which are supposed to be the dynamic, free-market, capitalist competition that will ensure efficiency, are being subsidised and given guaranteed business. That is the exact opposite of what should happen. For example, a doctor wrote to me recently saying:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_28">&quot;One contributing factor&quot;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-17_para9">
<a name="stpa_105">to the problems of the NHS&#151;
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_29">&quot;is the . . . Treatment Centre . . . in Shepton, which is treating straightforward patients for routine ops at an inflated tariff and leaving the more complex cases, as well as sorting out their errors, to the local NHS.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-17_para10">
<a name="stpa_106">He makes an interesting point when he states that the number of staff working there is very similar to the number of redundancies at the Royal United hospital, Bath. He says that that is no surprise, as those staff members are doing the work that the RUH has lost, although at a higher price. That cannot be a rational way to manage efficiency in the health service.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-17_para11">
<a name="stpa_107">The shadow Secretary of State, the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire, asked about what should happen when a district general hospital &quot;loses business&quot;, as the jargon has it. He did not answer his own question, but the logic of the Government&#039;s policy is clear, and it is that district general hospitals may close when their work can be taken up by regional specialisms, treatment centres and GP surgeries. However, have the Government talked to the British public about that? Has there been a debate about whether we think that district general hospitals have a future?
</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-17_para12">
<a name="stpa_108">The answer to both questions is no. We have had no such debate. What is missing most of all from the NHS is real local democratic accountability. The NHS employs 1.3 million people, or one voter in 35. The only person democratically accountable to all those people is the Secretary of State, who has just left the Chamber.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-17_para13">
<a name="stpa_109">I shall give the House an example from my own part of the world. In the former area of Avon, none of the local MPs and councillors, regardless of party, wanted the PCT configuration, but the health authority just said, &quot;Tough.&quot; Where is the democracy and accountability in that?
</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-17_para14">
<a name="stpa_110">That is not merely a constitutional point. We want the NHS to be genuinely accountable and answerable to us not just because we pay for it, but because that would be more efficient. Local people and those whom they elect would be able to scrutinise what went on and ask pertinent questions. At present, they are completely shut out; only one person is accountable for the NHS, and she takes no responsibility for it.

<a name="stpa_111">Over the past nine years, the amount of money going into the NHS has risen from historically low levels to something more credible, but the problem has been the endless interference and issuing of diktats from the centre.

<a name="stpa_114">The Opposition motion mentions the word &quot;turnaround&quot;, but the greatest turnaround in our NHS began in May 1997. It may have taken a couple of years to take effect, but that was when the NHS started to get the expenditure that it had needed for a long time. I have to disagree with my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State when she says that 18 years of Conservative Government took money away from the NHS; the process began in 1976 under Denis Healey when he started to attack the NHS capital expenditure programme&#151;an easy public sector target whenever a Government come under pressure. The cuts have decades of history and the process did not end for a long time, but it has ended over recent years.

Before that I was active in local politics and I heard it there, too. Every time we ask for change in the NHS, we are told, &quot;Yes, but don&#039;t do it now.&quot; I do not say that things could not be done better, but I suspect that the hon. Gentleman is listening to the voices of vested interests&#151;people who work in the NHS and do not want to change. In certain circumstances, it is a great pity that they do not want to.

In March 2000, three years after we took office, more than a quarter of a million people had to wait more than six months for an operation; by December 2005 the number was almost nil.

I am sure that the Health Committee, which I chair, would want to look at examples if patient care is being affected&#151;as opposed to jobs being affected in certain circumstances. There are several things involved. The general secretary of the Royal College of Nursing said on BBC radio that the safety net was being removed from under national health service patients in this country. I challenged her to give evidence of that. To date I have not found any evidence whatsoever. If it is out there, I would like to see it.

<a name="stpa_123">The hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley) did not entirely answer the intervention made by my hon. Friend the Member for Dartford (Dr. Stoate) about seeing suspected cancer cases within two weeks, and the situation that existed before. More than 99 per cent. of suspected cancer cases are now seen within two weeks. That is up from 63 per cent. in 1997. Again, there has been a substantial increase. Those are the figures that the hon. Gentleman should have given.

<p>
<a name="60509-19_para2">
<a name="stpa_124">My final point relates to my earlier intervention on the Gentleman. In my view, we should measure what is happening inside our national health service in terms of 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>9 May 2006 : Column 206</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>its impact on patients, not jobs. The national health service is there primarily for patients, and not as an employer. There were many times when large parts of the public sector were there to provide social employment; that is not the case any more. God knows, in my own constituency, I saw thousands of jobs go from public sector industries that were there for social employment reasons. That is how we should look at the situation now.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-19_para3">
<a name="stpa_125">A MORI poll on public attitudes to our national health service draws attention to users&#039; good personal experience of the NHS. It says that 81 per cent. of hospital users were satisfied with their last visit. In a Populus poll, 70 per cent. said that, based on their own experience, a good service was provided in the NHS. That is not anecdotal evidence. We are not talking about vested interests being shouted out in television studios or conference halls. The polls reflect the views of the people whom the NHS is there for. There is no doubt at all in my mind that in 1997 a turnaround team was put into the Department of Health, and it is working wonders for an area of the public sector that was badly neglected for many years.

<p><a name="st_182"><a name="60509-19_spnew3"><b> Mr. Stephen Dorrell  (Charnwood) (Con):</b> 
 I will begin by following on pretty directly from what the right hon. Member for Rother Valley (Mr. Barron) was saying. On the basis of his speech, I could couple him with the Secretary of State and ask him to reflect on why the reaction that the Secretary of State received to her statement that the NHS had just enjoyed its best year ever was as strong as it was. On the basis of his speech, he is clearly bemused by the reaction that the Secretary of State received and he prefers to believe that it was all got up by a group of Tory politicians and journalists. The right hon. Gentleman and the Secretary of State would serve their cause better if they reflected a little longer on the fact that the Secretary of State&#039;s comment received an intense reaction not just in the political world, but right through the national health service. They might serve themselves better if they set out to understand why people reacted as strongly as they did.
</p>





<p><a name="st_183"><a name="60509-19_spnew4"><b> Mr. Barron: </b> 
 I made this point, in effect, in an earlier intervention. If the statement had been that patients had had a better year, nobody could have grumbled about that, because that is the case. The right hon. Gentleman was a Health Minister so he should know all about the issues inside the health service. We then come to the question of how there could be a so-called spontaneous demonstration at a conference&#151;with hundreds of people sitting there all wearing the same protest T-shirts. The simple answer is that that was not patients being mad at the national health service; it was people who might have to move and change their jobs in the next few years. If that improves patient care, they should get on with it.
</p>





<p><a name="st_184"><a name="60509-19_spnew5"><b> Mr. Dorrell: </b> 
 The right hon. Gentleman was kind enough to refer to the fact that I was once Secretary of State for Health. I have read briefs very similar to the speech that he just made to the House&#151;on occasion, I have even read them to the House. They are no substitute for an honest reflection on why people react to circumstances in the way that they do. He is quite 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>9 May 2006 : Column 207</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>right to say&#151;and the Secretary of State may reasonably reflect&#151;that the national health service has been the beneficiary of record levels of expenditure. He is quite right to say that record numbers of people, in the history of the national health service, were treated last year, record numbers of clinicians were employed and records levels of resources were deployed. Given those facts, why did people dispute the proposition that it was the best year ever? I want to focus on that question, because some important policy conclusions can be drawn from the reasons people reacted in the way that they did.
</p>





<p><a name="st_185"><a name="60509-19_spnew6"><b> Dr. Stoate: </b> 
 Perhaps I can help the right hon. Gentleman to explain why there was such a strong reaction. As someone who worked in the health service and spent a lot of time speaking to people who use the health service and people who work there, I know that the facts are that people have much higher expectations than they had before&#151;and so they should. People expect to have better treatment. They expect to be treated more fairly and more humanely. That is the way things should be, and long may that continue. Things are available now that were not even conceived 10 years ago. As my right hon. Friend the Member for Rother Valley (Mr. Barron) said, most people receive a far better service than they did before&#151;albeit that the health service staff might not entirely always agree with that point.
</p>





<p><a name="st_186"><a name="60509-19_spnew7"><b> Mr. Dorrell: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman is quite right to say that things are being done in the health service now that were not done in 1997. It is equally true that things were being done in the health service in 1997 that were not done in 1987. That is the first point to make when thinking about why the Secretary of State was so misguided as to present her case in the way she did. In fact, in every year of its history, the national health service has used more resources, treated more patients and employed more clinicians. The proposition that everything is better this year than it was last year&#151;or better this year than in 1997&#151;is one that every single Secretary of State for Health from Aneurin Bevan onwards has been able to make, and justify.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-19_para4">
<a name="stpa_126">As my hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley) said, the thing that causes offence in the national health service is the suggestion that that progress, which is the result of the efforts of individual clinicians and employees right through the service, is due to the interventions of politicians&#151;in other words, politicians claiming credit for the endeavours of employees. My hon. Friend was entirely right to say that, in the health service today, there is a broad sense that people are making progress, as the health service has always made progress, but doing so despite the intervention of politicians, rather than because of it. That is the first point.

</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-19_para5">
<a name="stpa_127">Let me move on to the second point. The argument that has not yet surfaced in the debate is that one of the reasons for low morale and demotivation in the health service, as well as one of the reasons for the major waste of resources 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>9 May 2006 : Column 208</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>in the health service in recent years, is the programme of constant reorganisation&#151;the bureaucratic moving round of the deckchairs. Let me briefly recite the Government&#039;s record on the reorganisation of the service.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-19_para6">
<a name="stpa_128">When the right hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras (Frank Dobson) was appointed, he said that he would abolish the internal market, but then the right hon. Member for Darlington (Mr. Milburn) was appointed and said that that was wrong and that the Government would reintroduce foundation hospitals. The present Secretary of State says that the Government were wrong to abolish not only the independent management of hospitals but fundholding, so back comes practice-based commissioning with a deadline of involving every general practitioner in GP fundholding, or practice-based commissioning&#151;they are exactly the same&#151;by December this year.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-19_para7">
<a name="stpa_129">I intervened to ask the Secretary of State about the role of PCTs in the delivery of service, because it is one of the issues on which the Government have caused deep confusion throughout the service in the past 12 months. She said, as though it was somehow clear and everyone knew it, that PCTs would go on being involved in the delivery of community-based health service care. However, that is absolutely not what Ministers have been saying over the past 12 months.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-19_para8">
<a name="stpa_130">It is worth repeating Ministers&#039; words. In July 2005, the Government&#039;s position was:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_30">&quot;PCTs will become patient-led and commissioning-led organisations with their role in provision reduced to a minimum.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-19_para9">
<a name="stpa_131">There was confusion about that and Ministers announced an extension to the deadline, which was originally the end of 2008. When the then Health Minister, who is now Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, gave evidence to the Health Committee on 1 November 2005, he was asked by the hon. Member for Pendle (Mr. Prentice):
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_31">&quot;Are you telling us that the Government is as committed as it ever was to see frontline medical staff move away from employment in Primary Care Trusts? Is that what you are telling us?&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-19_para10">
<a name="stpa_132">The then Health Minister replied:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_32">&quot;I think we have set ourselves a long-term objective, yes, but I think what was clarified was the removal of the 2008 timetable for that.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-19_para11">
<a name="stpa_133">There was thus a statement in July 2005 to say that PCTs would divest themselves of the services. By November, they were still going to do that, but do so without a deadline. However, today, the Secretary of State says that PCTs will not divest themselves of the services. It is small wonder that there is confusion in the service about where the bureaucratic deckchairs will come to rest when Ministers can give three fundamentally different answers in 12 months to a very simple question.

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_33">&quot;I assure my hon. Friend that district nurses, health visitors and other staff who deliver services in the community will continue to be employed by the PCT unless and until it decides otherwise.&quot;&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 25 October 2005; Vol. 438, c. 152.]</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-20_para0">
<a name="stpa_134">Her answer came after a debate that had taken place between July and October because of uncertainties. It means that the decision is in the hands of a PCT and will not be imposed on it.
</p>





<p><a name="st_192"><a name="60509-20_spnew3"><b> Mr. Dorrell: </b> 
 If the Secretary of State said that on 25 October, presumably, since the rest of the world knew that the matter was an issue of the moment, her ministerial colleague was aware of her answer when he gave evidence to the Health Committee on 1 November. Presumably the then Health Minister was expecting to be asked about the matter, yet he said:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_34">&quot;I think we have set ourselves a long-term objective, yes, but I think what was clarified was the removal of the . . . timetable&quot;.</p>
</ul>

<p>
<a name="60509-20_para1">
<a name="stpa_135">What is the Government&#039;s policy on the subject?
</p>





<p><a name="st_193"><a name="60509-20_spnew4"><b> Mr. Lansley: </b> 
 Further to add to the confusion about the policy, the interim chief executive of the NHS more recently told primary care trusts that insofar as they may continue to have a provider role, they must ensure that their governance arrangements wholly separate their commissioning and provider roles. We will thus end up with not just merged PCTs, but bifurcated PCTs.
</p>





<p><a name="st_194"><a name="60509-20_spnew5"><b> Mr. Dorrell: </b> 
 I hope that those who heard the words of the senior manager in the health service will now regard the position as clear, although I gather from my hon. Friend&#039;s tone that it is not clear to him. It is certainly not clear to me whether PCTs in the long run will, as the Secretary of State said in July and her ministerial colleague said before the Health Committee in November, ultimately be divesting themselves of provision, or whether they will remain bifurcated in the way management describes. I do not want to dwell any longer on the matter. However, I wanted to emphasise it because it is an aspect of the process of constant management change that is one of the reasons why the Secretary of State received such a reaction when she tried to suggest that the NHS had had one of its best years ever.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-20_para2">
<a name="stpa_136">The thing that makes me cross is that all this is unnecessary. Of course I do not disagree with the direction of a health policy that is an attempt to put commissioning back in the hands of GPs, to give the power to manage hospitals back to hospitals and to distance the Department of Health from the day-to-day micro-management of the NHS. I could hardly disagree with that direction of policy because it was the one that we pursued when I was both a junior Health Minister and Secretary of State for Health. However, it makes me cross that nine years after the Government came to power&#151;it has been nine years of confusion, wasted resources and demotivation&#151;they have made a 360&#176; U-turn. That is a major factor behind the demotivation of the staff of the NHS.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-20_para3">
<a name="stpa_137">Let me move on to another reason the Secretary of State received the reaction that she did. There is emerging knowledge in the NHS that the good times are 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>9 May 2006 : Column 210</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>over and that there has been, to an almost criminal extent, a wasted opportunity. That is not to say to the right hon. Member for Rother Valley that no good has been done&#151;of course good has been done&#151;but people in the NHS understand and increasingly reflect on the scale of financial mismanagement during the growth years as they find that the years of plenty are inevitably, under Governments of any political complexion, coming to an end. The Government get credit, as they should, for the fact that they have doubled the resources going into the NHS, but they must accept responsibility for management decisions on the use of money and the consequences of those decisions as they work themselves out in the coming years, as people in the service are increasingly seeing that they will.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-20_para4">
<a name="stpa_138">I will offer two examples that people working in the NHS increasingly cite when they talk to me. They talk about the employment prospects for doctors and nurses coming out of the medical and nurse training schools. The Government are keen to claim credit for committing substantial extra resources to increasing the number of people going into medical schools and nurse training so that a greater number of skilled clinicians is available to the NHS. However, they do not tell us that there is no model for the future funding of the NHS that offers job opportunities for all the people coming out of the expanded nurse and doctor training schools. Those who are coming out of the schools have a pretty significant vested interest in understanding the economics and dynamics. They have done the maths and know that there are not enough jobs to go round. We are heading into a period in which there will be unemployed nurses and doctors because the Government have got their staff planning wrong and are producing more trained doctors and nurses than the NHS will be able to employ in any likely scenario over the next decade. That is mismanagement of resources and is known to be such by those who work in the service.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-20_para5">
<a name="stpa_139">There is a second area of mismanagement of resources of which people are becoming increasingly aware, and it is not dissimilar to the one to which I have just referred. The Government are proud that in constituencies throughout the country they have launched the biggest capital investment programme in the history of the NHS, and that throughout the country there are new, expanded and renovated hospitals that reflect that huge investment programme. The Government do not tell us&#151;the hon. Member for Northavon (Steve Webb) touched on this&#151;that resources have been pre-empted elsewhere, and that the intelligent commissioners in the health service increasingly see that resources should have been made available in greater proportion to the development of the community-based and the less politically sexy aspects of the delivery of health care.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-20_para6">
<a name="stpa_140">The NHS that the Government will bequeath their successors is one where major capital investment has committed resources for a generation to come that do not reflect&#151;this is what the commissioners fear&#151;the priorities of the NHS during the life of the investments that have been made and which have secured so many brownie points for the Government during their time in office. It is ironic that the Government should have issued a White Paper within the past 12 months stressing once again, as Health Secretaries have since Enoch Powell and before, the importance of moving health 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>9 May 2006 : Column 211</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>care out of the big general hospitals into the communities so that it is close to where patients live, is accessible to patients and uses the latest technology to deliver day case and ambulatory care, for example.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-20_para7">
<a name="stpa_141">The Government talk the talk of the development of community-based health care while at the same time putting shedloads of money into a new district general hospital investment programme, which is preventing them from delivering the model of health service delivery that is so articulately described in the Secretary of State&#039;s White Paper.

They have lived in a world where somehow money was no object. They took the view, &quot;We can do everything because we, the Labour party, are committed to the NHS.&quot; They are discovering that in reality all of us are committed to the principles of the NHS.

I have been in the NHS now for more years than I care to share, and in every one there have been funding crises. We are in the difficulties that we now face because we are taking tough decisions that were avoided for far too many decades, let alone years. These decisions should have been taken many years ago.

Not only is that scaremongering for those people who dedicate their lives to the NHS, but it is not true. The NHS has imported doctors and nurses for the past 30 or 40 years because we have not produced anything like enough of them. The NHS has had an expanded medical school programme and an expanded nurse training programme so as to reduce our reliance on overseas trained nurses and doctors, who are often sorely missed by the countries we take them from.

 I am interested to hear that from my hon. Friend. I do not wish to make points about the Royal College of Nursing. I speak to nurses daily. I talk to these people. Many have told me that they are embarrassed by the way in which their leadership has portrayed them in the media and has allowed them to be undermined, as well as allowing them to abuse the hospitality of the Secretary of State in the way that they did. That was unforgivable. I do not blame nurses for that, but I point the finger at some of the leaders who purportedly speak on their behalf. Let me cite some important statistics. Minimum starting pay for nurses is &#163;19,000&#151;a 55 per cent. increase since 1997. Nurse consultants start on &#163;49,000 a year, senior professional nurses can earn up to &#163;88,000, and modern matrons start on &#163;35,000 a year. The typical starting pay for a junior doctor is &#163;30,000&#151;an increase of 40 per cent.&#151;and a grade F nurse who earned &#163;21,000 in 1998, received &#163;28,200 in 2004, which represents a 23 per cent. increase. I could speak about those increases indefinitely, but it is not about pay or numbers.

 The hon. Gentleman makes an interesting point, but I am not embarrassed at all, as most GPs do not earn anything like the figures that appear in the newspapers. According to the British Medical Association, the average pay for a general practitioner is &#163;90,000 to &#163;95,000, which is a reasonable rate for a good job. GPs undertake considerably more responsible work than before, and I shall come on to some of the things that they did not do a few years ago. For example, they have taken on some of the acute hospitals&#039; work load&#151;five or 10 years ago that would not have been possible&#151;and they can provide facilities that they did not have at their disposal only a few years ago.

<p><a name="st_207"><a name="60509-21_spnew8"><b> Dr. Stoate: </b> 
 There are some incredible differences between the way in which GPs were treated before and how they are treated now, and I shall expand on that later.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-21_para4">
<a name="stpa_148">I want to look at what we can do in the community to expand health care and health care facilities. The community services White Paper called for far more services to be delivered outside hospital, along with practice-based commissioning and new initiatives on prevention and chronic disease management, thus demonstrating that the NHS can become leaner, fitter, much more efficient and capable of delivering much greater value for money. I am concerned, however, that those reforms may not be sufficient to reshape the health care landscape in favour of primary care. How can we reconcile the goal of moving more care closer to home and encouraging more integrated pathways of care with the Government&#039;s determination to allow more acute trusts to attain foundation status and to operate independently?
</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-21_para5">
<a name="stpa_149">One problem is that, as a result of the NHS tariff system, acute sector providers are encouraged to try to generate as much business as possible to maximise their income. There is an increasing incentive for hospitals to treat more people more regularly than before, and I am afraid that that will put pressure on the NHS. Some have argued that more competition between trusts as a consequence of practice-based commissioning will help to negate any inflationary effect arising from the tariff-based system. Underperforming providers will be squeezed, and commissioners will seek to secure the greatest possible value for money. However, it is dangerous to rely on the market alone to achieve the reduction in acute activity needed to achieve the goals that the Government set out in the White Paper. Not only will that lead to imbalances in the way in which acute care is delivered but it will encourage acute trusts to concentrate on more lucrative health care activities at the expense of less lucrative ones.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-21_para6">
<a name="stpa_150">Moreover, the experience of countries that have sought to shift more care into the community is that change is slower in health care systems composed of powerful, autonomous hospitals that compete with one another for patients. Having invested so much political capital in the foundation trust model, the Government would find it inconvenient to curb the very freedoms that it has worked so hard to give hospitals. Without a concerted and meaningful attempt to blur the boundaries between primary and secondary care to achieve vertical integration between the two sectors, we 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>9 May 2006 : Column 215</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>cannot achieve the vision of a prevention-oriented, primary care-led NHS that the Government wish to deliver.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-21_para7">
<a name="stpa_151">Simply encouraging more consultants to see more patients in primary settings is not the answer. Primary and secondary-care consultants and professionals must be answerable to the same paymaster&#151;a single care trust that it is openly committed to an integrated, primary care model&#151;if we are to achieve meaningful change and resolve the problems facing the NHS. We could learn a great deal from the Kaiser Permanente model of health care in California, which has reduced secondary admissions and kept hospital stays to a minimum in a wide range of specialties. It owes much of its success to its decision to invest in a network of community-based specialty clinics, in which primary care professionals work alongside specialists. Those clinics have the facilities to cater for virtually every step of the patient pathway, from initial assessment to diagnosis, treatment and follow-up appointments.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-21_para8">
<a name="stpa_152">One aspect of the Kaiser model is crucial to its success in reducing acute sector activity. Unlike the NHS, there are no structural distinctions between primary and secondary care. Not only is the model vertically integrated but the entire care package is based on prevention, integrated working and a belief that the most effective treatment is delivered as close to home as possible. The specialist doctors and nurses who work for Kaiser tend to support that model. It has been extremely successful, and we could learn a great deal from it.

<p><a name="st_208"><a name="60509-22_spnew0"><b> Steve Webb: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman is making a thoughtful contribution. If we blur the distinction between primary and secondary care, should we therefore blur the distinction between health and social care, and merge those budgets, too?
</p>





<p><a name="st_209"><a name="60509-22_spnew1"><b> Dr. Stoate: </b> 
 Yes, I believe that we should. A few years ago, when I was a member of the Select Committee on Health, we looked at that issue and recommended blurring the boundary and breaking down that Berlin wall to achieve much more integration of budgets and personnel so that people work across both sectors.

<a name="stpa_153">If we removed the boundary between primary and secondary care, we could provide the care that the patients need, whatever the location, without competing pressures between social and health care, or between primary and secondary care. The system would be much smoother, and patients could understand it. It would achieve what they want and deliver efficiencies. I would go further, as we need to ask what is the role of the acute hospital in the 21st century. That dangerous question needs to be handled subtly&#151;Members on both sides may fear that there is threat to their own unit&#151;but we must have that debate. An acute unit capable of delivering emergency care, followed if necessary by transfer to a more appropriate unit after stabilisation, is required in each district, but what should be provided beyond that? Does the district general hospital need all its acute beds? Is that requirement appropriate in every instance? Is it appropriate for every speciality to be provided in every district general hospital? Do we need a full range of services in each unit?


<br>&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-22_para1">
<a name="stpa_154">The vast majority of acute admissions are entirely avoidable, particularly for people with chronic conditions such as asthma or diabetes. Those admission should be regarded first and foremost as a sign that the system has failed. If I have to make a phone call as a GP to admit a patient to hospital, I always ask what went wrong with their care package. Sometime there is a simple answer&#151;they have had a heart attack or stroke and need to be admitted to hospital to be stabilised and treated&#151;but often there is a failure of social care. I have to send a patient to hospital, because there is not a safety package in the community that I can put into action fast enough to enable them to stay in their own home.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-22_para2">
<a name="stpa_155">When we send a patient to hospital, it is usually a nightmare. Elderly people, in particular, become institutionalised after only a few days, and it is much more difficult to rehabilitate them so that they can return to their own community. They become disoriented and, all too often, end up spending a long time in hospital or being transferred from hospital to a social care bed, all of which could have been avoided with more planning and blurring of boundaries. Putting people in hospital is expensive, and in many cases it is harmful to their health, particularly to their psychological well-being, as most people would far rather be treated by their family and friends in a familiar environment. Hospital-acquired infections are, by definition, acquired in hospital, not in the community. Far too many people succumb to those.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-22_para3">
<a name="stpa_156">Reviewing acute sector capacity is not just financially desirable, but essential from a clinical and a patient perspective. In the early 1960s, when the present model of the district hospital was developed, there was a need for large-scale repositories in each area, given the rather limited range of treatments that we could provide and the rather rocky patient pathway that many people followed. It was inevitable that people were kept in hospital for long terms. When I was a junior doctor, I remember working in a district hospital that had access to 1,000 beds, and we were always full. I used to admit acute surgical patients to the ear, nose and throat ward because I had nowhere else to put them. That was 20 years ago. We now have far fewer beds and do not face anything like the same pressures on the beds. Times have changed.
</p>





<p><a name="st_210"><a name="60509-22_spnew2"><b> Mr. Burrowes: </b> 
 Although I agree that we can have a carefully reasoned debate about acute care strategy, there is a threat in my constituency of losing our accident and emergency department at Chase Farm hospital and of its being transferred to Barnet hospital, in the context of dealing with a &#163;31 million deficit, and the financial concerns are paramount to residents when they see that they may lose their A and E department just to save money.

 Obviously, each area has its own problems. I cannot comment on the hon. Gentleman&#039;s area because I do not know it. I am suggesting a debate on a much wider scale than individual hospital budgets.

In fact, we are not sending them anywhere. What GPs are doing is keeping far more people than ever before in their practices. They are all running diabetic clinics, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease clinics, asthma clinics and minor surgery clinics. Treatments that were impossible 10 years ago are now routine and commonplace in general practice. Patients like being treated in their own practice. We are therefore not making the referrals to hospital.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-22_para5">
<a name="stpa_158">I would go further. I spoke to a consultant cardiologist the other day, and he was not joking when he said that heart attacks&#151;coronary thromboses&#151;were becoming a scarcity in his hospital. He said that the cardiac unit was having to look around for other things to do because there was no longer a steady flow of cardiac problems. Why was that? &quot;Because,&quot; he said, &quot;you GPs are preventing them. Because you are treating people with high cholesterol and blood pressure, managing diabetes, coping with the effect of their obesity and their smoking, we are not seeing the heart attacks that we saw before&quot;. In other words, we are already seeing a fall-off of need.

When it was being planned, I was vilified, the NHS was vilified, everyone was vilified in the press because, it was claimed, the hospital would be far too small. It was replacing three hospitals with one hospital, and the result would be chaos, meltdown, disaster&#151;all the usual hyperbole.

My gut instinct is that patients being treated in their own home by their own practice nurse, their own doctor and their own team of associate support staff is the way to go. Big acute general hospitals are probably not the way to go. The interesting debate will be about how we get from here to there, and I look forward to many more of these debates in the future.

Member for Dartford (Dr. Stoate) that nurses are far better paid than they were, and so they should be. That manifestation was not about pay at all. It was about the constant rate of change in the health service, which is proving so destabilising and bringing such great uncertainty not only to those who work in the health service, but in the long term to patients.

<a name="stpa_165">In the south-east of England a health care crisis is developing throughout the region, and dealing with it will be extremely difficult. The Chancellor made a colossal error by announcing massive increases in public expenditure on health without demanding substantial productivity gains and further reforms. A very great deal of taxpayers&#039; money has been wasted and is about to be so again, and there is a substantial managerial failure which lies at the door of the Department of Health. It is not a failure, by and large, at local level.

Managers who, given their heads, could do a much better job, feel disempowered and are unable to take initiatives that they know to be right. Only in genuine partnership will clinicians and managers be able to deliver the sort of dynamic service that is really responsive to the needs of patients.

Ethos matters very much to most public servants. There are some outstanding managers in the NHS, but there are also too many inadequate ones who are recycled from job to job. The good ones need to be nurtured and developed. Initiative, and particularly risk taking, needs to be encouraged and managed.

Such a course could be run at business schools throughout the country to ensure that only the very best managers go on to the most important jobs.

They yearn for the ability to take the best decisions for their local communities, to provide the best care that they can, and to deal with the abuses and inefficiencies that are all too rife. Many of the NHS&#039;s difficulties are systemic and the deficits can be wiped out only by fundamental change: the NHS and its people, wherever they work, need the time, the space and the resources to achieve it.

We have already doubled spending since then, and it will have trebled by 2008. We were spending at well below the European average on health after years of Tory cuts, and waiting was the keynote that typified NHS services in those days, whether it was waiting on those ever-increasing lists for operations, waiting on trolleys in accident and emergency units or waiting for

In my first few years as a Member of Parliament, I used to receive far too many letters from constituents who did not know whether they would get their hip or knee operation done or whether they would die first. We used to get letters like that, but I am delighted to say that I have not received one for some years.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-23_para4">
<a name="stpa_181">At that time, the health service in my constituency was typified by the Devonshire royal hospital, which rattled around inside a magnificent grade II* listed building. The building was in a poor state, and, although people were fond of it, few High Peak residents used it as an in-patient hospital, because it was a centre of regional excellence for head injuries and rheumatism treatment in the north-west&#151;it happened not to be in the north-west region, which was one reason why its closure was proposed. Many people were against the closure, but when the hospital closed, no services were lost. Out-patient services were transferred to the two community hospitals or, as is increasingly the case, to GP surgeries. Now, nobody would attack the decision to close that hospital on the basis of the health care that is provided in the area.

<a name="stpa_182">Although there are no acute hospitals in the High Peak constituency, we have got a foundation three star hospital at Stockport Stepping hill, which is on the outskirts of my constituency, and a brand new hospital, which is awaiting the outcome of its foundation application, is about to be built to replace the present Tameside hospital. No one waits for four hours in A and E in either of those hospitals, and in-patients, who typically faced a 12-month wait in 2002, now wait for less than six months. Out-patient waits in the area were typically 21 weeks in 2002, but they are now less than 12 weeks.

<a name="60509-23_para6">
<a name="stpa_183">There are two PCTs in my constituency&#151;Tameside and Glossop and High Peak and Dales&#151;and they are both hitting all of their key targets, which benefits their patients, providing more and more services within communities and working closely with an excellent team of GPs. Furthermore, an increasing number of non-GP health staff are working inside GP surgeries delivering basic community health services. As far as Tameside and Glossop PCT is concerned, Shire Hill hospital in Glossop has now achieved step-up, step-down status, which means that people who do not need to take an acute bed can use a GP bed in that hospital. Similarly, people who have been in an acute hospital can use that hospital as a staging post on the way home. A walk-in centre will be built in Glossop through the local improvement finance trust programme, and I am

<b>9 May 2006 : Column 223</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>delighted to say that the town has a high level of registration by dentists. Tameside and Glossop is an historically low-funded area, so I am pleased to say that it is getting a 9.4 per cent. increase this year and a 9.3 per cent. increase next year.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-23_para7">
<a name="stpa_184">High Peak and Dales PCT also has a record of excellence, although the locality is different. The Corbar maternity centre is a centre of excellence, and it was recently reopened and reinvigorated in Buxton. The Stonebench ward is one of the most deprived wards in my area, and for the first time it has both GP and dental services provided through PCT investment in the Sure Start programme. It also has the first four dentists employed by the NHS who do not have the option of going private. That historically high-funded area will still get an 8.1 per cent. increase this year and an 8.2 per cent. increase next year.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-23_para8">
<a name="stpa_185">There is an issue about the High Peak and Dales PCT budget, because&#151;sin of sins&#151;the PCT has overspent by 1 per cent. on its 2005&#150;06 budget, which has resulted in the closure of the minor injuries unit in Buxton for eight hours a day between midnight and 8 am and the failure to bring an elderly person&#039;s ward at the Cavendish hospital back into use after refurbishment. I agree with the protestors who say that the minor injuries unit should be available 24 hours a day, and I hope that the PCT will make sure that it comes back into service in one form or another. Between midnight and 8 am, the unit used to serve an average of two people a night&#151;on average, one of them would go to A and E, while NHS Direct would probably be able to deal with the other. Nevertheless, public pressure is such that the situation requires a response. Equally, I agree with the PCT that the elderly ward should be brought back into use first when the money becomes available. In dealing with that minor overspend, no redundancies have been necessary, and I hope that the situation will be corrected before too long.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-23_para9">
<a name="stpa_186">Like PCTs in other areas, PCTs in my area face reorganisation. Tameside and Glossop PCT is perhaps the only PCT which straddles a regional border&#151;Tameside is the north-west region and Glossop is in the Trent region. Greater Manchester SHA has proposed that Tameside and Glossop should stay together, which recognises the local affinities, the local needs of Glossop, transport connections and travel-to-work areas. Indeed, 1,601 people replied to the public consultation in Glossop, of whom 1,597 supported maintaining the current link. Greater Manchester SHA only consulted on that option, while Trent consulted on four options, two of which would take Glossop back into Derbyshire in order to make a Derbyshire-wide PCT, which would be coterminous with social services. I understand that argument and see why social services and health services should be run according to the same boundaries, where no overriding feature exists. However, because of the geography of Derbyshire, and, in particular, the geography of Glossop, it is essential to maintain the link between Tameside and Glossop, and I hope that the Minister will announce the adoption of the status quo when he makes the announcement in a couple of weeks&#039; time.

<a name="stpa_187">I have already mentioned Corbar maternity unit. For some reason, the whole of High Peak is included in the north-west region, where a number of options are currently being considered for maternity and children&#039;s services. The consultation is open until the end of this week, and the large number of such units will be reduced to eight or nine in the Greater Manchester and north-west area, with the aim of improving staffing, quality, investment and opportunities for excellence. That idea has come from within the NHS itself&#151;it is not being imposed from elsewhere. I am happy to tell the Minister that I have supported option A, which is already the preferred option, because it not only retains Corbar maternity unit in Buxton&#151;in fact, all the options do that&#151;but is the only one that maintains the maternity services at Tameside.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-23_para11">
<a name="stpa_188">Having said that, if Ministers find that there is an opportunity to show some flexibility, they might acknowledge that the reduction in choice from 13 or 14 units to around eight is a bit drastic. Perhaps they could consider the possibility of including Macclesfield in option A, because choice is an issue here. As someone who is used to representing a constituency on the fringe of a region, I am aware that one usually does not have as much choice as one does elsewhere.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-23_para12">
<a name="stpa_189">The NHS has been a huge success under Labour. More staff are employed and they are better paid than ever. There are more community services and more flexible services. There is an imaginative use of private capital to support and expand, not replace, public services, and there will be more to come. In the NHS, change is always difficult and challenge is always complex. Champions of health care, especially in our most deprived communities, are worth their weight in gold. The principles on which the NHS was founded, which, we are told this afternoon, are espoused across the Chamber, are safe with this Government. Equally, the funding that has been championed only on this side of the House is safe with this Government. We have a job to do with the NHS&#151;let us get on and do it so that we have a better NHS for all.

 I remain absolutely convinced that my constituents are fortunate indeed to live where they do and to be served by the national health service, and I make no apology for that. Labour Members who have implied that there is no common ground between us and that some of us are not committed to the NHS do themselves, and us, no justice whatsoever.

I recall listening to &quot;Yesterday in Parliament&quot; during the late 1970s and mid-1980s, when Mrs. Thatcher was challenged week after week on the state of the NHS. She always answered robustly from the Dispatch Box with reams of statistics saying how many more operations had been carried out and so on. Even in those years, despite the myths that may be spun, the NHS was improving. Nevertheless, it did not work, because it did not match up to the ordinary people&#039;s perceptions based on their experiences. That is the problem that my constituents are having at the moment. Their 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>9 May 2006 : Column 225</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>perceptions of what is happening in the NHS are informed by the difficulty, or otherwise, that they face in seeing their doctor or dentist.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-24_para1">
<a name="stpa_191">I should like to give hon. Members an impression of what it is like in my part of the world. We have a vastly expanding population. As the Deputy Prime Minister&#039;s rules, particularly on density, begin to bite in urban centres such as New Milton, and townscapes are changed for ever as family houses are pulled down and replaced with blocks of flats, the population is expanding fast. Yet only one GP practice south of the A337 is still taking on new patients. That outgrew its existing premises some time ago and is short of space, whatever measure one chooses to use, and sometimes the cramped conditions in the waiting room are unacceptable. A few years ago the practice secured the primary care trust&#039;s permission in principle to expand its premises, but before it could do so, a directive from the Department of Health instructed that that was not to happen because the funds were to be allocated not to the primary care trust but to Hampshire as a whole. Hampshire&#039;s priorities are different; they apparently lie in Portsmouth. There is now not the remotest chance of that practice, or any practice in my constituency, being able to expand its premises.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-24_para2">
<a name="stpa_192">My constituents write to me in droves complaining that they can make an appointment with their GP only on the same day. It does not suit most people to have to spend hours ringing the surgery in the morning, only to find it engaged, when they would like to organise their lives so as to see the doctor at a time convenient to them, as they used to in the past. They feel that the situation is not as good as it was before. That is entirely a consequence of the targets to which general practitioners have been subjected.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-24_para3">
<a name="stpa_193">During the election campaign, on the &quot;Question Time&quot; interview, the Prime Minister was confronted with that problem, appeared greatly surprised, and said that he was going to do something about it. I have not noticed any result. I have written to the Secretary of State saying, &quot;Please find enclosed a copy of a letter from my constituent complaining about X, Y or Z. I remember the Prime Minister saying he was going to do something about it&#151;what has happened?&quot; The answer is, &quot;You can rest assured that patient satisfaction will be one of the measures on which general practitioners will be remunerated in future.&quot; That does not deal with the perceived deterioration that my constituents experience in booking an appointment.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-24_para4">
<a name="stpa_194">Let us examine the possibility of booking an appointment with one&#039;s dentist. A couple of years ago the situation deteriorated. It got so bad that constituents of mine who were lucky enough to have an NHS dentist were receiving letters telling them that there were not going to be any more NHS dentists, but they were welcome to stay on as private patients if they wished. When I raised that at Prime Minister&#039;s Question Time, the Deputy Prime Minister, who was answering on that occasion, said:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_36">&quot;I am well aware of the problem that the hon. Gentleman mentions because I have experienced it. My dentist declared that he was going private and I declared that I could not stay with him. Many of our constituents have faced this problem. As the hon. Gentleman said, each one of us has been confronted with it.&quot;&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 9 June 2004; Vol. 422, c. 270.]</p>

</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-24_para5">
<a name="stpa_195">That does not actually address the problem. He went on to tell me that it was all the Tories&#039; fault for having closed down the dental schools. A decision by the university grants funding body more than 10 years ago is not germane to our problem now. The problem is that NHS dentists are leaving the NHS. It is not a question of a shortage of dentists but of how they are employed.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-24_para6">
<a name="stpa_196">The problem got worse. Several constituents wrote to me complaining that they had received a letter from their dentist saying that he was no longer going to be an NHS dentist but would nevertheless continue to treat their children under the NHS as long as they, the parents, remained as private patients with the practice. They did not like being held hostage in that way, but felt fortunate at least to have their children still being treated as NHS patients. The Secretary of State acted to right that perceived wrong. Instructions were issued to primary care trusts whereby they were empowered to prevent dentists from maintaining children-only NHS lists. So in the past few months, parents in my constituency, particularly vulnerable families, have been receiving letters from those self-same dentists saying, in effect, &quot;You will recall my letter of such and such when I undertook to keep your children on as long as you remained as a registered private patient at the practice&#151;well, sorry, that deal is off and your children will either have to find another dentist or stay with me and pay.&quot; That is a very worrying letter for the many families with children who have orthodontic requirements and all sorts of work to be done.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-24_para7">
<a name="stpa_197">As a consequence of the Government&#039;s policy, it is much more difficult to secure NHS dental treatment. However, my constituents have been told that the seventh cavalry is on the way, and that some 12,500 new dental registrations will be available to the good people of New Milton. To take advantage of those as yet virtual dental registrations, a new model is to be used to avoid the inconvenience&#151;and, of course, the attendant unpleasant publicity&#151;of long queues forming and being photographed.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-24_para8">
<a name="stpa_198">The people of New Milton have been invited to telephone a number to secure their dental registration. I have a letter from a constituent who tried that. The announcement was made in February and he began to make telephone calls. The letter states:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_37">&quot;Since then I and friends have telephoned this number many times only to hear an automated voice saying &#039;The number you called is busy. To ring back please press five&#039;. Furthermore, if you press five a similar voice tells you &#039;Sorry, there is a fault please try again&#039;.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-24_para9">
<a name="stpa_199">He writes that he tried the number on 3 April from 1.55 pm to 2.25 pm, from 3.30 pm to 3.50 pm and from 4.43 pm to 4.52 pm. He tried again on 4 April between 1.45 pm and 2.10 pm, and 4.10 pm and 4.35 pm. Each occasion met with the same result. Let that be a measure of the frustration of ordinary constituents in trying to secure the NHS treatment to which they rightly believe that they are entitled. Those perceptions mean that there is an understandable belief that things have got worse.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-24_para10">
<a name="stpa_200">We have been told that the position on waiting times has changed; the claim was repeated today. We are told that a magnificent improvement has occurred, but that is not the experience of many of my constituents. At previous Health questions, I asked about audiological waits in my constituency. It has a disproportionate number of elderly people, and thus a disproportionate number suffering from poor hearing, which is one of the

<br>&nbsp;<br>most socially isolating experiences. As I said in Health questions, there is a significant danger that many patients will die before they secure the hearing aids that they require.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-24_para11">
<a name="stpa_201">Strangely, I received a letter about the problem today&#151;although it is not an amazing coincidence, because I am afraid that I receive such letters almost every day. My constituent&#039;s 17-month wait for a hearing test was over in February. His appointment was on 6 February and the consultant told him that it would take three months for the hearing aids to be made up. My constituent wrote:
</p>

<a name="stpa_202">He waited and waited. After a further three months, he rang the hospital to find out what had happened to his hearing aids, only to be told that it would take another six months before they were delivered. That is a measure of ordinary people&#039;s experience of the health service. Can we blame them if they believe that it is getting worse?
</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-24_para13">
<a name="stpa_203">We have five community hospitals in New Forest. We launched a massive campaign in the past year to save them because the primary care trust intended to close them. It backed off and said that it no longer planned to close them, but that it would have to work with the community to find a role for them&#151;exactly the model that the White Paper, which the Secretary of State launched, set out. There was, therefore, progress.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-24_para14">
<a name="stpa_204">However, community hospital supporters now experience huge frustration and staff morale is low because nothing has emerged from the process. Whatever is suggested about the role of a specific hospital&#151;whether in Fordingbridge, which could be a centre for best practice or nursing excellence, or the hospital in Milford on Sea&#151;the PCT response is that there is a difficulty because it is building a new hospital in Lymington. That is one of the first new hospitals in which the PCT will employ a private supplier to provide the health care. It does not yet know what services will be provided at Lymington, and will not therefore make any commitment about the services that need to be provided in any of the community hospitals. The new hospital in Lymington is due to open in January next year. Is that the way to run a national health service? We are only a few months away from the opening of the new hospital, yet we are told that decisions cannot be made about existing community hospitals because the PCT does not know about the services that it is commissioning at the new one.

In contrast to the hon. Member for New Forest, West (Mr. Swayne), I have experienced&#151;as a Member of Parliament, a lifelong resident of my area and, most personally important, the daughter of two very elderly parents&#151;the most fantastic improvements in the local health service.

<a name="60509-25_para0">
<a name="stpa_206">The improvements are due to the work of dedicated staff, as we have heard, and the investment in facilities, to which the increase in the money spent on the health service has directly led. Those improvements are tangible. The south-west London elective orthopaedic centre in Epsom has ensured that the waiting time for hip and knee replacements is less than six months. I have been a direct beneficiary of that centre because my mother, a nurse who was forced into early retirement by being made redundant in the 1980s, has had two hip replacements in the past three years. Her care has been fantastic and I thank the Government and the doctors and nurses for that treatment.

Within 48 hours, he was diagnosed with bladder cancer, of which, thanks to the care of Mr. Bailey and his oncology team, he has now been cured.

The Tories&#039; approach to that inequality was to take away our health services, force us to cope with grotty GP surgeries and shut our hospitals. Labour&#039;s attitude involves doubling investment, building brand new GP surgeries and health centres, and reopening and rebuilding our hospitals.

I do not wish to criticise dedicated and hard-working NHS doctors, nurses, ancillary staff and managers who share our commitment. However, there are still a few people in place who take a bureaucratic approach to health care, rather than a human approach.

<a name="stpa_215">I have first-hand knowledge of the commitment of this Government to confronting and dealing with health inequalities. Earlier this year, more than 250 people from two council wards in the south of my constituency braved a freezing February evening to attend a small celebration that I hosted to thank the Secretary of State for Health for saving and agreeing to rebuild their local general hospital, St. Helier. They wanted to thank her for listening to their concerns. Many of them were elderly or infirm, and they have suffered for years as a result of inequalities in the health service. They wanted to celebrate because they were so delighted that, in order to tackle health inequalities, an earlier decision by some in the health establishment about where to locate their new hospital had been overruled.

So I should not have been surprised when St. Helier came under threat again more recently, when the administrators decided that they wanted to remove critical services from the hospital.

<p>
<a name="60509-25_para12">
<a name="stpa_218">Those administrators argued that the site of the main hospital&#151;the critical care hospital&#151;was not important, as the community hospitals would take most of the people who normally go to hospitals. A public consultation was conducted, and it soon became clear that the main issue would be where to put the new critical care hospital, which would house the area&#039;s accident and emergency unit, and acute services such as maternity and obstetrics.

<p>
<a name="60509-25_para13">
<a name="stpa_219">My view is that the people who need critical care services the most are those who are most disadvantaged and have the worst health. There is a strong link between social disadvantage and the need for emergency services and health needs such as low birth weight and teenage pregnancy. The bulk of the population live near St. Helier, and the vast majority of those with the greatest health needs live there. They are those with the lowest life expectancy, those who experience the most emergency admissions, the highest levels of child accidents, the lowest levels of good health and the most long-term illnesses. The also include those with the most babies with low birth weight, the least access to primary care, the lowest incomes and the least access to cars. The area also has the largest black and ethnic minority population. For all those reasons, I felt that having the critical care hospital at St. Helier was the best way to reduce health inequalities.

<a name="stpa_220">The public consultation seemed to agree with my views. Although fewer people from disadvantaged areas take part in public consultations, and although my own surveys were repeatedly ignored, St. Helier emerged as the top choice among the public for the location of the critical care hospital. However, last January, local NHS managers voted to overturn the views of the residents, and to build a new critical care hospital in Belmont, a very well-to-do suburb in Surrey, instead. They did so despite the fact that the health establishment initially gave St. Helier a 7 per cent. higher score than Belmont in its original assessments. That decision would have meant that St. Helier would lose its accident and emergency, maternity and other critical care services.

<p>
<a name="60509-26_para1">
<a name="stpa_221">Belmont is one of the wealthiest areas in the country, and the people living close to it have a high life expectancy, good access to health care and high levels of private health care. The area around St. Helier has the greatest health needs in the whole catchment area, and the people living there have up to 10 years less life expectancy. They are also the least likely to have a car and the most likely to need to go to hospital. The whole catchment area can reach St. Helier well within the critical &quot;golden hour&quot; that our health experts agree is crucial to survival. Indeed, more people can get to St. Helier within 20 minutes than to Belmont, and St. Helier has far better public transport services than Belmont. St. Helier was the preferred choice of all the MPs in Sutton, Merton and Wandsworth, and of Sutton and Merton councils.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-26_para2">
<a name="stpa_222">Given the harm that would be done in terms of health inequalities if Belmont was the location of the new critical care hospital, rather than St. Helier, Merton council called in the decision. Even the health establishment admitted that if the Belmont site was chosen, people living in seven of the 10 most deprived postcodes in the region would have to travel further than they do at the moment.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-26_para3">
<a name="stpa_223">I was delighted, therefore, when the Government demonstrated once and for all to the whole NHS that health inequalities really do matter, and when the Secretary of State backed St. Helier too. She was brave to do that, because she must have been under a lot of pressure from the health establishment, and the decision must have been very close. She came down firmly on the side of reducing health inequalities. She decided that it was the patients who mattered most, and showed for all to see that reducing health inequalities was the Government&#039;s top priority.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-26_para4">
<a name="stpa_224">This is the Secretary of State who has seen a fantastic growth in the NHS, a dramatic reduction in waiting times, and a significant increase in the number of staff and the amount that they are paid. She is the Secretary of State whose policies have uncovered modest overspends in some hospital trusts, and established the need for them to improve their efficiency while spending the extra money that the Government have given them. She is also the Secretary of State who has put tackling health inequalities firmly at the top of the political agenda. I back the Government&#039;s amendment.

<a name="60509-26_para6">
<a name="stpa_226">The debate is about management of the NHS, so I shall refer first to reforms. In 2002&#150;03, the Health Committee&#039;s report inquiring into foundation trusts started with a table quoted from the <i>Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine</i>, which listed the reforms that had taken place between 1982 and 2003 under Governments of different colours. There were 12 reorganisations between 1982 and 1997, another six between 1997 and 2003, and since then, as panic has set in, there have been at least 10 more&#151;practice-based commissioning, payment by results, &quot;Agenda for Change&quot;, new contracts, reorganisation of trusts, independent sector treatment centres, out-of-hours care, the computer program, the primary care White Paper and the abolition of the Commission for Patient and Public Involvement in Health. The NHS is supposed to be patient-led, but none of those have come up from the bottom; they are all top-down.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-26_para7">
<a name="stpa_227">For example, by and large, independent sector treatment centres are against local wishes. I have just received a letter from one of my ex-housemen, who is now a professor of magnetic resonance imaging. In respect of independent sector scanners, he wrote:

<a name="stpa_229">In relation to primary care trust mergers, everyone in my area is against the loss of their own PCT for their own part of the county.

PCT mergers are not in accordance with local wishes; they are top-down.

<p>
<a name="60509-26_para10">
<a name="stpa_230">The abolition of the Commission for Patient and Public Involvement in Health will have a devastating effect on local forums, removing the very bodies that could communicate the patients&#039; and public&#039;s needs and wishes. Abolishing the CPPIH two years after its institution does not strike me as good management. Equally, abolishing PCTs just two to three years after inception, just as they are beginning to work, does not seem to me to be good management.

<a name="stpa_231">The Government-inspired reforms, especially their number and top-down nature, lead to problems. The person who wrote the article listing the number of reforms from 1982 to 2003, quoted in the Health Committee report that I mentioned, wrote subsequently that

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_41">&quot;perpetual reform is very costly, both in terms of the time and effort invested by managers and other NHS staff, and in terms of the financial costs of establishing the physical fabric of new organisations and of meeting the redundancy or retirement costs of displaced staff.

<a name="60509-26_para14">
<a name="stpa_234">The Government attempt to justify the NHS deficits on the basis that they only affect a minority of trusts. In relation to the 2005&#150;06 deficits, that seems to be the case. What we desperately need to know&#151;I am pleased that the Health Committee will undertake an inquiry about this in future, as we might then find out the real scale of the deficit&#151;is what savings all trusts across the country must make to be in balance by the end of 2006&#150;07. That will give us some idea of the true deficit.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-26_para15">
<a name="stpa_235">I have thoroughly welcomed the extra money that has gone into the NHS, but the Health Committee has heard some worrying facts about what happened to the extra &#163;6.6 billion this year. Nearly half has gone on pay rises and other expected things, but much of the other half has gone on uncosted or inaccurately costed contracts, PFI costs, independent sector costs, the computer system and the pharmacy contract. At that stage, there has been mismanagement of the vast amount of extra money that has gone in.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-26_para16">
<a name="stpa_236">With regard to the private finance initiative, would people now allow a PFI contract to be written with a clause stating that if bed occupancy goes above 90 per cent, there would be extra payment? Before the changes removing the need for some hospital beds, not all of which have taken place, as the hon. Member for Dartford (Dr. Stoate) mentioned, initial PFIs were made with fewer beds. Allowing a contract to have a penalty clause for occupancy levels that would inevitably be reached was inexcusable. During one meeting of the Health Committee, we tried to find out from top civil servants how widespread the practice was. The civil servants promised to send a note because they could not answer at the time, but I think we are still waiting for that note.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-26_para17">
<a name="stpa_237">There is another sad aspect of the private finance initiative. Forecasts were made of its unaffordability, and my own trust has now admitted that approximately &#163;7 million of its deficit of nearly &#163;30 million is owing to the PFI.

<a name="stpa_238">We should also ask what managers in any concern other than the health service would allow independent-sector treatment centres a fixed contract for a guaranteed number of cases, to be paid for within a fixed time regardless of whether they have been dealt with, while at the same time NHS treatment centres struggle to make ends meet?

<a name="stpa_240">Some expenses resulting from Government rulings on top-down management seem to me fairly ridiculous. They may be controversial and I may be wrong, but I want to mention them. Clinical risk managers, for instance, are senior nurses who have been taken away from their jobs looking after patients in order to manage risk. Has there been any study of their value for money? The same question could be asked about quality managers. As for the plethora of &quot;modern matrons&quot;, that is really just another name for the departmental nursing officers whom we have had for years and years.

<a name="stpa_241">The typical image of a matron is that of the archetypal figure in a smart uniform who sails around a hospital and puts the fear of death into all the nurses and doctors. That one person can do more in terms of risk, quality and the standard of care than any number of highly paid modern matrons. If I were looking for savings, rather than getting rid of practising, working nurses on the wards I would get rid of risk managers and quality managers. I would return the modern matrons to their jobs as nursing officers and bring back &quot;the matron&quot; who is not bothered by management or the reforms that she must introduce, but is purely and simply concerned with quality.

However, as I listened to the speeches of some Opposition Members, it occurred to me that they could will the ends but not the means for that understanding to grow. Conservative Members have been critical. They cannot pretend that their opposition to providing proper funding was not clear, given that they refused to vote with us to ensure that the NHS was properly funded. They said then that it should be made clear that there will be reform and value for money, and it was obvious that they were not in favour of increasing the salaries of NHS staff. During today&#039;s debate, they are saying very loudly that they support NHS staff, including doctors and nurses, but they are still critical of the increase in pay.

That must include a proper salary and a proper job design and structure, which has certainly been missing for many people. A nurse can now advance her career&#151;or his career, given that nursing is increasingly a male occupation&#151;from a starting salary of &#163;19,000, through grades that used not to exist, and take on management and important clinical responsibilities that used not to exist.

 No, I am finishing my response to the point made by the hon. Member for Romsey (Sandra Gidley), which deserves an answer. We are entitled to expect results from consultants, but should such an expectation be included in their contract? There is a proper argument to be had about what should be included in the contract, and in my view, we should be able to demand certain outcomes from consultants. On the other hand, there are those who criticise the Government for insisting on certain outcomes.

Some of my constituents would cry out for more and faster change if they felt that it would benefit patients. The question should be: what will bring about the best results for patients, not for doctors or managers? These are very difficult problems to grapple with. A continually changing NHS is having to cope with new treatments coming on stream, for example. We need to balance the NHS&#039;s differing demands in a sensible way. Simply slowing down the process of change would not, of itself, be the answer.

<a name="stpa_253">That brings me to a very difficult problem. A lot of change is taking place in my own area. The hon.

Incidentally, that candidate beat a Liberal Democrat in the local elections&#151;a point that the hon. Gentleman failed to mention. I can understand why some people say, &quot;We don&#039;t want change in the NHS.&quot; They have grown to value the NHS and they feel that it is best left as it is&#151;until they hear of a new treatment, which they want &quot;today&quot;. Herceptin is a valuable example. At first, the primary care trust in my constituency refused to supply it, but after some debate about the savings to which its introduction could lead, the PCT changed its mind, and patients now have that choice.

How should they then balance public demand against what clinicians tell them is best for patients? Conservative Members have put forward both sides of the argument. They have said, &quot;Save my hospital, because I don&#039;t want anything to change&quot;, and in the very next breath said, &quot;We ought to allow such issues to be decided locally, and we should be brave enough to shut down certain hospitals.&quot;

St. Luke&#039;s has acquired a new building that is closer to the general hospital, and it could be used in a different way.

My personal view is that midwife-led units can, in the right circumstances and with the right support, be of great benefit. Midwives are the right people to make decisions and help a mother through all prenatal care, the delivery of the baby and some of the postnatal care. The relationship that can be built up over a period of time is valuable to a safe birth and important in helping mothers to take decisions that lead them away from unnecessary interventions, such as elective caesareans. As soon as a pregnant woman visits the local maternity unit, she sees shiny pieces of equipment and thinks, &quot;Oh my God, I need some of that. It is bound to all go wrong and I want to ensure that I am as near to that equipment as possible.&quot; That has been the undercurrent of the debate on health.

We rejected those plans, although the hospital claimed at the time that it was a matter of clinical need. The hon. Member for Wyre Forest has mentioned clinical need, but the problem is that clinical decisions are not always straightforward. Clinicians argue about them all the time. Indeed, clinicians from all over the country came to my constituency to argue about the best way forward for delivering babies. There is not only one point of view or one way of delivering excellence. That is fine, if the community backs the eventual decision. If everybody in my community demanded a midwife-led unit, I would not blame them for doing so, because it could be an excellent move.

My constituency has one of the lowest rates of home births. It is not the norm for mothers there to elect to have that form of delivery, nor is it the norm for them to consider midwife-led units.

The community said, properly, that it was used to what it already had and did not buy into the PCT&#039;s suggestion. The hon.

 It seems an eternity since this debate began. It is customary in such debates for Opposition Members to identify problems and blame the Government for them, and for the Government to identify successes and take the credit; for the Government to gloss over problems, and for the Opposition to ignore the successes; and for the cup to be seen as half empty by one side, and as half full by the other. What is missing is the perception that successes and failures are often intimately related.

<a name="stpa_270">I want to return to the substance of the debate. I have no reason to believe that civil servants or Ministers in the Department of Health are any stupider, less efficient or less caring than their counterparts elsewhere&#151;at least I hope that they are not. I think that the fault lies with a mistaken ideology based on flawed thinking and a false prospectus. I am sorry to say that that ideology seems to be shared by ranks of dubious advisers and think tanks, as well as the official Opposition and, sadly, the Prime Minister. That is what the Department of Health and Ministers have to contend with.
</p>

<a name="60509-29_para1">
<a name="stpa_271">That false ideology is at the root of the problem, and it is possible that it will be the cause of this Government&#039;s ultimate downfall. It is an ideology dreamed up by people who do not understand what the NHS is. As I understand it, the NHS is the vehicle by which we&#151;the healthy, the taxpayers&#151;entitle the sick and infirm to a standard of care that they simply could not afford by themselves. The NHS is a provider of entitlements and a moral enterprise. It is not a business, but nor is it a fairy godmother to satisfy every whim and ill.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-29_para2">
<a name="stpa_272">However, just as the sick are entitled to care, so the taxpayer is entitled to value for money, and to see that the money invested is well spent. We all welcome the new investment, and we all want value for money, which leads us to the mantra about investment and reform that the Government recite again and again&#151;although the word &quot;reform&quot; should be a synonym for beneficial change, and not just for change itself. Moreover, not

<b>9 May 2006 : Column 243</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>every change is a reform, and there is certainly something wrong with permanent reform that is too fast and too frequent, and which is ill-managed and incapable of being withstood by the organisation to which it is applied. That is what is called chaos.

<a name="60509-29_para3">
<a name="stpa_273">Mao Tse Tung thought that revolution was a good thing, but discovered eventually that permanent revolution was not such a good thing, as it led to destitution and chaos. We have almost got to that stage in the NHS, caused by well-motivated but mistaken attempts to secure value for money.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-29_para4">
<a name="stpa_274">In the early phase of this Government we had a target and inspection regime that in itself was not bad: setting targets and having inspections is one way to encourage a degree of efficiency in a public service. Gradually, however, it was recognised that the service could be distorted by performance indicators that caused silly things to be done, such as taking the wheels off trolleys so that they could be called beds. Moreover, targets could be politically driven. They were micromanaged and run to satisfy inspectors, and they were neither sufficiently focused nor alert enough to patients&#039; needs or clinical priorities.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-29_para5">
<a name="stpa_275">That approach has not been abandoned altogether: it is still around, being implicit in the contracts for dentists and GPs whereby activity is to be rewarded. In some ways the process has become more sophisticated and works a little more harmlessly than in the past. Now we simply have a new, more dominant model of reform; in the absence of another description I shall call it the market model. It seems to be widely accepted on both sides of the House, although not by me, and consists of turning our NHS institutions into autonomous trading units, increasing competition and importing concepts of consumer choice from private enterprise. Its rationale is relatively easy to understand: such models are supposed to encourage efficiency in the private sector, so, it is argued, they will necessarily encourage it in the public sector. It is believed that the model will eventually shake out waste and inefficiency in the NHS, which of course we are all against.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-29_para6">
<a name="stpa_276">There are fears about the model, however. The fear that it will accentuate health inequality has been voiced in the debate. There is also the fear that the model will bring unpredictability, and the fear, which should dog Labour Members, that it will bring the collapse of much-needed services and district general hospitals. The reason for those fear is that markets do not deliver entitlements, and the NHS is not a market.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-29_para7">
<a name="stpa_277">To deliver the complex entitlements that the NHS offers, it needs to operate seamlessly. There must be strong clinical networks spanning many agencies, co-operating and not trading with one another. The NHS needs strong partnership arrangements and good integration. I offer a practical example from my own neck of the woods, where there have been long-standing problems with children&#039;s services, which were to be ameliorated, in part, by co-operation between Alder Hey, the PCT and the acute trust to establish good and better clinical networks. That clinical network&#151;the solution&#151;has been blown apart, because the organisations concerned have acute individual financial needs and problems that they need to address separately rather than co-operatively.

Is he really saying that choice is such a bad thing, and that if an elderly lady were offered a hip operation either in her local hospital or in a hospital near where her daughter lives, she should not be allowed to choose the latter?
</p>





<p><a name="st_256"><a name="60509-29_spnew2"><b> John Pugh: </b> 
 I am saying that the fundamental job of the NHS, as established by Aneurin Bevan, Beveridge and so on, is to deliver entitlements. People are entitled to a degree of choice, but entitlement must come first. If the choice regime leads to things being unavailable that were previously available, entitlements are lost and disappear.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-29_para11">
<a name="stpa_281">At present, we have a strange, perverse, hybrid market; we have a muddle, with mixed messages from the Government. Worse still, there is the potential for mayhem&#151;that should put fear into Labour Members. It is not too late for the Department of Health to turn round and be sensibly pragmatic, which we will all support; to consult and inspire the NHS work force, which it has clearly failed to do so far; to proceed on an evidence-led basis, which it has not done so far; and to listen. But that would mean the Department of Health and the Labour party taking on the crazed ideologues who buzz around No. 10. Not to fight that battle is, ultimately, to betray the NHS, and the nation.

<a name="stpa_282">The topic for debate is the management of the NHS by the Department of Health. Thank goodness the NHS is managed not by private business, as the Opposition would prefer, but by the Department of Health. I am not a dinosaur and I have no problem about the use of spare capacity in private hospitals. The hon. Member for Shipley (Philip Davies) will know what I am talking about, because the Yorkshire Clinic is near my house. The clinic is pleasant and I have attended it from time to time for minor diagnostic procedures, paid for by my health centre because my appointments were for 8 o&#039;clock on Sunday mornings. I did not mind that, because my treatment took place at times when the clinic would otherwise have been unused.

Airedale hospital is the biggest employer in my constituency; it is much loved and appreciated by patients from Settle in the north to Bingley in the south.

There is no clinical or patient need to close it, because the patients will be transferred to the only remaining Victorian asylum operating in England.

Of course, pay has gone up&#151;so it jolly well should&#151;but there are issues that we must address. In 1996, pay had gone up from 1994, and so it goes back.

<p>
<a name="60509-30_para9">
<a name="stpa_293">The PCT had a substantial and partly inherited deficit. Last week, to alleviate that deficit, it decided, against public opinion, to close community beds.

That was one of five options that the PCT had to consider. Democracy and local opinion have been mentioned, and it is of note that 94 per cent. of local people did not want that option.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-30_para10">
<a name="stpa_294">The decision was taken despite the fact that the local community in Cranleigh has raised considerable funds to rebuild Cranleigh village hospital. It was taken despite the fact that the Cranleigh village hospital trust has now been given a piece of land on which to build the hospital and despite the fact that it has planning permission to build the hospital and a partner within the project. In fact, the trust was going to build precisely what the Government would like to see: a community hospital that has flexible space, the opportunity for step-up or step-down beds and the space to perform diagnostics within the community.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-30_para11">
<a name="stpa_295">By pulling the plug on the beds at Cranleigh village hospital, the PCT has put the project in jeopardy. The partners are unsure whether there is any real commitment from the NHS to buy services from the hospital. It is extremely disappointing to local residents in Cranleigh that the Government cannot see that. I share the frustration of my hon. Friend the Member for North Shropshire (Mr. Paterson), who said that he has written to the Secretary of State and to Ministers but nobody is listening. There are exceptional circumstances&#151;Cranleigh village hospital is one&#151;where the community have embraced some of the changes that the Government would like to see and have raised all the funds to build a new hospital, but still it seems impossible to get the attention of Ministers or the Secretary of State.

Having been in balance, the trust is now forecasting a &#163;15 million overspend and today it announced plans to try to counter that. I have had some reassurance that the situation is unlikely to lead to redundancies at this stage, although I think that there will be some job losses.

I remember a time when I worked in the NHS, when the first aim and objective of many public sector workers was their pay and conditions of service. Their second objective was service delivery. That was in the &#039;70s and I remember it well. I do not believe that that is the case now or that the Royal College of Nursing did what it did the other week&#151;or is coming here to do on Thursday&#151;because those people are self-serving and are simply thinking of their own jobs. People are behaving like that because they are frustrated and because they do not feel that the Government are listening.

There is a reason I joined the Conservative party and not the Labour party and if Labour Members really want me to go back and describe the situation in the NHS when I was a nurse, I will gladly tell them about it. When I could not get a porter to take a patient to the ward and wheeled him myself, the porters went on strike for 24 hours because I was doing their job.

The hospital says that the PCT will not pay for them and the PCT says that it has funded them, but the patients are left terribly confused and do not know who is making the decision. The NHS about which some Labour Members talk is not the NHS that I recognise at the moment in Guildford.

They are coining in the money, but are operating at about 50 per cent. They get the money even if they do not do the work. Other headlines include &quot;How NHS cash goes to waste on private ops&quot;, &quot;NHS &#039;facing worst financial crisis&#039;&quot;, &quot;Threat to funds for medical training as hospital advertises for four risk assessment managers&quot; and &quot;NHS faces job cuts as financial crisis deepens&quot;.

<a name="stpa_302">I am surprised by the choice of subject for this Opposition day. I seem to remember that a previous Opposition day was dedicated to welfare reform. Today, the Conservatives have once again been kind enough to choose a subject for debate on which we have led the way since 1997.

<p>
<a name="60509-31_para5">
<a name="stpa_303">Since 1997, we have doubled investment in the NHS, and by 2008 we will have trebled it. Waiting lists are at their lowest ever. No one now waits more than six months for an operation and no one with suspected cancer waits more than two weeks to see a specialist from the day that their GP refers them.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-31_para6">
<a name="stpa_304">The hospital that serves my constituency of North-East Derbyshire, the Chesterfield Royal hospital, is beating those national statistics. The national standard for a first routine out-patient appointment is 13 weeks. At Chesterfield, a patient waits a maximum of 10 weeks, although most people do not have to wait even that long. That success is largely due to a close working relationship between our primary care trust and the hospital to ensure that waiting times are some of the lowest in the country. By the end of March last year, every single patient who was referred with suspected angina was seen within two weeks. Every single patient with suspected cancer saw a cancer specialist within two weeks, and every single patient diagnosed with cancer was treated within one month. The hon. Member for Guildford (Anne Milton) was absolutely right that this is not about politics or point scoring. What we have been doing since 1997 means that more people&#039;s lives are being saved.

<a name="stpa_305">I make no apology for being parochial. The successes and changes that we have seen in North-East Derbyshire have been astonishing, but what is most significant is the massive cultural shift that we have seen in the health service in empowering patients. From direct personal experience, I can say that the shift in emphasis to put the patient at the heart of the NHS has been our greatest success.

I am sure that everyone in the Chamber will join me in wishing him a speedy recovery. We all look forward to hearing directly from him about the positive experiences that he has had from the NHS, which is free at the point of use for everyone, based on their need and not on their ability to pay.

<a name="60509-32_para3">
<a name="stpa_314">Northamptonshire is desperately underfunded. We have heard that there are many problems and that people wish to transfer money from the wealthy areas to the poor ones. I am not sure that we are a poor area, but we are certainly heavily underfunded in local government, policing and health. The Minister for Local Government acknowledged those problems but did not act to deal with them when I visited him in December last year. They are caused by various factors&#151;I shall not go into all of them, because time forbids&#151;but a serious shortfall has resulted from the formulaic underfunding of Northamptonshire in general and Northampton in particular. We face an additional problem as the result of the sustainable communities programme that the Government have forced on us, but which most of us reject. There is sizable growth, but the need to fund extra medical provision has simply not been recognised by the Government.

<a name="60509-32_para4">
<a name="stpa_315">The most serious problems are in health. Leicestershire, Rutland and Northamptonshire strategic health authority is the worst-funded SHA relative to the notional capitation formula. Together with our PCTs, it was underfunded by &#163;88 million&#151;5.3 per cent. of the budget&#151;and thus significantly below the capitation funding level at the end of the last financial year. Northampton general hospital faces 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>9 May 2006 : Column 253</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>severe demands for a reduction in spending in two areas in particular. It has been forced to reduce spending on the 2006&#150;07 budget by &#163;7.8 million or 4.5 per cent. of the budget, which means reductions in the length of stay and staffing&#151;particularly health service staff, as well as increased day care treatment. Doctors may wish to recommend that a patient remain in hospital, but the hospital fears that it cannot allow them to do so.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-32_para5">
<a name="stpa_316">In addition, the hospital faces a further reduction of another &#163;8 million because of the transfer of certain functions to the primary care sector. I accept that that is Government policy, but it creates a massive challenge for both the hospital and the primary care sector, as there will be a 10 per cent. cut in the hospital budget and a 5 per cent. minimum increase in work load for the primary care sector. Any business man knows that there is a huge risk attached to such change within a year. I am not sure that the Government have understood what that risk element means. I can tell them. It means possible cuts in services, a lack of resource to service the requirements, and less good treatment for the patient. On top of that, we have a further problem in Northamptonshire because &#163;25 million of underfunding has been carried forward.

<a name="60509-32_para6">
<a name="stpa_317">The Office for National Statistics said that we were to have no growth in Northampton between 2001 and 2008. I invite the Minister to come to Northampton. By God, he will see growth on a massive scale, yet the ONS said that we were to have no growth, which meant that we were not funded. That was accepted by the Government. What have they done? They have given us slightly increased growth for 2006&#150;07, but have taken no account of the &#163;25 million underfunding.

That is what I mean by flexibility in the system. It is okay looking down from the macro level. I understand why you make the decisions that you do. I understand the problems that you are faced with and what you are trying to achieve, but at the micro level the impact is different and needs to be understood equally well.

<a name="stpa_320">In the city that I represent in East Yorkshire, Hull, we have people who are severely disadvantaged in terms of the economic success that they enjoy, the jobs that they are able to get and the health care that they were able to access in the past. Examining and investing in public health in Hull is key to the future prosperity and regeneration of Hull and that part of East Yorkshire. The life expectancy of a man in Hull is at least two and half years off the national average. For a woman, the corresponding figure is just over a year. That says something about the health of people in Hull. We need to discover where health inequalities exist and address them.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-32_para10">
<a name="stpa_321">In Hull we have single-handed GP practices, with GPs operating in small houses that they have changed into surgeries. Those are not suitable for the kind of health care that we need in 2005&#150;06. In the past, the emphasis was on acute hospitals&#151;district general hospitals. We will always need hospitals, but we also need to ensure that we invest in our community sector. I was pleased that there was some debate earlier about the LIFT programme and the money that the Government have identified to go into enhanced service delivery for GPs, linked to the wider regeneration of areas such as Hull.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-32_para11">
<a name="stpa_322">I would like to deal with the effect on my constituency of the massive investment that has been put into it over the last few years, particularly in respect of the Hull and East Yorkshire NHS hospitals trust, an acute trust. About &#163;6 million has been invested in the creation of the Hull and East Yorkshire eye hospital and &#163;35 million has been put into the building of the Hull and East Yorkshire women and children&#039;s hospital, which opened two years ago. Plans are afoot&#151;the first contractors are on site&#151;to build a &#163;45 million cardiac and elective surgical facility at the Castle Hill hospital site, and &#163;60 million is available for a new oncology centre at Castle Hill. Several other smaller capital developments are either planned or already in progress. My constituents are really seeing the benefits of massive investment in the NHS in Hull and east Yorkshire.

<a name="stpa_323">My area in Hull is rated ninth out of the 354 local authorities and districts in the country in respect of disadvantage and deprivation: health care is thus a key issue for us. I was very pleased that the Hull York medical school came to the Hull university site a few years ago, which meant that we were training doctors who would, we hoped, decide to make their careers in the Hull and East Riding area. We put in a bid for a new dental school, but it was unfortunately not successful. I remain hopeful of another round and another strong bid from the Hull York site, which should be viewed favourably by the Government.

<a name="stpa_324">I want to finish with a few comments on some recent visits that I have made. The first was to the East Yorkshire eye hospital. I encountered a fabulous NHS staff team there, including a consultant who told me that, from the day he sees someone who needs a cataract operation, he can be operating nine days later. I believe that that is phenomenal when we think that a few years ago, people in Hull and elsewhere had to face months of misery before having a cataract operation. Nine days is brilliant and something to be very proud of.

<a name="stpa_325">We should also pay tribute to the flexible way in which NHS staff now work. It was interesting to hear from the hon. Member for Wyre Forest (Dr. Taylor) about what I thought was a rather old-fashioned way of demarcating doctors, nurses, matrons and so forth. What I felt was so refreshing when I visited the eye hospital was the fact that the consultant, the nurses and the administrators worked incredibly well together to ensure that the patient experience was the best possible. It was a real team, which recognised the importance of working as a team. There was no pulling rank in the sense that the consultant had considerable experience while others did not: they operated as a team, which demonstrates the way forward.

<a name="stpa_326">I would like to say a few words about the Hull and East Yorkshire women and children&#039;s hospital, which provides midwifery-led care. We also have the Jubilee birth centre, which is totally midwife led, but the costs are quite high. We have to think about costs and the type of facilities that we provide to expectant parents.

<p><a name="st_287"><a name="60509-33_spnew0"><b> Sandra Gidley: </b> 
 The hon. Lady mentioned the cost of the midwife-led centre, but there is a body of opinion that clearly demonstrates that the wider cost benefits are often not taken into account. The key benefit of a midwife-led unit is the one-to-one care, which means that there are fewer interventions. That is simply not taken into consideration when we look at the issue from a purely accounting perspective. Does she agree that that should be taken into account as well?
</p>





<p><a name="st_288"><a name="60509-33_spnew1"><b> Ms Johnson: </b> 
 That is probably right. When I visited the Jubilee birth centre, I was rather taken aback when told the cost of each birth in comparison with having a baby at the women and children&#039;s hospital. It was because it was midwife led and no consultants or doctors were there to deal with any emergencies. Women then had to be put into an ambulance and taken back to the centre of Hull. There are many important issues there.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-33_para0">
<a name="stpa_327">When the Jubilee centre was being designed, I suspect that management was not thinking sufficiently clearly. There are two sites in Hull&#151;one in central Hull, the other in East Riding. It is now believed that elective surgery and planned occurrences such as having a baby should be carried out on the site outside Hull and that the acute hospital should deal with accident and emergency and provide urgent treatment that cannot be arranged in advance. The issue involves management and thinking about what will be most effective for people in a particular area. Ten years ago, such issues would not have been thought through as well as they are today, and I know that today&#039;s plans involve splitting off elective care from A and E and the acute sector.

<a name="60509-33_para1">
<a name="stpa_328">Finally, I want to mention the PCTs in Hull, which are spearhead PCTs because we have some of the worst deprivation in the country. I am very pleased about the reconfiguration of the PCTs. At the moment, we have East Hull PCT and West Hull PCT, but we will have one PCT for Hull, which is sensible because it will be coterminous with the local authority. Furthermore, the local authority and the PCTs are already working together on the public health agenda: a public health director has been jointly appointed; work is going on in our schools to encourage healthy eating among young

 We have had a wide-ranging debate today, so I shall keep my comments brief and focus on some of the pertinent issues.

<p>
<a name="60509-33_para3">
<a name="stpa_330">The people of Basingstoke are proud of their health care professionals: we are proud that we have one of the top 40 hospitals in the country; we are proud that we have world leaders in bowel and liver cancer in North Hampshire hospital; and we are very proud of the Ark, which is a medical research and learning centre located at the hospital. We have a team of dedicated professionals, who do a very good job.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-33_para4">
<a name="stpa_331">In response to my questions about the future of health care in my constituency, the Minister usually blames people on the ground for our problems&#151;in my part of the world, the health care crisis is real. I think that the origins of the problem lie not with the people who work in my constituency, but with the Department of Health, which needs to take a long, hard look at its own management before pointing at people who live in north Hampshire.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-33_para5">
<a name="stpa_332">The financial crisis in north Hampshire is real, but the problem runs deeper and stems from management practices in the Department of Health. Unless those problems are addressed, we will continue to pump taxpayers&#039; money into a structurally dysfunctional organisation. What is structurally dysfunctional about the Department of Health or, using language that the Government understand, where does the systemic failure lie? In too many cases, there is no link between the central strategies followed by the Department of Health and what is delivered on the ground. The Government are trying to micro-manage from Whitehall, but they do not take responsibility when things start to unravel on the ground in our constituencies, and we have heard many examples of that today. I follow my hon. Friend the Member for Guildford (Anne Milton) in hoping that Ministers are listening to the problems, which are real.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-33_para6">
<a name="stpa_333">I shall give the House two brief examples. A key plank of Department of Health strategy is to move patients from being treated in an acute setting in hospital to being treated in the community. We have been told that that strategy reflects the patients&#039; desire to be treated closer to home. In my experience, most patients want to be treated in the most appropriate place, which should be down to doctors, but we have been told to follow that strategy in order to reduce referrals to secondary care and to control the financial situation. GPs in my constituency have acted responsibly and organised themselves to take the challenge seriously and to examine delivering services in GP surgeries which have historically been delivered in hospital. However, we have no community hospitals in my constituency.


<br>&nbsp;<br>

<p>
<a name="60509-33_para7">
<a name="stpa_334">We have identified at least four surgeries that need a lot of investment, possibly even new accommodation, in order to be able to increase services of the kind that the Government are talking about. Staff at our doctors&#039; surgeries are working in intolerable conditions, which I could go through in detail if time allowed. Despite the Government&#039;s strategy of trying to take people out of acute services and into our community, there is simply no money available from the primary care trust for any new doctors&#039; surgeries to fulfil either the strategy of trying to increase the services that are available through surgeries or the demands of the many thousands of new people who are moving to Basingstoke every single year.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-33_para8">
<a name="stpa_335">Our GPs have had problems with regard to the Department&#039;s accounting practices, which are beyond me. As a simple person who has been in business for about 17 years, I find that the way in which the Department tries to put together accounting practices is for the benefit of nobody but itself. When doctors look at creative ways of trying to improve services for their patients, financial limitations, in the shape of accounting procedures, are put in their way. That is deplorable.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-33_para9">
<a name="stpa_336">As I said, a key plank of the Department&#039;s strategy is to move more patients from being treated in an acute setting in hospital to being treated in the community, but there is no money to invest to make it become a reality. It needs to take a long, hard look at that short-termism, which is destabilising the long-term robustness of the community health service in my constituency.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-33_para10">
<a name="stpa_337">That level of dysfunction does not end there; it extends to departmental announcements that have no way of being delivered on the ground. One example that will have led to similar problems for many other hon. Members is that of IVF treatment. When the Department&#151;indeed, the then Secretary of State, who is now Home Secretary&#151;announced that by 1 April 2005 all hospitals would be able to provide at least one cycle of IVF treatment, that built up the hopes of a great many of our constituents. It received good media coverage for that&#151;just before a general election, I seem to recall&#151;but the reality is that health care providers in our constituencies cannot provide that service on the ground. There was no more money to deliver, and the result was a great deal of distress and pain for people who deserve better. It does not seem to matter much to the Department whether the headline matches the reality.

 I am pleased to be able to speak in this debate to raise concerns about what is happening in my very well regarded hospital trust&#151;the Mayday trust. It recently benefited from significant investment in the capital of its building, but now faces a &#163;6.8 million overspend that is described by the departing chief executive as a significant financial problem. Indeed, it is a problem that will also be worrying staff, as it is expected that several rounds of reductions in posts, and some redundancies, will have an adverse effect on the performance of this excellent trust.

<a name="60509-33_para12">
<a name="stpa_339">I listened closely to what the hon. Member for Keighley (Mrs. Cryer) said about supporting the elderly, because the Mayday trust has found it necessary to close down a ward that was dedicated to such support. In times of financial difficulty, inappropriate decisions are often made whereby services are in effect forced to transfer to other parts of the public sector, often to areas where the eventual cost of care will be greater than it would have been for the authority that has been trying to transfer it to others.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-33_para13">
<a name="stpa_340">I am also worried about the distorting effects of centrally set targets on my local primary care trust. Croydon PCT found it necessary, in its desire to match a Government short-term target for the completion of operations, to pay over the odds for evening and weekend operations. The PCT&#039;s director of commissioning said:

</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-33_para15">
<a name="stpa_342">I am also worried about the future of an important investment that was made in the walk-in centre in Croydon. Estimates show that it has been successful in serving 32,000 visitors a year. It is an important service, especially when we bear in mind that it deals with many unregistered people, often migrants from Lunar house. That nurse-led service, which relied on support from doctors, now finds that, despite the good investment that has been made, it is no longer able to afford doctor support.

 I want to make two brief points. First, I welcome the two new Ministers&#151;the hon. Member for Leigh (Andy Burnham) and the hon. Member for Bury, South (Mr. Lewis)&#151;to their posts and wish them success.I have sat through the long debate, in which we had, with one notable exception, thought-provoking, valid contributions of quality.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-34_para0">
<a name="stpa_344">My first point is a macro point. No hon. Member wants the NHS to be out of financial balance. However, the Government&#039;s macro reality is that they are spending &#163;96 billion on the NHS, whereas my micro reality is that my local acute hospital and my PCT are in deficit. The Government&#039;s macro reality is that, as the Secretary of State said, the financial problems are always created by the trusts. That is not so. The bulk of my constituents in Wimbledon look to St. George&#039;s as their acute hospital, which is in the constituency of the hon. Member for Tooting (Mr. Khan). I have spoken to the financial director, Mr. Colin Gentile, and the turnaround team has done a good job. However, one of the problems that exacerbated the deficit was the inability of the Department of Health to get its tariffs 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>9 May 2006 : Column 259</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>correct in the first place. Although the Government say that the problems are always caused by the trusts, that is not the case.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-34_para1">
<a name="stpa_345">Secondly, let me consider the local point. The hon. Member for Mitcham and Morden (Siobhain McDonagh), who is no longer in her place, made an ill-tempered contribution, in which she allowed no interventions. Her constituency is next to mine and we share a borough council and a health reality. The health reality that she portrayed was not that that some of us experience. Yes, several improvements have taken place at Sutton and Merton PCT but she should also have said that it has deficits. Some are due to overspending, which it needs to put right, but others, as in the case of St. George&#039;s healthcare trust, are due to a problem about which it could do nothing. An arbitration settlement from three years ago hit it. Community practice nurses, the district nursing service and the home health visiting service are consequently being cut. The White Paper states that community health provision should not be cut as a result of short-term budgetary issues. I ask Ministers to think about that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-34_para2">
<a name="stpa_346">The hon. Member for Mitcham and Morden also spoke a lot about the &quot;Better Healthcare Closer to Home&quot; project, and about her supposedly great victory in retaining St. Helier hospital. St. Helier was never going to be closed: it was either going to be a local care centre or an acute care trust. She misrepresented the situation several times, and I look forward to reading <i>Hansard</i> carefully tomorrow and, I hope, making some points of order and asking for some corrections.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-34_para3">
<a name="stpa_347">The overwhelming point is that, although the Secretary of State granted the hospital a reprieve as an acute care trust, she failed to consider what would happen to the local care trusts. As a result of that decision, the whole &quot;Better Healthcare Closer to Home&quot; project has now gone into abeyance, and the business case has been distorted. My constituents in Wimbledon, who want to see excellent local primary care delivered through the local care hospital, can no longer be certain that that will happen, either in the given time scale or at all.

 This is a timely debate, given the considerable uncertainty in the national health service, both nationally and in my local area. My local acute trust has overspent by &#163;24 million, which means that it will have to make considerable savings. There is no doubt about that. Some of the reasons for the overspend are quite interesting. The trust talks about an overspend from the last financial year, as well as about money that needs to be spent over the next year in order to meet Government targets and to comply with other financial pressures. Therein lies the message.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-34_para4">
<a name="stpa_348">Health trusts have tried hard to meet the various targets that the Government have set. They have had to reduce waiting times and perform a certain number of operations and procedures, for example, in order to meet those targets. The problem is that, in doing so, they have overspent. It is a bit rich of Ministers to point the finger at health trust bosses who have done their bidding 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>9 May 2006 : Column 260</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>and performed the tasks that they were asked to perform, and who are now being threatened with the sack because they have overspent. The Government cannot have it both ways, and it is absurd that they appear to want to take that position.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-34_para5">
<a name="stpa_349">It is likely that 190 beds will be lost in the hospital sector in my local health community. That is partly due to relocation to a new hospital site funded by a public-private partnership. I welcome the creation of the new health facilities, provided that they are used effectively and properly. My concern, however, is that that is not going to happen, because efficiencies&#151;such as those relating to the use of theatre time&#151;that need to be put in place now have not been followed through properly.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-34_para6">
<a name="stpa_350">In the Secretary of State&#039;s opening speech, she commented on the fact that my local hospital trust was going to make savings from the temporary agency staff budget. That might be quite clear, but she appeared to pass over the issue on the ground that that meant that there would be no loss of clinical staff on the front line. I simply do not accept that. While those savings are part of the recovery plan that the health trust is putting in place, it seems clear to me that the jobs of permanent front-line staff will be threatened.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-34_para7">
<a name="stpa_351">The comments made by the chief executive of the health authority are germane to this argument. He said:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_51">&quot;I hope we will not have to make any more reductions in staff&#151;650 is a large number and will help to make substantial savings, but I cannot guarantee that there will not be further reductions next year.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-34_para8">
<a name="stpa_352">We are talking about problems that are being experienced now, but I perceive that there will be significant problems next year, as we suddenly realise that the necessary savings cannot be made and that more pressures are being brought to bear. As the chief executive of my health trust is suggesting, more job savings on the front line might be needed. Locally, there is considerable uncertainty. The local health economy faces a number of challenges, which the professionals, nurses and doctors are working extremely hard to meet, but the threats are there.

<a name="60509-34_para9">
<a name="stpa_353">We are constantly told that what is going on is all down to local decision making. Therefore, the Government are in some way off the hook. However, I draw the Minister&#039;s attention to the fact that PCTs and other health bodies must adhere to the framework set by the Department of Health. Priorities set from the centre must be adhered to, spending levels must be followed and increases in spending cannot be applied elsewhere. The suggestion that it is all about local decision making and local management misses the point. It is about central direction, the priorities set by Government and failures from the centre. The localities must deal with that, but the problems are caused by the centre.

<br>&nbsp;<br>hon. Member for Bury, South (Mr. Lewis) to their posts. I also welcome the promotion of the former Under-Secretary of State, the hon. Member for Don Valley (Caroline Flint) to Minister of State.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-34_para10">
<a name="stpa_354">We are here to hold the Secretary of State to account for the shambolic way in which she has mismanaged the finances of our national health service. She somehow avoided the Prime Minister&#039;s Cabinet purge last week. More than anything else, the Prime Minister&#039;s fatigue with the NHS is shown by the fact that he is happy for it to limp on under her misdirection. With the continued incompetent leadership of the Department of Health, it is timely that we should provide the Government with the chance to bring in a turnaround team.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-34_para11">
<a name="stpa_355">In this debate, we have heard countless examples of the impact of that incompetence on constituents of Members on both sides of the House, and of the cuts in front-line patient services as a result of those financial pressures. We heard first from the Chairman of the Health Committee, the right hon. Member for Rother Valley (Mr. Barron), and methinks he doth protest a bit too much. Having given the Secretary of State a lesson in how to deploy statistics, he should reflect on the way in which his speech was analysed by the former Secretary of State for Health, my right hon. Friend the Member for Charnwood (Mr. Dorrell), who spoke immediately afterwards. He described accurately how and why many members of the national health service reacted to the Secretary of State as they did. He showed that the constant reorganisation and the way in which things have gone full circle have caused a serious collapse in morale, and that frustration and anger have been caused by the constant management changes from the centre, leading to mismanagement of resources. That illustrated the real difference between the approach taken by the governing party and the alternative.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-34_para12">
<a name="stpa_356">We also heard the hon. Member for Wyre Forest (Dr. Taylor), who is in his place, talk from experience about the fear that underlies the quality of care issues. Apart from advocating the return of matrons, which is close to the Opposition&#039;s heart, he told us how reforms needed to be put on hold for a moment.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-34_para13">
<a name="stpa_357">We heard an interesting contribution from the hon. Member for Dartford (Dr. Stoate), a practising doctor, who described the increase in pay for doctors as of some interest. I do not think that he is in his place at the moment. He was followed by the hon. Member for High Peak (Tom Levitt), whose many interventions must have lasted as long as his speech. He made only one point that I thought was worth putting on record&#151;about the difficulty of being on the border between two English regions and the disparities that that creates. I ask him to consider the problems of being on the border with Wales. The health provision for my constituents in Farndon is completely different from that for those in Holt in Wales, 200 yd across the River Dee. Those disparities are caused by the ill-thought-through devolution of health in Wales.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-34_para14">
<a name="stpa_358">One of the most interesting experiences in a long debate was the speech by the hon. Member for Mitcham and Morden (Siobhain McDonagh), who, after relating some personal stories, delivered one of the longest ranting press releases that any of us has had to hear. On the question of health inequalities, she made the serious point that the Secretary of State was advised by the director of public health in London, Dr. Sue Atkinson, 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>9 May 2006 : Column 262</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>who, I am told, said that the Secretary of State&#039;s decision was precisely the wrong one to address the health inequalities in her area. No wonder the hon. Lady did not like the professional health establishment. Not surprisingly, none of its members agreed with her, or, indeed, with the Secretary of State.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-34_para15">
<a name="stpa_359">We then heard rather a long speech by the hon. Member for Colne Valley (Kali Mountford). We also heard some interesting definitions of markets from the hon. Member for Southport (John Pugh). I think we were all genuinely moved by the personal testimony of the hon. Member for Keighley (Mrs. Cryer), which was much appreciated.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-34_para16">
<a name="stpa_360">It may have gone unnoticed by many Members that, having described her own experiences, the hon. Member for North-East Derbyshire (Natascha Engel) referred emphatically to the patients forums. She hoped that they would continue doing work that she thought would be useful. In fact, it has been announced that they will be scrapped. After much argument&#151;not least an argument in which I was personally involved&#151;the Government replaced the community health councils, which were scrapped. Yet again there had been a false claim by the Prime Minister, for which he had to apologise to me in a three-page letter, that he had consulted before he decided to axe them.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-34_para17">
<a name="stpa_361">However, the hon. Lady also made an important point with which I think all Members would agree&#151;that we should send our good wishes to the Doorkeeper Calvin Thomas. Some of us were around when he collapsed, and I think the whole House will welcome the news that he has undergone a successful operation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-34_para18">
<a name="stpa_362">The hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, North (Ms Johnson) was, of course, perfectly entitled to say that the NHS was a political issue, but she implied that if people did not agree with her about the way in which it was funded, they were clearly not in favour of the service itself. All Members throughout the House agree that it should be a national health service, free at the point of need and supported by central taxation, with equity of access.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-34_para19">
<a name="stpa_363">At the time of the most recent general election, there was a clear commitment from the official Opposition to expenditure equal to the amount proposed by the Government and announced by the Chancellor for the period up to 2008, however the money was to be raised. The Government have not committed themselves to any amount beyond 2008. The suggestion being made in the Whips&#039; handouts to the parliamentary Labour party is therefore a complete Aunt Sally. I have some of the notes here. The main argument that features in the material that the Whips keep handing out to Labour Members&#151;they have done it before every health debate in which I have been involved for the past few months&#151;is that there is a distinction between us when it comes to funding. There is not. We made a total commitment to the same level of funding as the Government&#039;s until 2008. The question concerns the way in which it is spent, how the Department of Health is led and the competence of the Secretary of State, her Ministers and the leadership of the Department of Health.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-34_para20">
<a name="stpa_364">We heard a measured and thoughtful speech from my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Sussex (Mr. Soames), who plainly felt that support for the health service was universal but that there was deep disappointment about 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>9 May 2006 : Column 263</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>the absence of productivity gains. He came up with an idea that we should all consider, involving the possibility of an equivalent of a professional training college for public service employees.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-34_para21">
<a name="stpa_365">My hon. Friend the Member for New Forest, West (Mr. Swayne) was very articulate in demystifying issues relating to the perceptions of many people in constituencies about the needs that can be serviced by the NHS. I am sure that his constituents will be extremely grateful to him for ensuring that the Secretary of State personally heard his advocacy on behalf of those who are suffering serious delays, especially in connection with digital hearing aids, and what he said about the closure of community hospitals on his patch. They will hope that the Secretary of State takes the appropriate action.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-34_para22">
<a name="stpa_366">My hon. Friend the Member for Guildford (Anne Milton) spoke of her personal experience of the health service. In particular, she stood up for her constituents in Cranleigh. She is finding it very difficult to get any Minister to take account of their health needs.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-34_para23">
<a name="stpa_367">One Labour Member described her party&#039;s &quot;greatest achievement&quot;, so I shall use the same phrase to describe my hon. Friend the Member for Northampton, South (Mr. Binley), who is our party&#039;s greatest achievement. Displaying his experience of management and gaining value for money, he invited the Minister to visit Northampton and see for herself what was needed there.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-34_para24">
<a name="stpa_368">My hon. Friend the Member for Basingstoke (Mrs. Miller) expressed her clear expectation that health care provision should be redirected toward the primary end. However, the health budget has not been adjusted sufficiently to make that deliverable. The Government have resorted to policy rhetoric and failed to provide the mechanism to deliver such provision. My hon. Friends the Members for Croydon, Central (Mr. Pelling) and for Wimbledon (Stephen Hammond) identified on their constituents&#039; behalf the need for efficient investment in the health service, and to balance finances in order to respond to local need. That point was reflected by my hon. Friend the Member for Hornchurch (James Brokenshire), who discussed costs.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-34_para25">
<a name="stpa_369">We have to make it clear that the issue in today&#039;s debate, as my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Sussex said, is the competence of the Secretary of State, not of the hard-working doctors and nurses whom we support, and who are doing their best to deliver health care for our constituents. The shadow Secretary of State made with forensic skill&#151;as skilfully as if he had used a surgeon&#039;s knife&#151;the case for the prosecution concerning the financial competence of the Secretary of State, her Ministers and the Department of Health.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-34_para26">
<a name="stpa_370">Most people will agree that, sadly, the Secretary of State&#039;s reply was flat-footed and a touch too shrill. If there had been a bucket of sand in the Chamber, Mr. Speaker, you would have believed that, ostrich-like, she had her head buried in it. The problem is not only what she says, but the way in which she says it. Hard-working doctors and nurses&#151;let alone the public at large&#151;are fed up to the back teeth with being talked down to, and with everything being larded with a smile from here to Australia.

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-34_para27">
<a name="stpa_371">Let me recap the howlers that have been committed. The Secretary of State has not listened to NHS staff or to patients. She has consistently meddled and interfered, using centralised, top-down management under the cloak of the word &quot;local&quot;, and ducking the blame as her meddling goes wrong. <i>[Interruption.]</i> Now her Parliamentary Private Secretary, who is from Scotland and has absolutely no relevance to this debate whatever, is trying to intervene from a sedentary position. The Secretary of State has presided over 13,000 job losses so far, with more expected to be announced any day. She has consistently underestimated the deficits, leading directly to real cuts in front-line patient services. She botched a needless reorganisation, and is now returning the organisation of the NHS to a map that applied until 2002.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-34_para28">
<a name="stpa_372">The Secretary of State has allowed health inequalities to widen. More community hospitals are closing or being cut as we speak. She has had an adverse impact on training and employment throughout the service. Her handling of Herceptin was a fiasco, as my hon. Friend&#151;and neighbour&#151;the Member for North Shropshire (Mr. Paterson) forcefully highlighted. She miscalculated the demand for flu drugs by forgetting about Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. She underestimated the new doctors&#039; and consultants&#039; contracts, introduced a shambolic dental contract and wasted time and money delaying the Barts private finance initiative. This year she is underfunding hospitals, and according to the <i>Health Service Journal</i>, the tariff was a &quot;total cock-up&quot;. She has had to cut back, backtrack and apologise, and she has allowed the home oxygen service to collapse. She has made little progress on the targets for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and her NHS information technology programme is behind schedule, under fire from the experts and of uncertain cost&#151;and what a cost.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-34_para29">
<a name="stpa_373">The Secretary of State failed to get the Chancellor to address the NHS at all in the Budget. She axed the Mental Health Bill and allowed her Ministers to make spending commitments without the money to support them. Public health campaigns&#151;notably the bowel cancer screening programme&#151;have been severely delayed on her watch. Failure is rewarded with the spending of taxpayers&#039; money in the Department of Health. The Under-Secretary with direct responsibility for public health was promoted. Before the reshuffle there were two Ministers of State and two Under-Secretaries; now there are three Ministers of State and one Under-Secretary. That amounts to a 3 per cent. pay rise within the faction of Ministers&#151;at the very time when doctors and nurses are losing their jobs as a result of their financial mismanagement. Finally, the Secretary of State then tried to blame it all on the Conservatives.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-34_para30">
<a name="stpa_374">To try to mitigate the financial mismanagement of the NHS, the Secretary of State has sent turnaround teams into the most troubled trusts. The full cost, like so much else, has been kept hidden. There is clearly a pattern, and we must look carefully at it. Of course the NHS deficit is the biggest scandal. It is the legacy that the Secretary of State will leave behind when the Prime Minister next needs to clear the headlines with a reshuffle. Indeed, it is the legacy that the Prime Minister will leave: he will be remembered as the leader of a Labour Government who could not be trusted with the NHS.

If she covers up some failings with the empty cacophony of the restructuring programme, others are hidden by a deafening silence. Our national health service is too important for that. We want it to succeed, and we want it to succeed now. To remedy the financial mismanagement today, we need a turnaround team to go into the Department of Health today.

He forgot to say that they were committed to a policy that would have taken millions of pounds out of the national health service.

 The right hon. Member for Charnwood said in this debate that GP fundholding was being reintroduced, but I remind him of the inequitable situation that existed when there were fundholding GPs, and non-fundholding GPs.

<p><a name="st_305"><a name="60509-35_spnew8"><b> Andy Burnham: </b> 
 I will not give way to the hon. Gentleman. That completely arbitrary system gave people differential access to secondary care, and it would never be countenanced by this Government. I give way to the right hon. Member for Charnwood.
</p>





<p><a name="st_306"><a name="60509-35_spnew9"><b> Mr. Dorrell: </b> 
 I am grateful to the Minister for giving way. When I was Secretary of State for Health, our policy was to encourage every GP who so wanted to become a GP fundholder. The Government&#039;s policy is to encourage every GP to engage in practice-based commissioning. Will he explain the difference to the House?

<p><a name="st_307"><a name="60509-35_spnew10"><b> Andy Burnham: </b> 
 I will. The bureaucracy created by the right hon. Gentleman&#039;s system was strangling the NHS. As I said, he was not able to get the then Chancellor, the right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke), to pay for the expansion that he envisaged. I listened carefully to the lecture that the right hon. Gentleman gave Ministers today, but it was undermined somewhat by what the shadow Secretary of State told the House in his contribution. He said that the percentage deficit was higher when the Tories left office than it is now, and gave the bizarre explanation that that 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>9 May 2006 : Column 268</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>was because the then Conservative Government were preparing to be succeeded by a Labour Government. I do not accept that: the large deficits that existed when the right hon. Member for Charnwood left his post as Secretary of State for Health were partly due to the fact that the previous Conservative Government would not put the money in.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-35_para10">
<a name="stpa_387">As always, my hon. Friend the Member for Dartford (Dr. Stoate) spoke from the front line with great passion and knowledge. He was absolutely right to say that we must move to self-sufficiency in work force planning, and that we should blur the boundary between secondary and primary care. He also rightly drew attention to the Kaiser Permanente model, where specialists work alongside primary care workers. I believe that the LIFT centres that this Government have created in areas such as mine will enable us to make changes to that model of care so that secondary care services can be delivered in communities, and my hon. Friend the Member for Kingston upon Hull, North (Ms Johnson) was absolutely right to draw attention to that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-35_para11">
<a name="stpa_388">The hon. Member for Mid-Sussex made a measured contribution. His trust is dealing with financial pressures and the Department has offered support through the turnaround team. He made an impassioned call for decentralisation. I share that aim, which is precisely what foundation trusts are about. It is not just for professionals and managers to make local decisions; it is for local people on the boards of their hospitals. We are committed to seeing all trusts become foundation trusts.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-35_para12">
<a name="stpa_389">My hon. Friend the Member for High Peak (Tom Levitt) spoke knowledgeably about issues in his local health service. He said that there were no redundancies, which is the case in the vast majority of constituencies.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-35_para13">
<a name="stpa_390">The hon. Member for New Forest, West (Mr. Swayne) drew attention to access to GP services and told us that there were 60 GPs per 100,000 people in the New Forest PCT. That may be so, but there are only 45 GPs per 100,000 in my PCT, so I hope that the hon. Gentleman understands that there are great needs in constituencies such as mine. We have to ensure that there is fairness and that resources go where they are most needed.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-35_para14">
<a name="stpa_391">My hon. Friend the Member for Mitcham and Morden (Siobhain McDonagh) spoke about the situation in south London. I listened carefully as she told us about the excellent care that her parents receive. I served on the Health Committee with my hon. Friend, where she always spoke fearlessly about the problems faced in her local health service. I welcome what she said today.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-35_para15">
<a name="stpa_392">The hon. Member for Wyre Forest (Dr. Taylor), with whom I also served on the Select Committee, mentioned its report on foundation trusts. If I remember correctly, he was one of those making dire, apocalyptic predictions when foundations trusts were being created. The predictions did not come true. Foundation trusts have been shown to work; they are a success. We do not want unnecessary reorganisation, but we do not want to stand still either. Where reorganisation is good for the NHS we should get on with it.

<a name="stpa_393">My hon. Friend the Member for Colne Valley (Kali Mountford) made a passionate speech, as did my hon. Friend the Member for Keighley (Mrs. Cryer) who   spoke of her personal experiences. I pay tribute to her.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-35_para17">
<a name="stpa_394">The hon. Members for Southport (John Pugh) and for Guildford (Anne Milton) made intelligent speeches. My hon. Friend the Member for North-East Derbyshire (Natascha Engel) made a particularly important point about strengthening the patient voice in the NHS&#151;I have heard her remarks. She also asked us to send good wishes to the Doorkeeper, Calvin Thomas. I am pleased that she went across the river to visit him. I hope that the whole House will send him good wishes. As someone who debated football with him from the opposite side of the Merseyside debate, I hope that his recovery will not be halted by Liverpool&#039;s defeat in the FA cup final at the weekend.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-35_para18">
<a name="stpa_395">The hon. Member for Northampton, South (Mr. Binley) made an entertaining speech. I listened carefully to his invitation and I will go to Northampton, but I want him to involve my hon. Friend the Member for Northampton, North (Ms Keeble) who has been discussing the issues with my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State. Let us work through them.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-35_para19">
<a name="stpa_396">My hon. Friend the Member for Kingston upon Hull, North made the important point that the NHS is intensely political. Opposition Members, in a self-serving argument say, &quot;Let&#039;s take the politics out of the health service&#151;there&#039;s no real debate between us&quot;. Well, there are differences between us. The Labour party created the NHS; we believe in it and we believe in its future. There will continue to be major differences between us. My hon. Friend is right to reject the Conservative attempt to neutralise health. She was absolutely on the button when she made that point today.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-35_para20">
<a name="stpa_397">There were interesting contributions from the hon. Members for Basingstoke (Mrs. Miller), for Croydon, Central (Mr. Pelling), for Wimbledon (Stephen Hammond) and for Hornchurch (James Brokenshire). I am sure that their points will have been heard.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-35_para21">
<a name="stpa_398">In conclusion, I do not hide from the fact that this is likely to be a tough year for parts of our national health service and for the staff who work in it. But there are no major compulsory redundancy exercises, nor shall we be deflected from saying that the NHS is making outstanding progress.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-35_para22">
<a name="stpa_399">As we reach the end of the debate, I urge Members to reflect on what they have heard from the Opposition. Conservative Front Benchers want to unpick and break the coalition of support that sustains the NHS, but whenever they add their voice in support of those whom they have never supported we have to ask why. Their aim is not save jobs or secure better conditions; they seek to undermine public confidence in the NHS and to splinter its support base. They propose vouchers and privatisation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-35_para23">
<a name="stpa_400">The Conservatives tell us that they have changed, but I remember the hon. Member for Woodspring (Dr. Fox), now a member of the shadow Cabinet, telling us about his four-point plan&#151;his secret plan to destabilise the NHS&#151;but we will have none of it. When the Tories talk about the NHS, we know that they will never change their colours. When people vote blue, they get

<a name="60509-38_head5"><h3 align=center>Proposed Closure of RAF Hythe</h3>


<p><a name="st_321"><i>Motion made, and Question proposed,</i> That this House do now adjourn.&#151;<i>[Mr. Roy.]</i></p>



<a name="time_28">
<a name="60509-38_time2"><h5>10.34 pm</h5>


<p><a name="st_322"><a name="60509-38_spnew3"><b> Dr. Julian Lewis  (New Forest, East) (Con):</b> 
 Anybody looking at the title of this Adjournment debate could be forgiven for anticipating that I am yet another Conservative Member standing up to complain about the Government&#039;s closure of an RAF base. That would be very far from the truth. I am delighted to say that the Minister has been giving the utmost support and consideration to my efforts to prevent the closure of the base. He has been able to do that not only because he has safely survived the reshuffle, which I am delighted to see&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i> I am delighted that he is delighted. He has also been able to do it because RAF Hythe is not a British base at all. Since 1967, when General de Gaulle threw NATO bag and baggage out of France in the atmosphere of fraternal French military support to which we have become so accustomed, the base has been a US army facility in my constituency. It masquerades under the title of a Royal Air Force base and deals primarily with water craft, as one would expect given such consistency so far.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-38_para2">
<a name="stpa_410">What RAF Hythe has done over these years is quite phenomenal. It has developed from what was originally a storage base into an advanced network of shipbuilding maintenance repair and upgrading skills that is second to none in the US armed forces. That has been acknowledged. In order to give the House an idea of what the equipment that is so well looked after by the personnel at RAF Hythe is for, I ask hon. Members to imagine the Mulberry harbours, which, perhaps by coincidence, were also developed, constructed and deployed from the Solent and Southampton Water region. Mulberry harbours were the artificial harbours that enabled a port to be opened on the coastline of occupied France when opposed landings were being made.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-38_para3">
<a name="stpa_411">That is the work to which RAF Hythe has been essentially committed. It is involved in the preparation of causeways and the maintenance and upgrading of port-opening vessels, floating cranes, and medium-sized and small landing craft. Another particular line of expertise has been the maintenance of fleets of small vessels that were originally deployed on the back of a very large ship based in Diego Garcia, a place that I may mention again later. That large vessel, which was a semi-submersible, would be able to transport the small vessels to anywhere they were needed, flood down, and float them off, and thereby enable a floating point of deployment for the application of military force to a hostile shore.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-38_para4">
<a name="stpa_412">Over the years, the staff of RAF Hythe, who are, with the exception of two or three American personnel, entirely British, have been called upon to perform many functions, and they have never failed. They wrote the textbooks on the way to dehumidify and preserve water craft and other military assets so that they can be pre-positioned in various theatres around the world. What is more, they developed the techniques and wrote the manual for bringing those dehumidified and otherwise stored assets safely back into service and ready for deployment within a 10-day period. In 2002, it was 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>9 May 2006 : Column 281</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>decided that 30 of those vessels should be pre-positioned to serve the far east theatre at Yokohama north dock in Japan. In 2003&#150;04, a similar pre-positioning of another 30 such vessels was arranged to be carried out in Kuwait naval base. That was in no way to diminish the role of Hythe, which was integral to setting up those two bases and has been essential in carrying out the missions that the bases perform.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-38_para5">
<a name="stpa_413">At Yokohama north dock, an attempt was made to contract out one of the less skilled functions that the direct US army-employed work force of Hythe had previously performed. It was such a failure both in the quality of the work and the cost that the services of ITT, the contractor company, were dispensed with and Hythe was recommissioned to carry on with the work.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-38_para6">
<a name="stpa_414">The key document to which I shall refer is an audit, which was carried out early this year and presented on 13 March to Major-General Johnson, who is at army field support command at Rock Island, Illinois. That is the next step up in the chain of command from which the facility at Hythe derives its work and instructions. The audit examined four options for continuing the work, which the work force at Hythe, who are directly employed by the US army, has hitherto carried out.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-38_para7">
<a name="stpa_415">Option 1 was to carry on with Hythe, option 2 was to continue with full and open competition, and options 3 and 4 were to use other agencies that had done similar bits of work, which related to part of the functions that Hythe had hitherto performed either for the Army or the US navy and ascertain whether they could apply.Five criteria applied: technical capability of sustaining the water craft; overall cost of the operation; contract duration; lead time to the award, and resident skills and expertise.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-38_para8">
<a name="stpa_416">Let me give the assessment of option 1&#151;Hythe. The audit, by the US army&#039;s audit agency, found in favour of Hythe that maintenance costs were projected to be significantly lower through continuing with Hythe than the contracted operation alternatives of options 2, 3 and 4. It found that there was a completely trained work force, total resident knowledge and technical capability, and that Hythe provided maximum flexibility, resident expertise to support exercises and no security problems because all employees are security cleared through their affiliation to the US army.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-38_para9">
<a name="stpa_417">What was against Hythe? Only two things. The base closure was stated to be already in process, although nothing had been announced and no explanation has ever been given, and Hythe was not funded for the financial year 2007 and beyond.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-38_para10">
<a name="stpa_418">Options 3 and 4 did not come close. It is interesting that one of the arguments against option 2 was:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_62">&quot;Readiness may be impacted if any delays to contract award by 30 September FY06&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-38_para11">
<a name="stpa_419">and that it would be a lower risk if the award date were postponed until 31 December 2007.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-38_para12">
<a name="stpa_420">At the end of the process, a matrix was produced showing the four options and judging them against the five criteria. Hythe was the only one to score a 1&#151;the top grading&#151;for technical capability, a 1 for overall cost, and a 1 for resident expertise. The other two criteria, which covered contracts and how long it would take to get the operation up and running, did not apply because Hythe is already up and running. So Hythe had 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>9 May 2006 : Column 282</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>a top score of 3&#151;the lower the score, the better. Option 2 scored 10.5, option 3 scored 16, and option 4 scored 12.5.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-38_para13">
<a name="stpa_421">This resulted in the realisation that, whereas it would cost $18.42 million for Hythe to carry on doing what it does, both locally and in running the bases in Japan and Kuwait, that sum would be at least doubled by option 2, to $37.73 million. The cost of closing Hythe&#151;we assume that the Americans would act in good faith and pay off the pension fund in full&#151;would have to be added to that $37.73. That would involve another $72.85 million, making a grand total of more than $110 million in the first year, compared with $18.42 million.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-38_para14">
<a name="stpa_422">Three additional vessels in Hythe have been separately budgeted for, which would keep the base going until the end of 2007. That would lessen the risk even if option 2 were chosen. When that is taken into account, we need to add another $27 million to the costs that would result from the closure, because the uncompleted boats would have to be towed back across the Atlantic for completion in US dockyards. If they stayed at Hythe, however, and if the work force were allowed to continue to work on them for that extra year, it would cost only an extra $10 million. In other words, this is the economics of the madhouse.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-38_para15">
<a name="stpa_423">The audit recommended to the commanding general in Rock Island, Illinois, that the closure notice that was under way&#151;for reasons that have never been explained&#151;should be rescinded, and that Hythe offered by far the best value for money. We do not know what went on when that audit report was received at the Rock Island base in Illinois. We do know, however, that no explanation has been given, and that no notice of any significance has been given. There seems to be a desperate rush to close the base at Hythe before the end of the American financial year on 30 September.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-38_para16">
<a name="stpa_424">By contrast, other bases that carry out only part of the work&#151;in Germany and Italy, for example&#151;are not being closed, even though the base at Germersheim in Germany consistently fails to meet its targets. It carries out work not on the water craft but on flat-bed trailers and mobile military generators, in which Hythe also specialises. A similar function is carried out at a base at Livorno in Italy, which has frequently been beset by labour troubles and strikes.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-38_para17">
<a name="stpa_425">We wonder whether Hythe is being picked on in this way because the American army authorities feel that it would be easier to divest themselves of their loyal work force in England than to divest themselves of people who are not direct employees of the US Army, and who are protected by all sorts of labour laws in countries on the continent that have shown themselves to be somewhat less reliable to the United States of America when the chips are down than have the people from this base in the United Kingdom.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-38_para18">
<a name="stpa_426">In short, we have a facility that is versatile to the extent that when it was invited to send volunteers to Afghanistan, 14 went, and let us remember that they are civilians and do not get medals or other recognition. Incidentally, volunteers were requested from the Rock Island headquarters, and I believe that three were obtained. Out in Afghanistan, the volunteers from Hythe were able to turn their hands to augmenting the armour on armoured vehicles to protect the lives of US service personnel. This is an expert force: as I said, it 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>9 May 2006 : Column 283</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>wrote the manual for the preservation and reactivation techniques of pre-positioned stocks. It is an economical force&#151;it is half the cost to the US taxpayer compared with the next best option, and that is only the yearly cost, apart from the colossal closure costs to which I have referred. It is a reliable force and has never taken industrial action in well over 30 years of service to the United States of America.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-38_para19">
<a name="stpa_427">I have little time left, as I am anxious to hear the Minister&#039;s reply. I shall therefore mention quickly some of Hythe&#039;s commendations. One says:

<p><a name="st_323"><a name="60509-39_spmin0"><b>The Minister of State, Ministry of Defence  (Mr. Adam Ingram): </b> 
 First, let me express my appreciation to the hon. Member for New Forest, East (Dr. Lewis) for what was undoubtedly a thorough and well-rehearsed contribution, and for the support that he is showing for his constituents in seeking to understand the reasons for the United States&#039; decision to withdraw from RAF Hythe. Of course, had his speech been more concise I should have had more than 10 minutes in which to respond.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-39_para0">
<a name="stpa_439">As the hon. Gentleman knows, the decision to withdraw US Army operations from RAF Hythe by 30 September this year was confirmed in a letter to the Ministry of Defence only this afternoon. I agree with him that it will be very disappointing news for the local work force, especially given the valuable contribution made by RAF Hythe&#039;s highly trained and dedicated workers over the years. The hon. Gentleman paid generous tribute to them.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-39_para1">
<a name="stpa_440">I remind the House that this was very much a US decision. I know the hon. Gentleman understands that. Notwithstanding the case that he presented, I know that he is also aware that the decision was made as part of a wider US review of the global posture of US forces across the world. That has resulted in the reconfiguring of the US &quot;global footprint&quot; and reductions in US forces, particularly those stationed in western Europe.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-39_para2">
<a name="stpa_441">While I fully appreciate the hon. Gentleman&#039;s concern for the local community, the US decision should be viewed in a wider context. RAF Hythe is one of several RAF bases in the United Kingdom made available to United States visiting forces under the terms of the NATO Status of Forces Agreement of 1951. It is one of the smallest bases of that kind, and the only US visiting force facility in Britain that is used exclusively by the US Army. It is also unique in that it is the only US facility in the United Kingdom that handles marine assets by the waterfront, as the hon. Gentleman pointed out.

<a name="stpa_442">Although RAF Hythe is the only US Army base in the UK, there are other US visiting force bases in the UK that employ considerable numbers of US military personnel, including some members of the US Army. Overall, the US visiting force presence totals more than 20,000 service personnel and their families, who represent a considerable investment in the US-UK special relationship. I recognise that notwithstanding that wider presence, this will be a difficult time for the 200 or so civilians employed by the US Government at RAF Hythe who are now considering their future as a result of the US decision to withdraw from the base.

<a name="stpa_443">The hon. Gentleman dealt with the function of RAF Hythe, so I need not go into it now. There are currently only two US personnel stationed there, including the facility commander and a small complement of 12 Ministry of Defence police. However, there are around 210 civilians employed by the US Government in connection with the base. Those personnel are 

<br>&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>employed in a wide variety of trades. Approximately 170 are &quot;blue-collar&quot; workers, while around 40 fulfil &quot;white-collar&quot; functions in supply, administration and facilities management. The blue-collar posts are mainly in support of the marine repair function, and include marine mechanics, electricians, platers, pipefitters and painters. Many of the personnel have been carrying out those specialist roles since the start of the operation in 1975, and their loyalty and commitment are commendable.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-39_para5">
<a name="stpa_444">RAF Hythe also has a first-class apprenticeship training regime, which has produced a highly trained and skilled work force. Such is the value of their skills that a significant number of them are in demand overseas: the hon. Gentleman mentioned many of the areas in which they are involved. They are employed by the US Government around the world&#151;for instance, in locations in Kuwait and Japan. At any one time, between 30 and 50 of the personnel directly hired locally are deployed to overseas sites for periods of three months at a time. A full team in Kuwait comprises 23 staff, and a full team in Japan comprises 27. Given that the bulk of those posts require skilled blue-collar workers, the deployed task falls largely to the 170 marine engineering tradesmen.

<a name="60509-39_para6">
<a name="stpa_445">The hon. Gentleman knows how disappointed I was to learn today that the US Army no longer requires RAF Hythe, when the US Government confirmed their decision to cease their operations at the base by 30 September 2006. The hon. Gentleman first raised this issue early in the new year&#151;he was on to it early on&#151;but it was not until early April that the Ministry of Defence received notification of the US Government&#039;s intention to withdraw from the base by this September. As I said, only today did final confirmation of the decision come through.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-39_para7">
<a name="stpa_446">I know that our US ally will acknowledge the considerable contribution that RAF Hythe and its work force have made to both countries&#039; defence over the decades. That will doubtless be reflected in their treatment of their committed local work force, who have given such loyal and sterling service over the years. Indeed, the US ambassador and I spoke about that very point.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-39_para8">
<a name="stpa_447">During my discussions with the US ambassador, I fully recognised that the final decision can be made only by the US Government. I was keen to register then the MOD&#039;s interest for two principal reasons. First, if the decision to withdraw from the base were formalised, as has since proved the case, I wished to make it clear how important it was that all those affected understood the timing of, and reasons for, the decision. Secondly, I wanted to register the concern, expressed this evening by the hon. Gentleman, that careful consideration be given to mitigating measures to ease the effects of the 

<br>&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>withdrawal locally, and to the thoughtful and sensitive handling of the situation. I know that the ambassador duly registered that point.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-39_para9">
<a name="stpa_448">I was made aware that the MOD police complement at RAF Hythe was informed by its management of the US proposals in early April. Separately, I have been made aware that the approximately 210 civilians employed by the US Government were notified of the decision earlier today. I mention this because I have been copied a letter that the chairman of the local national employee council wrote to the US President and to the Prime Minister, among others. Again, I registered that point with the US ambassador during my conversation with him. That letter made some very significant points, which the hon. Gentleman cogently expressed in this debate.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-39_para10">
<a name="stpa_449">Let me deal with the UK MOD personnel, which is where my responsibility lies. The MOD police senior management were quick to inform and brief their officers about the consequences of the US proposal to withdraw from the base. I understand that senior management within the MOD police are considering redeployment of their officers, as necessary, and it is appropriate that we handle our personnel accordingly.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-39_para11">
<a name="stpa_450">It is too early to determine the long-term future of RAF Hythe. If the base is to be vacated, a detailed process will be gone through to look for alternative uses. The hon. Gentleman will be fully aware that that first involves looking for alternative defence uses. If that is not possible, the site will be offered to other Government Departments, and appropriate rules for disposal will be applied. We are very conscious of the quality of the property that we have. Even when we ourselves vacate such property, we try at all times to ensure that we are not divesting ourselves of valuable assets that would be difficult to replace or replicate. A sensitive process is gone through in that regard.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60509-39_para12">
<a name="stpa_451">In concluding, I hope that I can go some way toward satisfying the hon. Gentleman&#039;s concerns. The news confirmed today is particularly disappointing for those civilian employees who have worked so hard in support of the US military mission at RAF Hythe for so many years. I will draw the US Government&#039;s attention to this debate, and I know that the hon. Gentleman will pursue his case with vigour at all appropriate levels within the US Administration. Like him, I am keen to continue our excellent relations with our closest ally, the United States, and I know that none of his comments attacked that very close relationship. He is a great admirer of that relationship, as are this Government, and it will continue in the decades to come.
