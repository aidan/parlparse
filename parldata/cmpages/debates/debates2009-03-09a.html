 Yes, I will. It was a superb bid. It was strong in two respects, which is particularly important. The first strength was the partnership behind the bid, which means that a strong and secure revenue funding stream supports future work through the involvement of the primary care trust and the police. The second strength was the central involvement of young people that shaped the bid and decided what it would provide, including a mixture of exciting activities as well as a range of advice, information and support for young people from the various agencies involved.</p>

 That is very important. The partnerships putting in the bids&#151;Blackpool&#146;s bid was strong in this respect&#151;had to demonstrate how they would seriously involve young people from a range of communities, in particular those from the most disadvantaged communities. We know that the young people who cannot get these opportunities routinely through their family are the ones for whom the opportunities offered by the centres of participating in such positive activities with good, mature adults who are good role models will make the most difference. My hon. Friend&#146;s point is a very important one.</p>

 Capital spending on schools and children&#146;s play areas of &#163;919 million will be brought forward from 2010-11 to the coming financial year. Of that money, &#163;390 million has been devolved directly to all schools to invest in smaller projects such as new science labs or gyms and &#163;490 million has been allocated to the 116 local authorities who responded to our invitation to accelerate larger-scale spending to the benefit of pupils and local businesses alike.</p>

<p><a name="st_o6"><a name="0903092000030"><a name="90309-0001.htm_spnew4"><a name="0903092000311"><b>Kerry McCarthy:</b>
 My right hon. Friend will know that Bristol has been well ahead of the curve in terms of the Building Schools for the Future programme, which has made a real difference to schools in east Bristol in particular. Will he confirm that this new tranche of investment will benefit not just schools in Bristol but local companies, and construction firms in particular?</p>

<p><a name="st_o7"><a name="0903092000031"><a name="90309-0001.htm_spnew5"><a name="0903092000312"><b>Ed Balls:</b>
 I can confirm that that is the case. In fact, Bristol brought forward a total of more than &#163;2 million plus a further &#163;500,000 for voluntary aided schools out of a possible &#163;4.2 million, so there is still space there. If Bristol wanted to make a further bid to bring more money forward, that would mean even more contracts for local small businesses as well as more benefits for pupils. Bristol is one of the authorities to have bid and that is very welcome indeed.</p>

 Will the Secretary of State confirm again that some of that money will be used for science laboratories in schools? Will he also ensure that they are of dedicated design so that teachers can do the sort of experiments that excite young people into learning the individual science subjects? Will he also consult on risk so that teachers have the courage to do something that goes &#147;Bang&#148; occasionally?</p>

 I can confirm that the money is available to schools so that they can make their own decisions, in part. If their decision is to refurb science labs, that is all to the good. Surprisingly, the hon. Gentleman&#146;s authority asked to bring forward only 30 per cent. of the total that it could have brought forward, so it has not brought forward over 85 per cent. of the money that it could have done. There are 33 authorities that have turned down the invitation to bring forward any money at all to 2009-10. That seems to be letting down the small businesses that need the contracts very badly.</p>

 My right hon. Friend is right: capital funding is highly valued, and will transform the quality of education. That said, does he understand why I, like my colleagues in Stockton, was disappointed to read that we would lose &#163;5 million from our Building Schools for the Future funding? Can he explain why that is happening, and why it is based on something called the location factor?</p>

and it turned down that invitation entirely. I know that the Conservative party has issued a national injunction on bringing forward spending to benefit local businesses, but I would have thought that the right thing for local councils to do would be to ignore central political injunctions, and to do the right thing by local pupils and businesses. The fact that the 33 authorities concerned are disproportionately Conservative authorities is no surprise at all.</p>

 On the issue of schools funding, ever since Tony Blair was Prime Minister, there has been a pledge to increase each year the share of the national cake that goes on education funding. That has been honoured since 1998. Does that pledge persist beyond the current spending review?</p>

 It does persist for the Labour party. We have made clear our commitment that a rising share of national income will go on education over the course of this Parliament. That is the commitment that we made. It takes forward our goal, which is steadily to close the gap in funding between state schools and independent schools. That is our commitment, but it would not be delivered on if there were a &#163;5 billion cut in public spending and a commensurate cut to the Department for Children, Schools and Families budget. That may not be what the hon. Member for Surrey Heath (Michael Gove) wants, but there is a clear commitment to that cut from the Leader of the Opposition, Mr. David Cameron.</p>

 I apologise wholeheartedly for that mistake, Mr. Speaker. On Plymouth, the answer is that the authority has asked to bring forward just 3.2 per cent. of the total that it could have brought forward&#151;a matter of a few hundred thousand pounds, when it could have brought forward millions of pounds of extra investment to 2009-10. As for the wider commitment to Building Schools for the Future, we are clear that we will keep this record investment in school buildings moving forward, so that we rebuild or refurbish all secondary schools in our country. It is the Conservative party that is committed to a &#163;4.5 billion cut, which would mean that hundreds of schools around the country would not get the go-ahead if&#151;</p>

London challenge advisers are supporting school improvement in six secondary schools and 13 primary schools in Croydon through the Key to Success programme.</p>

 I thank the Minister for that answer. On academy plans for Croydon, what attention will he pay to the capture and continuation of the best of the predecessor schools, and to transferring any good traits to succeeding academies? I am thinking especially of Haling Manor high school, which has just been named the most improved school in London by the Specialist Schools and Academies Trust. What consideration is given to minimising disruption, for example in the case of Ashburton junior and infant schools, which have already been subject to a destabilising merger with another primary school? There were also three different succeeding plans and proposals for amalgamation on the Ashburton community school, creating an all-the-way-through, four-to-18 school.

Given the comprehensive performance assessment rating that Croydon council has recently received, I am not confident that that is the right body to provide the support that that school needs, which is why I have approved the move to academy status with one of the strongest sponsors that we have in the academies movement, the Harris Federation.</p>

buildings and technology since 1997 has supported rapidly improving learning environments.

However, we also have an important, dynamic and forward-looking academy programme, including a proposed new Mercers&#146; school in Hammersmith.

 My hon. Friend is right. This is a good opportunity to reinforce my congratulations to King Edward VI school in Stafford on its great improvement.

 I know that the hon. Gentleman is wedded to wanting a two-tier system, but we want a GCSE system that caters for and properly assesses people of the full range of abilities. We are implementing the Dearing review on languages in full; that is why we are moving from five years to seven years of compulsory language learning by starting that learning at the age of seven. In respect of science, the GCSE tests the full range of ability. When he was on the radio, John Dunford from the Association of School and College Leaders rightly said that young people who need to be stretched at the top level may not need such assessment, because they can be engaged with and stretched through, for example, the Young Gifted and Talented programme and, if desired, starting AS-levels and A-levels early.</p>

 The Minister who is about to answer me is the one Minister in her Front Bench team whom I have not nobbled on this issue.

January 2008, and &#163;20 million of the money was supposed to be used to set up projects in the 21 pathfinder areas before the end of the current financial year in a few weeks&#146; time. Mencap reports that, far from things going well, not one of the families with children with profound and multiple learning disabilities that it follows in the pilot areas has had any increase in their package of short breaks&#151;14 months on, and there has been no transformation at all.

 The total spending in the next three years, including this year, is not &#163;370 million but &#163;770 million. It will mean a transformation in the provision of short breaks.

Those organisations expressed a clear view that we should spend a small amount of money in the first year while we piloted how to spend the money well. A substantial amount of investment&#151;indeed, record amounts&#151;will be made next year and the year after.

 With permission, I would like to make a statement about the horrific attack last Saturday at Massereene Army base in Antrim.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o6"><a name="90309-0003.htm_para2"><a name="0903092000149">The focus for that sickening crime was civilians and young soldiers of 38 Engineer Regiment, part of 19 Light Brigade. The House will know that Operation Banner&#151;the deployment of troops in Northern Ireland&#151;was brought to an end in July 2007. 38 Engineer Regiment is part of the Northern Ireland garrison. Those men and women are part of the new arrangements in which soldiers are based in Northern Ireland for deployment anywhere in the world. The arrangements are not about a garrison to replace Operation Banner.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o7"><a name="90309-0003.htm_para3"><a name="0903092000150">Those soldiers were in the process of being deployed for active service in Afghanistan, to support international efforts to stabilise and bring peace to that region. At the time of the attack, most of their colleagues had already left for that deployment. A small number remained, awaiting their deployment to begin within hours. While waiting, a small number of soldiers decided to order food from Domino&#146;s Pizza in Antrim. At about 9.40 in the evening, the delivery arrived in two separate cars. The soldiers came out of the main gate of the barracks&#151;the cars delivering the pizzas were parked less than 10 yd away&#151;and as they did so, two masked gunmen opened fire. The initial volley of shots was followed by a second. The attackers were clearly intent on killing both the soldiers and the civilians. They continued firing even when the men were injured and when some had fallen to the ground. The firing lasted for more than 30 seconds. More than 60 shots were fired.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o8"><a name="90309-0003.htm_para4"><a name="0903092000151">Neither the soldiers nor the civilians had a chance against that premeditated attempt at mass murder. Two of the soldiers were killed. The families were informed yesterday, and this morning the Ministry of Defence released their names. Sapper Patrick Azimkar and Sapper Mark Quinsey were held in the highest regard by everyone in their regiment. Patrick Azimkar was just 21. He was looking forward to facing the challenges of his first operational tour in southern Helmand. Mark Quinsey, who was 23, was equally looking to the operational challenges he would face in Afghanistan.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o9"><a name="90309-0003.htm_para5"><a name="0903092000152">Two more soldiers were seriously injured. The attack on the civilians from the pizza company was just as barbaric. Both were injured, one extremely seriously. There can be no doubt that those responsible were intent on taking the lives of all these men.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o10"><a name="90309-0003.htm_para6"><a name="0903092000153">I know that the House will want to join me in expressing our deepest condolences to the families of those who were murdered, and to send our sympathy to the injured and all the families who are also victims of this act of terrible violence, which has rightly been described as evil.</p>

They tended the wounded and cared for the dying. I had the honour of meeting some of those young men and women immediately after the attack yesterday morning. This morning my right hon.

record the admiration that we all have for those young men and women. They are the greatest credit to our country, and I know that I speak for the whole House in saying how proud of them we are.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o12"><a name="90309-0004.htm_para1"><a name="0903092000155">It is now the job of the Police Service of Northern Ireland to conduct the investigation to bring those who murdered and injured these soldiers and civilians to justice. A major investigation is under way. This morning both the Prime Minister and I had further briefings from the Chief Constable, Sir Hugh Orde, from our intelligence advisers, and from Brigadier George Norton, commander of 38 (Irish) Brigade and the Northern Ireland garrison.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o13"><a name="90309-0004.htm_para2"><a name="0903092000156">The House will wish to know that everything is being done that can be done. It is too early for me to report on the progress of the criminal investigation. However, I should tell the House that yesterday evening the so-called Real IRA claimed responsibility for this act of extreme barbarism. Whatever self-styled name these murderers choose to use, the House will correctly recognise them as barbaric criminals prepared to carry out an act of pre-meditated mass murder&#151;callously murdering innocent people going about their daily business. They are simply brutal and cowardly killers. It is true that the number of people who make up these criminal groups are relatively few, but they are no less dangerous for their small numbers. We know that they have no community support whatsoever, but their guns are able to murder.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o14"><a name="90309-0004.htm_para3"><a name="0903092000157">The police have asked for everyone in the community who has information to come forward, and they should do so as a matter of urgency. Anyone in the Antrim area or beyond on Saturday who may have seen anything suspicious, in the vicinity of Domino&#146;s or on the Randalstown road close to Massereene Barracks, should contact the police.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o15"><a name="90309-0004.htm_para4"><a name="0903092000158">The House will want to know that all political leaders and political parties in Northern Ireland have condemned this evil act. They are united not only in their condemnation and in their expressions of condolence to the families, but in their demand that anyone who can help should come forward. They join in those expressions with my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister and all the party leaders in this House, and they join today in a statement from all the Churches in Northern Ireland condemning the violence and asking those who can help the police to come forward.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o16"><a name="90309-0004.htm_para5"><a name="0903092000159">It is right for me also to record the expressions of support and sympathy that we immediately received from the Taoiseach and President McAleese, from the United States Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, and from President Obama, who last night made his position very clear, condemning the attack in the strongest terms and making clear his support for the people of Northern Ireland&#151;those people who have chosen a future of peace.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o17"><a name="90309-0004.htm_para6"><a name="0903092000160">It may be helpful if I take this opportunity to provide the House with further information about the current levels of security threat in Northern Ireland. As the House will know, both the Chief Constable and I have made public our view that the level of threat posed by dissident republicans has recently been higher than at any time in the last six years. Since 2008 they have mounted 18 attacks, 15 last year and three so far this year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o18"><a name="90309-0004.htm_para7"><a name="0903092000161">The House will be aware that last week the Security Service raised the level of threat from Irish-related terrorism from substantial to severe in Northern Ireland.  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="9 Mar 2009">

<notus-date day="9" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><b>9 Mar 2009 : Column 23</b><br>
That was a carefully calibrated decision, based on an overall assessment of the last nine months. That period includes the attempted murder of police officers, including one savage attack on a police officer who had just dropped his child at school. Five bullets were put into the man&#146;s chest. There was some uncertainty last week about the wisdom of raising the threat level. I believe this was the right decision and entirely justified.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o19"><a name="90309-0004.htm_para8"><a name="0903092000162">Policing in Northern Ireland enjoys the highest levels of confidence from the public. In my judgment, it is absolutely essential that the Chief Constable has operational independence. Of course, he is accountable to the Policing Board under the Patten arrangements. He will, if he sees fit, enjoy the same rights as any other chief constable in the UK to request further technical back-up, if so needed; that would be the case in, say, a chief constable dealing with a threat from al-Qaeda and any international terrorism. Indeed, we made that clear at the end of Operation Banner. In a statement to this House on 31 July 2007, the Minister of State for Defence, my right hon. Friend the Member for Coventry, North-East (Mr. Ainsworth), said that after 1 August the vast majority of military support in Northern Ireland will be broadly comparable to the assistance that is currently provided in Great Britain, but tailored for the particular circumstances in Northern Ireland. He also made it clear that the provision of explosive ordnance disposal would continue; this was, of course, used to deal with the car bomb in Castlewellan in January of this year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o20"><a name="90309-0004.htm_para9"><a name="0903092000163">I hope that, whatever concerns may have been expressed by hon. Members last week&#151;and it may be appropriate to comment on the serious distortions and misleading reports in some of the media at that time&#151;hon. Members will now feel reassured about the role of any technical support being used to tackle the current threat. This is, as the Chief Constable has repeatedly said, not about the return of troops to the streets, but it is about protecting the public at a proportionate level, and about protecting those who provide that protection, such as police officers and those who work to protect the international community or on international theatre operations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o21"><a name="90309-0004.htm_para10"><a name="0903092000164">It has been 12 years since the last death of a soldier in Northern Ireland, and this has been a very dark few days for Northern Ireland, but it is a temporary darkness at the end of a tunnel of considerable light. The peace process and political progress, as part of shared power, have transformed Northern Ireland. The perpetrators of this attack believe they can stall the progress and, in stalling the progress, instil seeds of self-destruction in the politics of today. Indeed, they have clearly chosen to act in this evil way only because the politics of a shared future is working.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o22"><a name="90309-0004.htm_para11"><a name="0903092000165">The determination and resolve of all political leaders in the face of this brutal act are working proof of a unity of purpose. We are all united in our resolve that these criminals will not succeed. Our confidence must be stronger, our resolve even greater; and while the House will understandably be sombre as a result of this murderous attack, the greatest memorial to Patrick Azimkar and Mark Quinsey and their families will be in our determination to unite behind the peace process and the political progress in Northern Ireland.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o23"><a name="90309-0004.htm_para12"><a name="0903092000166">So let us make sure that those responsible for this attack are not given any opportunity to stall or prevent the progress of the people of Northern Ireland. Let us join together, and let this House send this afternoon an unequivocal message: the men of violence will not succeed; these criminals will not succeed&#151;not now, not ever.</p>

 I thank the Secretary of State for giving me advance sight of his statement and for his call yesterday. I also join him in sending our deepest sympathies to the families and friends of Sapper Patrick Azimkar and Sapper Mark Quinsey, and to those injured in this cowardly attack. The murdered men were about to travel to Afghanistan to serve their country and to support the Afghan people. The horrific events of this weekend bring into focus the bravery of all those who serve the armed forces, the PSNI and the security services. We should also thank the emergency services and medical staff. We are all indebted to them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o24"><a name="90309-0004.htm_para13"><a name="0903092000168">The Independent Monitoring Commission review confirmed our concerns about the dissident threat. We raised this again in the Chamber last Wednesday. This attack follows a succession of near misses on police, and the Chief Constable has been consistent, and increasingly public, about the severity of the threat posed by dissident republican groups. I would like to confirm our firm support for the operational independence of the Chief Constable. Like every other chief constable in the UK, he must have the right to enlist the help of specialists. Will the Secretary of State confirm that the decision of the Chief Constable to call in reconnaissance experts would not have been affected had criminal justice and policing been devolved?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o25"><a name="90309-0004.htm_para14"><a name="0903092000169">The aim of these attacks was to try to disrupt normal policing, forcing police into barracks and armoured vehicles, and away from the public. Will the Secretary of State confirm that a balance must be struck between the need for the increased protection of officers and ensuring that police are visible and known to their communities? The Government raised the threat level from substantial to severe last week. Was the change due to specific intelligence that had been received, or was it a response to the general security situation? Were civilian guards briefed on the current threat level, and were individual establishments chased up to ensure that this was understood and that appropriate measures had been taken to take account of it? Given the understandable pursuit of normalisation, will he conduct an immediate review of the security arrangements at police stations and military installations? Has he had any discussions with the Defence Secretary about the consequences for defence installations in the rest of the UK?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o26"><a name="90309-0004.htm_para15"><a name="0903092000170">The attackers showed a devastating ruthlessness in shooting their victims a second time on the ground. Does the Secretary of State believe that that cold brutality suggests that these were experienced terrorists? The crime scene will reveal valuable ballistic and forensic evidence. Experience from previous investigations shows that speed is of the essence, so will he confirm that these category A murders will receive top priority? Will he also confirm that the most competent and experienced officers will be in charge of the investigation?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o27"><a name="90309-0004.htm_para16"><a name="0903092000171">I would like to confirm that we will support the Government&#146;s efforts to bring these ruthless murderers to justice. We believe that they have no support in the  <br>

wider community, and the support for the police investigation from all political parties is welcome. The key to defeating terrorism in Northern Ireland lies with all parts of the community. I endorse the Secretary of State&#146;s appeal yesterday for anyone with information on these criminal acts to come forward: even the smallest piece of information could be vital and might help to bring this investigation to a swift conclusion. We welcome the public statement by the Irish Justice Minister and the Garda Commissioner and their commitment to help.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o28"><a name="90309-0004.htm_para17"><a name="0903092000172">Although huge progress has been made, Northern Ireland still has some way to go before normal security arrangements are appropriate. Thanks to the peace process, which was begun by the previous Government and continued by this one, Northern Ireland has been transformed. An unrepresentative minority of dissidents are determined to undo the good work of the past 15 years. It is incumbent on us all to respond to this shocking attack by going about our business normally, but with increased vigilance. The good work of recent years must continue&#151;terrorism, in any form, must never succeed.</p>

 The decisions of the Chief Constable to call in technical back-up support, to which the hon. Gentleman was referring, would, of course, not change under any arrangements in the future for devolution; those are decisions for the Chief Constable. On the balance to be struck between enabling the police to continue normal policing&#151;again, I pay a huge tribute to the work of the PSNI, as it has ensured that it is, indeed, normal policing that takes place in Northern Ireland today&#151;and addressing the huge risks taken by the men and women of the PSNI, I can confirm that the Chief Constable always has the interest and welfare of the PSNI at heart and I believe that the balance is very carefully struck. That is a matter for the Chief Constable, but I have full confidence in the decisions that he has made.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o29"><a name="90309-0004.htm_para18"><a name="0903092000174">The hon. Gentleman asked whether there had been specific intelligence about the threat last Saturday evening and the connection of any such intelligence to the decision by the Security Service to raise the level of threat last week. The reasons for raising the threat level last week were a carefully considered calibration of the events of the past nine months and the fact that although it is a small number of people who self-style themselves as the Real IRA, there was, none the less, an indication that they were intent on perpetrating further violence and criminal acts. We did not have specific intelligence about a threat last Saturday evening at the base.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o30"><a name="90309-0004.htm_para19"><a name="0903092000175">I am pleased to report to the House that of course the guards were briefed and that special arrangements were put in place at the base following the decision to raise the military threat level in Northern Ireland. Of course, the young men and all those serving there were spoken to and reminded of the change in the security threat level. As for the implications for other military barracks and police stations in Northern Ireland, of course the Chief Constable and Brigadier Norton separately undertake reviews as a matter of course. I am certain that in the light of the tragic events of Saturday evening further reviews will be conducted in the course of this week.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o31"><a name="90309-0004.htm_para20"><a name="0903092000176">I hold regular conversations with the Defence Secretary on matters related to these issues and I am sure that uppermost in his mind will be the need to review the  <br>

security arrangements for those people serving with the MOD, not only in the light of last Saturday but always. As for the investigation, it is too early for us to speculate as to who might have been responsible. On the subject of who is in charge of the investigation, I reassure the hon. Gentleman and this House that it is being personally overseen by the Chief Constable and those at the highest levels in the PSNI. I hope that sooner rather than later we will be able to bring these people to justice.</p>

Friends with the expressions of condolence expressed to the friends, families and comrades of Sapper Patrick Azimkar and Sapper Mark Quinsey, who were killed yesterday, and extend to those who were injured our very best wishes for their recovery.

In particular, they have called for all communities to co-operate fully with the police investigation. For Martin McGuinness in particular to be able to make a call of that sort is an indication of just how far we have come in this peace process as well as of how much we have to lose. The communities in Northern Ireland have been well served on this occasion by both the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister.</p>

I am reassured by the Secretary of State&#146;s comments about the availability of every resource for their investigation, and I think that in time this event might give us some pause for reflection on the correct level of support and resourcing for policing in Northern Ireland from hereon in.</p>

I absolutely agree with the right hon. Gentleman that there should be no cover provided by putting the event under the heading of a terrorist attack. It was a criminal attack of the most callous, brutal and evil kind, and I absolutely join him in recognising the contrast between the evil of Saturday night and the good shown by the public yesterday. One small example is that of a local Catholic church: the priest led the entire congregation out on to the street, near where the evil act was committed, and everybody in that Catholic church prayed for the souls of those who had died. There could be no greater distinction between what is good in people on the one hand and the evil of Saturday night, and what is terrible, on the other.</p>

I am sure that the Secretary of State will want to commend the people of Antrim from all denominations who showed that they were one in condemnation and one in unity, standing together by the forces of the Crown and the police to bring those who have committed these murders to the laws of this land and to make them obey the laws of our country.</p>

 With permission, I shall make a statement on the asset protection scheme, and the agreement in principle reached on Saturday between the Treasury and Lloyds Banking Group. My right hon. Friend the Chancellor is travelling to Brussels ahead of the meeting of European Community Finance Ministers tomorrow to discuss the G20 Finance Ministers meeting this weekend, so he has asked me to make this statement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o49"><a name="90309-0005.htm_para11"><a name="0903092000219">The asset protection scheme was announced in January. In my right hon. Friend&#146;s statement of 26 February, he gave details of the participation by the RBS Group, and he mentioned the negotiations under way with Lloyds. The approach that we adopted with Lloyds is similar to that adopted with RBS; discussion involved a large amount of complex detail and it was important to take time to reach a satisfactory conclusion. An agreement in principle has now been reached that helps to ensure financial stability, to safeguard the interests of the taxpayer and to support the real economy by increasing lending.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o50"><a name="90309-0005.htm_para12"><a name="0903092000220">Under the asset protection scheme, the Government will provide protection against certain credit losses on particular assets in exchange for a fee. A first loss, similar to the excess in insurance policies, remains with the institution. Lloyds will meet all of that. The protection provided by the Government will cover 90 per cent. of the remaining loss. The other 10 per cent. will remain with the institutions as an incentive to manage the assets prudently. The Government will accept applications to the scheme for other eligible institutions until 31 March.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o51"><a name="90309-0005.htm_para13"><a name="0903092000221">Lloyds announced on Saturday its intention to place &#163;260 billion-worth of assets in the scheme, on which it has already taken impairments of &#163;10 billion. Through the first loss mechanism, it will retain a further exposure of &#163;25 billion. Of any losses beyond that, 90 per cent. will be borne by the Exchequer and 10 per cent. by Lloyds. The protection will cover a range of assets including mortgages, unsecured personal loans, corporate and commercial loans and Treasury assets.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o52"><a name="90309-0005.htm_para14"><a name="0903092000222">Lloyds will pay a fee of &#163;15.6 billion in new, non-voting B shares. Those will count as core tier 1 capital. The Treasury has also agreed to replace its existing &#163;4 billion of preference shares. Current shareholders will be able to purchase these ordinary shares as part of an open offer. The Treasury will take up its pro rata share of the open offers, maintaining its minimum voting share at 43.5 per cent., and will subscribe for any additional shares not taken up by existing shareholders. If no other shareholders take up their entitlements, the Treasury&#146;s ownership of ordinary shares will increase to 65 per cent. Taking into account B shares paid as a fee, its economic ownership would reach 77 per cent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o53"><a name="90309-0005.htm_para15"><a name="0903092000223">As my right hon. Friend the Chancellor set out, the asset protection scheme is a key step to put banks on a stronger footing, to insure their balance sheets and to boost lending to businesses and individuals. As part of that deal, in return for access to the asset protection scheme, Lloyds has agreed to increase its lending by an additional &#163;14 billion over the next 12 months &#151;&#163;3 billion for homebuyers and &#163;11 billion for business lending&#151;and it has made a similar commitment for  <br>

2010. Consistent with RBS, Lloyds will be required to present a detailed implementation plan to the Government, and to report monthly on compliance with the lending agreements. The Government will publish an annual report on these arrangements, which will be made available to Parliament. The agreements are binding and will be reflected in the performance-related pay of bank staff involved.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o54"><a name="90309-0005.htm_para16"><a name="0903092000224">Another condition for Lloyds, as for any bank participating in the scheme, is a requirement to develop a sustainable long-term remuneration policy. That means reviewing policies and implementing new policies consistent with the Financial Services Authority&#146;s recently published code of remuneration practice. We have agreed that no discretionary bonuses will be paid in 2009 except to junior staff earning an average of &#163;20,000, and that there will be no annual free share award at all.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o55"><a name="90309-0005.htm_para17"><a name="0903092000225">At the heart of the current financial and economic problems around the world is a crisis of confidence about bank assets. That lack of confidence is having profound effects on UK companies and on individuals who are not able to secure business loans or mortgages. The critical obstacle to expanding lending is uncertainty about the value of banks&#146; balance sheets, so we are acting now to enable the banks to clean up their balance sheets, making them better able to lend to individuals and businesses.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o56"><a name="90309-0005.htm_para18"><a name="0903092000226">Transformation will not happen overnight, but that is the essential starting point, and it must go hand in hand with broader reform of banking supervision and regulation. Action must be taken not only here but by Governments across the world. The alternative would be a failure of the banking system here and elsewhere, which would make the recession longer and more painful and put more jobs at risk. Getting the banks to lend again is essential to economic recovery and to our fight against the global recession.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o57"><a name="90309-0005.htm_para19"><a name="0903092000227">The Government are clear that British banks are best owned and managed commercially, rather than by the Government. The future of the UK as a financial centre, and the future of our economy and of many thousands of jobs, depends on being able to run banks commercially. All countries are having to deal with the same problem&#151;how to isolate assets that are damaging confidence in the banking sector and preventing banks from lending more. Over the coming weeks, we will continue to discuss with other countries, including the United States and the European Union, how best to co-ordinate our approaches to the shared challenges that we face. As part of our presidency of the G20 this year, my right hon. Friend the Chancellor recently wrote to Finance Ministers setting out a set of shared principles for dealing with asset protection and insurance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o58"><a name="90309-0005.htm_para20"><a name="0903092000228">It is essential to restore confidence in the banks, allow them to clean up and rebuild and get lending going again. Economic recovery and thousands of jobs depend on that, and I commend this statement to the House.</p>

The &#163;14 billion of lending commitments that the Government claim to have extracted from Lloyds Banking Group is less than half of the total taxpayer investment in Lloyds, and less than 5 per cent. of the total taxpayer exposure to Lloyds HBOS. Will the Financial Secretary confirm that the additional promised lending will be subject to the group&#146;s prevailing commercial terms and conditions, including on pricing and risk assessment, and, in relation to mortgage lending, that it will be subject to the group&#146;s standard credit and other acceptance criteria? If that is the case, is not this pledge just more simple rhetoric?</p>

Until last October, Lloyds had stood aloof from the chaos engulfing the banking sector, as a sound, somewhat old-fashioned bank with a reputation for caution that attracted small investors and drove to distraction those in the City who preferred riskier plays. In the space of a few weeks, that sound, solid bank, which would have been quite capable of prospering without the support of the taxpayer, has been transformed into a banking behemoth that is incapable of surviving without these huge infusions of taxpayer funding. I ask the Financial Secretary whether the Government really believe that the creation of this crippled giant at the heart of our banking system is the best outcome if the objective is to maximise the flow of credit from the banks to Britain&#146;s recession-hit businesses and households.</p>

credit flowing at the minimum, long-term cost to the taxpayer? Can he look the House in the eye and tell it that the guarantee option has been chosen on the basis of the economics and long-term best value for money for the taxpayer, not simply because, alone among the alternatives, it keeps the cost to the taxpayer off the balance sheet and out of sight until the losses crystallise?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o64"><a name="90309-0006.htm_para5"><a name="0903092000235">The Prime Minister&#146;s mantra is that the crisis was made in America and blew in on the wind to afflict a blameless Britain. He paints a picture of toxic assets, which comprise US sub-prime mortgages, complex derivatives and impenetrable credit default obligations. However, will the Financial Secretary confirm that more than a quarter of the toxic assets that the Government guarantee in the deal are plain, old-fashioned UK mortgages, lent by HBOS in a bout of over-exuberance, which testifies to the failure of the Prime Minister&#146;s tripartite regulatory system? In effect, is the taxpayer not taking a &#163;75 billion bet on future house prices not falling by more than 10 per cent. from 31 December 2008? If the Financial Secretary has not noticed, they have already fallen by 3.3 per cent. in the first two months of the year. I do not know of a single commentator who does not believe that they have further to go.</p>

The Financial Secretary set out in his statement, and Lloyds set out in its statement to the stock exchange, the fees payable by Lloyds Banking Group to the Treasury. However, the end of the Lloyds announcement refers to &#147;certain interim arrangements&#148;, agreed between the Treasury and Lloyds and relating to the management of the assets in question. I imagine that the right hon. Gentleman knows that, in the deal between the Dutch Government and ING, as well as the fee payable by the bank to the Government for the guarantee, a fee is also payable by the Government to the bank for managing and financing the assets that the guarantee covers to maturity. Will he give hon. Members a categorical assurance today that no fees whatsoever are payable under the deal by the Treasury to Lloyds Banking Group? Will he confirm that the ban on cash bonuses that he announced for this year will extend to future years? Will he adopt, at least for Lloyds Banking Group, our policy of a &#163;2,000 permanent limit on cash bonuses? Will he also tell the House what steps the Government have agreed, as part of the deal, about executive and director pensions in Lloyds Banking Group?</p>

The first banking bail-outs failed to get lending flowing again, requiring taxpayers to stump up hundreds of billions of pounds in further guarantees and capitalisations. The temporary VAT cut has failed to stimulate consumer spending and the stamp duty holiday has failed to stop house prices nosediving.

very least that taxpayers should expect in exchange for the &#163;1,200 billion that the Government have pledged on their behalf to the banking system.</p>

 I can agree with the hon. Gentleman&#146;s final comment, but there is not much else with which I can agree. To fix the economy we have to fix the banks first. As with previous measures, capital support for banks is an investment and it will eventually be sold for the benefit of taxpayers. With the insurance scheme, the eventual cost to the taxpayer over the lifetime of the scheme will depend on economic conditions and how assets are managed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o68"><a name="90309-0006.htm_para9"><a name="0903092000240">However, the key is ending the uncertainty that has been holding Lloyds back from lending and enabling it to make a significant additional commitment on lending, which is certainly not rhetoric, as the hon. Gentleman suggested, but an additional &#163;14 billion on top of what was planned for this year, with a similar sum envisaged for next year. I can confirm that that lending will be subject to the bank&#146;s normal commercial considerations, but that lending will be made. It will be reported regularly to the Government and we shall report regularly to the House, as I said in my statement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o69"><a name="90309-0006.htm_para10"><a name="0903092000241">The hon. Gentleman made some comments about the merger between Lloyds TSB and HBOS. The priorities that we were concerned about were stability in the financial sector and, in particular, avoiding a catastrophic failure on the part of HBOS. Lloyds and HBOS had been talking for some time and they asked the Government whether it was possible to modify the competition rules to allow the merger to go ahead. Like others, we concluded that that was the right thing to do. The hon. Gentleman suggested that it was not the right thing to do, but he might wish to have a word about that with the shadow Chancellor, who said on &#147;Newsnight&#148; on 17 September: &#147;I spoke to both of the chief executives today of the two institutions and made it clear the Conservatives support what they&#146;re trying to put together&#148;. The shadow Chancellor&#146;s view is therefore somewhat different from the one that the shadow Chief Secretary has put to the House this afternoon.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o70"><a name="90309-0006.htm_para11"><a name="0903092000242">The boards of both banks recommended acceptance of the agreement to their shareholders and both sets of shareholders agreed. Lloyds shareholders voted on 19 November, with more than 95 per cent. of them in favour of the merger, and HBOS shareholders voted on 12 December. There was therefore broad agreement on what was done.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o71"><a name="90309-0006.htm_para12"><a name="0903092000243">Of the assets that are covered by the announcement today, rather more than 80 per cent. come from HBOS, which was largely active in the UK, but also, to an extent, in Ireland and, to a smaller extent still, in some other territories. I can confirm to the hon. Gentleman that there are no fees payable to the Treasury as part of the package announced today. The costs of setting up the scheme will be charged to the participating institutions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o72"><a name="90309-0006.htm_para13"><a name="0903092000244">Finally, the hon. Gentleman is quite wrong about the VAT cut. because there is growing evidence of its effectiveness in stimulating the economy. Let me draw his attention to information published by Goldman Sachs just over a week or two ago. As others have pointed out, the effectiveness of the VAT reduction as a stimulus to the economy will grow over the course of this year, leading up to the rise back up to a rate of 17.5 per cent. on 31 December.</p>

 There would once have been a time when a Government commitment of &#163;260 billion of taxpayers&#146; money, which is just under a quarter of gross domestic product, would have merited the attention of the Prime Minister, let alone the Chancellor. It is no disrespect to the Minister, who is generally regarded as very decent and very capable, to say that on this occasion not only are we denied the attentions of the organ grinder, but we are not sent the monkey either, but the monkey&#146;s second assistant.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o77"><a name="90309-0006.htm_para18"><a name="0903092000250">I want to ask the Minister about tax avoidance. Quite apart from HBOS, Lloyds is known to have undertaken large-scale tax avoidance. Will this stop, now that the bank is fully publicly owned? Mr. Daniels has been described as enjoying a &#163;25,000 tax planning allowance from his bank, to help him to avoid paying UK taxes. Will this continue under public ownership?</p>

Are those arrangements going to be preserved? So that we can have clarity about who is being paid what, may we have an assurance that, if very highly paid executives in this bank and elsewhere are paid large amounts&#151;let us say, more than the Prime Minister&#151;those emoluments will be made fully transparent?

The private shareholders are rightly outraged about the way in which they have been treated, and they are rightly calling for the head of Sir Victor Blank. They want to know why the documentation lying behind this Treasury paper is not being made publicly available. It states that, in September, the Government considered a range of alternatives. Will they publish those alternatives, and the reasons why they rejected them? As the paper is so heavily redacted, will they also publish the full version, so that we can be sure that nothing is being hidden from the public and the House?</p>

That arrangement is in place for two directors now, and that opportunity has been taken up. The hon. Gentleman talked about agreements that were reached as part of the arrangements that were made before Christmas&#151;the announcements that were made at the beginning of October&#151;and the lending commitments. Actually, bank lending on the part of the UK banks involved has, indeed, risen but as the hon. Gentleman knows, the great problem we faced was the withdrawal of non-UK banks from the UK market, leaving a gap of perhaps some &#163;100 billion of lending capacity. The &#163;14 billion that Lloyds announced on Saturday is a valuable step towards making up some of that shortfall.</p>

 My hon. Friend is absolutely right to highlight the importance of that. We will be reporting annually on the delivery of the lending commitments&#151;we are not proposing to publish information every month, but we will do so annually.

 Is not the truth that the taxpayer is not just being asked to stand behind &#163;585 billion of especially toxic assets in the two big banks, but in practice is standing behind &#163;3 trillion of assets and liabilities in the two banks? There is presumably no circumstance in which the Government would bring down one of those banks now they have bought a majority shareholding in it, so will the Minister come clean and say how the taxpayer can be expected to take a &#163;50,000 risk for every man, woman and child and how much money the Government will lose on the scheme before they realise what a disaster it is?

 Of course, there is some uncertainty about what the arrangement will cost over time. The uncertainty is the reason why the arrangement is necessary, because that is what has been preventing Lloyds from lending until now. However, not wholly dissimilar arrangements have been in place in Sweden and Japan and, more recently, in the Netherlands and the US, and experience shows that the ultimate price is a small proportion of the value of the assets insured. The insured figure for Lloyds is &#163;260 billion; the cost to the taxpayer, however, will be a great deal less. We do not know exactly what the figure will ultimately work out to be, but the cost of doing nothing would be very significantly more because of the loss to the economy of momentum and lending capacity. We need that capacity in the economy to navigate a way out of the recession&#151;the downturn&#151;we are in at the moment.</p>

 Yes, a good deal more work has to be done before the final details are absolutely pinned down and signed off. I envisage all that work being done between now and the summer. Of course, there is no immediate payment to be made; there will be a payment only when, for example, there is a default on a loan and the insurance is triggered.

 The hon. Gentleman is quite wrong to characterise what happened between Lloyds and HBOS in that way. As I have already pointed out to the House, the shadow Chancellor strongly supported the arrangement at the time, and indeed spoke to the chief executives of both banks to reassure them that he supported their merger. In addition, when Lloyds shareholders voted on 19 November, more than 95 per cent. of them voted in favour of the merger. That does not look like railroading to me.</p>

 Is it not worth while to make the point that we should use the right language in relation to saving the banks? In reality, this step, and subsequent steps, had to be taken because more than 70 per cent. of voters have bank accounts. We had to save one bank in particular, and then others, because if one had been allowed to fail, there would have been a domino effect, with them all failing. That is why all parties agreed on the rescue at the beginning&#151;they knew that their voters would not want to see a bank finish up in the gutter. We should use that language, and not give the impression that somehow we are saving bankers, bonuses and all the rest.

 I am having some difficulty in recognising the figures to which the hon. Gentleman has referred. Let me just say once again that the announcement covers, effectively, an insurance for &#163;260 billion-worth of assets, but the cost to the taxpayer in due course will be a great deal less than that. As I have said, Lloyds is paying &#163;16 billion for access to this facility, and we will have to see whether the cost is more or less than the fee being paid. Clearly, there is at this stage a great deal of uncertainty about what the ultimate cost will be; if there were not uncertainty, it would not be necessary to put this scheme in place. We need the scheme in order to end the uncertainty about the value of assets on the Lloyds balance sheet, and so to enable Lloyds to lend, which the economy needs.</p>

I do not think that sharing Ministers is a very clever idea on the whole, and BERR has far more than its fair share of shared Ministers. My view of Whitehall is that it works on constructive tension between Departments, and although internalising too much tension may look like joined-up government, it makes for bad government. There has even been criticism&#151;I see that the hon. Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston (Andrew Miller), my friend who is Chair of the Select Committee on Regulatory Reform, is in his place&#151;of the fact that responsibility for regulatory reform has been taken away from the Cabinet Office and given to BERR, because that has internalised a very important conflict.</p>

I have a lot of sympathy with the view of the British Chambers of Commerce that there should be a three-year moratorium on non-essential Government regulation that imposes a cost on business. Although business has been talking about this for a long time, when preparing for this debate I was struck by the new urgency from the business community about the need to curb the growth in regulation.</p>

 Does the hon.

<p><a name="stpa_o97"><a name="90309-0008.htm_para6"><a name="0903099000022">There are conflicting views about the status and activities of BERR. One leading business organisation member said:</p>

I think that that will do a lot to address the inevitable flux in Ministers, but it would be nice to have that person in post soon. I know that the consultation has begun and I welcome that, but there are big issues. For example, there is tension between the Department for Children, Schools and Families, which has unspent capital in its budget, and the Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills, which cannot find the money to fund the essential further education college building programme. A modest transfer from one to the other would help the nation&#146;s skills agenda and the construction sector. The chief construction officer could and should be knocking heads together to achieve that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o104"><a name="90309-0008.htm_para13"><a name="0903099000029">The good news is that BERR seems to be doing better than its predecessors. That is the judgment, it seems, of a number of organisations. The CBI said that it saw an improvement from the old Department of Trade and Industry, a positive change and transition and greater emphasis on shaping policy across government. However, the CBI also said:</p>
<a name="90309-0008.htm_brev6"><a name="0903099000132"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;BERR still has some way to go to achieve its mission.

 One matter that does not seem to have been mentioned by the CBI is over-regulation and the role of my hon. Friend&#146;s Committee and the Department in the context of billions of pounds-worth of over-regulation. Commissioner Verheugen has already identified a cost of &#163;100 billion a year for the whole of Europe, Boyfield and Ambler and others have calculated a figure of &#163;23 billion for the City and, as my hon. Friend mentioned earlier, according to the British Chambers of Commerce, cost increases to business amount to &#163;20 billion a year. In that context, is it not absolutely essential in weighing up the cost-benefit of the Department to start digging deeply into that over-regulation and to take all necessary steps in this House and in Europe to ensure that the whole thing is dealt with properly?</p>

 I am very pleased to agree with my hon. Friend. To be fair to the Department, many of the regulations that impact on business come from other Departments. We need to get a handle on other Departments&#146; behaviour, too, and not just on BERR&#146;s.</p>

Sometimes I think that the Government are throwing up a smokescreen in front of our eyes and promoting some issues over some of the more fundamental issues. I shall not talk about that today, but shall simply say that the banks and the Government got us where we are by allowing indiscriminate lending and over-borrowing, both public and private. My friends in business find it somewhat confusing to be told by business Ministers that the Government are suggesting that banks must restore lending, especially lending on property, to the very levels that helped to create the problem. I hope that it is uncontroversial now to say that we believe that the Government and the Bank of England should have acted sooner to correct the huge asset price bubble that we knew was an unsustainable boom that was bound to end in bust.</p>

 I hope that we will again move towards a world where more prudent guidance about lending is offered to individuals who are making the most important purchase of their lives. One of the great failures of the past few years has been the failure to provide that guidance, so I am very sympathetic to what my hon. Friend says.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o108"><a name="90309-0008.htm_para17"><a name="0903099000037">The trouble is that the indebtedness in our economy&#151; the indebtedness of individuals, companies and the Government&#151;poses huge challenges to business. There is an overwhelming need to refinance corporate debt this year, a lot of it held by foreign banks that are now desperately short of liquidity and unprepared to offer that refinancing. Intriguingly, one senior banker said to me that in the great scheme of things, given the scale of the tidal wave of corporate debt requiring refinancing this year, the schemes that we are debating in our consideration of the estimates today, such as the enterprise finance guarantee scheme, amounted to little more than &#147;a rounding error&#148;. That is a salutary thought. When I think of the hundreds of billions of pounds that we have been talking about, I see what he means.</p>

Quantitative easing may make the refinancing of corporate debt more achievable, but its scale does not match up to the level of corporate debt that needs refinancing. Anyhow, the smaller businesses that are rightly of concern to the Government and the House will not be selling bonds to the old lady of Threadneedle street for a while yet; that is for sure. What businesses, and small businesses in particular, need is working capital; it is often overdrafts that they need, not loans&#151;a point that my hon.

sorry that the Government could not bring themselves to back my Bill. Small schemes of that kind add up and form a big picture; they would make a world of difference to small and medium-sized businesses. I will not repeat all that my hon. Friend and I said about the importance of small businesses to the economy.

The consequences do not need to be spelled out. That is happening across the retail sector, leaving otherwise completely healthy businesses facing an inevitable funding crisis. If those retailers collapse, jobs will be lost not only in those businesses, but in the manufacturing industries that supply those retailers. Sorting out trade credit insurance must be a very high priority for BERR. I look for reassurance from the Minister when he replies to the debate that that is indeed the case.</p>

the SMEs continues at last year&#146;s levels, but the almost complete withdrawal of UK banks from funding smaller businesses on normal terms, if at all, means that specialist leasing companies have to rely on foreign banks and to take more risk on their own books, and they cannot afford to do that for much longer. That reduces the number of SMEs able to access affordable leasing arrangements. There will be serious consequences for SMEs if we cannot give them the quality systems and technology that they need to develop their businesses. Leasing, sometimes of quite small items of kit, is hugely important in the SME sector, but the money is not available to finance it. I hope the Minister will be prepared to look into that with representatives of the leasing sector.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o126"><a name="90309-0009.htm_para3"><a name="0903099000057">I welcome, I think, what the Government have done for the automotive sector, as does the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. However, we still have to be clear in our own minds about the basis for supporting the automotive sector as opposed to any other sector. We must not allow dangerous precedents to be set; the Government cannot support every sector.</p>

 I am surprised at the lack of consistency among those on the Conservative Benches. I welcome the comments that the Chairman of the Select Committee has just made; it is a pity, however, that the right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke), who went uninvited to Vauxhall last week, did not say the same thing. He was still trying to talk down the business.</p>

<p><a name="st_o185"><a name="0903099000061"><a name="90309-0009.htm_spnew5"><a name="0903099000166"><b>Peter Luff:</b>
 If my right hon. and learned Friend were here, he would be able to answer for himself; I think that he will be here a little later. I do not know what he said, but I had a discussion with him last week about the merits of scrappage allowances, for example. The Government have been slow to move on that issue, and that concerns the SMMT. There may be a case for scrappage allowances, although it may be weaker here than in Germany or France. The Government are talking about the issue, but nothing has happened.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o127"><a name="90309-0009.htm_para4"><a name="0903099000062">The SMMT shares my concern about the failure to develop a proper package of support for the automotive finance houses. That is crucial. I know people&#151;perfectly sound risks&#151;who want to buy cars, but cannot get the finance to do so. Again, the Government have been promising action on finance, but it has not been taken. That is another example of an idea being talked about that needs to be brought forward.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o128"><a name="90309-0009.htm_para5"><a name="0903099000063">The SMMT would also like Government support for short-time working, which might help in the constituency of the hon. Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston; I do not know. Lord Jones of Birmingham has put that interesting idea forward, and it involves a shared package of employees taking less money, employers making a contribution and the Government helping to subsidise part-time working, so that the companies do not lose the skills that they will need again when the recession ends. The chambers of commerce share that view and such a scheme was in place from April 1979 to March 1984; there is a precedent. Other European countries are introducing such schemes, and I hope that the Minister will say that the issue is being considered with some urgency&#151;and, if it is not a runner, that it is being dismissed. We need clarity about the Government&#146;s intentions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o129"><a name="90309-0009.htm_para6"><a name="0903099000064">The Government will have to move more swiftly than they have until now, and pick the big issues to address. They need to promise to do less, but do it better and more quickly. I am not talking about doing nothing; we all agree that action is needed. However, the Government must make sure that what they do is done with care and speed, and that they then explain themselves clearly to the House of Commons.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o130"><a name="90309-0009.htm_para7"><a name="0903099000065">That leads me to my final points, which are about the accountability of the Department to the House. I am still proud to be a Member of the House and I want to reinforce its position in society. We should be debating great issues not only in television studios and on the &#147;Today&#148; programme, but here in the House. Today&#146;s debate is an estimates day debate, one of the most important things that the House of Commons does.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o131"><a name="90309-0009.htm_para8"><a name="0903099000066">By the way, it is worth pointing out that only the decision of the Liaison Committee to hold this debate fleshed out the fact that the Department had failed to  <br>

provide the customary written statement on the estimates. That was a regrettable oversight. For reasons that I shall explain a little later, it is really important that the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform, above all others, fulfils all its obligations to the Commons to the letter&#151;that includes replying to letters more speedily than it sometimes does and not transferring to other Departments letters to which it should reply. The Department has to treat the House of Commons with the utmost care at present because of the relative paucity of its representatives on House of Commons Benches.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o132"><a name="90309-0009.htm_para9"><a name="0903099000067">I am still surprised by the introduction of the Industry and Exports (Financial Support) Bill, a hugely important Bill, without any explanation or statement. I have had no letter about it and have seen no written statement about it&#151;it was just suddenly published. I am likely to support it, although I have not seen a detailed debate on it yet. It is a really important measure, and it would be good to see the Government explaining themselves rather more clearly about such important steps.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o133"><a name="90309-0009.htm_para10"><a name="0903099000068">We have the power to grant money. That is what we are doing today; later this evening, we are voting on millions of pounds. The Government rely on the Commons to approve the estimates. Today, we are debating requests for money, including potentially significant liabilities for business and the automotive sector. But the Secretary of State cannot come here to explain his policies and the Minister with responsibility for small businesses cannot come here to explain hers. Furthermore, neither the Minister for Trade and Investment nor the Under-Secretary of State responsible for communications, technology and broadcasting can come here and explain their policies. They are all in the Lords, although I know that the hon. Member for Dudley, South (Ian Pearson) has a lot of sectoral responsibility, which is welcome.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o134"><a name="90309-0009.htm_para11"><a name="0903099000069">I do not know what this Government would have done without the ability to create life peers in the House of Lords. We have had five life peers at the Department in my short time chairing the Select Committee. One roared briefly and gloriously across the parliamentary sky&#151;Digby, Lord Jones of Birmingham&#151;but he was not a real Minister. He was never a member of the Labour party, and he had no policy responsibility and not much collective responsibility, but he was a very good salesman for UK plc: an important job well done, all too briefly, but not a ministerial one. However, he gave the Prime Minister some help in his early days, and I suppose we must thank Digby for that. To be fair, Digby, Lord Jones, has a quality shared with the other four life peers now serving in the Department&#151;real ability.</p>

Department and this place. They are all able and decent Ministers; I can say that genuinely. I like them, get on very well with them personally, and respect them&#151;but they do not have Cabinet rank, and they do not have enough time to do justice to their portfolios or to make themselves properly responsible to this House. This is not an arcane constitutional issue. Our constituents must have confidence that we can raise on their behalf the most pressing issues of the time with the Ministers who are taking the decisions on those issues.</p>

People can ask Lord Mandelson a question, and the most popular one will get a video response. I have asked a question, although I do not know if it is popular. There are some very good questions on it. When last I looked, there were 38 questions and no responses. However, in the House of Commons itself only members of the Select Committee&#151;there are many here today&#151;have the privilege of being able to ask Lord Mandelson questions on the record. We read about the consequences in last week&#146;s edition of <i> The Sunday Times</i>, where we were told, of the controversial proposals to part-privatise Royal Mail Group:</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o137"><a name="90309-0009.htm_para14"><a name="0903099000073">That is a rather important question for this House to ask, but we cannot do so. Lord Mandelson&#146;s speeches are always reported. They are very well written, although I am not sure that they are always as radically new as he thinks&#151;&#147;industrial activism&#148; sounds remarkably like the policy of successive Governments since the war. They are always worth asking about, but we cannot ask him on the record. I can, and the other members of the Committee can, but none of the rest of us can, and we should be able to.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o138"><a name="90309-0009.htm_para15"><a name="0903099000074">This is not just about scrutiny but legislation. The Commons will be asked to legislate without access to the head of the Department. Will junior Ministers really have the power during those debates to make the concessions that this House needs? When the Postal Services Bill comes here after Easter, that will become a very important question. Indeed, we have the curious spectacle of a major Bill that will spend large amounts of money to address a massive pension deficit and breaks the spirit, if not the letter, of a manifesto commitment, beginning its life in the Lords&#151;its Second Reading is tomorrow&#151;simply because the Minister with prime responsibility for it is a Member of the House of Lords. There should be a Commons Cabinet Minister in this House and the Bill should begin here.</p>

 The right hon. Gentleman tempts me to recite the Committee&#146;s 14th report, which I recommend to him. There is a particularly good footnote about Lord Wellington appearing before the Bar of the House of Commons. I think that there was only one occasion of substance in recent history when there was a Minister in the Lords without a Cabinet Minister to match him here in the Commons&#151;Lord Cockfield, from 1982 to 1983.

<p><a name="stpa_o148"><a name="90309-0009.htm_para25"><a name="0903099000090">One of the most extraordinary claims in the Government&#146;s response was this:</p>
<a name="90309-0009.htm_brev8"><a name="0903099000145"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;A Minister who is a Member of the House of Lords may make a statement to a grand committee of the House of Commons and answer questions on it.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o149"><a name="90309-0009.htm_para26"><a name="0903099000091">There are only three Grand Committees&#151;for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland&#151;and I am advised by the Journal Office that so far during this Parliament, only the Welsh Grand Committee has met, and it has only met twice. The Scottish Grand Committee has not met since 2003. This idea of Grand Committees as a mechanism, even if we got the English regional Grand Committees, is not a good one because we want the whole House to be involved in this process. Allowing regional Grand Committees to call Ministers is not a substitute for the democracy of this House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o150"><a name="90309-0009.htm_para27"><a name="0903099000092">Another point raised by the Government, which we were just discussing, was this:</p>

For a start, this is a time of economic crisis, and the decisions being taken by these Ministers are hugely important. When I was a special adviser at the old Department of Trade and Industry and Lord Young of Graffham was Secretary of State, my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke) was a Cabinet Minister, sitting here and answering questions. We should have something similar now. Actually, it would be good to have my right hon. and learned Friend in the Department again, and sitting round the Cabinet table, not just the shadow Cabinet table. But that is a partisan point, and Select Committee Chairmen must not make those. It would be good to have a Cabinet-ranking Minister in this House at this important time.</p>

 It is a pleasure to follow the Chairman of the Select Committee on Business and Enterprise, the hon. Member for Mid-Worcestershire (Peter Luff). When the Department was restructured, we had a discussion about where regulatory reform fits into it, given the new responsibilities of my Committee, the Select Committee on Regulatory Reform, and we now have a good working understanding of how that relationship fits together. That is an example of how we can build bridges and make structures work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o155"><a name="90309-0010.htm_para0"><a name="0903099000100">I wish to make some observations about the departmental structure. I, too, was concerned when I first saw the structure that was set up after the last election. In fact, my Committee passed comment in its first investigative report on the moving of responsibility for regulatory reform from the Cabinet Office to the new Department. When we took evidence during that investigation, it was interesting to find that the majority of people had come to the conclusion that there is always difficulty in creating the right structure of government, as successive Governments have demonstrated. The hon. Gentleman mentioned science, which has been around five or six different Departments. There is never a perfect place to put it. The important thing is not creating departmental structures but creating mechanisms to make Departments talk effectively to each other.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o156"><a name="90309-0010.htm_para1"><a name="0903099000101">I have come to the conclusion that the hon. Gentleman is wrong about Ministers with a foot in both camps. There is a role for them, and it is particularly useful if there is a foot in the Treasury camp, as there are cross-cutting matters to consider. It is interesting to note his observation that both the CBI and the Engineering Employers Federation have said that certain things are working better in the new Department than in its predecessor. That is partly down to the new cross-cutting arrangement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o157"><a name="90309-0010.htm_para2"><a name="0903099000102">My Committee&#146;s report concluded that we would want to revisit the role of regulatory reform in future, based on experience. There is a good argument to be had about whether it can be dealt with effectively by one Department, given that it should transcend every Department of State and every aspect of local government. I respect the hon. Gentleman&#146;s view, but I believe he would acknowledge that, on some matters, we can come to conclusions only when we have the advantage of hindsight. It is a great benefit to be able to use hindsight from time to time, but of course it can be too late if we have got things wrong. However, I believe that we have made some important steps.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o158"><a name="90309-0010.htm_para3"><a name="0903099000103">I commend to the House the survey of business undertaken by the National Audit Office during the past year.

There has been a slight move in the right direction, with businesses perceiving that the burden is shrinking. Interestingly, the perception is sectorally based. The Committees that the hon. Gentleman and I chair will consistently have problems in being able to drill down on the impact of Government legislation on individual sectors of the economy and come to conclusions about the best way forward. I would like detailed work of the type that I have mentioned to be commissioned, so that we can get away from the rather silly headlines about the number of regulations and so on and consider how individual sectors are affected.</p>

 Does the hon. Gentleman appreciate that the cost to business of additional regulation amounts to &#163;66 billion over the past 11 years? That is not a silly figure&#151;it is a most disturbing burden that businesses have to face and tackle every day.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman is so anxious that he will not let me finish my sentence. It is important to consider the way we try to shift the burden away from businesses, and which regulations have gone through the House with all-party support. We must also recognise that some burdens that we place on businesses are necessary. It is easy to cite figures that sound horrendous, but when one asks what the burdens are&#151;as the National Audit Office asked businesses; clearly, the hon. Gentleman has not read its report&#151;it is interesting to note that only a few businesses, which totalled 5, 6, 7 and 8 per cent. of the 1,000 surveyed, identified the same burden. However, the survey had an extremely long tail of little gripes from individual businesses. I am concerned that we are not drilling down and considering those properly.</p>

 I am most grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving way again. Does he also appreciate that, when the sets of regulations were examined, 62 per cent. were found to be gold-plated by the Government? Is that a silly statement, too?</p>

 Neither our report nor the National Audit Office found that. I am not sure whether it is proper for me to try to recruit, but there is a Conservative vacancy on my Committee, and I would look forward to the hon.

 My hon. Friend takes a great interest in regulation. Does he agree that it is rather odd that Conservative Members complain about the so-called burden of regulation on businesses, but almost in the same breath blame the Government for not regulating the financial services sector more heavily in the past few years? Is the Regulatory Reform Committee considering the possibility of analysing the appropriate regulatory framework for the financial services sector?</p>

 The financial services sector is, of course, the purview of my right hon.

I will deal with some of those problems when I speak shortly about the vehicle industry, which is dear to my heart. However, my hon. Friend makes a good observation.</p>

that has successfully traded for two generations. The father started the business and the son continues it. It deals with ground-level works, ground clearances and environmental clean-up. The Minister for Trade, Development and Consumer Affairs will be interested to learn that the company&#151;Morgan&#146;s&#151;won a major health and safety award as a result of its work, in competition with other, much bigger companies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o160"><a name="90309-0010.htm_para5"><a name="0903099000113"></p>

<p><a name="stpa_o161"><a name="90309-0010.htm_para6"><a name="0903099000114">Morgan&#146;s is typical of the kind of company that the hon. Member for Mid-Worcestershire spoke of. It is genuinely concerned about the problem of credit insurance, which is an area where we need some rapid movement by the Government to try to help to underwrite some of the important work that is available. There is a lot of potential in the publicly funded contracts that can emerge as a result of the Building Schools for the Future programme and other such projects, but we must ensure that the potential contractors can fully participate without risk to themselves.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o162"><a name="90309-0010.htm_para7"><a name="0903099000115">My fourth point is about vehicles. I am delighted that the right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke) has joined us, because he visited my constituency last week&#151;he did not bother to tell me of course, but that is the nature of things these days. We are not as polite to each other as we used to be. <i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> I can see that the right hon. and learned Gentleman is seeking to stand up and apologise, but he does not need to bother, because I accept that from him. His was supposedly a private visit&#151;that was what it said in one newspaper, but last Saturday&#146;s <i> Daily Post</i> quoted him at length on what he thought of the vehicle industry. I am sure that he will not have seen that, because the <i> Daily Post </i>does not circulate in his neck of the woods, but I commend the online edition to him, because he is quoted in it at length, suggesting that the Government have done nothing to aid the vehicle industry.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o163"><a name="90309-0010.htm_para8"><a name="0903099000116">The right hon. and learned Gentleman and I would probably start with some common ground, in that Vauxhall, which is part of GM Europe, which is part of General Motors, has transformed itself beyond all recognition. He will have seen a company that is tooling up for a new vehicle that is going to come on stream in September, part of which has been supported by a significant degree of public money&#151;so significant, in fact, that it was subject to inquiries from Europe about whether it was legitimate under competition rules. That money has been given the green light and is being used.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o164"><a name="90309-0010.htm_para9"><a name="0903099000117">That work is being done by the company in partnership with West Cheshire further education college, which is upskilling people, and not just for the new vehicle in September. Plans are afoot to keep that training programme, so that we will be in a position to capture some of the new work that will come into Europe and, I hope, into the UK as a result of the investments being made in electric cars. I hope that we can get a cross-party consensus to encourage companies such as General Motors to work with all parties in the House in bringing that about.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o165"><a name="90309-0010.htm_para10"><a name="0903099000118">If we do that, not only will the 2,200 people who work at Vauxhall in Ellesmere Port be beneficiaries, but there will be massive supply chain implications. The hon. Member for Mid-Worcestershire touched on the supply chain and he is absolutely right. In my constituency we have just lost a tiny company called Cabot Carbon, which had been there for 60 years. It had certificate No. 1 under the Marshall plan and was formally sponsored and backed to the hilt by the late Harold Wilson when  <br>

he was President of the Board of Trade. Cabot Carbon made carbon black, an essential product in tyres, but the market in carbon black has collapsed across the world. Factories around the world have closed because of the failure of vehicle companies to sell their products.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o166"><a name="90309-0010.htm_para11"><a name="0903099000119">The problem starts at the raw materials level and goes up from there. It is not just the companies that make components that are affected; it is companies that make the raw materials that make the components. We have to look at the supply chain comprehensively and ensure that the programmes that we put in place as a result of the Government&#146;s proposals reach out to all parts of the industry. It is no good our simply saying that we can do nothing, as some have suggested, and that we should leave things to the market. That is not good enough.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o167"><a name="90309-0010.htm_para12"><a name="0903099000120">There must be some direct intervention to offer support with short-time working and scrappage, as I indicated in the Liaison Committee&#151;the hon. Gentleman will recall that I asked the Prime Minister about that. There is a raft of issues that we can examine, although it would be wrong, incidentally, to use the scrappage scheme as a pretend environmental scheme. We must be clear that the issue is not whether the project is environmentally friendly; it is about intervening in the market to help to stimulate it. We ought also to look at the finance companies, as the hon. Gentleman said.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o168"><a name="90309-0010.htm_para13"><a name="0903099000121">Those are the kinds of things that are being examined, along with the training programme. We now need to see those things translated into action well before the summer, so that the companies are lined up, just as Vauxhall is lined up to launch the new vehicle in September with gusto and confidence. It is a great vehicle and I am sure that people in this place, as well as many people outside, will buy it, but I will leave it at that.</p>

 I congratulate the Chairman of the Business and Enterprise Committee, the hon.

It has been a privilege to serve on the Committee and I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate him on how he has chaired it through consideration of some complex issues over the past six months.

It is extremely frustrating not to be able to do so on the Floor of the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o171"><a name="90309-0010.htm_para16"><a name="09030916000004">As the Chairman of the Committee said, we have some extremely hard-working and able Ministers coping with some extremely difficult circumstances. What I am saying is in no way a criticism of their ability; in fact, we are arguing that it would help them with their role and function if they could be more accountable. It is not acceptable to have so many Ministers in the Department in the House of Lords. In principle, I have no problem with Ministers coming from the House of the Lords; in fact, the appointment of Peter Mandelson was a good thing in many ways. It certainly raised the profile of business and he seems to have brought a lot of energy and vigour. One of the advantages of appointing from the Lords is being able to bring in such individuals. However, the one weakness in the system is the lack of accountability.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o172"><a name="90309-0010.htm_para17"><a name="09030916000005">In considering that point, the Committee suggested a number of solutions, some of which the Chairman touched on. The most obvious solution is for Peter Mandelson to be at the Dispatch Box in this Chamber. I just cannot understand what is tied up in our history that does not allow a Member from the other side of the Palace to come and be answerable at the Dispatch Box. That would be the simplest thing to do. I am sure that there are all sorts of archaic reasons why we cannot do it, but now is not the time for old-fashioned, fuddy-duddy ideas; now is the time for the Government to demonstrate that they recognise and understand that there is a crisis. If that means more accountability by allowing a Member of the House of Lords to stand at the Dispatch Box in this Chamber, that is what we should do.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o173"><a name="90309-0010.htm_para18"><a name="09030916000006">I cannot understand the arguments against that happening. It is not good enough to say that it has not happened before. That is never an argument for change; if we use that argument, there will never be any change. Even if we are prepared to accept that Lord Mandelson is unable to answer questions here at Question Time, surely he should at least be able to come to this House to make key statements. I feel disfranchised when important statements on business and the economy take place in the House of Lords and we are unable to put questions to the Cabinet Minister on the Floor of this House.</p>

 I appreciate the work that the hon. Gentleman does in the Select Committee. I do not want to trivialise what he is saying, but what he is suggesting has been done before: the Duke of Wellington was here in 1815. <i> [Interruption.] </i>Also, we have Westminster Hall and Committee Room 14, so it really should not be difficult to achieve this.

 My hon. Friend the Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath) says that he remembers that occasion; I do not. I do not really give a damn about whether there is a precedent or not. The point is that it is a good idea now, and we should adopt it now. Whether there is a precedent or not is irrelevant. If we are not prepared to do that, however, we might consider that there is a precedent for Members of the other place appearing before Grand Committees&#151;albeit that the Scottish and Welsh Grand Committees would be pretty useless forums when it came to the matters that we are talking about. Why could the Secretary of State not come to Westminster Hall, for example, so that we could ask him questions there?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o174"><a name="90309-0010.htm_para19"><a name="09030916000009">There is also the matter of written questions, and of not being able to go through directly to the Secretary of State with them. It would be an incredible response from the Government if they were to recognise this unique situation and to create some kind of accountability. However, their response has not been helpful, as the Chairman of the Select Committee has said. I will not repeat all the various issues, but the one that I found the most ridiculous was the suggestion that, if we were to allow some such accountability, Peter Mandelson would not be able to meet his commitments in the other place. Peter Mandelson would be more than able to do all that at the same time, as he indicated when he appeared before the Select Committee, although he did say that he was beyond his comfort zone. However, he would probably appreciate being able to do so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o175"><a name="90309-0010.htm_para20"><a name="09030916000010">It is not good enough simply to allow Peter Mandelson to appear before the Select Committee on a few more occasions, as the Government have suggested. That would not create parliamentary accountability. It would hijack the work of the Select Committee, and genuine accountability would be provided to only about 11 Members. It is certainly not good enough to say that there are opportunities to have quick conversations with Ministers in corridors, because we want the ability to have their answers placed on record. People do not get on the record by talking in corridors.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o176"><a name="90309-0010.htm_para21"><a name="09030916000011">I want to touch briefly on a few of the issues that the Select Committee has considered in relation to the present economic crisis, and to pick up on the theme of its impact on small businesses. Having talked to small businesses, my biggest concern is the mismatch between central Government announcements and reality. That is a constant theme from those who represent individual businesses. A number of examples spring to mind, the first of which is the small business finance scheme. The initiative sounds incredibly worth while, and it was welcomed by Members on both sides of the House. In the months since the scheme was announced, however, it has been extremely difficult to tie down the Government and find out what is actually happening.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o177"><a name="90309-0010.htm_para22"><a name="09030916000012">I asked the Minister in a parliamentary question last December when he expected the first payments to be issued under the small business finance scheme. I asked further questions about access and about the resources being set aside for that purpose. That question was asked at the beginning of December, and it was due for answer on 15 December. I have checked with my office today, 9 March, and we have still not had a reply to that question about an important Government scheme. How quickly the Government respond to questions about how the schemes are working on the ground sends completely the wrong message.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o178"><a name="90309-0010.htm_para23"><a name="09030916000013">Another issue that has been touched on by the Chairman of the Select Committee is the way in which banks are providing for implementation of the various schemes. Having spoken to business men and those working in the banks, I have discovered several problems. First, there is a lack of awareness at branch level about what the schemes are and how they work. Worse still, different banks are offering different interpretations of how the schemes operate. The same business could approach three or four banks and be told different things about how to apply for the schemes.</p>

8 per cent. of small businesses found that banks were making the enterprise finance guarantee scheme available. Other figures have shown how many businesses were actually accessing the scheme, but if only 8 per cent. are saying that banks are making it available, there is a poor chance of increasing take-up for those who have to jump through all the various hoops to obtain it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o180"><a name="90309-0011.htm_para1"><a name="09030916000015">I had a meeting this afternoon with one of the trade bodies representing the insolvency firms, and I was told that there was confusion about the schemes and about which businesses are able to take advantage of them. For example, some businesses are being told that, because they are still viable and successful, they are not able to access schemes to help them to grow. Other businesses, however, are being told that they are unable to access the schemes because they are not viable or successful. That is a complete contradiction. If businesses are struggling&#151;and therefore not viable&#151;these loans might get them back on track, yet they are unable to access them. It is also important, in a recession, to look after the companies that are doing well, yet companies that are doing extremely well but need support to get them to the next stage are being told that they are doing too well and are therefore unable to access the schemes. These confused messages and inconsistencies are causing great concern in the small business sector.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o181"><a name="90309-0011.htm_para2"><a name="09030916000016">We have been promised that the Government will report back on how the banks are performing on lending. We touched on that matter during the statement earlier. I would welcome any promises or commitments that the Minister can make, and any information on how the Government&#146;s lending panel is working. Will he also tell us who is on the panel and what assessments are being put in place to look at lending? Does he think that we can improve on the present commitment for the panel to report back on its work only on an annual basis? If that is still the target, I am sure that the House would want at least a quarterly update on lending, rather than having to wait for an annual report from the panel.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o182"><a name="90309-0011.htm_para3"><a name="09030916000017">I want briefly to touch on two other issues. The first, which we raised in the Select Committee, relates to procurement. For many small businesses, procurement is an absolute nightmare. Trying to win contracts from Government Departments is a real headache for them. I must declare an interest, in that I occasionally help out a business in my constituency, and I have sat with representatives of that business trying to help them to win business in the health and local government sectors. The chief executive of the company has shown me a document of some 100 pages of forms to be filled in by the company just to try to get on to a tender list to win business from Government Departments. Some of the questions in that procurement process are breathtaking. They include questions such as: what is the average age of the people working in the company? The forms go on and on in that kind of detail.</p>

In the Select Committee, Lord Mandelson acknowledged that the Government needed to do more about that. The Glover review was put in place by the Government to look at procurement, and I would be grateful if the Minister could tell us what Glover is doing now to sweep away some of the ridiculous form-filling and red tape that businesses trying to win Government contracts have to deal with.

lot of businesses are trying to win work on the back of the Olympics, and that process is quite complex, although some work has been done to make it easier. However, across the board, in local government, health and all the various Government Departments, we could do more to help our small businesses to reduce the time it takes to win business.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o184"><a name="90309-0011.htm_para5"><a name="09030916000019">Finally, I want to pick up on the points that the Chairman of the Select Committee made about the 10-day payment target, and to welcome DBERR&#146;s commitment in that direction. When I asked a question about that in December, I was told that 96.9 per cent. of the Department&#146;s payments were made within 10 days, which is excellent and represents good progress. At the same time, I asked whether the Department could report on whether other Government Departments were meeting their 10-day targets. I have not yet had a response to that question, and I wonder whether the Minister could tell me whether the other Departments are following DBERR&#146;s lead in scoring a percentage in the mid-90s.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o185"><a name="90309-0011.htm_para6"><a name="09030916000020">The concern goes further than central Government Departments; the commitment was to try to speak to those working in health and local government to see whether we could speed up the 10-day period in those sectors. Again, the word coming back from suppliers in health and local government is not promising: some of the figures suggest that in many cases people are waiting way beyond 30 days, let alone achieving any improvement towards 10 days. In his winding-up speech, will the Minister give us some comfort that we are looking seriously at putting more pressure on those public bodies to meet the 10-day target? I would appreciate that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o186"><a name="90309-0011.htm_para7"><a name="09030916000021">In conclusion, I believe that the Government are doing good work in hard times, but it would help enormously if two things came out of this debate: first, if we made some progress on accountability so that we could cross-examine Ministers more regularly and more clearly; and secondly, if we could gain a real understanding that an announcement had to result in action on the ground very quickly afterwards.</p>

 I do not think that any of us on any day can underestimate how deep the present recession is becoming and just how many jobs are being lost. In a patch like mine, which most hon. Members would consider to be a relatively prosperous part of the country, there is barely a day&#151;certainly not a week&#151;goes by without very significant announcements being made of further job losses in the automotive industry, retailing, automotive components and pretty well every sector of the economy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o187"><a name="90309-0011.htm_para8"><a name="09030916000023">What is also frightening is just how quickly businesses are running out of cash and the number of job losses that is leading to. Last week, for example, a very professional printing business in my patch announced that it would have to make about 60 people redundant&#151;simply because of a somewhat disappointing order book for January and February. In the past, if a business had a cash-flow difficulty of that kind, it would have either gone to the bank to sort out future financial loan arrangements or gone to the shareholders to raise extra funding: neither of those options is now available, so businesses that are running out of cash find that the only way they can respond to it is by making people redundant and laying them off.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o188"><a name="90309-0011.htm_para9"><a name="09030916000024">Even in the most recent unemployment figures&#151;for January&#151;we are already seeing the highest unemployment figure in Oxfordshire since May 1997, when the present Government came to power. In the month of January, unemployment in Oxfordshire jumped up by 1,104 people since the previous month&#151;the biggest increase in a single month since March 1991. I suspect that, as the months go by, we are going to continue to see unemployment figures tragically beating those of previous months. Twice as many people are out of work in Oxfordshire now as compared to a year ago, and it is getting worse.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o189"><a name="90309-0011.htm_para10"><a name="09030916000025">What we need, then, is for the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform to be a champion in Whitehall and it should devote all its attention to being an advocate for businesses in these particularly difficult times. Against that background, it is disappointing that so many of the relevant Ministers are in the other place. They are also somewhat distracted by trying to sort out the problems of the Royal Mail and, indeed, sort out the internal workings of the Labour party in terms of Royal Mail.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o190"><a name="90309-0011.htm_para11"><a name="09030916000026">Lord Mandelson obviously appreciates that the Department should help business and be an advocate for it because on 9 February, he wrote us all a letter to tell us what the Department intended to do. We should compare the promises in the letter with what is actually happening in reality, because, as the hon. Member for Winchester (Mr. Oaten) rightly and correctly said, all too often the statements and promises made by the Government in the House do not compare with the reality on the ground.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o191"><a name="90309-0011.htm_para12"><a name="09030916000027">Let me mention one good thing that the Department has done. A number of us who participated in a Westminster Hall debate recently were very concerned that, with so few Ministers based in the House of Commons and given the issues faced by our constituency firms are so immediate, by the time we wrote to Ministers and the information went all around Whitehall, it would take far too long to get responses. We suggested to the Minister responding to the debate that it would good if there were a hotline that MPs could use to raise urgent and immediate issues with officials in BERR. The suggestion I put forward had all-party support on the day and I am pleased to credit Ministers for introducing it. For the first time, the Department now has a helpline and MPs are able to communicate directly with officials on policy issues. Lord Mandelson made it clear in his recent letter that if we had any urgent matters relating to a local company in difficulty, we could get in touch with David Smith, the director of special projects at BERR by e-mail on economy@berr.gsi.gov.uk. Having used it on several occasions since it was announced, I have to say that officials have not only been courteous, but have interacted, responded and taken up issues with other Government Departments. That is what we need them to do.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o192"><a name="90309-0011.htm_para13"><a name="09030916000028">Let us look, however, at what else the Department says it is doing. On finance and the various schemes for business support, I really question the real value to business of the enterprise finance guarantee scheme. First, the banks have 75 per cent. of their lending guaranteed by the Government; secondly, individuals or companies have a 2 per cent. premium charged on  <br>

the outstanding balance&#151;presumably that is some sort of insurance scheme on the remaining amount. It has now become clear, however, that the banks expect personal guarantees for 100 per cent. of the loan and that those 100 per cent. loan guarantees are offered with the support and agreement of the Government. As Phil Orford, chief executive of the Forum of Private Business, has said:</p>
<a name="90309-0011.htm_brev0"><a name="09030916000046"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;It is outrageous. The guarantee scheme is supposed to be lending of the last resort when small firms have explored every other route&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o193"><a name="90309-0011.htm_para14"><a name="09030916000029">If personal guarantees of 100 per cent. are sought, what is the advantage of this scheme over any other banking scheme? A director of a public company, a small plus-listed or alternative investment market-listed company is not in a position to give personal guarantees, so those smaller public companies are effectively being excluded from the scheme.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o194"><a name="90309-0011.htm_para15"><a name="09030916000030">What happened with the enterprise finance guarantee scheme? First, for a number of weeks, it was clear that the banks did not understand what was going on. Then, they did understand&#151;and only too well, because the Treasury told them&#151;that they only needed to lend money if they could get 100 per cent. personal guarantees. It will not be surprising if the take-up is not huge. One business man put it very well:</p>
<a name="90309-0011.htm_brev1"><a name="09030916000047"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;To my mind, the guarantee scheme is one of those things that makes the government sound good without it actually having to come up with anything.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o195"><a name="90309-0011.htm_para16"><a name="09030916000031">All too many of these schemes seem to be about wanting to make the Government look good, without actually delivering anything.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o196"><a name="90309-0011.htm_para17"><a name="09030916000032">Another scheme that Lord Mandelson mentioned in his letter of 9 February was the working capital scheme. One would assume from the letter that the scheme was up and running and that people would know how to access the funding, but all of us who take an interest in these matters know that the detail of the working capital scheme has yet to be sorted out&#151;a point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Worcestershire (Peter Luff), who chairs the Select Committee.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o197"><a name="90309-0011.htm_para18"><a name="09030916000033">There is no point in banks such as the Santander, Abbey National or others saying very virtuously that they are putting an extra &#163;100 million into the enterprise finance guarantee scheme, when it seems to me that those bankers are taking on no risks at all. In the announcement earlier today, we heard about supposedly large sums of money coming from Lloyds for extra lending, but what is the point of it all if the money is released only if secured by the personal guarantees of small business men? I do not see how the scheme will work or how it will help any companies with their present cash flow. It is not surprising that in a recent survey of the Federation of Small Businesses, more than half of those questioned said that they did not think that the scheme would encourage bank lending.</p>

<p><a name="st_o203"><a name="09030916000034"><a name="90309-0011.htm_spnew1"><a name="09030916000056"><b>Mr. Binley:</b>
 Does my hon. Friend agree with me and the Federation of Small Businesses that the people you are talking about are actually saying that they are being forced into personal guarantees, which puts their home on the line, and their partners are saying &#147;We are not carrying on the business if that is the choice&#148;? Do you find that to be the case in the real world out there&#151;</p>

 The scheme is putting unsustainable pressure on many businesses, but my real point is that if a business wants to raise money on a secured loan it can do so with a bank anyway, so why are the Government trumpeting their introduction of a scheme that does very little?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o198"><a name="90309-0011.htm_para19"><a name="09030916000037">Lord Mandelson&#146;s letter also trumpets the following:</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o199"><a name="90309-0011.htm_para20"><a name="09030916000038">Actually, when we get down to the detail, Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs says that will be only for new inquiries. A company in my constituency, which I will not name for reasons of commercial confidentiality, wrote to HMRC on 11 November 2008 asking permission for deferment of pay-as-you-earn and national insurance contributions. It was not until 6 January, nearly two months later, that HMRC wrote to the chief executive of the company:</p>
<a name="90309-0011.htm_brev3"><a name="09030916000049"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;I am writing to advise you that I have assumed responsibility for collecting any tax debt owed by the company. I can also confirm that I have received your correspondence dated 11th November&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o200"><a name="90309-0011.htm_para21"><a name="09030916000039">It is wholly unacceptable for HMRC to take from 11 November 2008 until 6 January 2009 to reply to a sizeable company that is clearly in difficulties and asking for help with deferment of tax and PAYE. My impression is that what happened in that case happens in most instances and HMRC is merely telling companies that approach them, &#147;Well, if you get your tax affairs up to date we might consider what we could do in the future&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o201"><a name="90309-0011.htm_para22"><a name="09030916000040">There is another way for the Government to help small businesses in their dealings with HMRC, and BERR could help as an advocate. When customers fail to pay for goods or services, companies have to pay the VAT on the bad debt, but they cannot reclaim it for six months, which adds insult to injury. With today&#146;s technology one can scarcely believe that it would be impossible for the Treasury either to remove the need to pay VAT on bad debts&#151;thereby easing cash flow&#151;or at least to repay the VAT much more speedily than six months. For a number of businesses in my constituency finding that they have to pay VAT on bad debts just adds insult to injury.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o202"><a name="90309-0011.htm_para23"><a name="09030916000041">What is BERR doing as a champion in the Government to deal with the mismatch between the jobs we are losing and the jobs we need? I shall give just one example. For me, one of the most depressing things recently was talking to skilled young automotive engineers who were made redundant at Prodrive because Subaru no longer sponsors a Formula 1 racing team. I then happened to hear a presentation from Transport for London and Crossrail about the Crossrail project and the refurbishment of the London underground. The House may not know the average age of a London underground engineer&#151;it is 58. Who in the machinery of government is trying to ensure that the skills of those young automotive engineers, who clearly recognise that they will not be working in automotive engineering for some time, are put to good use working in other parts of the economy where their skills are needed?</p>

laid off there is no potential to match up some of their skills with the skills needed for the 2012 Olympics, but who in the machinery of government is doing that? It should be a task where BERR acts as an advocate to try to ensure that there is not a skills mismatch.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o204"><a name="90309-0011.htm_para25"><a name="09030916000043">Many of us are organising job clubs in our constituencies to try to support people who are out of work so that they can get back to the world of work as speedily as possible. However, that needs people in the machinery of government to ensure that everything is pulled together. At present, one has no sense of that happening. One has no sense of the regional development agencies or anyone else trying to ensure that the skills we have are put to the best possible use.</p>

Undoubtedly, the market is worth trillions of pounds and it could produce large numbers of new jobs, but one has no sense that anyone in the machinery of government is trying to see how areas such as mine in Oxfordshire&#151;connected to the universities and to new technology&#151;can promote green technologies and take the opportunities they offer.</p>

<notus-date day="9" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><b>9 Mar 2009 : Column 71</b><br>
by my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Worcestershire. I am sorry the Bill was not accepted by the Government at that time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o210"><a name="90309-0012.htm_para1"><a name="09030924000005">The truth of the matter is that small business faces a harsh reality that is quite unique. It has never faced such a situation before. I worked in a small business in 1979-80 and created my own in 1989-90, and both those periods were pretty harsh. But believe me, this situation is unprecedented. Small businesses face problem upon problem, and I shall give just four examples.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o211"><a name="90309-0012.htm_para2"><a name="09030924000006">Cash flow is a real problem, especially when caused by a one-off debt default. For a small business, it is a massive problem when someone does not pay a bill of &#163;5,000 or &#163;10,000. That might not seem a lot in the great world of the City, or in the portals of the headquarters of the CBI but, in our market towns up and down the country, it is the blow that puts small businesses out of business, especially if the Government&#146;s promised schemes are not forthcoming, which they are not at the moment. The truth is that the money is not getting through.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o212"><a name="90309-0012.htm_para3"><a name="09030924000007">Debt repayment times are lengthening. For a small business&#151;not in the cash business&#151;that invoices every month and expects its money back in 35 days, the period is now extended to 60, 65 and 70 days. If businesses cannot get that working capital, that alone has the potential to put them out of business. Working capital is at a massive premium, and cash is king.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o213"><a name="90309-0012.htm_para4"><a name="09030924000008">So what are businesses doing? They are reviewing staff&#151;I said this on Friday, and I repeat it so that the current Front-Bench team can take note&#151;and cutting staff. Small businesses with 10, 15, 20 or up to 140 or 150 people are asking themselves how they can make savings, because their working capital&#151;their cash flow&#151;is under great pressure. They are tightening credit controls&#151;if they were invoicing every month, they are now invoicing every two weeks, and some are doing so every week, in an attempt to ensure that the cash flows in.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o214"><a name="90309-0012.htm_para5"><a name="09030924000009">Finally, small businesses are cutting back on capital expenditure programmes, marketing and advertising budgets. All that tightening does not help the Government or the economy, because it means more unemployment, less spending and a deepening recession, and all for the sake of working capital and help with cash flow. The Government have been spreading new projects as though broadcasting or sowing in a field of corn, but most of those projects are not doing the job that the Government tell us that they are doing. The money is simply not getting through.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o215"><a name="90309-0012.htm_para6"><a name="09030924000010">I urge the Government, as I have on several occasions, to tell me about their assessment and monitoring of those schemes. I have not had an answer, which suggests to me that we are not monitoring and assessing how those schemes are working. That is a major problem, and I urge the Minister to take that on board and ensure that the Government understand what is happening in the real world. Although their fine words are welcome, the fact that what they say is not being put into effect certainly is not. It is causing businesses to go to the wall.</p>

If that does not make the point that there is an urgent need, I do not know what does. Let me assure the Minister that for most small businesses there is only one game in town&#151;survival. Their only objective is to be around this time next year. I urge the  <br>

Minister to take that on board most seriously, because as BDO Stoy Hayward and businessmen in our constituencies tell us, businesses are going to the wall for want of working capital and help with cash flow.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o217"><a name="90309-0012.htm_para8"><a name="09030924000012">I am concerned about the sector, and about the lack of monitoring, accountability and assessment of how well the Department is doing. Let me give a couple of examples. In 2005, 11.6 per cent. of adults in Britain were considering going into business, and the Department made it an objective to turn that into 12.3 per cent. The Department&#146;s 2007-08 report made it clear that there had been no change, but the reasons for that are simply not in the report. The Department does not know why it did not hit its targets or achieve its desired figures.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o218"><a name="90309-0012.htm_para9"><a name="09030924000013">The audit report of August 2006 found that there were 3,000 national, regional and local government projects to support small and medium-sized businesses. The Government wanted to reduce that figure to 100. The report also criticised the Government for not assessing and evaluating the effectiveness of those projects. So what has happened? I have asked questions about the monitoring of the objective to cut the number of schemes from 3,000 to 100, and asked questions on three separate occasions. If Members can believe it, I phoned the Department today, and asked how many of the 3,000 had either been amalgamated or ceased to exist. I was told that the Department did not have a list of the 3,000. It defeats me totally how one can amalgamate, take over and carry out the work of 3,000 different projects if one does not know what they are. If one wants a cut to 100, it would seem essential to know the starting base. However, the Department simply does not know.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o219"><a name="90309-0012.htm_para10"><a name="09030924000014">The Government can use fine words to tell us about their schemes again and again, but unless they are prepared to monitor and assess the effectiveness of those schemes, and to fine-tune them when the assessment tells them that they are not as successful as they need to be, the Department is wasting its time, and so are the Government. There is no way that they will achieve their objectives unless they know the performance of the schemes. It is no good just talking about new projects unless they also talk about the delivery vehicles, and assess and monitor their performance. The truth, however, is that that assessment and monitoring are simply not happening. I checked Lord Mandelson&#146;s speech on the new schemes that he would put in place, and it contained not one word about how he would monitor or assess their performance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o220"><a name="90309-0012.htm_para11"><a name="09030924000015">I do not have to tell you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, how vital the small and medium-sized business sector is to the well-being of our country. I do not need to tell you that most of the job creativity over the past six or seven years has come from that sector. I do not need to tell you that most of the original thinking&#151;about 70 per cent., it is estimated&#151;has come from that sector. I do not need to tell you that the supply chains are totally dependent on small and medium-sized businesses. For example, Airbus, in this country, employs 13,000 people directly, but it employs a further 140,000 in 400 small and medium-sized businesses throughout the country. That simple fact underlines the vital importance of the sector to UK plc.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o221"><a name="90309-0012.htm_para12"><a name="09030924000017">Am I not right in recollecting that somewhat over 99 per cent. of businesses employ fewer than 100 people, that those businesses account for somewhat more than 50 per cent. of the private-sector work force, and that they generate two fifths or thereabouts of our national output?</p>

<p><a name="st_o208"><a name="09030924000018"><a name="90309-0012.htm_spnew1"><a name="09030924000071"><b>Mr. Binley:</b>
 My hon. Friend is absolutely right. I am grateful to him for further emphasising the importance of the sector, thus helping me to make my point effectively.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o222"><a name="90309-0012.htm_para13"><a name="09030924000019">When we talk about small and medium-sized businesses, we are talking about a sector that will lie at the very foundation of any recovery from recession when green shoots appear. We need to ensure that that sector is as healthy as it can be, we need to ensure that it retains its skills, and, most of all, we need to ensure that the necessary structure is in place.</p>

<p><a name="st_o209"><a name="09030924000020"><a name="90309-0012.htm_spnew2"><a name="09030924000072"><b>Mr. Cash:</b>
 My hon. Friend may be intending to deal with this point later, but in the light of the telling figures given by my hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham (John Bercow) and in the light of his own excellent speech, does he not agree that one of the most crippling problems for small businesses is over-regulation? They complain about that almost as much as anything else, and rightly so. Is it not in the Government&#146;s gift to repeal legislation of this kind, whether it comes from their own Departments in the United Kingdom, from across the board or from the European Union, and does not the failure to do so let down small businesses? The Federation of Small Businesses, the Forum of Private Business and many similar organisations are leading in this regard, and they deserve full support.</p>

<p><a name="st_o210"><a name="09030924000021"><a name="90309-0012.htm_spnew3"><a name="09030924000073"><b>Mr. Binley:</b>
 I thank my hon. Friend for making that point. On a number of occasions I have called for sunset clauses to be included in every new regulation that the House accepts. I have also called on the Government to stop gold-plating, and have pointed out that they have been found to have gold-plated 62 per cent. of a number of sets of regulations. It is not only Europe that causes regulatory problems and increases the regulatory burden faced by business; it is our own Government as well. But of course we can do something about it in both quarters, and I hope that we will.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o223"><a name="90309-0012.htm_para14"><a name="09030924000022">The Government have made promises about regulation, but again we have not seen the results. Indeed, we heard earlier in the debate that a supporter of the Government felt that some of the remarks made about cutting regulation were silly. I thought that a rather silly thing to say, because I know what businesses are feeling out there. They feel that they are being over-burdened, week in week out, year in year out, by additional regulation that is costing them a great deal of money.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o224"><a name="90309-0012.htm_para15"><a name="09030924000023">I call on the Government not only to consider the projects that they spread around, the new deals and the promises that they make to the wealth-producing sector, but to recognise that while it is easy for them to make promises, they increase frustration and cause immense concern in the business sector if they fail to keep those promises. When the Government say that something will be put into effect, businesses expect it to be in effect when the Government say that it will be. They said that their loan guarantee scheme would come into effect on 1 March, but it was not there on that date. People ask for papers and cannot obtain them: they do not exist.</p>

 Today&#146;s debate has centred on two crucial issues: the accountability of the BERR ministerial team to this House of Parliament, and the Government&#146;s ability to deliver and implement the various promises and initiatives that they have announced.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o226"><a name="90309-0012.htm_para17"><a name="09030924000026">The debate was ably and lucidly kicked off by the Chairman of the Select Committee, my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Worcestershire (Peter Luff), who set out the case admirably. He was followed by another Select Committee Chair&#151;the hon. Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston (Andrew Miller), who is not here at the moment, although I am sure he will return soon&#151;and was bolstered by others making the same points: the hon. Member for Winchester (Mr. Oaten), my hon. Friend the Member for Banbury (Tony Baldry) and, in a typically rumbustious and passionate contribution, my hon. Friend the Member for Northampton, South (Mr. Binley).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o227"><a name="90309-0012.htm_para18"><a name="09030924000027">This is the crucial question relating to accountability: is the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform truly accountable to the House of Commons, the directly elected, most democratically legitimate Chamber of Parliament? I'm afraid the answer must be &#147;not really&#148;. Of the seven BERR Ministers, four&#151;more than half&#151;sit in the House of Lords, and five are part-timers shared with other Departments. During one of the most severe economic crises in a generation, possibly in several generations, the Government have just two full-time Business Ministers. They are led, of course, by Lord Mandelson, the puppetmaster controlling policy from a safe distance in the House of Lords, where he does not have to face Members of Parliament directly.</p>

 I am listening carefully to the hon. Gentleman&#146;s speech. Is it his party&#146;s policy to create an elected upper Chamber, if it were ever to come to power?</p>

 I am struggling to work out how that intervention is directly relevant to the BERR estimates. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman would like to take up the point with me later.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o228"><a name="90309-0012.htm_para19"><a name="09030924000030">My hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Worcestershire presented the various options that might be pursued to improve the accountability of Lord Mandelson and other House of Lords Ministers to the House of Commons. He mentioned the excellent footnote in his Committee&#146;s report stating when such a thing last happened. I understand that the Duke of Wellington was invited to answer questions here in the House of Commons. When he walked into the Chamber, the entire House rose spontaneously in a demonstration of admiration and support for the great man&#146;s abilities. I just wonder whether the same would happen if Lord Mandelson turned up here. I know that Labour Members hold him in the highest regard, and that it is their great aim to make him loved by their party. Perhaps we could try it; then we would see how they genuinely feel.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o229"><a name="90309-0012.htm_para20"><a name="09030924000031">Before we go any further, let me say that I am sure the Minister is eager to point out that in Lady Thatcher&#146;s Government, the then Department of Trade and Industry was also led by a peer&#151;Lord Young&#151;for a time. The difference is that Lady Thatcher continued to ensure full House of Commons accountability by ensuring that the DTI was headed by not one but two Cabinet-level Ministers, one of whom&#151;the right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke)&#151;is sitting next to me: one for the Commons and one for the Lords.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o230"><a name="90309-0012.htm_para21"><a name="09030924000032">The comparison between then and now is not flattering. I mean no disrespect to the individual BERR ministers in the House of Commons, who I am sure are all assiduous and hard working, but the plain fact is that their roles and authority have been reduced by this Government from one of the plum jobs in Westminster to the shrivelled and wrinkled parliamentary prune that we see today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o231"><a name="90309-0012.htm_para22"><a name="09030924000033">The second issue is delivery, and it was the subject of much debate.</p>

<p><a name="st_o214"><a name="09030924000034"><a name="90309-0012.htm_spnew7"><a name="09030924000077"><b>Tony Baldry:</b>
 Before my hon. Friend moves off the question of accountability, there is a second point that has been made by many Members in the Commons, which is that some of those Ministers who sit in the Commons also serve in other Departments. The future of business rates is one issue of current concern to businesses, particularly small-shop retailers. One would expect BERR Ministers at least to be advocates in that respect within Whitehall, but how can they be so if they are simultaneously Treasury Ministers, for example? They are totally schizophrenic on this issue because they seek to serve two Cabinet Ministers, which it is impossible to do properly.</p>

<p><a name="st_o215"><a name="09030924000035"><a name="90309-0012.htm_spnew8"><a name="09030924000078"><b>John Penrose:</b>
 I completely agree with my hon. Friend. The Chair of the Select Committee, my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Worcestershire, made the same point, saying he thought Whitehall would work better if there were a tension between the Departments and each set of Ministers were putting across their view&#151;not trying to reconcile internally, but batting for their own team properly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o232"><a name="90309-0012.htm_para23"><a name="09030924000036">The problem of delivery will be familiar to every businessman and woman throughout the country. They can have the best, most expensive, glossiest strategy or business plan in the whole world, but it is not worth a penny if they cannot put it into practice. The Government&#146;s record in this regard is spectacularly awful. Regulatory reform has been mentioned. In 2005, the Government promised to cut red tape by a quarter by 2010. We are now just a few months away from that deadline, but the British Chambers of Commerce &#147;burdens barometer&#148;, which tracks these things, tells us that the costs of red tape and regulation have got worse, rather than better, every year since it began.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o233"><a name="90309-0012.htm_para24"><a name="09030924000037">It is not just red tape and regulation that have got worse. We are in a credit crunch, so the Government have rightly pledged to pay their suppliers promptly&#151;within 10 or 14 days, depending on which announcement we believe&#151;to help their cash flow. That is admirable, except that many NHS hospital trusts are, apparently, routinely failing to pay their suppliers within 30 days&#151;far beyond Ministers&#146; much-hyped promises.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o234"><a name="90309-0012.htm_para25"><a name="09030924000038">Even worse for Great Britain plc, what about all the different loan guarantee schemes, personally announced by Lord Mandelson, which are supposed to get the banks lending again, and which the Government have launched amid huge fanfare over the last few months? I am afraid it is clear that they have stalled. The working capital scheme was supposed to be the Government&#146;s flagship measure for getting credit moving in the economy. It was announced way back in January, but as of last week it had not guaranteed a single loan. The enterprise finance guarantee scheme was supposed to help small firms. It was announced in January but, as we have heard from the hon. Member for Winchester, the Federation of Small Businesses says that only 8 per cent. of its members can find a bank that is actually offering it. The loan guarantees scheme for car manufacturers was announced in January, but the Government have only just asked for applications from firms needing help, and they have not disbursed a single penny so far. The Government&#146;s guarantee scheme for asset-backed securities was announced in January, but will not start until April. The home owners mortgage support scheme was announced last December, but has not yet helped a single family that is falling behind with its mortgage. The recruitment subsidies scheme to get people into work was launched in January, but has so far not helped anyone to get a job, and the graduate internships scheme was announced in January, but has not even got a launch date yet.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o235"><a name="90309-0012.htm_para26"><a name="09030924000039">For the Government who are supposed to be the voice of business to be so weak on delivery and implementation is scandalous. As Alan Sugar has repeatedly rightly said on &#147;The Apprentice&#148;, business men and women need to be practical. They need to be doers, not just talkers. They have to make things happen but, as this list of delay and failure shows, these Ministers and this Government are far better at press releases and glossy announcements than they are at the grubby, and often messy, business of delivery and implementation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o236"><a name="90309-0012.htm_para27"><a name="09030924000040">I suppose we should expect that from a Department led by Lord Mandelson. The PR and spin are excellent, but the follow-through is rubbish. If the Secretary of State and his team were applying for jobs on &#147;The Apprentice&#148;, I doubt that they would last 10 minutes. The electorate of this country have reached a decision, too. Their message to this Government is very simple: &#147;You&#146;re fired.&#148;</p>

I have to say, however, that I do not agree with his points on accountability. There are many precedents for Departments being led by peers.

There are regular Business questions in this House, during which hon. Members of  <br>

all parties can scrutinise the Department&#146;s work. I am sure that there is no Minister in DBERR who feels unscrutinised. I remember that in one 10-day period I appeared before seven different Select Committees, of both this House and the House of Lords.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o238"><a name="90309-0013.htm_para1"><a name="09030924000043">I welcome the comments of the hon. Member for Banbury (Tony Baldry) about the immediate response he has received from DBERR officials when he has raised particular issues. That is a small indication of the commitment in the Department, from both Ministers and officials, to do all we can to help businesses and families through the recession.</p>

 I will not repeat the debate on accountability, as I have made my points&#151;although I profoundly disagree with the Minister, and think he is absolutely wrong on it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o239"><a name="90309-0013.htm_para2"><a name="09030924000045">I did not know about the helpline that my hon. Friend the Member for Banbury drew to the House&#146;s attention. He kindly showed me the letter that he mentioned. The relevant reference comes in the last paragraph of a three-page letter, the contents of the first two pages of which I was entirely familiar with. It would be prudent for the Department to draw that excellent helpline to the attention of the whole House in a single, dedicated letter just to make the point that it exists, because I did not know that it existed.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman has drawn the House&#146;s attention to it, and we will certainly consider whether we need to do so further, but I am sure Members will read <i> Hansard </i>and reflect on the speeches of the hon. Gentleman and the hon. Member for Banbury.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o240"><a name="90309-0013.htm_para3"><a name="09030924000047">I want to pick up one further point that the hon. Member for Banbury made. He raised the question of Ministers working across Departments. That is not a new innovation. It seeks to break down the silo mentality that can, on occasion, bedevil any Government of any colour. In a time of economic difficulties it makes absolute sense to have, in the case of my hon. Friend the Member for Dudley, South (Ian Pearson), a Minister with one foot in the Treasury and another in the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform. For other Ministers who also have joint responsibilities, there is the opportunity to bring, on occasion, a slightly broader view to their discussions internally.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o241"><a name="90309-0013.htm_para4"><a name="09030924000048">I hope that the hon. Member for Mid-Worcestershire will forgive my saying that I was slightly surprised by two omissions from his opening comments. I am sure that he would accept that DBERR Ministers have a key role to play in continuing to encourage trade, and particularly in encouraging the avoidance of protectionism. That is another key part of the Department&#146;s work, in which Ministers are playing their part. I am sure that only lack of time meant that the hon. Gentleman could not also raise issues to do with help for families, which my Department is offering, such as the increase in support to debt advisers, the national debt helpline and citizens advice bureaux. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman and the House in general will recognise the importance of that assistance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o242"><a name="90309-0013.htm_para5"><a name="09030924000049">The hon. Gentleman asked a number of specific questions. I will deal with one of them now, and I hope to address some of the others during the course of my remarks. He asked for final clarity as to whether the enterprise finance guarantee scheme applied to Northern Ireland. I can tell him that it does; I hope that deals with the remaining confusion on that.</p>

This recession was not made in Britain, but its consequences are having a profound impact on the daily lives of many families and businesses. That is why the Government have developed a number of key policies aimed at providing real help now. A series of our measures are making a real difference for many businesses and families as we speak. I recognise that there is more that not only the Department but the Government need to do&#151;all contributions from hon.

caused. First, we prevented Northern Rock from going under&#151;I remind the House that the Conservative party opposed that move and then, in a perfect example of the constantly shifting sands on which their economic policies are made, they changed their minds&#151;and we have since recapitalised a series of banks that were experiencing real difficulties. We are working hard, as the statement by my right hon. Friend the Financial Secretary to the Treasury made clear, to get the banks to increase their lending activities directly. The asset protection scheme has led to agreement with banks on lending levels; an agreement on lending levels has been put in place not only with Northern Rock, but now with the Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds bank, as Members who were in the House at the time will have recognised. Lending levels will be increased to help viable businesses get access to the credit that they need.</p>

There is a mix of loan guarantees and, potentially, loans to support some &#163;2.3 billion-worth of lending from the European Investment Bank and other sources. A number of hon. Members raised other issues that are potentially of considerable interest to those in the car industry. A further meeting with car manufacturers and their suppliers will take place on Wednesday&#151;it will be chaired by my hon.

Such ways include a new set of principles for handling how they manage the debts and an agreement to provide a breathing space of up to 60 days space for people in financial difficulties, to allow them to sort themselves out and be able to move on with their repayments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o251"><a name="90309-0013.htm_para14"><a name="09030924000062">The single biggest measure that we have initiated to help businesses and families through the recession is the fiscal stimulus, which was unveiled by the Chancellor at the pre-Budget report and opposed by the Conservative party. The fiscal stimulus package includes a cut in VAT&#151;the largest tax cut since 1988&#151;putting money back into the pockets of shoppers and shopkeepers; an income tax cut of &#163;1.4 billion; a &#163;60 payment for pensioners; new help on child benefit; and &#163;3 billion of capital investment.

Member for Weston-super-Mare that it is a little rich to be lectured on providing support to businesses during a recession by the Conservative party, given that it was responsible for two devastating recessions in the 1980s and 1990s that cost thousands of jobs. Those recessions were directly attributable to the economic policies of the then Government. The striking thing about the Conservative party&#146;s approach, which includes opposing the fiscal stimulus, is that it is completely out of synch with the rest of the world. Doing nothing to help&#151;indeed, it is now advocating significant cuts in public expenditure&#151;is a reckless approach at best; it is certainly extremely dangerous. That approach is advocated by no major country.</p>

 I am pleased to open this estimates day debate on rail. There is no doubt that rail is great success story, but it also faces challenges related to the recession, and there are question marks over its structure and about whether it is achieving value for money. The Select Committee on Transport&#146;s report &#147;Delivering a sustainable railway: a 30-year strategy for the railways?&#148;, which was published on 21 July 2008, considered those points, a number of which are being followed up by new inquiries.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o257"><a name="90309-0013.htm_para20"><a name="09030928000006">The report considered the rail White Paper, which combines the Government&#146;s strategy for the next 30 years with proposals for the next five years in its high level output statement. It anticipates the doubling of passenger and freight traffic over a 30-year period. The Committee welcomed the growth strategy but criticised the report for lacking vision, particularly in relation to high-speed rail and electrification. It is reassuring to see how much progress has been made on both issues since the Committee&#146;s report was published. They are both of critical importance and the Committee will be pursuing them. We are pleased that studies are being undertaken, but we want to see commitment to action within a realistic time scale.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o258"><a name="90309-0013.htm_para21"><a name="09030928000007">In today&#146;s debate, I want to concentrate on a number of key financial issues that challenge fundamental parts of the rail system as it operates today, as well as raising specific questions about the estimates before us.

It shows a small reduction in the number of passengers in the third quarter of 2008-09 compared with the third quarter of 2007-08. The first two quarters of that year showed small increases compared with comparable periods in the previous year. If that trend continues and there is a reduction in the number of rail passengers or in the number of anticipated rail passengers, that will have major implications for the franchising system for rail services and rail finances.</p>

anticipated when companies bid for and acquired franchises could threaten the viability of rail services and pose a serious financial challenge for the Department for Transport. It is not clear in the estimates whether the scale of that challenge has been assessed or, indeed, provided for. In those circumstances the train operating companies might seek renegotiation of their franchise agreements. They might default on premiums due or seek to increase subsidies, perhaps activating the revenue sharing agreements that are already in place. They might try to reduce services&#151;indeed, that has already started&#151;or to walk away from their franchises. Concerns have already been raised about all those possibilities and jobs in the rail industry are already being shed.</p>

He told the Transport Committee on 25 February that no train operating company had yet told the Department that it wanted to walk away, abandoning its franchise, but he did not deny that up to five red warning lights about train operating companies were flashing in his Department. He told us that the train operating companies would be held to their franchise agreements, but that it is often unclear exactly which services the train operating companies are contractually bound to provide. One issue that has raised great public consternation has been the plans to close booking offices. That is a matter of convenience for passengers, but it is also related to transport safety.  <br>

 Can the hon. Lady confirm the information that I have heard, which is that the train operating companies have been told that if they abandon or walk away from one franchise they will be expected to walk away from all the franchises that they hold? Some, of course, hold multiple franchises. Whether that is the correct system or not, does she agree that there are significant doubts about whether there is a default mechanism in place for the Department for Transport or any other mechanism to run a franchise that has suddenly been abandoned? There is no expertise there to do that.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman refers to a key section of the financial arrangements between the train operating companies that hold the franchises and the Department. He raises serious issues about what would happen if one or more than one train operating company sought to enable such a change to take effect. My noble Friend the Minister of State reiterated before the Committee that his Department was the operator of last resort. It is legitimate to consider what would happen if a number of train operating companies withdrew from their franchises or were unable to follow the agreements that they have entered into. That raises big questions about how train services would operate and it also raises major financial questions. What provisions have been made to accommodate that and what credibility would there be for operators who took up the new franchises when they saw how people who did not want to continue with their obligations were being allowed to renege on the agreements they had made. Those are big, serious questions and a realistic reading of the economic situation suggests that a crisis in railways or rail funding might not be far away. I want to seek reassurance that the Department is ready for such a crisis and is ready to address it so that the travelling public do not suffer.</p>

 We have already had the experience of one franchise that was run for a little time in the public sector. During that time, it was more efficient and it produced a better service than it did in the private sector. If all the franchises collapse back into the public sector, will we not see an improvement in our railways and more efficiency? Could we not then simply take over the rolling stock leasing companies, which are now owned by the banks, which are now in the public sector, and recreate something that we might call British Rail?</p>

 I am not able to explain that item in detail, and I hope that the right hon. Gentleman will address that question to the Under-Secretary of State for Transport, my hon. Friend the Member for Gillingham (Paul Clark). Given the question marks over the operation of the rail service, and given the economic climate, it may well be that a number of items will be called.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o262"><a name="90309-0014.htm_para1"><a name="09030928000021">Rail fares are another important issue, and the Select Committee&#146;s report addresses the issue. Indeed, the Committee called on the Government to review their decision to change the funding balance between taxpayers and passengers so sharply. In 2006-07, Government support for the railways totalled &#163;6.3 billion, whereas &#163;5 billion came from passengers. Under the Government&#146;s plans, by 2013-14, those figures will have been dramatically reversed. The Government project that their support will total &#163;3 billion, while the projected support from passengers will reach &#163;9 billion&#151;a dramatic increase.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o263"><a name="90309-0014.htm_para2"><a name="09030928000022">If we look at the whole of the next control period, which is 2009 to 2014, we see that it is projected that Government support will total just under two fifths of the money that is expected to be raised from passengers; the former will be &#163;15 billion, and the latter &#163;39 billion. If we compare that with the current control period, which is nearing its end, we see that between 2003 to 2008&#151;the last period for which figures are available&#151;the Government more than matched the revenue raised from passengers; there was &#163;23 billion from passengers, and &#163;24 billion from Government. In the next control period, which is due to start at the beginning of April, the Government plan a dramatic switch from the taxpayer to the passenger.</p>

 I thank my hon. Friend for giving way yet again. Are those plans not absolutely astonishing? We already have the highest rail fares in Europe. If there is a massive shift from taxpayer or Government funding to the fare-paying passenger, at a time when a reduction in passengers is likely, rail fares will go through the roof. It will be beyond anybody&#146;s capability to pay them. The exception, perhaps, will be those whose fares are paid for them, such as Members of Parliament.</p>

 My hon. Friend raises an important point to which I will refer a little later. In January this year, there was public outcry from passengers who experienced increases to regulated fares&#151;ones over which the Government have some control. The increases were, on average, six or seven times the current rate of inflation, yet they followed the agreed formula. I am pleased to say that the Government have now rejected the request from train operating companies to abandon the formula when that formula might lead to fares being reduced; my noble Friend Lord Adonis informed the Select Committee of that when we questioned him very closely indeed on the issue. The formula means that regulated fares can be increased, on average, in a so-called basket of fares, by the retail prices index plus 1 per cent., although in reality that can mean increases that are six or seven times the rate of inflation. If inflation reduces next year, as is predicted, the application of the formula could mean a reduction in fares. I understand that the train operating companies made a request to the Government that the formula be not adhered to, and I am pleased to hear that their request was turned down. It was good to hear from my noble Friend that it is possible that fares will be reduced next year; I hope that that can happen.</p>

 I absolutely share the hon. Lady&#146;s desire to see rail fares controlled; they are far too high, and are in danger of getting higher. There may be a different double whammy from the one that she mentions. There could be the double whammy of reduced income for the train operating companies, and a reduced number of passengers, if the recession kicks in. However, there would be the same overheads, over which they have little flexibility, although there may be a bit of flexibility at the edge, with regard to booking offices and so on. Under those circumstances, and given the architecture that is in place, is not the real danger that those circumstances make the defaulting of the franchise more likely?</p>

Network Rail has now accepted the rail regulator&#146;s decision to reduce the sum that it requested for the next control period from &#163;31.1 billion to &#163;28.5 billion&#151;a reduction of &#163;2.6 billion.</p>

Friend the Member for Westbury (Dr. Murrison), there is sometimes a lack of clarity between Network Rail and the train operators as to which is responsible for painting, modernising and maintaining various parts of the station. Surely the Government could do more to help with co-ordination between the two.</p>

 I am delighted that my hon. Friend has reminded the House how infinitely better Network Rail is than its predecessor, Railtrack. Notwithstanding the enormous improvement that we have seen in the performance of Network Rail, does she agree that there is a fundamental problem with the way in which it is governed, and its accountability? There is a desperate need for an improvement in the governance structure and the accountability of the organisation.</p>

 I certainly agree with my hon. Friend in raising questions about the accountability of Network Rail and its structure. The matter was considered in the Select Committee&#146;s report. I am pleased to note that the members of Network Rail commissioned a special report to look specifically at governance, but it is a matter of some disappointment that Network Rail apparently does not wish to release the report, although I note that somehow it has made its way to the newspapers, and I do not think it will be kept secret for much longer. It is important that Network Rail reviews the way it is run, improves its accountability and looks again at the way its members operate, and the possibility of setting up a smaller supervisory board that could exert much more control and accountability.</p>

 The hon. Lady rightly says that the report is likely to find its way into the newspapers, for indeed it has. A number of comments appeared in the <i> Evening Standard</i> last week.

It states that the increased contribution from the Department will be matched by a reduced contribution from the train operating companies, which will pay lower track access charges, and that the net effect on the train operating companies will be nil, yet it is not clear from the estimates exactly how that will be achieved. There is no mention of reduced funding to the train operating companies in the estimates. I should be grateful if my hon. Friend the Minister would inform us how the matter is to be addressed.</p>

As we know, rail travel has increased dramatically in the past few years, but the consequence has been that overcrowding&#151;particularly on commuter trains; not only those to London, but to places such as Manchester and Bristol&#151;is increasing enormously. Part of the reason for that is the failure of the Government and the rolling stock companies, which are the architecture of the rail industry, sufficiently to predict the increase and to have in train&#151;no pun intended&#151;sufficient rolling stock to meet the challenge.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o276"><a name="90309-0015.htm_para1"><a name="09030928000057">At the moment, there is a grotesque shortage of rolling stock. There are virtually no trains anywhere in the country, and rolling stock is cascaded from one operator to another as if in some sort of merry-go-round&#151;Southern takes some stuff from South West Trains, and then some more carriages are handed over to First Capital Connect. There are not enough trains. There are many examples across the country of passengers being asked to travel in grotesquely overcrowded conditions.

 The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right. Some services in Shropshire are extremely overcrowded, particularly Arriva services. How much compensation does he think travellers should get from operators if they are forced to stand during their journey?</p>

 I am not necessarily talking about whether they are forced to stand, but the compensation regime is entirely inadequate. For example, the Government&#146;s targets measure whether an inter-city train arrives within 10 minutes of the due time or later, and whether a local train arrives within five minutes of the due time or later. As far as I can tell, there is no incentive for operators to deliver a train 11 minutes late rather than 59 minutes late. That is one example of when the compensation scheme does not work.</p>

Despite Network Rail&#146;s alleged endeavours to get to a 24/7 railway, the number of engineering works for this year is substantially the same as that for last year. As far as I can tell, Network Rail has made no progress on reducing the number of engineering works that cause people to be diverted on to replacement bus services. Financial incentives to repay passengers and force the industry to recognise the disruption that it is causing are long overdue.</p>

Announcements are made at regular intervals to tell us how it is all getting on. Yet a parliamentary answer to me from the Minister, dated 4 March, said that the last of the trains from the InterCity express programme will not come until 2018. Some of the delivery periods for the new trains are very long.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o279"><a name="90309-0015.htm_para4"><a name="09030928000066">It all comes back to the statement on rolling stock that the Secretary of State for Transport made the other day. He spoke in complimentary terms, saying that the trains would be greener, more environmentally friendly and good for British jobs. We now know that the consortium was not British-led, although that is how the Department for Transport described it. It was a Japanese-led consortium, with John Laing as a minor partner. Furthermore, of the 12,500 jobs talked about, 10,000 are existing jobs at third-party companies that may conceivably benefit over the lifetime of the billed contract; even the other 2,500 jobs are disputable as the initial 70 engines and carriages are being built in Japan. </p>

As far as the statement that the new rolling stock would be green and environmentally friendly is concerned, the claim was that the stock would consume less energy. That, however, is not correct: when we divide the total energy consumption based on total passenger capacity of the rolling stock, with a new, greater seat complement, we find that it is less energy efficient than the inter-city trains that it is replacing. I mention that because, apart from the fact that it all seems expensive and that there seems to be an environmental question mark over the Government&#146;s train-ordering process, we are moving away from rolling stock leasing companies towards a more centralised ordering of trains.</p>

I do not want to defend the privatisation foisted on us by a previous Conservative Government; in many ways, that failed and we are still picking up the pieces. Furthermore, the creation of ROSCOs enabled a great deal of money to be made to no real benefit, especially in the early days. But we are where we are. The Government do not like the ROSCOs and referred them to the Competition Commission, whose draft report indicated that the issue was a boomerang from the Government. The Government largely got the blame for the arrangements, not the ROSCOs. The Government&#146;s response has been to take hold of the InterCity express programme and order a train that is overpriced, not energy efficient and does not particularly help British industry.</p>

they will have no incentive to build anything other than on the basis of firm orders. If they build only on that basis, when passenger numbers pick up&#151;and they are doing so, in fact&#151;there will be no rolling stock for the train operating companies to get hold of.

The advantages of that would be twofold: first, the train companies could look to getting their own rolling stock, thereby bypassing the ROSCOs, which could be a useful step forward; and secondly, it would enable them to plan ahead and see the financial case themselves for infrastructure improvements, which we have not seen to any large degree so far in the 10 years of this Government. For example, Chiltern Railways is effectively creating a new line between Oxford and London as a consequence of alterations that it is making to one particular section of the track, and that would not be possible unless it had the long franchise that it does.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman suggests that we should have a 30-year franchise so that people could plan ahead but then says that it would have to be reviewed every five years. I presume that it could therefore be cancelled every five years, so it would really be a five-year franchise.</p>

 The position is clear; I am sorry if I did not make it clear to the hon. Gentleman. A franchise would be awarded for 30 years, but there would be five-year checks to ensure that the franchise conditions were being met, and if so the franchise would automatically stay with the company that was awarded it in the first place rather than being re-tendered. The alternative is what we have at the moment, whereby, for example, the Southern franchise is being re-tendered for a period of five years and eight or 10 months. With the best will in the world, what can a train company possibly do in that period other than paint the stations and sort out one or two car parks? It cannot possibly make the necessary investment.</p>

 It sounds like a good idea that a company would be able to invest ahead at the start of a 30-year franchise. However, that would kill off the ROSCOs, and what would happen in the last five or 10 years of a franchise&#151;investment would stop still, would it not?</p>

 If the hon. Gentleman is arguing that in the last five or 10 years of a franchise investment stops still, he must be arguing that no investment takes place under a franchise at the present time. Franchises currently run for five or 10 years, so there is, by definition, only five or 10 years to go on existing franchises. That is how long they are.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman cannot have heard what I said. Because we have relatively short franchises, there is another mechanism&#151;the ROSCOs&#151;for rolling stock and locomotive investment. If we expected investment to take place in-house within the franchise, that would kill off the ROSCOs and there would be no investment in the last five or 10 years. How would he deal with that problem in the closing stages of a franchise?</p>

 In that unlikely scenario, it would be perfectly possible to have an arrangement whereby we had investment of last resort or had the franchise for the following 30 years awarded earlier than the expiry of the 30-year period in sufficient time for rolling stock to be ordered for the following period. The problem would be easy to get round. Although I am happy to accept that any scenario will have difficulties, I argue that the difficulties presented by my suggested solution are far less serious than the ones presented by the current arrangements, whereby no investment takes place from the train operating companies in rolling stock or in anything much else given the limited range of franchises.</p>

In Ministers&#146; efforts to improve the railways&#151;they have got hold of where they need to be improved and invested in; I am grateful that are seeing a sea change from the laissez-faire approach of a few years ago&#151;their instincts are to intervene more and more in small details. That is wrong in terms of rolling stock for the reasons that I have given. It is also wrong in terms of some of the timetable arrangements that are being imposed on the railways. We have just seen a new timetable produced for the Southern region that has been catastrophically ineffective and caused a record level of complaints to the train company, which is not responsible for the problems that have arisen. The problems in the Southern region are a consequence of the Government giving in, as they always do, to the aviation industry&#151;at Gatwick in this case&#151;so that a timetable has been constructed that suits Gatwick airport and, frankly, screws the rest of the Southern network. That is a direct consequence of the Government&#146;s intervention. They overruled the preferred timetable from Southern and from Network Rail, which should have maximised journey opportunities for those in Brighton and other areas of the south coast, including my constituency. I fear that we are moving towards a situation in which Department for Transport officials intervene to micromanage in a way that is counter-productive in terms of delivering a good railway. We need to ensure that we expand the network.</p>

 I certainly agree that significant lines used only for freight could be used for passenger services. Some go to quarries, and would be less used by passengers, but others could be used in that way&#151;for example, Exeter to Okehampton in Devon. Okehampton is not served by passenger services except on some days in summer, but there is a perfectly serviceable line that could be used for a regular commuter service.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o289"><a name="90309-0015.htm_para14"><a name="09030928000090">It is not sufficient to argue, as the Government have, that expansion is simply a matter for Network Rail, which is then constrained by the Office of Rail Regulation. The ORR operates on a past Department for Transport policy and is unable even to agree, say, to the doubling of Swindon to Kemble line, which everybody in the rail industry accepts is a sensible proposal that should be taken forward. We have not seen a plethora of new or reopened lines or stations, despite the growth in passenger numbers in the past 10 years, and those that have come have done so almost in the teeth of opposition from the Department for Transport: I am thinking of Stirling to Alloa and the Ebbw Vale line in Wales. The devolved Assemblies and Governments have been producing the lines, not the British Government here, who have delivered almost nothing in the way of improved rail connections in England since 1997. That is very sad.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o290"><a name="90309-0015.htm_para15"><a name="09030928000091">As the hon. Member for Wansbeck (Mr. Murphy) said, a plethora of lines and stations should be considered for reopening. I must mention Lewes to Uckfield, of course, but there are plenty of others up and down the country. Yet it seems that the Department for Transport still has the mindset that money spent on roads is investment and money spent on rail is subsidy. We have to change that if we are to meet the environmental and economic challenges ahead. A longer franchise agreement for 30 years would enable train companies to look at what might be sensible for them to invest in without even having recourse to the public purse. Essential to that is the reform of NATA&#151;the new approach to appraisal&#151;which is the archaic formula that the Government use to work out the benefits of rail schemes. Under NATA, if a new rail line is opened, a calculation is made as to how many people would transfer from road to rail, and the Treasury then counts the loss of fuel duty as a disbenefit to the scheme. It is hardly surprising that lines do not open given that sort of mad economics. The Department continually underestimates the number of passengers. Stirling to Alloa, for example, has seen a massive increase, way above the projection given for passenger numbers.</p>

Some of my hon. Friends spoke, including Peter Pike from Burnley and the late Bob Cryer from Bradford, and the right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon (Mr. Curry). The reason for the debate was that British Rail wanted to close the line, but the Conservative Government wanted to privatise it. Of course, nothing happened and it was saved. April will be the 20th anniversary of the saving of the Settle to Carlisle railway line and, hopefully, we will have an Adjournment debate about that anniversary, when we can pat everybody on the back and say what a good idea it was. That was the last attempt by any Government of any colour to close a major railway line. In many ways, it was the start of the renaissance of the railways. Unfortunately, the Conservative party decided to go through the trauma of privatisation. It discounted it in the case of the Settle line, but went for the big experiment.</p>

Friend the Member for North Tyneside (Mr. Byers), the Secretary of State who had the courage to put Railtrack into administration. If he had not done so, we would not be talking about a successful railway today. Hon. Members should remember that our railways have the most advanced rolling stock of anywhere in Europe, but listening to the comments from the Liberal Democrat spokesman, one would not believe it.

One day it is this, the next it is that, and if we look a bit later, we find the price has gone up again.

 I agree totally with my hon. Friend. For someone travelling from Carlisle to London, it may be cheaper to buy a single to Preston, and then one from Preston to Crewe, and then one to London. That makes no sense. If British Rail did one thing, it was to tell people the price of a ticket, and they knew what they were paying for. That is not now the case.

The latter would be a major problem for us. It could easily be done and nobody would notice. My understanding is that the Conservative policy is to build a high-speed line from existing resources. That would mean that the maintenance of the rest of the line and the upgrade of the rest of the railways would be reduced&#151;it is a sleight of hand.

Unlike London, their public transport system is made up of buses, and in urban areas those buses are not subsidised. In the big commuter areas, fares are considerably subsidised. If we are saying to my constituents, who might get on a train once or twice a year, that they should pay more subsidy to the railways so that other people will benefit, we should make that clear.

What we must not do is lose track of what we are about: creating a better railway for the future. We will get over this recession. We may have to put more money in, and perhaps later we can take it out again, but we should not start making major cuts that would mean we did not have a railway that was fit for purpose when we came out of the recession.</p>

 The increasing gap between per capita expenditure on railways in London and the south-east and in the rest of the country is unjustifiable. When Ministers have appeared before the Select Committee on Transport or been asked questions on the Floor of the House, very few of them have justified that gap. In some cases, they have not known where their investment was going. Those who have attempted to justify it have used the Eddington report, which states that the rail network is good enough and that we should invest in the parts of the system where there is congestion. The problem with that approach, which is a bit like the one suggested in the Barker report on housing, is that it is fundamentally reactionary. It leads to money and investment being put where investment already exists, to the detriment of the rest of the county.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o310"><a name="90309-0016.htm_para18"><a name="09030933000002">In the new ministerial team at the Department for Transport, we have a team with real vision. They have put electrification back on the agenda and are talking about High Speed 2. I am delighted about that, because transport is not just about making right what is already in place. When it is invested in properly and produces better transport, it transforms any economy. There is a need to be proactive.</p>

People are discussing whether, after Birmingham, the high-speed link should go to Manchester or Leeds on its way to Scotland. I do not want to get into that competition, because we can have our cake and eat it. The Victorians built railways at both ends of the country because they did not have the engineering capacity to get through or over the Pennines. After London, population density in the country is highest in Birmingham, west midlands, Manchester, Leeds, Newcastle, Edinburgh and Glasgow. We have got the technology to go over or through the Pennines, which would be the best route. Why do we not build a high speed link across the Pennines and kill two birds with one stone?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o312"><a name="90309-0016.htm_para20"><a name="09030933000004">The other side of the coin is that we do not have to start in the south-east.

That would transform the economy, and be good for the environment and transport.</p>

In considering investing in high-speed routes, we should not forget that, London may have Thameslink, but exactly the same problems exist in the Manchester system, which affect the whole of the north of England. We refer to the Manchester hub, but perhaps we should say &#147;the Irwell link&#148; or &#147;the northern link&#148; to try to take the bottlenecks out of the Manchester system.

There are only two platforms, which take five trains. Salford council, the urban development company in the area and all the partners would like investment in that site so that there can be four platforms to ease congestion. That would benefit the whole of the north of England and start balancing investment between the north and the south of England. It would also be good for regeneration, and a bus station could be sited there.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o316"><a name="90309-0016.htm_para24"><a name="09030933000012">My next point is about investment. High-speed rail would be good for the whole country and getting rid of the congestion in the Greater Manchester system would be good for the north of England. The Government have said that they want to bring forward expenditure. We recently had a debate on the transport innovation fund and &#147;congestion-TIF&#148;, as it was called. The people of Greater Manchester rejected that, but the money is still sitting in the pot. I do not see the point of leaving it hanging around for three or four years, when it will probably disappear, given that the economy needs that investment now. It should be transferred to a productivity pot for which all districts and councils in the country can bid. Otherwise, it will not be spent. In Greater Manchester, it would be best to spend it on tram links or heavy rail links to Manchester airport, which is one of the major international access points to this country. That would have an economic benefit.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman is right.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o317"><a name="90309-0017.htm_para0"><a name="09030933000017">My next point deals with the conundrum of expenditure on Network Rail. If one imagines British Rail with the number of passengers that now travel on the rail system, and an average of &#163;5 billion of subsidy every year&#151;in real terms, approximately three times what British Rail had&#151;it would be in huge surplus. That is the first indication of inefficiency in the Network Rail system. I have asked many Ministers why rail in this country costs so much. The answer is beginning to become clearer. One obvious answer is that 100 companies are now involved in the railways, with 100 chief executives, 100 finance officers and 100 bottom lines, out of which to make profits. Obviously, that costs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o318"><a name="90309-0017.htm_para1"><a name="09030933000018">There are also perverse incentives. When lines are closed, Network Rail pays the train operating companies. If a business is to benefit from something&#151;investment means that the railway system will be getting better for those train operating companies&#151;it normally pays. We are considering a perverse incentive and a perverse reward.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o319"><a name="90309-0017.htm_para2"><a name="09030933000019">I guess that most people do not know the next reason for the cost of Network Rail. When Network Rail closes a line for improvements or because something has gone wrong, it puts on buses, and calls that&#151;it is a dreadful word&#151;&#147;bustitution&#148;. Twelve of the 13 major rail franchises that bus companies run effectively use themselves as agents. Arriva uses Arriva; National Express uses National Express; FirstGroup uses FirstGroup; Stagecoach uses Stagecoach and so on. That means that anyone bidding does not get the bus service operator grant because it goes to the agent of the main company. There is very little control over the costs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o320"><a name="90309-0017.htm_para3"><a name="09030933000020">I have talked to representatives of bus operating companies that have been put out of business because they do not believe that they can compete with bodies that effectively award the contracts to themselves. They are told that it is a matter of quality as well as price, but when one talks to the bus drivers, one finds that the agents pay two and three times what the competitors would pay. There is a cost to Network Rail and there is, therefore, a cost to the public purse. I have talked to several bus operators. One&#151;Fraser Eagle&#151;was recently put into administration. It believes that that has happened because of those unfair, if not corrupt practices by train operating companies that also run the buses. Those are most of the points that I want to make.</p>

The &#163;60 billion of benefits from a high-speed line that were identified in the second Atkins report will come about only if it goes to the major centres of population.

In the period immediately before privatisation, the number of passenger miles travelled was dropping each year. In 1980, investment in the railways was &#163;900 million; by 2003, it was &#163;4 billion. The state-owned monolith of British Rail would never have secured the requisite funding to invest in major capital infrastructure and the upgrading of rolling stock, signals, the permanent way and stations. British Rail was only ever an inert supplicant for inadequate state funding, under both Labour and Conservative Administrations, with poor management and planning. It could never have developed a coherent case for rebalancing our transport policy away from road freight and car use towards greater equilibrium and sustainability.</p>

It is an inconvenient truth that privatisation arrested a 50-year decline in freight traffic.

In addition, despite paying lip service to the unreconstructed left on their Back Benches, even this Government had to concede that privatisation was a success.

In the absence of any undertaking by Ministers to assist the train operating companies, we could be forgiven for asking two pertinent questions. First, was the east coast franchise overpriced and a product of Treasury greed and myopia? Secondly, what is the Government&#146;s plan B, if the costs prove prohibitive for the company? The medium-term financial viability of the franchisees on the east coast main line is integral to Network Rail&#146;s proposal to upgrade Peterborough station over the next few years, and that project is inextricably linked to the regeneration of Peterborough city centre and the economic competitiveness of the greater Peterborough travel-to-work area.</p>

The viewpoint of those organisations and Labour Members has been short-termism. High-speed rail links work; they have social and environmental benefits, as well as massive economic benefits, as the hon. Member for Manchester, Blackley (Graham Stringer) mentioned.

 The recent decision to award the Intercity Express programme for 1,300 carriages to the Agility consortium has already been mentioned by the hon. Member for Lewes (Norman Baker) and I would like to expand on the subject. As he said, the consortium is based on Hitachi, a Japanese supplier, and the decision has been greeted with anger and gloom in Derby&#151;the home of Bombardier, which employs 2,200 people in the area with a large supply chain concentrated close to the city; it is the only major rail manufacturer in the UK. Obviously, as a Member whose constituency includes part of Derby, I am concerned about that and I want to share my concern with the House. I shall develop four points in that regard.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o336"><a name="90309-0017.htm_para19"><a name="09030933000050">First, the commitment to British manufacturing and technology within the Hitachi bid is, to date, extraordinarily light. It seems likely that its tender will commit only to  <br>

assembly and maintenance in the UK; the reference to 70 per cent. of jobs being here is largely based around the maintenance activity, which is already located here. No growth in employment is being offered.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o337"><a name="90309-0017.htm_para20"><a name="09030933000051">If, as the Government stated in their announcement, we are to place the UK in a strong position for rolling stock supply across Europe, it is critical that any contract ensures that high-value manufacturing of the vehicles takes place here and that the technologies to support that development of the industry are based in the UK. Mere kit assembly will proffer us no competitive advantage whatever in a European marketplace. It is intriguing to note that the welding technology that Hitachi has claimed as being critical to its bid and unique to its company was actually originally developed at the Welding Institute at Abingdon. The company has certainly supplemented that technology over time, but must we see our key technologies in a sector that we used to dominate once again reliant on foreign exploitation?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o338"><a name="90309-0017.htm_para21"><a name="09030933000052">Secondly, the scale of UK employment in the Hitachi bid has been questioned. Hitachi itself has not made the claim, but the Government have stated that 12,500 jobs will be created or secured. It has so far proved impossible to get close to that figure, which appears to have been based on the fact that in its bid Bombardier quoted 12,500 jobs created or protected, but the company already had a large base in the UK that the project would indeed have protected. It appears that the Government&#146;s estimate is based on the unrealistic multiple of four supply chain jobs to every one directly employed job. Most people would regard that as an exaggeration and would consider that a ratio of about 2:1 might be closer to reason.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o339"><a name="90309-0017.htm_para22"><a name="09030933000053">So far, Hitachi has had limited contact with the supply chain network in the UK, and the company has specified that it is in discussion with 20 supply chain operators. The Derby rail forum, which encompasses the supply network in Derby, is far larger than that. Hitachi already has some relationships with Derby-based companies, but it seems most unlikely that the company will be able to achieve an integrated UK supply chain. There is genuine anxiety about where it will serve a large proportion of the high-value supply chain business from.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman is talking about the fact that Hitachi does not have a supply chain in the UK. Does he agree that Bombardier does have a supply chain and that both in Derby, where trains are made and assembled, and in Crewe, where they are overhauled and maintained, we already have skilled work forces available to carry out the work for which Hitachi has been given a contract? Does he agree that awarding the contract to Hitachi does not safeguard jobs in Bombardier?</p>

labour easier and the sourcing of materials and services from which no business derives competitive advantage easier and cheaper, and allows the location of shared infrastructure.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o341"><a name="90309-0018.htm_para1"><a name="09030933000057">The area around Derby is the only major manufacturing centre in the UK for rail technologies. It thus has a test track for vehicles and a large concentration of supply chain businesses. Highly skilled engineers and technologists find a ready market for their skills. Without wishing to be negative, I think Hitachi appears to be considering manufacturing in parts of the country where nobody has manufactured a train for 100 years. If we are to build an internationally competitive railway technology sector, we should ensure that it has critical mass and that it concentrates its capacity as efficiently as possible. There is no case for determining location on the basis of grants that may be available or generalised labour availability.</p>

 My hon. Friend and neighbour will be aware that the town of Ashby-de-la-Zouch has been mooted as one of the three options for assembly&#151;the other two being Sheffield and Gateshead. My hon. Friend is dubious that 12,500 jobs will be created or sustained. Is he also dubious about the figure given by the Government that of the final delivered value about 70 per cent. will be of UK origin?

 I certainly share my hon. Friend and neighbour&#146;s doubts. Much more thorough disclosure is needed of the thinking behind the awarding of the contract. The data issued so far have failed to satisfy most of the questions that could be put, both about labour utilisation and the value of the contracts issued within the UK.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o342"><a name="90309-0018.htm_para2"><a name="09030933000060">The fourth point is that one wonders whether the right choice has been made anyway. The full reasons for awarding the contract to Agility have not been disclosed, but I understand that price was the critical factor. Was it the case that technology differences&#151;for example, the use of lighter vehicles&#151;increased the initial cost of the Bombardier bid? We all accept that constructing lighter vehicles is likely to be more expensive at first, but it might gain greater efficiencies in fuel utilisation over the life of the vehicles. How was that factored into the assessment of the technologies offered by the various bids?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o343"><a name="90309-0018.htm_para3"><a name="09030933000061">Were both bids compliant with the technical specification in the first place? I would welcome a clear analysis of that. Is Hitachi equipped to supply an order of such scale? I understand that it is 12 months behind on a contract delivering trains to Australia, and has subcontracted substantial elements of that work to China. Is that the sort of future that we can expect on the fulfilment of the contract under discussion?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o344"><a name="90309-0018.htm_para4"><a name="09030933000062">The Government have a period to reflect on the contract before committing to it. If they must pursue the Agility tender, they should focus strongly on the manufacturing strategy that was said to lie behind that decision&#151;ensuring high-value manufacturing, access to and exploitation of key technologies, utilisation of existing supply-chain businesses and rational location choice to maximise competitiveness and quality.</p>

 I recognise, as everyone does, that railways are expensive and heavily subsidised. I believe that that is partly a result of the legacy of botched privatisation, about which other Members have spoken, which leaves an unworkable and bizarre structure in place. It leads to unclear accountability, needless friction, short-termism, and virtual private monopolies such as ROSCOs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o345"><a name="90309-0018.htm_para5"><a name="09030933000064">Despite that, we all recognise that railways are needed more than ever&#151;by the traveller, who cannot cope with road congestion; by the environment, which cannot cope with car pollution; and by the economy, given the capacity of railway to transform and boost the local economy. I agree entirely with the hon. Member for Manchester, Blackley (Graham Stringer), who made precisely that point. Like him, I am also concerned that although we appreciate the need for rail, our appreciation of that need is fairly selective.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o346"><a name="90309-0018.htm_para6"><a name="09030933000065">Let us consider rail expansion and investment. London has Docklands light railway, Thameslink and Crossrail. The Government have already made a &#163;5 billion investment in a &#163;15 billion scheme under the most expensive real estate on the entire planet. Millions have been spent on lawyers, millions have been committed to buy off objectors, and millions will be spent on consultants. Hours and hours of Members&#146; time&#151;some of them are present&#151;has already been used up on the project to join Heathrow to Canary Wharf, and to get those financiers, who do us so much good, and some other people, across London a little more quickly.</p>

Some of those will appear&#151;it is a matter of faith with me. But where will they go? Out of the first 1,300, 900 will go to London. London already has an excellent tube system, which is to be completely refurbished&#151;it is a public-private partnership, it is not ideal, and we do have Metronet, but, still, it is being refurbished. London has the best bus service in Europe. If the only problem London has is bendy buses, it is in an enviable position. If the only thing one has to worry about is how much the buses bend, one has worries that other people would be quite happy to have if they had a decent bus service. London will get more and more.</p>

There is not a penny to be spent in extending track in that area&#151;not a foot and not a rail. We struggled to get freight smoothly off Liverpool docks, even though there was an unassailable case for it, and the project would have taken place at first sight in London had it been mooted. We are told that Liverpool Central station in Merseyside is suited to a modern city, although in fact it is an absolute pit and a King&#146;s Cross waiting to happen.</p>

 Well, there you have it. We already have some of the oldest stock in the United Kingdom. We have bus chassis on rail: that is what some of those 142s are. We also have some of the most overcrowded overground trains, particularly those coming out of Manchester. We have critical but entirely soluble snarl-ups on the network, again around Manchester.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o350"><a name="90309-0018.htm_para10"><a name="09030933000071">Ours is a supplicant attitude, evident even in our approach to new schemes. In the north we have good, viable, non-anorak-type schemes, predicated on rational expectation of increased passenger numbers and increased profits&#151;schemes that would genuinely boost local economies. I am thinking of, for instance, the Burscough curves, the Halton curves and the Todmorden curves. All those are do-able with the lawyers&#146; fees, the consultants&#146; fees or the tea money set aside for Crossrail. They are small schemes with big local benefits&#151;genuine benefits.</p>

We know that the chances of the railway raj in London helping us are not that good. We hope that it can be cajoled into possibly doing something some time, although possibly not other things. We compete for attention. The net effect is that our London masters at the Department for Transport say &#147;You cannot expect us to do all these things&#148;, and then do none of them. They carry on laying the track in London, digging the tunnels in London, and spending the billions in London. It is a case of &#147;Divide and rule&#148;.</p>

I could speak, in transport terms, of two nations, north and south. However, I can be proved wrong. All that is needed is for some kindly soul in the Department to show me one yard, or one metre, of new track in the north-west. I do not mind whether it is in Todmorden, Halton or Burscough. I will reduce the demand: I should like a train less than 20 years old to arrive in my own town, at Southport station. But I am not holding my breath.</p>

 I want to explore some ideas about the role that our railways could play to help our country out of recession. The railways are vital economic arteries connecting businesses to markets, and connecting the north and west of the country to London and the south-east. As we heard earlier in the debate, they carry more passengers now than at any time since the second world war. I believe that the Government need to adopt policies that will reinforce the role that the railways can play in helping our country to emerge from recession in three specific ways. First, they need to encourage business confidence, especially in core railway businesses such as the train operating companies, Network Rail, and the infrastructure companies that build, maintain and renew the track. Secondly, they need to ensure best use of our existing assets by means  <br>

of more efficient timetabling. Thirdly, they need to provide as much new investment as possible to stimulate economic activity and safeguard jobs in the industry.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o353"><a name="90309-0018.htm_para13"><a name="09030933000075">These are uncertain economic times, but the Government can boost business confidence during the downturn by creating greater certainty in the industry. As has already been mentioned in the debate, two years ago GNER, a train operating company that was well regarded by both the industry and the passengers who used its services, lost the east coast main line franchise. Its successor, National Express East Coast is doing well, but the hiatus when the GNER franchise collapsed lasted for a year and created uncertainty both in the rail industry and for businesses up and down the east coast line that rely on that railway service to reach their customers and markets.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o354"><a name="90309-0018.htm_para14"><a name="09030933000076">We must remember that GNER was forced out of business, first, because its parent company, Sea Containers, ran into difficult trading conditions in north America, which faced the economic downturn earlier than us in Europe, and secondly, because it faced uncertainty over the competition it had from open-access operators. I would not want National Express East Coast, or any other train-operating company, to go the same way as GNER, so I ask the Government to say this evening what they are doing to reduce the risk of any other franchisee going under during the downturn.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o355"><a name="90309-0018.htm_para15"><a name="09030933000077">The Government must, of course, honour the open-access agreements that have already been agreed&#151;such as the one to Shrewsbury, which we heard about earlier. Grand Central, a York-based company, deserves a return on the investment it has made on a direct service from Sunderland, through intermediate stations, to York and then down to London. However, open-access services are not part of the strategic rail network, unlike franchises. During a downturn, the Government should give priority to the strategic railway, and when line capacity is short, it does not make sense to award a train path to a four or five-carriage open-access train when an eight-carriage franchise train could use the slot.</p>

One of the key criticisms of privatisation was that it would lead to fragmentation, and that has been borne out in practice. We have a less integrated timetable now than we had before privatisation and that was a direct consequence of franchising. The problem has been exacerbated by open-access services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o357"><a name="90309-0018.htm_para17"><a name="09030933000079">Since the Strategic Rail Authority was wound up, there is no office or agency with a strategic responsibility for timetabling. The basic objective of timetabling is to connect point A with point B, with a direct service if possible, and with the fewest number of changes where that is impossible, and for any changes that are necessary to be brisk. It is a simple principle that is used by timetablers in other European countries, but, sadly, not in our country.</p>

Yet its recent decisions on train paths on the east coast main line have enormous implications for the timetable. As a result of awarding additional paths to open-access operators, it has postponed the National Express East Coast franchise commitment to delivering five trains per hour as a standard pattern.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o360"><a name="90309-0018.htm_para20"><a name="09030933000082">Let me give just one example of how railway fragmentation gets in the way of timetabling. The passenger flow by railway between York and Leeds is broadly the same as that between Manchester and Liverpool or Edinburgh and Glasgow, and it needs four trains per hour. Three trains are run at 15-minute intervals by First TransPennine Express and the fourth train is run by CrossCountry, but its train runs in between two of those others and, consequently, there are four trains in half an hour and no trains for the next half hour. Over lunch today, the Secretary of State told me that he would look at these problems.

I am glad that the Government have increased Network Rail&#146;s budget for track renewals over the next five years, but I am extremely concerned that Network Rail is planning to spend less next year on track renewals than it did this year.

Friend the Member for South Derbyshire (Mr. Todd) has questioned whether the three preferred locations&#151;Ashby de la Zouch, Sheffield and Gateshead&#151;are the best places in which to build the trains. The Government should look closely at the location, and the Minister will not be at all surprised when I remind him that there is a perfectly good railway carriage factory in York. If the factory, which is currently used by Network Rail, is unavailable or deemed inappropriate, I should also remind him that the York central site, which abuts the York carriage works and has directly access to the railway, is one of the biggest industrial development sites in Europe and would be an ideal place for a new plant.

 I welcome the opportunity to take part in this debate, because Chelmsford is a significant commuter town for journeys down to London. If one looks on the positive side, one can see that some significant improvements have been made over the past 20 years to the infrastructure and to the services provided to my constituents: in the late 1980s and early 1990s, a multi-million pound redevelopment and enhancement of Liverpool Street station took place; during the 1990s Chelmsford station was rebuilt and significantly improved; and, in addition, improvements have been made to the rolling stock. I recall that 20 years ago one could travel from Chelmsford to Liverpool Street during the day and although it might have been bright and sunny outside, the carriage windows were so dirty that one would have imagined it was late evening. That is a thing of the past, and we have seen real and significant improvements and investment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o363"><a name="90309-0018.htm_para23"><a name="09030933000086">There are, however, downsides that my constituents have to put up with day in, day out, the first of which is significant overcrowding on the trains. Not only is it a safety problem but, to my mind, it is unacceptable that having paid through the nose through the fare structure for the service down to Liverpool Street, they all too often cannot find a seat during the rush hours in the morning and in the late afternoon and early evening. My solution would be to have longer trains with more carriages during that period to take the overcrowding and to ameliorate that problem. Too little is being done at the moment to solve the problem.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o364"><a name="90309-0018.htm_para24"><a name="09030933000087">The other issue of grave concern is rail fares. Because commuters are a captive audience it seems that there are significant increases in fares over and above the rate of inflation, so that the price of an annual season ticket for people going down to London to work makes up an exorbitant part of their salaries. Something has to be done to ensure that people get a fair deal and value for money and that they do not have to pay through the nose, year in, year out. It will be extremely interesting at the back end of this year and the beginning of next year to see what the annual increase in fares will be given the fact that the retail prices index, as opposed to the consumer prices index, is now at 0.1 per cent. on an annual basis&#151;the first time that we have had that situation in living memory and beyond. The regulator and the powers that be that set the fares have to think again in this unusual time of extremely low inflation to ensure that hard-pressed commuters are not penalised once more and that they do not have to pay through the nose.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o365"><a name="90309-0018.htm_para25"><a name="09030933000088">The other issue that I want to raise tonight is the fact that, on environmental grounds, it would be sensible to build a new station on the outskirts of Chelmsford, somewhere between north Springfield and Boreham, to stop all those motorists who travel into Chelmsford to get the train into London when they do not live in Chelmsford. They come from the Dengie peninsula and from areas north of Chelmsford, up near Braintree and Witham and beyond. If they could go to a station there, that would relieve the traffic in the centre of the town and would provide a steadier and more responsible way of people getting on to and alighting from trains. That proposal is in the Chelmsford borough council structure plan. We can argue about and discuss exactly where a  <br>

They should not have to suffer, yet again, a significant increase in the fares that they have to pay without a significant improvement in the quality of the service. Severe disruptions happen too often. Sometimes, to be fair to the rail provider, those disruptions are not due to the provider but to vandalism, but we need to ensure that the overall service improves. We need to ensure that the work on the overhead electrification cables, which involves investment to replace infrastructure that is 20 years-plus old and that is out of date, is enhanced and moved along the line towards Chelmsford and beyond to Colchester more quickly and that the plans for the timetable ensure that we can all benefit from those improvements.</p>

 I welcome this debate. I want to concentrate principally on the issue of investment in high-speed rail networks, as did my hon. Friend the Member for Manchester, Blackley (Graham Stringer). To some extent, I want to make common cause with my friend from the other side of the Pennines, unusual though that may seem.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o369"><a name="90309-0019.htm_para0"><a name="09030933000097">It was good to hear recent announcements about the formation of the High Speed 2 company, and I am sure that we all await further statements on that topic with interest. Of course, anyone could be forgiven for finding it difficult to accept that further high-speed networks will be built until we actually see the relevant signatures on the dotted lines. To be honest, our country&#146;s history has, for decades, been one of short-term decisions at the expense of long-term investments. As Steve Richards of <i> The Guardian</i> said recently, there has been a &#147;perverse indifference&#148; on the issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o370"><a name="90309-0019.htm_para1"><a name="09030933000098">However, the Government appear to be on the verge of doing something bold and exciting, and I can only urge our Ministers to stick with their instincts, and to deliver what it appears that they are promising to deliver as soon as they can. That we have moved to such a position is, in many ways, quite an achievement, given where we were only a short time ago. The Eddington report, for instance, argued that economic returns from high-speed rail in the UK were unlikely to be as large as  <br>

returns on investments in alternative projects. Eddington argued that that was due to the compact geography of the UK and an extensive air network, among other things, but many disagreed with him, and their contributions to the debate have helped to lead us where we are today. Public opinion is more aligned towards the progressive position than it has been for some years, and recognises that it is right to challenge aviation as the principal means of travelling within the country. I support the third runway at Heathrow, but it is absolutely right that we challenge aviation and provide a greener alternative wherever we can.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o371"><a name="90309-0019.htm_para2"><a name="09030933000099">The Atkins report argued that the economic benefit to the UK of high-speed rail would be &#163;63 billion, and the Commission for Integrated Transport made a significant contribution to the debate. The well-respected Professor David Begg argued that</p>

<a name="90309-0019.htm_brev1"><a name="09030933000119"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;essential if we are to deal with capacity constraints that are building up on our intercity network.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o373"><a name="90309-0019.htm_para4"><a name="09030933000101">That point was well made earlier by my hon. Friend the Member for Manchester, Blackley. In other words, the capacity that was apparent in the 1970s and 1980s has been soaked up.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o374"><a name="90309-0019.htm_para5"><a name="09030933000102">One option for dealing with the lack of capacity on the network would be to price passengers off the trains. It is clearly an option, and it may well be the chosen route of the train operators, but I believe, as do most progressive thinkers, that that would not be the right way forward. It would make much more sense to invest in new capacity and so free up capacity on our existing network. Given the increasing pressure on our highway network, would it not make much more sense to get more passengers and more freight off our roads and on to our trains? After all, as Professor Begg has pointed out, increasing congestion on our roads is leading to reductions in average travel speeds, and that, of course, has a negative impact on economic activity. Surely common sense, if nothing else, needs to prevail; we need to recognise that the only way out of the situation is to build more and&#151;this is the key point&#151;better railway capacity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o375"><a name="90309-0019.htm_para6"><a name="09030933000103">The Northern Way is the other organisation that has made the case for high-speed networks for both the east and west. I now come to the point on which I do not entirely agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Manchester, Blackley. The Northern Way&#151;a group of regional development agencies&#151;argues that we need high-speed routes up the east and west coasts, linked by the trans-Pennine route. It predicts that such an investment would have an economic impact of &#163;10 billion on the economy of the north.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o376"><a name="90309-0019.htm_para7"><a name="09030933000104">All in all, then, there is a powerful economic case for high-speed rail, which could help to rebalance our economy by encouraging the integration of our regional economies. As I pointed out in a debate in Westminster Hall the other week, we talk a lot nowadays about rebalancing our economy by developing our manufacturing base, but I believe strongly that we need to do so by considering not just whether we need more manufacturing and less of a financial services sector, but whether we develop the economy of the north and the rest of the country, and balance those regions with London and the south-east.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o377"><a name="90309-0019.htm_para8"><a name="09030933000105">However, the environmental case is powerful too, for only a reliable fast rail network offering a comfortable journey at a reasonable price will be able to compete against the car and the plane. I echo entirely the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Carlisle (Mr. Martlew) about the inconsistencies and the difficulties experienced by passengers in getting the best deal on the trains, and the disincentive that the current fare structure presents for people who make a last-minute decision to hop on a train. They find it much easier to get in the car to make that journey, because the cost of travelling on the train at the last minute is prohibitively high.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o378"><a name="90309-0019.htm_para9"><a name="09030933000106">A modal shift is critical to our environmental and economic future, and I therefore call on Ministers to commit the Government to this vision for our rail network. Economically, socially and environmentally, that is the right thing to do. That vision should include in the first phase of High Speed 2 the reopening of the trans-Pennine link, preferably based, as everyone would expect me to say, on the reopening of the Woodhead line.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o379"><a name="90309-0019.htm_para10"><a name="09030933000107">The Woodhead line runs deep in the hearts of most railway commentators. I have had letters from up and down the country on that subject. It was the first line in the country to be electrified and it provides a fast link of just 35 minutes between Sheffield and Manchester. It would be the best option environmentally for a new trans-Pennine link because the environmental impact of reopening that line would be much less than that of building a brand new link between, say, Manchester and Sheffield, or elsewhere.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o380"><a name="90309-0019.htm_para11"><a name="09030933000108">There are other things that we need to do. Before we start investing in the high-speed network, we need, for instance, to sort out the logistical problems that dog Manchester&#146;s rail network. It might seem strange that a Member representing Sheffield should support Manchester in wanting to get its problems sorted, but the problems of Manchester impact on every major city in the north. We need the Manchester hub, and we need it quickly. Progress in the north cannot move forward much further until that is resolved.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o381"><a name="90309-0019.htm_para12"><a name="09030933000109">We need the electrification of lines such as the Great Western and midland main line, in order to bring cities such as Leicester, Derby and Sheffield closer to London as soon as possible. The journey takes 2 hours 7 minutes at best from Sheffield to London, but Sheffield is the UK&#146;s fourth largest city. We could bring the journey time below 2 hours, but there are still certain times of the day when it is more like 3 hours. We need to make progress in that respect.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o382"><a name="90309-0019.htm_para13"><a name="09030933000110">In conclusion, although I welcome many of the proposals to improve rail services in the medium to long term, there are many things that the Department for Transport can do in the short term. By improving the quality of stations and providing safety and disability access measures, we can improve the travelling experience for train passengers. I commend my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for making available &#163;35 million for such upgrades. I am delighted that upgrades are in the pipeline for stations on the much used Huddersfield to Sheffield line, which is one of those sardine tin lines that is packed for most of the time that the rolling stock is in operation. Investment is promised for Penistone, Silkstone Common and Dodworth. More of this type of short-term investment would be good for our railways and provide a useful stimulus to our ailing economy.</p>

 I will be as brief as I can. As part of the argument for an expansion of the rail network, I draw attention to the Ashington, Blyth and Tyne railway line, which is a fully maintained, operational, mostly double-track freight line that last saw regular passenger services in the 1960s. It forms an important part of our regional network. The main trunk runs from Newcastle through Northumberland Park, which has a Metro station connection, then to Seghill, Seaton Delaval, Newsham&#151;for Blyth&#151;Bebside, Bedlington and Ashington. There is a further branch, which runs from Bedlington, through Choppington, connecting back to the east coast main line at Morpeth. There are other freight branches to the Alcan aluminium smelter and the port of Blyth.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o384"><a name="90309-0019.htm_para15"><a name="09030933000113">Supported by other funding partners, the North East assembly has already completed a technical report into restoring passenger rail services on the line. The report concluded that there would be a one-off cost of &#163;4.1 million and an annual operating subsidy of only &#163;50,000 per annum for an hourly service to Newcastle until early evening&#151;or of &#163;100,000 per annum for a half-hourly service until midnight, which is our preferred option. No extra rolling stock would be required as, instead of waiting 30 minutes at Morpeth, the train would continue along the line to Bedlington. That would double the train frequency and provide a service until midnight for both Cramlington and Morpeth.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o385"><a name="90309-0019.htm_para16"><a name="09030933000114">The proposal to open the main section of Ashington to Newcastle via Northumberland Park was the subject of a technical study funded by Nexus. It concluded that an hourly service was easily achievable in addition to existing freight traffic. The study did not examine capital costs, revenue or operating costs, but as Ashington is a much larger community than Bedlington and its station is in a prime town centre position, it can be assumed that patronage and revenues would be much higher if Ashington were included.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o386"><a name="90309-0019.htm_para17"><a name="09030933000115">A Network Rail guide to railway investment projects 3 study, or GRIP 3 study, into restoring passenger rail services from the Metro centre outside Newcastle into Ashington has just started. At the same time, a freight operator has requested a study into significantly increasing freight movement on that line. A new coal-fired power station is proposed for north Blyth; it would require 6 million tonnes of coal per year and approximately 3 million tonnes of that would come in on the rail line.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o387"><a name="90309-0019.htm_para18"><a name="09030933000116">I conclude by asking the Minister to consider the request to reopen the railway to passenger rail services and by informing the House that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has agreed to visit Ashington and Bedlington to see for himself the benefits that that would bring.</p>

in dedicated rail freight and in infrastructure linking the channel tunnel to Glasgow. With colleagues from the rail and haulage industries, I have been supporting the EuroRail freight route scheme for some time. We have a detailed, worked-out scheme, and I am glad to say that we have put it directly to the Secretary of State and the Minister with responsibility for railways. They know the detail.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o388"><a name="90309-0019.htm_para19"><a name="09030941000023">I want to emphasise that the issue of rail freight is underplayed by the Government. The rail White Paper allocated only &#163;200 million for rail freight over a five-year period. That is a tiny amount of money&#151;just one eightieth of the proposed spending on Crossrail, one fortieth of what has been spent on west coast main line modernisation and half of what will be spent on modernising Birmingham New Street station. It is a tiny amount, and the Government are not taking rail freight seriously.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o389"><a name="90309-0019.htm_para20"><a name="09030941000024">If we want those major economic regions in Scotland, the north and the midlands to be linked to the continent of Europe, a dedicated rail freight line going through the channel tunnel to those regions is vital. The existing routes cannot take double-stack containers and most cannot take full-size containers. They cannot take lorries on trains. They will not be used by hauliers without regular services accessible through terminals close to motorways; hauliers could load their lorries and get them delivered to Dortmund, Rome or wherever the next day. That is what we need and we have to invest in it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o390"><a name="90309-0019.htm_para21"><a name="09030941000025">We estimate that our detailed scheme would cost &#163;4 billion&#151;a tiny fraction of what would be spent on a high-speed passenger service and of what is being spent on many other schemes. I would have liked much longer to speak about the scheme. I have just touched on it, but I hope that the Minister will take note.</p>

I hope that he might answer some of those in his speech. Tonight we have had the chance to range a little more widely.</p>

I understand that these estimates involve Government guarantees against London and Continental Railways, Network Rail debt issuance and the Air Travel Trust fund. To enable the House to assess the risks attached, can the Minister confirm when those guarantees were put in place, for how long they will extend, and what risk analysis has been undertaken; and will he put into the Library the probability analysis that was undertaken by the Department prior to making a risk assessment?</p>

The White Paper&#146;s dismissal of high-speed rail and electrification has been rendered obsolete by the Government&#146;s U-turns. On high-speed rail, the new Minister of State has clearly reversed the catastrophic opposition of the then Secretary of State. It is a shame that the Government&#146;s plans for high-speed rail are rather less extensive than those announced by the Conservatives. The plans are so far uncosted, and we do not know where the trains are going to start from or go to.</p>

 My hon.

 Does my hon. Friend not think that it is a badge of shame for this Government that when questioned last year it would seem that not one civil servant in the Department for Transport was allocated the task of looking at high-speed rail? In fact, after 11 years of Labour Government, we have just 113 km of high-speed rail, while France has 1,900 km.</p>

<p><a name="st_o330"><a name="09030941000040"><a name="90309-0019.htm_spnew10"><a name="09030941000227"><b>Stephen Hammond:</b>
 Indeed I do. The fact that no civil servants were looking at high-speed rail was confirmed by the then Minister responsible for rail, the hon. Member for Glasgow, South (Mr. Harris). My hon. Friend&#146;s point is absolutely accurate, and like him I might conclude that the Government have finally joined us in our far-sighted policy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o398"><a name="90309-0019.htm_para29"><a name="09030941000041">The capacity shortage on the network should be the top priority for the industry. The Government&#146;s attempts to tackle the shortage have been misguided and totally inadequate, which was borne out by the evidence taken by the Select Committee. In its report, the Committee said that it was concerned that the Government were failing to deal with the concerns of the industry. It recommended that the Department revise its method of costing rail patronage, and it said that the Government&#146;s approach to increasing rail capacity is over-cautious. That may be one word for it, but I bet that the commuters from the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for West Chelmsford (Mr. Burns), of whose struggle he spoke so eloquently, do not use the word &#147;over-cautious&#148;. A stronger, more unified strategy for tackling overcrowding and keeping costs down is urgently required. That will help to take the pressure off rising fares, and more importantly, it would drive better value for money for the fare payer, the taxpayer and the traveller.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o399"><a name="90309-0019.htm_para30"><a name="09030941000042">Hon. Members have raised a number of points tonight, but we have spent a lot of time listening to comments about the extra carriages, which are clearly the key to delivering extra capacity in the short term. The high-level output specification outlined 1,300 extra carriages, and we would welcome that. But are they new? How many of them are new? How many are cascaded? How many of them have actually been ordered? Will Thameslink phase 1 be delayed? How many carriages will be delivered and when? The process is close to a shambles.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o400"><a name="90309-0020.htm_para0"><a name="09030941000043">On 12 February, the Under-Secretary of State for Transport, the hon. Member for Gillingham (Paul Clark) said that all of the carriages would be in operation by 2014, but let me illustrate the shambles that the Government have made of this matter. Last week, I had a response to a written question to the Secretary of State. I asked him the timetable for ordering the remaining 877 carriages, which were referred to in the 2007 White Paper. Some 423 have so far been ordered. I was told in the answer that the new train orders will be placed as follows:   <br>


<meta name="Date" content="9 Mar 2009">

<notus-date day="9" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><b>9 Mar 2009 : Column 120</b><br>
120 for National Express East Anglia, 88 for London Midland, 202 for GoCo, 140 for South West Trains and up to 1,300 for Thameslink. That is all very well, and superficially that answer might sound sensible. However, the Minister will remember that his predecessor told us that the Thameslink vehicles were not part of HLOS. When I asked the Minister about the 877 vehicles that had not been ordered, he detailed only 550. According to the rolling stock plan, South West Trains was to have only 105, not the 140 specified in that answer, so perhaps the Minister would care to tell us which is correct, his answer or the rolling stock plan. As the hon. Member for Southport (Dr. Pugh) said, there has also been a change in the rolling stock plan for the vehicles that were due to go to Northern Rail.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o401"><a name="90309-0020.htm_para1"><a name="09030941000044">Will the Minister clarify which of the class 323 carriages will be new and which will be cascaded, and to which operators? I still do not believe that anyone knows what the promise of 1,300 carriages really means. Even by the Department for Transport&#146;s lamentably low standards of responses to questions, the one that I have mentioned must be regarded as inadequate and poor.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o402"><a name="90309-0020.htm_para2"><a name="09030941000045">The shambles is further highlighted by an answer that the noble Lord Adonis gave. He stated:</p>
<a name="90309-0020.htm_brev0"><a name="09030941000169"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The Department for Transport does not determine the amount of rolling stock for First Great Western...or any other train operator.&#148;&#151;[<i> Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 4 November 2008; Vol. 705, c. WA43.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o403"><a name="90309-0020.htm_para3"><a name="09030941000046">That is palpably absurd, because the Under-Secretary of State for Transport, the hon. Member for Gillingham, gave me a written answer that contradicts it. It is nonsense also because the Department now has an updated rolling stock plan which, as Lord Adonis concluded in the same answer, envisages an extra 52 carriages for First Great Western. In one sentence he said that the Government did not intend to tell any operator where carriages should go or how many they should have, and later in the answer he told us exactly how many First Great Western would have. The DFT is controlling procurement, and it is doing so shambolically. Will the Minister clarify exactly where all the carriages have gone?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o404"><a name="90309-0020.htm_para4"><a name="09030941000047">A number of contributions to the debate have been about the inter-city express programme. The Minister might at least explain something about that. When the Secretary of State announced the IEP, he talked about the 12,500 jobs that would be safeguarded or created. Hitachi has confirmed that its initial investment in the United Kingdom will create 200 jobs, which is likely to rise to 500. To be generous, there might be 2,000 maintenance jobs. That makes 2,500 of the 12,500. When my hon. Friend the Member for Chipping Barnet asked the Secretary of State on 12 February whether he could explain where the other 10,000 would come from and how many of them would actually be created or safeguarded, there was no answer. The suspicion across the House and among the railway commentariat is that, like so much of the Government&#146;s policy, those 10,000 jobs are actually just another incidence of double counting.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o405"><a name="90309-0020.htm_para5"><a name="09030941000048">There have been speeches about high-speed rail in the debate. For far too long it was absolutely clear that the Government had no interest in high-speed rail. When the right hon. Member for Bolton, West (Ruth Kelly) was Secretary of State, she said that it was &#147;risky and expensive&#148; and would not help to meet passenger   <br>

demand. That was clearly seen to be wrong, and how things have changed, led by the Conservatives&#146; innovative announcement last week. I am pleased to see that the Government have finally seen the light, and I welcome the fact that the hon. Member for Manchester, Blackley (Graham Stringer) has been converted to our policy and supports the Conservative party&#146;s plans for high-speed rail to be built, in phase 1, from London to Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds, and then in later phases across the whole country.</p>

 We have had a wide-ranging debate, with substantial contributions from many hon. Members. However, it is interesting that, at the outset of his speech, the hon. Member for Wimbledon (Stephen Hammond) could not bring himself to acknowledge the work of the Transport Committee or to congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Liverpool, Riverside (Mrs. Ellman) on her work as Chair. I would like to put my congratulations to her on the record.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o407"><a name="90309-0020.htm_para7"><a name="09030941000051">Contributions included bids for additional funding in several different ways and bids for investment in specific constituencies, which is understandable. Some contributions frankly disregarded any changes in the past 10 years or any improvements to our rail system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o408"><a name="90309-0020.htm_para8"><a name="09030941000052">We all know that good transport networks are essential to people&#146;s everyday lives and to the health of the UK economy. That remains true, especially in today&#146;s challenging economic conditions. That is why the Government remain committed to substantial investment in our transport system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o409"><a name="90309-0020.htm_para9"><a name="09030941000053">We have therefore led and promoted several major long-term infrastructure projects, which will provide a major boost to our economy. We are investing &#163;15 billion between 2009 and 2014 to increase capacity for up to 183 million passengers a year. For the long term, our aim is a rail network that can carry double the current number of passengers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o410"><a name="90309-0020.htm_para10"><a name="09030941000054">However, in spite of the record investment, people&#146;s increasing demand for travel means that in many places, our transport infrastructure is operating at, or near capacity. We need not only to address the problem, but to do so in an environmentally sustainable manner.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o411"><a name="90309-0020.htm_para11"><a name="09030941000055">Rail already has an impressive and established record of being a highly sustainable form of transport. Carbon emissions from rail are around a third of those for road transport. Electric trains in particular are not only cheaper to operate than diesels, but emit far less carbon. That is one reason for the further work on the case for electrifying the busiest parts of our network, including the Great Western main line and the midland main line, with decisions to be announced later this year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o412"><a name="90309-0020.htm_para12"><a name="09030941000056">Some hon. Members referred to times gone by. Thirty years ago, the railway was being written off as an expensive, outdated and declining mode of transport.  <br>

Times change&#151;thanks to the substantial investment that we have made, Britain&#146;s railways have enjoyed a spectacular renaissance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o413"><a name="90309-0020.htm_para13"><a name="09030941000057">Some hon. Members claimed that the railways had improved because of privatisation. I well remember in 1997 that the railway lines in my neck of the woods suffered from gross under-investment, were unreliable and had rolling stock from the 1960s and 1970s. <i> [Interruption.</i><i> ] </i>That is not nonsense.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o414"><a name="90309-0020.htm_para14"><a name="09030941000058">Our rail network now carries more people and more freight than at any time in the past 50 years, and performance continues to improve. In the past year, 90.8 per cent. of passenger trains arrived on time. It is important that that improvement continues. The Government have, therefore, specified an improvement in reliability to 92.6 per cent. by 2014. In addition, we are specifying 25 per cent. reductions in delays of more than 30 minutes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o415"><a name="90309-0020.htm_para15"><a name="09030941000059">As I said, passenger numbers have grown around 40 per cent in the past 10 years. That is why we are going to such lengths to upgrade existing track. We want to tackle the major problems that we identified for the control period to 2014: overcrowding and capacity. That is our main focus between now and 2014, and that is why we have upgraded the existing track, such as on the west coast main line, as well as investing in new trains. <i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> I will come shortly to the number of carriages, which was raised by the hon. Member for Wimbledon and others.</p>

Crossrail will give commuters to the east and west of London direct access to the heart of the capital and mean that 1.5 million more people will be within an hour of London&#146;s business centres.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o417"><a name="90309-0020.htm_para17"><a name="09030941000061">Some 1,300 extra carriages are to come into service between now and 2014. The hon. Member for Lewes (Norman Baker) referred to the grotesque shortage of rolling stock, as did the hon. Member for Shrewsbury and Atcham (Daniel Kawczynski). Those 1,300 extra carriages will go to some of the areas suffering from the worst overcrowding; indeed, 423 additional carriages have already been ordered, before the control period has even started. That is a sign of the Government&#146;s decision to press on with procurement. All those carriages will be in place by 2014.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o418"><a name="90309-0020.htm_para18"><a name="09030941000062">I can confirm that the 423 new carriages to be delivered between 2009 and 2011 will be distributed as follows: 92 to Southern; 217 to London Midland; eight to Chiltern; and 106 to Virgin West Coast. That means that 423 have already been ordered. Invitations to tender have been issued for a further 320 vehicles and officials are currently in commercial discussions with train operating companies to secure the remainder, after which we will announce where those additional carriages will go.</p>

The benefit for passengers will be substantial, with more 21 per cent. more seats available on longer trains and shorter journeys. Typically, the journey time will be shortened between London and Leeds by 10 minutes, between London and Edinburgh by 12 minutes and between London and Bristol by 10 minutes.</p>

However, I would say to right hon. and hon. Members that safeguarding jobs is as important as getting new jobs. It is important that we ensure that those jobs remain. It is not a question of the Government micro-managing the process, because there is substantial work to be done, never mind the long time that it takes to design and deliver the programme. Indeed, the trains will be used by a number of different operators.</p>

 I will not give way, because I wish to cover a number of points, including some that relate to the hon. Gentleman&#146;s contribution.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o426"><a name="90309-0020.htm_para26"><a name="09030941000076">The disruption experienced by passengers and freight customers on the west coast main line in early January last year was unacceptable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o427"><a name="90309-0020.htm_para27"><a name="09030941000077">A number of Members asked questions about the bonuses for Network Rail. They are a matter for the company&#146;s remuneration committee, and not for the Government. They are set out in accordance with criteria set out in the management incentive plan. Having said that, my noble Friend, Lord Adonis said in another place:</p>
<a name="90309-0020.htm_brev2"><a name="09030941000171"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;I am sure that that House would expect Network Rail&#146;s remuneration committee to be mindful of the public mood on bonuses and not to award bonuses that the travelling public would consider unjustified by their own experience of Network Rail&#146;s performance.&#148;&#151;[<i> Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 2 March 2009; Vol. 708, c. 498.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o428"><a name="90309-0020.htm_para28"><a name="09030941000078">Questions were raised about the economic downturn. It is bound to affect passenger numbers, but, thanks to record levels of growth and investment, we are confident that the rail industry can remain competitive in these challenging circumstances. However, under the current regulatory system, the risks and rewards of the rail industry are shared between the operators and the Government. Most franchises are set up to ensure that operators are supported during periods of economic slowdown and, in turn, share their profits with the Government at times of strong economic growth. I would say in response to my hon. Friend the Member for Liverpool, Riverside that the independent Office of Rail Regulation has robust powers to enforce the licences of Network Rail and the train operators. On track maintenance, I can assure the House that we are carrying out careful inspection to ensure that track renewals undertaken by the private contractors meet the required standards.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o429"><a name="90309-0020.htm_para29"><a name="09030941000079">A number of Members raised questions about the regulation of fares. We have already made it clear that, come January next year, the use of the retail prices index plus 1 formula, and the impact of a negative RPI in July, means that we will allow fare prices to fall. This was confirmed by my noble Friend Lord Adonis.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o430"><a name="90309-0020.htm_para30"><a name="09030941000080">In conclusion, we have a rail network that has been a remarkable success story over the past 10 years, with more passenger numbers than at any time since the second world war and regular investment. I commend the estimates.</p>

 I am grateful for the opportunity to debate an industry that was such an integral part of my life before I entered the House. The debate is long overdue and it is with a sense of sadness that I feel it necessary to highlight the continuing dire state of the UK construction and housing industry. I declare an interest as I remain a director of a building supply company and have worked in the construction and housing industry for more than 30 years in various roles.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o463"><a name="90309-0021.htm_para27"><a name="09030941000120">The construction industry has more than 250,000 businesses employing more than 2 million people in the UK and has a turnover of about &#163;6 billion a year. We have the second largest industry output in the European Union and we all know and appreciate the role played by infrastructure in the UK&#146;s progress in recent years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o464"><a name="90309-0021.htm_para28"><a name="09030941000121">That is not the only story, however. There are vital subsets to the construction industry: for example, construction product companies have an annual turnover of more than &#163;40 billion and employ more than 650,000 people in more than 30,000 companies. In Scotland, almost 12 per cent. of the work force are employed in construction and building-related activities, and further decline would have a profound impact on Scotland in general.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o465"><a name="90309-0021.htm_para29"><a name="09030941000122">Last July, I wrote to both the Prime Minister and the Chancellor of the Exchequer to outline my concerns about the perilous state of the UK housing and construction industry. Sadly, those concerns have turned into reality; they are still with us today and there is little sign of improvement. It is important to understand that the housing industry has always built speculatively and not to order. Only by speculation can businesses provide continuous employment. The situation is little different from that of the car market, where mass production is not to order. In the housing industry, such speculation has stopped. The sector has lost jobs at an alarming rate, affecting the supply side, design and manufacture, road haulage and even council planning departments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o466"><a name="90309-0021.htm_para30"><a name="09030941000123">Past downturns have been different from that which we experience today. In Scotland, the industry has not experienced the highs seen in the south of England, but to some extent it has not experienced the same lows either. Arguably, that put Scotland in an advantageous position as part of the UK, as the situation was less volatile and a little more predictable, but not this time. The whole developed world has suffered a financial earthquake simultaneously, and no one was prepared. Almost overnight, credit lines were stopped. Major developers such as Barratt, Taylor Wimpey and Persimmon cut jobs as early as last summer. Speculative house building is virtually dead. Moreover, stock of completed housing units is reducing in value, and land values are plummeting.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o467"><a name="90309-0022.htm_para0"><a name="09030941000124">The construction industry is vital in delivering our new infrastructure. If there is no construction industry, there is no new infrastructure. There is a huge threat to the future of the construction industry, especially the housing industry, in the UK. Private finance initiatives or public-private partnership contracts created a boost  <br>

to the construction sector, with schools and hospitals the length and breadth of the UK being improved or newly built. The importance of public spending in a recession therefore becomes even more crucial. With the Scottish Executive delaying the process in search of a new name for PPP or PFI, however, there will not be a continuous flow of contracts in Scotland. That will not only harm the industry but delay the modernisation of our public estate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o468"><a name="90309-0022.htm_para1"><a name="09030941000125">On a wider scale, we need the new buildings, roads, railways and stations to remain competitive. Infrastructure is the key consideration for businesses when they want to relocate. In Clackmannanshire in my constituency, towns such as Alloa have been opened up with the construction of the eastern approach road, the reopening of the railway link to Stirling, and the construction of the Clackmannanshire bridge. The last batch of Labour&#146;s approved contracts are nearing completion, and Scottish construction companies look into the void in search of the next project, more in despair than hope. Government action is important in all areas of the UK, and spending from this Parliament is still strong. But we need clarity on the new projects being brought forward, and action is demanded in Scotland, not political posturing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o469"><a name="90309-0022.htm_para2"><a name="09030941000126">Although there is a huge responsibility on Government shoulders to bring forward infrastructure projects, responsibility also falls on the banks to lend at reasonable rates. That lending is required to allow developers to create the infrastructure that our economy will need to rebuild after the downturn, both to allow us to compete and to provide the housing and social environments that the country needs. Reasonable lending is not 7 per cent. above base rate, but that is becoming the norm. Lenders can make any deal competitive if they are all offering it, but that does not make it morally or financially right.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o470"><a name="90309-0022.htm_para3"><a name="09030941000127">Of equal importance, funding is required for potential home buyers. We need to be much bolder in our action and force all the banks to lend again at reasonable rates to encourage spending. I urge Ministers to look again at recommendations to intervene in the mortgage market by guaranteeing &#163;100 billion of mortgage-backed securities this year and next. Perhaps that will be part of the Chancellor&#146;s Budget next month; my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary can take that back to the Chancellor as part of my shopping list from tonight.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o471"><a name="90309-0022.htm_para4"><a name="09030941000128">I want to spend another minute or two on mortgages. First, on deposits&#151;or in sector speak, loan to value&#151;not long ago the financial sector was offering mortgages of 100, 110 and 120 per cent. of the value of properties. It is still possible today to get a 100 per cent. mortgage. Plainly, that was and is madness. Lest anyone think that I absolve the individuals from responsibility, I do not. Individuals who used such vehicles have a responsibility, but so does the financial sector. We did not ask the financial sector to create such products; it created them and offered them to individuals on the clear understanding that lenders were content that individuals could afford them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o472"><a name="90309-0022.htm_para5"><a name="09030941000129">In general, however, that madness has now gone full circle. Most products now demand a large deposit: 20, 25 or 30 per cent. Why? Could it be that the lenders really have individuals&#146; best interests at heart, and want to ensure that we can all cope with our repayments? I do not think so. If those were the banks&#146; true concerns, they would help by passing on the full falls in interest  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="9 Mar 2009">

rates that have been generated recently. I believe that they are protecting their own backs against possible further falls in house values. However, for the industry the solution is simple. We must return to widely available 90 per cent. mortgages if we are to have any hope of saving the industry.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o473"><a name="90309-0022.htm_para6"><a name="09030941000130">We have all seen and, I hope, welcomed the recent commitments from Northern Rock, the Royal Bank of Scotland and, last week, Lloyds Banking Group to increasing their home lending this year and next, but it really is a case of &#147;Increase it from what?&#148;. Northern Rock is to increase lending by &#163;14 billion over the next two years. RBS and Lloyds are to increase theirs by &#163;9 billion and &#163;6 billion respectively over the same period. That is a total of &#163;29 billion over two years. Let me put that into perspective.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o474"><a name="90309-0022.htm_para7"><a name="09030941000131">According to the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, new home-buying inquiries are at their highest level since October 2006, yet the number of home purchase loans fell to 516,000 in 2008&#151; their lowest level since 1974&#151;down 49 per cent. on 2000. In January 2009, total mortgage lending was estimated at &#163;12.4 billion for that month. It may be said that that is quite a sum, but it is 52 per cent. less than the figure for January 2008, which was about &#163;25 billion. The commitment of &#163;29 billion over two years is arguably needed over a single month.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o475"><a name="90309-0022.htm_para8"><a name="09030941000132">Sadly, we have not yet seen any move in the sector to affordable loans demanding, say, 10 per cent. deposits filtering through to the consumer. Quite the contrary, indeed. There are 1,398 different mortgage deals available today, but two thirds of them demand a minimum 25 per cent. deposit, and the number demanding a 15 per cent. deposit has risen by nearly 8 per cent. in the last month alone. Deals demanding 10 per cent. deposits are becoming scarcer rather than more available: 101 deals are on offer, compared with 120 last month and nearly 1,200 a year ago. The deals that are available for 10 per cent. depositors carry a penalty. They have an average fixed rate of 6.31 per cent.&#151;whereas someone with a 40 per cent. deposit can secure an average rate of 4.84 per cent.&#151;and they are often subject to significant arrangement fees, which are very clever marketing tools not to sell a product. Let me pose a question to my hon. Friend the Minister. What can he do about a state-funded lender such as HBOS, which since the first quarter of this year will lend only 80 per cent. of the value of any new-build property?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o476"><a name="90309-0022.htm_para9"><a name="09030941000133">Ninety per cent. mortgages will help the housing sector, but it does not stop there. When people buy new cars, what do they do? Nothing other than put fuel in them and drive them, which is what they did with their old cars. People who buy new houses spend additional money. Any high street retailer will confirm that a buoyant housing market, new or second-hand, fuels spending on the high street. New home owners buy carpets, fixtures and fittings, curtains, white goods, furniture and so on. It is the only industry of which I am aware that directly feeds spending in other sectors.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o477"><a name="90309-0022.htm_para10"><a name="09030941000134">Here is an interesting figure. In 2007, there were 357,800 first-time buyers. The Halifax has produced data suggesting that the cost of furnishing and equipping a new property is around &#163;6,000, which equates to about &#163;2.14 billion of high street spending by first-time  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="9 Mar 2009">

buyers alone. That, to my mind, is quite a fiscal stimulus, but we need to get people into those homes to trigger such a stimulus.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o478"><a name="90309-0022.htm_para11"><a name="09030941000135">As I said earlier, there is still a huge demand for housing, social and private. Nearly 500,000 people in Scotland are on local authority and housing association waiting lists for affordable homes, and with Scotland needing an extra 17,000 houses per year to meet rising demand, the mortgage situation is bound to have a serious impact. While I give the Government the benefit of the doubt when it comes to whether they grasp the importance of the home-buyer&#146;s effect on the high street, the banks have moved from one extreme to the other.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o479"><a name="90309-0022.htm_para12"><a name="09030941000136">Shared equity schemes are valuable and have a role to play, and the home buy direct programme will, I hope, be of significant help, but such schemes depend on how the lender views the share. If a 30 per cent. state-funded and industry-funded shared equity scheme is available, it is no good for the lender to demand a 25 per cent. deposit on the remaining 70 per cent.; that defeats the purpose. I acknowledge the steps taken to extend the Government&#146;s shared ownership programme and the &#163;270 million being allocated through the Housing Corporation&#151;and the new clearing house with &#163;200 million to allow developers to sell unsold stock for use as affordable housing is to be applauded when it delivers genuine results.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o480"><a name="90309-0022.htm_para13"><a name="09030941000137">The industry itself has many shared equity schemes, and I am advised of one developer whose company held &#163;1 million of shared equity. Obviously, there was a need to turn that into capital, but when the markets were approached, the best offer he got was &#163;400,000. Why? Because the markets said it would be worth &#163;1 million in 10 years&#146; time, but not today. The truly sad thing was that he was thinking about taking that offer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o481"><a name="90309-0022.htm_para14"><a name="09030941000138">I would like my hon. Friend the Minister to take away another point for the Chancellor. We could invest in building 100,000 new social rented homes over the next two years, with an investment of &#163;6.4 billion, which could be a tool to offset some of the intransigence of the banks, providing it is Government-driven.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o482"><a name="90309-0022.htm_para15"><a name="09030941000139">I would like to talk briefly about training as well. The Government have a target to increase the number of apprenticeships in the UK, and similar plans were secured by Scottish Labour during the recent budget process in Holyrood. However, many of these apprenticeship targets are earmarked for the construction industry, and if we do not support the industry, there will be no point in having a construction and related trade apprenticeships scheme in an industry with no work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o483"><a name="90309-0022.htm_para16"><a name="09030941000140">Negotiating planning procedures and processes takes time, and it may be one or two years before planning permission is granted and construction workers are on site. This will be too late for many construction companies. I would therefore be grateful if the Minister would expand on when Departments will be issuing detailed plans of all construction projects that are being brought forward on a constituency-by-constituency basis. While these companies tighten their belts simply to survive, there is little spare capacity to develop new products such as more effective insulation techniques, which can help us to meet our climate change objectives.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o484"><a name="90309-0022.htm_para17"><a name="09030941000141">There are real threats to other Government objectives, too. Without support for the housing industry, the Government can wave goodbye to any meaningful progress  <br>

on their target for zero-carbon housing in 2016. This initiative was not particularly welcomed with open arms by the industry in the first place, and there is still a struggle to achieve an appropriate definition, but if the Government do not step into the mortgage market with an underwriting guarantee or pressure to increase lending adequately, the lack of finance in the industry will make zero-carbon housing a dream, not an aspiration. It is not only the house builders that we need on board to meet these targets; we need the product manufacturers on board, too. These businesses need profit and investment to develop these products, and product development is currently not high on the list of priorities, but survival is.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o485"><a name="90309-0022.htm_para18"><a name="09030941000142">What makes the housing and construction industry so vital and in need of support and of being moved up the list of endangered species? I have already talked about the benefits to the high street, but another advantage is related to imports. Only 15 per cent. of construction products are imported, and they make up only about 6 per cent. of the total turnover, so there would be a far better return for the UK economy than expenditure on a wider range of consumer goods.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o486"><a name="90309-0022.htm_para19"><a name="09030941000143">I urge the Government to be bolder on VAT. They could reduce it to 5 per cent. on home extensions, repairs and maintenance. That would motivate home owners to invest, and provide real jobs in the industry. This was supported by UK MEPs of all major persuasions only last month. Individuals with private capital are simply not investing in the industry, and we need to change that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o487"><a name="90309-0022.htm_para20"><a name="09030941000144">The value of the housing and construction industry is massive. The skyline of this city&#151;and, indeed, of this very building&#151;displays an array of structures that showcase the talents, creativity and passion of the UK construction industry past and present. However, as well as the aesthetic achievements of the industry, there is a background of stable and valuable employment, which I am proud to say has supported many families, including my own, for a great many years. If we want to prevent its collapse, we need continued strong action now.</p>

 My hon. Friend the Member for Ochil and South Perthshire (Gordon Banks) has rightly highlighted the crisis in the construction industry. I want to focus on one aspect: planning. Consistently in my dealings with construction company representatives, I hear the strongly held view that some local authority planning departments are caught in a time warp and have not responded to the changing economic climate. Businesses often feel that there is a huge gulf between fine rhetoric&#151;well-intentioned words of support&#151;from local authorities and positive outcomes at grass-roots level. I am aware of several proposed developments that have secure funding and outline planning permission to take them forward, yet in these difficult economic times, when planning applications have drastically declined, inordinate delays are impeding implementation, with resulting job losses.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o489"><a name="90309-0022.htm_para22"><a name="09030941000147">In essence, there is strong feeling among sections of our communities that some planning systems are not fit for purpose, and there needs to be greater flexibility and urgency to accelerate projects to sustain vital jobs in this industry. All partners involved in supporting the construction industry need to work closely together to sustain and create jobs. In particular, I urge that political differences at national, devolved and local authority level must be set aside in the wider interests of infrastructure and housing projects, and that those need to be brought forward as quickly as possible.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o490"><a name="90309-0022.htm_para23"><a name="09030941000148">In Scotland over the past two years, despite Scottish Government promises of matching previous programmes &#147;brick for brick&#148;, not a new brick has been laid by the Scottish Futures Trust. Ideological differences must be abandoned for the sake of our work force and our communities. Across all levels of government, we must take whatever action is needed to assist us through these very difficult and challenging times, and if planning systems need to change, so be it. Does the Minister agree that doing nothing about such planning matters is not an option?</p>

 I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Ochil and South Perthshire (Gordon Banks) on securing this debate on a subject that we both agree is important. First, may I say that one of the biggest single acts that the Government can perform to help the construction industry and reinvigorate the housing market is to restore confidence and stability in the financial markets and to support the economy by increasing lending? That is why the actions that we took in October on the recapitalisation of the banks, those we announced in January on the asset protection scheme, whereby we provided guarantees to the Royal Bank of Scotland group, and today&#146;s announcement on Lloyds are providing real support to the banking system to ensure that continuance of lending in the economy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o491"><a name="90309-0022.htm_para24"><a name="09030941000150">My hon. Friend raises the important point about the availability of mortgages, and I agree that it is key to restoring the housing market. As he rightly points out, the underlying demand for housing is there, but one of the biggest problems is the availability of finance. That is why the Government recently announced that Northern Rock will increase mortgage lending by up to &#163;14 billion over the next two years and why we have seen the other announcements that he mentioned. The new lending will be made available on commercial terms to ensure that it represents good value for money for the taxpayer, and Northern Rock will return to the mortgage market after an absence. The Government have made it clear that we want to see a mortgage market that functions well, where lenders lend responsibly and borrowers have access to a wide range of mortgages that they can afford to repay: a return to responsible lending and responsible borrowing. He will be aware that we are monitoring bank lending very closely, with data being collated by the monitoring panel that we have established. I share his ambition to see more 90 per cent. loan-to-value mortgages being offered. He is right to say that a big  <br>

readjustment has taken place over the past six months in that respect. There are 90 per cent. LTV mortgages available at the moment from a number of lenders, as he rightly points out, but particularly for first-time house buyers we need to consider whether we can do more to help them at the appropriate time of their choosing to get their foot on the housing ladder.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o492"><a name="90309-0022.htm_para25"><a name="09030941000151">We also have to think about whether we want to do more to stimulate the private rented sector of the UK economy, too. It is clear that there is, and that there will continue to be, a strong demand for new homes in this country. My hon. Friend is right, too, to point out the benefits for the UK high street of the purchases that come when people move into new homes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o493"><a name="90309-0022.htm_para26"><a name="09030941000152">The construction industry is vital to the UK economy. In 2006, it accounted for nearly 9 per cent. of gross value added worth more than &#163;100 billion. The importance of construction to the Government and society goes beyond its economic contribution. Construction is vital for the provision of good quality public services and it plays a role in the delivery of more than half the 30 public service agreements set out in the 2007 comprehensive spending review. The sector is large, with recent employment levels exceeding 2 million people, and it contains some 284,000 firms. Although small and medium-sized companies predominate, the sector ranges from large international contractors to the self-employed jobbing builder and decorator.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o494"><a name="90309-0022.htm_para27"><a name="09030941000153">As a Government, we appreciate the fact that good quality housing is a basic human need and we are fully committed to it. By 2010, 95 per cent. of all social housing will meet the decent homes standard for housing that meets basic minimum quality standards. Furthermore, the Government acknowledge that there is a significant gap between the supply and the rising demand for new homes. For decades, the housing market has failed to keep up with our ageing and growing population. That has led to significant problems of affordability, particularly, as I have mentioned, for those seeking to buy their first home.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o495"><a name="90309-0022.htm_para28"><a name="09030941000154">First-time home buyers are key to the housing market. That is why we have set out an ambitious target to deliver 240,000 additional homes a year by 2016. In recent years, the housing market had responded to that challenge with the delivery of 207,500 additional homes in 2007-08. However, we recognise the reality of the recession and how it has hit the housing market badly. The capital constraints on private sector developers have been significant and the economic conditions facing the housing sector are far worse than those facing any other subsector in the construction industry.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o496"><a name="90309-0022.htm_para29"><a name="09030941000155">We recognise the need to take action and, as my hon. Friend will be aware, we are bringing forward public expenditure. Some &#163;775 million was earmarked in the pre-Budget report to be spent on housing and regeneration investment. Some &#163;250 million will be spent on the decent homes programmes to fund improvements in energy efficiency in 25,000 social homes. Some &#163;150 million will be spent on new social rented homes, in addition to the &#163;400 million to be spent on 5,500 new social homes that was announced last September.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o497"><a name="90309-0023.htm_para0"><a name="09030941000156">We are committed to a major increase in affordable and social housing to meet demand and to cut waiting lists. Local authorities with existing stock will be able to  <br>

apply for grants to buy social housing alongside registered social landlords. As my hon. Friend mentioned, HomeBuy Direct&#146;s &#163;300 million shared equity scheme will help up to 10,000 first-time buyers into affordable home ownership over the next two years. As with other homebuy schemes, any first-time buyers whose household income is under &#163;60,000 will be able to apply. That will not only help first-time buyers, but support the industry by identifying buyers for its new homes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o498"><a name="90309-0023.htm_para1"><a name="09030941000157">Of course, in addition to our desire to restore confidence in the banking system and to see further new house building in the UK, there is another factor: the Government are themselves a significant client, through public sector procurement, of infrastructure, and my hon. Friend the Member for Ochil and South Perthshire rightly mentioned that that was of significance. Some 30 per cent. of all construction activity is publicly funded, with a further 10 per cent. accounted for by the private finance initiative and similar schemes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o499"><a name="90309-0023.htm_para2"><a name="09030941000158">As the House will be aware, the Government recently announced measures to safeguard PFI projects that were unable to access credit because of the financial crisis. Our action will ensure that public sector investments in infrastructure projects, including schools, transport and waste treatment projects, can be protected and will proceed. We are also bringing forward billions of pounds of infrastructure project spending right across the UK to help to keep people and firms in work while private demand falls. Projects include: increasing the capacity in the motorway network; improving and building new social housing; renewing primary and secondary schools; and investing in energy efficiency measures. The challenge, of course, is to make sure that we deliver on those commitments, and the Government are determined to do so. It is also a challenge to see whether there is more that we can do in these difficult economic times to help people and businesses in the construction industry.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o500"><a name="90309-0023.htm_para3"><a name="09030941000159">My hon. Friend also mentioned planning issues. He asked me about the detailed delivery plans to ensure that the money that we have announced will be spent. I can inform him that planning is well advanced, and the Department for Children, Schools and Families announced on 3 March which local authorities will receive the &#163;499 million in additional money next year to invest in our schools. The Department is also bringing forward &#163;390 million of the money that head teachers receive directly, and &#163;30 million for investment in play facilities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o501"><a name="90309-0023.htm_para4"><a name="09030941000160">My hon. Friend the Member for Glenrothes (Lindsay Roy) raised the issue of planning. He pointed to the lack of strategic intervention in some of the areas with which he is familiar. I agree with him that all partners need to work together to ensure that we can remove barriers and blockages, particularly during these difficult economic times, so that projects go ahead. He mentioned the Scottish Futures Trust, which is a matter for the Scottish Parliament and the Scottish Administration, but I am aware of the concerns that he expresses. My hon. Friend the Member for Ochil and South Perthshire mentioned training and VAT issues; I agree with him about the importance of training and maintaining skills in the construction industry sector. I have noted his request on VAT, and it will form part of our Budget deliberations, no doubt.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o502"><a name="90309-0023.htm_para5"><a name="09030941000161">To conclude, it is vital that we continue to be in close touch with the industry. We meet regularly with the Strategic Forum for Construction, which includes umbrella  <br>
