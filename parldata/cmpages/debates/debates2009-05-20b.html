 The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right to say that social enterprises have an extraordinarily important role to play in providing debt advice, not least because they are often able to provide services in communities in a manner that it is difficult for Government to match. In February, the Parliamentary Secretary, my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, West (Kevin Brennan), announced &#163;42 million of extra help to support charities, voluntary groups and social enterprises that are seeking to do more, and my right hon. Friend the Chancellor provided for &#163;20 million on top of that in the Budget. If there is anything more that we can do to help social enterprises in the hon. Gentleman&#146;s constituency to get their hands on some of that money, I would of course be more than delighted to help.</p>

 I congratulate my hon. Friend on her work to champion the causes of those organisations. As a Government, we are absolutely clear that we will not repeat the mistakes of the 1980s, when too little help was provided to those losing their work, particularly the young&#151;those under 25. That is why my right hon. Friend the Chancellor set aside &#163;1 billion in the Budget to ensure that extra help is available to those under the age of 25 who have been out of work for more than 12 months to ensure that none of them needs to stay out of work, out of training or miss out on a volunteering opportunity. We think that social enterprises have a critical role to play in delivering that programme; that is why the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions announced &#163;100 million of funding for social enterprises to set about the job of giving people new opportunities during this downturn.</p>

 I am very happy to give the hon. Gentleman that undertaking. If we want to come through this recession as quickly as possible and in a way that best protects families and businesses, we have to ensure that we are not only delivering help to families and businesses but doing everything in our power to ensure that communities are strong, because it is on the foundation of strong communities that we will build a different kind of future for this country. Faith-based organisations have an enormously important role to play, so it is important that they are eligible for the extra assistance that we are providing. I hope that the hon.

He knows, surely, that the voluntary sector prospers best when demand is increasing, and that it plays a significant and progressive part in providing services. However, may I remind him that until we have a serious council house building programme to fire up that part of the economy, it will be very difficult for the voluntary sector to make real contributions to the housing market generally?</p>

 My hon. Friend has championed this cause, certainly for the short time that I have been in the House. He is absolutely right that the renewal and regeneration of housing is critical to the future that we want to see in this country. However, there cannot be traditional housing projects as they might have looked 20 or 30 years ago. We know now from pioneering housing associations that there is far more that associations themselves can do not just to build houses and give people homes that are safe and secure but to equip people with skills and connect them with jobs.</p>

I believe that he would agree, however, that a social investment bank is not some kind of silver bullet in securing a more effective social enterprise sector in future. We know also that local authorities&#146; contribution will be critical, which is why it is so important that we now ask the third sector&#146;s opinion about local authorities and their support for social enterprises. He will be as interested as I am to see the results. When we looked at how the sector rates local authorities, we found that of the bottom 25 rated councils in terms of commitment to the sector, I am afraid to say that 17 were Conservative.</p>

They can also often innovate in finding new ways of bringing public services together. That is one of the most important prizes that the groups to which the hon.

 I have already mentioned the strength with which the social enterprise sector faces this downturn. I should add, of course, that social enterprises can also benefit from the measures that we have put in place to help all businesses, including the &#163;10 billion working capital fund and the &#163;75 million capital enterprise fund.</p>

 That is good news. Phoenix is a social enterprise in Swindon that works with people recovering from mental health problems by offering them work in a mailing and assembly service. I should declare an interest, because I have used the service, paying for it through my office costs allowance, and excellent value for money it was. What can my right hon.

 The social enterprise that my hon. Friend highlights is part of a sector of some 55,000 social enterprises that creates a turnover of around &#163;27 billion. That enterprise, flair and innovation will be especially valuable in helping to get Britain through this downturn faster and in a way that protects families and businesses. That is why the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions has set aside &#163;100 million to help social enterprises get people back to work. It is also why the Cabinet Office is managing a clear set of ambitions to help ensure that those with learning disabilities or mental health issues are part of social enterprises&#146; work, because we know that those people, too, have a right to help and a contribution to make, and we are determined to unlock it.</p>

 My right hon. Friend will be aware of the fine work that social enterprises and charities do across all our constituencies, such as The Hinge, in Goole, which works with young, vulnerable and homeless people. That is a client group that, sadly, is likely to grow through this recession. Will my right hon.

 First, may I praise my hon. Friend for the charitable work that he does? Organisations such as The Hinge will have an enormous contribution to make over the coming months, and the strength that they could acquire in that time could serve them well in regard to their long-term contribution to the sector and to the communities that they work in. That is exactly why different Departments right across Government are putting in place significant amounts of funding to help the sector over the next two or three years. That funding would be cut if we took the advice of some in the House. Once the money is in place, it is vital that we get rid of any impediments to getting deals done, which is why I am bringing Ministers together to clear those road blocks out of the way much faster.</p>

The local churches&#151;with the support of my own livery company, the Worshipful Company of Weavers, which has invested a great deal in the project&#151;are putting a great many volunteers and community workers into that estate to help to reduce the deprivation and exclusion and the other problems that often go with exclusion.</p>

 May I take this opportunity, Mr. Speaker, to pay personal tribute to you for your great kindness, generosity and understanding, which you showed me when I entered this House four years ago?<a name="09052039000152">May I ask the Prime Minister what reassurance he might give those of my constituents who are struggling to keep businesses afloat? Is he aware that the banks are ruthlessly pushing many otherwise viable businesses over the edge by refusing reasonable loans to keep liquidity and cash flowing? They are also beginning to charge outrageous interest rates, far above what is reasonable or understandable. Can his Government do anything to pressurise these ruthless banks to free up lending in order to provide better liquidity until the better times come? Otherwise, good businesses are being pushed out of existence.</p>

 I appreciate what the hon. Gentleman is saying. There is clearly concern in all sections of the House about how banks can better serve the public during this economic recession to help us through it. I shall look at what he says about the bank if he will give me the names of the companies and the bank. The important thing is that in the past few weeks there has been a change of policy, and I hope that that change of policy will have an impact in every region and every part of this country.

I urge the hon. Gentleman to go back to those banks and remind them of the quantitative targets that have been agreed, and of the other means by which the Government have offered to help small business, including through the Inland Revenue.

 May I strongly identify myself with the tributes to you, Mr. Speaker, that the Prime Minister has led today? I know that hon. Members on both sides of the House will want to have the opportunity to pay tribute to you. As Leader of the House, I shall make sure that an occasion is arranged before you leave the Chair so that we can all pay tribute to your generous and courteous chairing of this House of Commons.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o14"><a name="90520-0004.htm_para0"><a name="09052039000159">With permission, Mr. Speaker, and following on from your statement to the House yesterday, I should like to make a statement on the decisions made yesterday at the meeting of the Members Estimate Committee that you convened with the Prime Minister, the party leaders and the Chair of the Committee on Members&#146; Allowances, and on the Prime Minister&#146;s proposals for a new parliamentary standards authority.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o15"><a name="90520-0004.htm_para1"><a name="09052039000160">First, I want to set out how we are dealing with the past. At the meeting last night, we agreed a process, proposed by the Committee on Members&#146; Allowances, that will reassess Members&#146; claims over the past four years and identify those claims that should not have been made and should not have been paid out because they were outwith the rules. We also agreed to make arrangements for repayment. The public are entitled to see a process of reparation and Members are entitled to know that this will be orderly and fair.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o16"><a name="90520-0004.htm_para2"><a name="09052039000161">Secondly, I want to set out the immediate steps that will be taken. The House has already voted to ensure that the threshold for receipts has gone down from &#163;25 to zero and to introduce full-scope audit under the National Audit Office. But, in addition, the MEC meeting last night agreed to an immediate ban on claims for furniture, a cap on interest payments for accommodation at the equivalent per year of &#163;1,250 per month and a restriction on any changes to designation of main and second homes. The meeting also agreed that Members who are married or living together as partners should be prevented from claiming more than one second home allowance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o17"><a name="90520-0004.htm_para3"><a name="09052039000162">I understand that the MEC will meet later today to determine detailed changes to the Green Book to put into practice the principles on which the party leaders and the MEC reached clear agreement last night. That should give immediate reassurance to Members of this House and to the public, but, in order fully to restore public trust and confidence, we need more than reparation and reassurance: we need renewal, and to put in place a new system on a new footing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o18"><a name="90520-0004.htm_para4"><a name="09052039000163">The House has already voted, on 30 April, to endorse the inquiry by the Committee on Standards in Public Life, which will come forward with its recommendations later this year. Once again, I want to place on record my thanks to Sir Christopher Kelly and his committee for their work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o19"><a name="90520-0004.htm_para5"><a name="09052039000164">At the MEC meeting last night, all parties agreed to the Prime Minister&#146;s proposal that the keystone for any reform must be to switch from self-regulation to independent external regulation. We agreed that we should end the gentlemen&#146;s club approach that means that we set and enforce our own rules, and instead bring forward proposals for a new parliamentary standards authority.</p>

It would be able not only to disallow claims, but to require payback of claims wrongly paid out and to impose financial penalties.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o21"><a name="90520-0004.htm_para7"><a name="09052039000166">It is clearly appropriate that the new body should also take responsibility for such issues in the Lords, including administering and regulating the systems for peers&#146; allowances, overseeing the code governing peers&#146; conduct and the Register of Lords&#146; Interests, ensuring high standards of propriety and financial conduct, investigating alleged abuses of the system and recommending any necessary sanctions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o22"><a name="90520-0004.htm_para8"><a name="09052039000167">We in this House recognise that the principle of self-regulation operates differently in the House of Lords. It is clear that extensive work and consultation will be necessary to ensure the agreement of the House of Lords to the effective transfer of responsibilities to the new body.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o23"><a name="90520-0004.htm_para9"><a name="09052039000168">The new authority would also maintain the register of Members&#146; financial interests in this House and deal with the disclosure of second incomes. Discipline issues that might require sanctions such as suspension from the House, which would have a bearing on Members&#146; ability to perform their work, would remain a matter for the whole House through the Standards and Privileges Committee. Only the electorate, or those who are themselves democratically elected, should be able to prevent a Member from doing their work in this House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o24"><a name="90520-0004.htm_para10"><a name="09052039000169">We have set in place the actions for reparation and reassurance. For renewal for the future, we look forward to Sir Christopher Kelly&#146;s proposals, and we further propose that the House move from a system of self-regulation to a system of statutory regulation. Although I know that it is hard to get a hearing on this subject now, as Leader of the House I will continue to argue, both inside and outside the House, that most honourable Members are precisely that: they are people who come into Parliament as a matter of public service, and are hard-working, decent and honest. However, we must recognise that, even before the allowance revelations, there was a problem of public disengagement and public cynicism, and a public sense of distance from Parliament.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o25"><a name="90520-0004.htm_para11"><a name="09052039000170">We must now seize the opportunity to promote a debate that will see proposals to change and strengthen our democracy move from the margins to centre stage, where they ought rightly to be. Parliament and politics are important precisely because there are deeply held, different views about public policy, but there is consensus among all parties that we need to put the reputation of Parliament above reproach, and we will. I commend the statement to the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o26"><a name="90520-0004.htm_para12"><a name="09052039000172">Following the uproar of the past couple of weeks, we have at last taken concrete steps to address some of the unacceptable elements of an allowances system for Members that has attracted universal condemnation. Last night, we learned from you, Mr. Speaker, of the main points that were decided, and they go a long way to addressing the issues that were crying out for attention. My right hon. Friend the Leader of the Opposition last week outlined a clear list of what he wanted to see for all of us, which he has insisted on for his party. Yesterday&#146;s announcement was in many ways the same as that list.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o27"><a name="90520-0004.htm_para13"><a name="09052039000173">We will have, straight away, a strict regime to ban the flipping of homes just to exploit the allowances available. Capital gains tax cannot be evaded. A declaration about where one&#146;s home is will have to be open and clear. People will not be allowed to claim for plasma TVs or furniture, and there will be an annual cap on how much can be claimed for mortgage interest or rent. Will the Leader of the House confirm when she expects those revised rules to be up and running?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o28"><a name="90520-0004.htm_para14"><a name="09052039000174">The very fact that the proposals were endorsed by all parties, and the fact that the meeting took clear, practical action, should be welcomed by all who have so disapproved of the system under which we have been working. Will the right hon. and learned Lady confirm that it is the Government&#146;s continuing wish to proceed in everything that we are going to do in a genuinely cross-party way?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o29"><a name="90520-0004.htm_para15"><a name="09052039000175">In the meantime, Sir Christopher Kelly and his committee are working on recommendations for a long-term solution to the pay and conditions of MPs. In the middle of what can only be described as the most serious and revolutionary shift in popular opinion and in the reputation of Parliament in our lifetime, his committee is required to stand back from the fray and set out how a modern Parliament should look, and how it and its Members should be resourced. This is no easy task, and whatever people think of Parliament, I hope they will fully respect the integrity of his committee&#146;s efforts and show proper respect for his conclusions. May I ask, therefore, when the Leader of the House thinks the committee will eventually report?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o30"><a name="90520-0004.htm_para16"><a name="09052039000176">One massive structural shift that we in this Parliament must embrace if it is not to sink further in the eyes of voters is to relinquish the right to determine how we reward ourselves. We are here to legislate, to scrutinise, to discuss and to govern. We are here to represent the interests of our constituents, not to serve our own. For a long time, the Conservative party&#146;s policy has been to give up setting our own pay and allowances and to give that power to an outside body. Some sort of outside structure is long overdue. We also want to cut the cost of politics. Where in the reforms does the right hon. and learned Lady believe that that might yet be achieved?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o31"><a name="90520-0004.htm_para17"><a name="09052039000177">Behind all this is the need for massive parliamentary reform to bring this institution up to the requirements of the 21st century.

We know that when we are looking for solutions to these issues, no party has a monopoly of wisdom, and when it comes to unearthing the problems, no party has a monopoly of virtue either, so we will work together across the House to sort them out.</p>

Some of it is self-evident, and it does not take a genius to realise that Members should stop buying household goods and stop some of the most egregious excesses and abuses that have come to light.

 The hon.

I acknowledge that there have been proposals from his party, which we have put into practice through the MEC system.

For 650-odd Members of the House of Commons, there are 650 different sets of circumstances, and each Member will need to know how the new rules apply to their circumstances and how they can make their arrangements. The MEC will have very much in mind the need for clarity and swiftness in showing how the rules are going to work, so that Members can work out how they apply to them. He has already made that point to me, earlier today, and he is absolutely right to have raised it.</p>

 The right hon. and learned Lady&#146;s statement raises important constitutional and ethical issues, which will need to be teased out during the consultation. May I press her on one point? The two driving principles are transparency and independence. To achieve those principles, the case is made to move from self-regulation to independent regulation. It is proposed that the new authority should investigate complaints when a Member is alleged to have breached the code of conduct, but why did the Government stop there? What about the ministerial code of conduct? Is there not an equal need for independence and transparency in investigations of complaints of that code having been breached?</p>

The question of suspension from this House must remain a matter for those of us who are democratically elected, not an unelected body. While it is right to delegate to a statutory authority the questions of setting the code of conduct, setting pay levels, setting allowances, administering the system and investigating any problems, the only thing that should come between us and our doing our duty as Members of Parliament in this House is either our constituents removing us at a general election or the House removing us, with democratically elected Members taking that action.</p>

 I entirely endorse the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Derbyshire (Natascha Engel) about the need to restore people&#146;s confidence and faith in the political system, and in some cases to create that confidence and faith in the first instance. One suggestion is that we should move to real-time month-by-month publication of claims, if not when they are submitted then at least when they are approved. Is that under active consideration?</p>

 That was one of the things that was agreed last time&#151;that there should be publication month by month of claims that have been made and allowed&#151;but obviously we are looking all the time at how we can improve transparency. These things will not be set in stone, and any other suggestions that hon. Members have will be&#151;<i> [Interruption.] </i>I have just been told by my deputy that it will be reported quarterly, not monthly, and I take it that my hon.

 I welcome today&#146;s statement. Does the right hon. and learned Lady agree that if it is really our intention to have here a legislature that is broadly reflective of the people whom we seek to represent, it must be made clear and taken into consideration that this is not a gentlemen&#146;s club, and that many Members have to balance their parliamentary and constituency duties with their family duties? That applies not only to those of us who are mothers of small children but to those with other family duties.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o59"><a name="90520-0006.htm_para0"><a name="09052039000245">It has been very upsetting to read in the press the great idea that we could all live in barracks in London. I ask the House to take into consideration where we will put our children and when we will have time to see them. If we want to have a legislature that really reflects the people, it must reflect families. The financial arrangements must therefore reflect the need for some of us to undertake family duties as well as parliamentary and constituency duties.</p>

 The hon. Lady has added another principle to the list that I suggest we all adhere to. We must not just be a millionaires&#146; Parliament, and we must respect the constituency link and have good professional offices. Also, this should not just be a Parliament of single people who either have never had families or whose families have grown up. The insight that hon. Members bring of struggling to balance work and family responsibilities, and of caring for older relatives and younger children, helps to shape public policy and helps us understand the lives of people in this country. I would definitely adopt the principle that she has put forward.</p>

 We are, of course, answerable to our constituents for the honesty and integrity with which we represent them and go about our work in the House, and to the Chair for not misleading other Members. I think that the regulation of our democracy is ultimately with those who elect us. We are currently considering regulating our pay and our allowances, having codes of conduct and making proposals for their enforcement; that does not cut across the basic fundamental principle of democracy.</p>

 At the meeting that the Speaker convened yesterday, the view of the party leaders was that it would be best for the House and all concerned if we could agree with as much as possible of what Sir Christopher Kelly proposes. I think that the Leader of the Opposition said on television that we want to agree with 99.9 per cent. of what Sir Christopher Kelly suggests. That is not to seek to allow for wriggle room. It is in the right spirit and all our interests if we all give evidence to Sir Christopher Kelly&#151;the deadline is 5 June. It is important for hon. Members to give evidence for him to consider. A great deal of responsibility rests on him because we want, cross party, to adopt what he recommends, which will then be put into practice by the new statutory authority.

 It is a pleasure to second the Prime Minister&#146;s motion. I personally thank the Prime Minister for his role in the process, which has been completely fair and open.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o68"><a name="90520-0006.htm_para9"><a name="09052039000267">The whole point of the job of Comptroller and Auditor General is that it must be above politics. For 150 years, since Mr. Gladstone founded the Public Accounts Committee, it has been a tradition that the Chairman of that Committee is drawn from the Opposition. However, there is also a well-established convention, which is now in statute, that the new Comptroller and Auditor General must be appointed by the Prime Minister&#151;by definition, a member of the Government&#151;and that the Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, who is obviously a member of the Opposition, must countersign the motion.

with no open advertisement. My predecessor, Robert Sheldon, now Lord Sheldon, conducted interviews on his own, and that was clearly inappropriate. We had to create a modern structure, and we have tried to do that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o70"><a name="90520-0006.htm_para11"><a name="09052039000269">In his opening remarks, the Prime Minister alluded to the modern structure. The first step in the process was to make the National Audit Office completely open, transparent and accountable. We had to preserve the ability of the Comptroller and Auditor to be entirely responsible for his reports&#151;nobody can influence their content. However, it was clearly wrong that he was running the National Audit Office on his own. There had to be a modern board structure and, as the Prime Minister said, the Public Accounts Commission&#151;not the Committee, but the Commission, under the able chairmanship of the Father of the House, who is here today&#151;devised a structure.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o71"><a name="90520-0006.htm_para12"><a name="09052039000270">I headed an appointments panel, which appointed the new chairman of the National Audit Office, Sir Andrew Likierman, who has unrivalled experience. He was head of the Government Accountancy Service&#151;apparently known in the trade as &#147;Hot GAS&#148;&#151;and is the dean of the London business school. He was an outstanding candidate and now sits at the apex of this modern, open and transparent National Audit Office. This morning, the Commission met again, and we have given him the go-ahead to appoint further independent board members. The creation of an independent structure was therefore the first part of the process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o72"><a name="90520-0006.htm_para13"><a name="09052039000271">We then had to move to interviewing. Again, I thank the Prime Minister. Of course, he is far too busy running the country to sit for 25 hours, as we had to do, interviewing people, and he therefore delegated Sir Nick Macpherson, the Treasury&#146;s permanent secretary, to sit on the interview panel, which I chaired with Tim Burr. I thank Sir Nick Macpherson, with whom I worked closely and who is an outstanding public servant, and Gus O&#146;Donnell, Secretary to the Cabinet, for their help in the process. The process was completely open and transparent, with open advertisements, head-hunters appointed, a long list of outstanding people applying, more than 20 hours of interviews and Sir Andrew Likierman finally getting involved, and we came up with an outstanding candidate, Amyas Morse.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o73"><a name="90520-0006.htm_para14"><a name="09052039000272">As the Prime Minister said in his opening remarks, Amyas Morse is, as far as I know, the first ever chartered accounted to be Comptroller and Auditor General. That is an important point in respect of when we talk about professionalising the civil service. He works in the public sector at present, having taken a huge cut in his salary to do so, but before that he rose right to the top of the accountancy profession, as the global managing partner of PricewaterhouseCoopers. It was quite obvious to all of us that he was the outstanding candidate and that is why we on the panel decided to appoint him.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o74"><a name="90520-0006.htm_para15"><a name="09052039000273">Amyas Morse&#146;s name was then put to the Prime Minister, who, again in the entirely helpful way in which he has conducted the process, approved the nomination within days. He had a veto, but he decided to trust the Committee with our decision. As the Prime Minister said, we then had the first ever confirmation hearing before the Public Accounts Committee; it is something that has never happened before. My colleagues on the Committee will confirm that Amyas Morse performed very well, with firm, well-argued answers, and the Committee clearly had confidence in him.</p>

 It is symbolic of the significance of the post of Comptroller and Auditor General that the announcement of his appointment should be made in the House by the Prime Minister. However, it would be fair to say that doing so is not one of the more onerous duties of a Prime Minister.</p>

the Comptroller and Auditor General, eight of which were spent as deputy. As we heard from my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough (Mr. Leigh), the Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, Tim Burr played a useful role in the selection of his successor. I would like to thank him for his contribution over many years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o80"><a name="90520-0006.htm_para21"><a name="09052039000280">When we debated Mr. Burr&#146;s appointment in January 2008, much of the discussion centred on the selection process. The consensus in the House was that it was important for Parliament to have a significant role in the appointment to such an important position as that of Comptroller and Auditor General. Some argued for a parliamentary vote. Others, including the Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, argued that if that were to happen, there may be a perception of a loss of independence from the Executive. The Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee is an Opposition MP, and if he has a greater role in the appointment, the perception may be one of greater independence. That view has prevailed and the Government have accepted it. I fully acknowledge my hon. Friend&#146;s point that both he and the Prime Minister have worked together successfully and smoothly in making this appointment. That helps with the perception of independence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o81"><a name="90520-0006.htm_para22"><a name="09052039000281">I agree with both the Prime Minister and my hon. Friend that an appointment for a single 10-year term is also helpful in maintaining independence and the perception of independence. There can be difficulties and dangers&#151;perhaps more of perception than in reality&#151;when someone has a shorter term and is then reappointed. For example, adverse comment was made about the delays in the reappointment of the Governor of the Bank of England. We think that the current structure has much to commend it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o82"><a name="90520-0006.htm_para23"><a name="09052039000282">In debating the appointment of Mr. Amyas Morse, it is worth highlighting how important the role of the Comptroller and Auditor General has always been and, indeed, how much more important it may become in the years ahead. We are entering a period of public spending restraint. We face record levels of borrowing and it will be necessary to ensure that public money is spent wisely, whoever is in power in the years ahead. Even the Government recognise that there is room for further efficiencies. In a period when the Government&#146;s projections are such that there will be real-terms reductions in departmental spending in some areas, the emphasis on value for money is significant.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o83"><a name="90520-0006.htm_para24"><a name="09052039000283">Hon. Members perhaps need no reminding of this, but it is worth reiterating the fact that the demand from the public for greater transparency in and scrutiny of public spending is greater than it has ever been before. The public demand to know more. We live in a less deferential society. Developments in technology make it easier for information to be disseminated and obtained. For example, the Conservative party supports the introduction of a website detailing items of significant public spending. We think that more can always be done. However, the National Audit Office, the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Public Accounts Committee all have distinguished records in scrutinising public spending, and they will continue to perform that important role. Indeed, just last night in his statement, Mr. Speaker announced a role for the Comptroller and Auditor General in examining MPs&#146; expenses.</p>

what a distinguished career Mr. Morse has had, at PricewaterhouseCoopers and, more recently, at the Ministry of Defence. I know from speaking to my hon. Friend the Chairman how deeply impressed he was by Mr. Morse, and I know that this view was shared by the rest of the panel. Indeed, I think that Mr. Morse impressed the Public Accounts Committee as a whole when giving his evidence to it in February. I have also spoken to others who know Mr. Morse, all of whom speak very highly of him. He has an important task, and we are confident that he will perform his role with great distinction. On behalf of the official Opposition, I wish him well.</p>

 In my role as Chair of the Public Accounts Commission, may I endorse completely everything that has been said about Mr. Morse&#146;s suitability for this job? There was an extremely good shortlist, and he was undoubtedly the best candidate. It is not surprising that it was a good list, because this is one of the most important public sector roles. Parliament would be impotent to carry out its financial scrutiny of the Government if it did not have an effective National Audit Office headed by a clearly independent and strong-minded Comptroller and Auditor General. Without the Comptroller and Auditor General, we would be incapable of monitoring the hundreds of billions of pounds of expenditure and income. He does not simply audit; he checks for value for money, probity and accuracy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o85"><a name="90520-0007.htm_para1"><a name="09052039000287">I should like to put a different hat on to describe another role of the Comptroller and Auditor General. In my role as Chair of the Liaison Committee, I have been very grateful to the previous Comptrollers and Auditors General, Sir John Bourn and Tim Burr, for all the work they have done with the Committees outside the Public Accounts Committee. For many years, the other Committees have justifiably been envious of the incredible support that the PAC receives from the National Audit Office. Sir John must be given credit for his decision to start using the NAO&#146;s expertise to support the other Select Committees, through the use of secondees and briefings. At the post-appointment hearing, I spoke to Sir Andrew Likierman, the new chair of the NAO, which is a new post. I was particularly delighted when he and Mr. Morse reiterated their commitment to expand the role of supporting the Select Committees. That can only be good news for the Committees.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o86"><a name="90520-0007.htm_para2"><a name="09052039000288">I, too, would like to thank Tim Burr. He stood in at a difficult time, and he indicated that he had no intention of applying for the post himself. I know that the Chair of the PAC will agree that he has done an excellent job in running the National Audit Office. More than that, however, he has started to implement the restructuring of the NAO and to adapt it to the best modern standards of corporate government, as recommended by the Tiner report. We owe him a lot for that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o87"><a name="90520-0007.htm_para3"><a name="09052039000289">I first started to serve on the PAC in 1990, when I left the Front Bench. At that stage, the NAO was saving the taxpayer five times its annual running costs. That gradually increased, under pressure from the Commission and the Committee, to seven, eight and then nine times the running costs. Tim Burr gave us a pleasant surprise at the last meeting of the Commission, when he told us that the NAO is now recovering 10 times its cost to the taxpayer. That works out at more than &#163;1 billion every 18 months, which is a remarkable achievement. Tim has  <br>

 It is indicative of the significance of the position of Comptroller and Auditor General that the Prime Minister himself moved the motion on the appointment of Mr. Morse. I congratulate the Prime Minister on the nerveless performance that he gave a few minutes ago.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o88"><a name="90520-0007.htm_para4"><a name="09052039000291">The post of Comptroller and Auditor General is a highly significant one, particularly at this time, when the Government have a public sector deficit of &#163;175 billion this year, falling to &#163;173 billion next year&#151;according to their projections. The deficit represents more than 10 per cent. of gross domestic product, so it is essential that we achieve value for money in public spending. That is clearly a task that Mr. Morse is well equipped to contribute to.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o89"><a name="90520-0007.htm_para5"><a name="09052039000292">A number of concerns have been expressed, not about Mr. Morse&#146;s individual qualifications and suitability but about the role more generally. There is a potential for conflict between the positions of the chairman, Sir Andrew Likierman, and of Mr. Morse. I am talking not about them as individuals but about the two roles, which have the potential to overlap. There are issues about the usefulness of the hearing processes, when they do not contribute directly to a recommendation or otherwise on the suitability of an applicant. There is also an issue about the balance between finding value for money and the financial audit work undertaken by the NAO. Mr. Morse will of course have some significant issues in his in-tray, not least the vexed question of whether private finance initiatives will contribute to the overall public debt of the country.</p>

 I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for that contribution.

 This is a very important point. The reason we did it this way is that the Committee, like every other Committee in the House, has a Labour majority.

<a name="90520-0007.htm_brev0"><a name="09052039001687"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;As a Committee, we have no role in the statutory process of selection and appointment of the Comptroller and Auditor General. Nonetheless we believe that our views should carry weight in the debate on the Prime Minister&#146;s motion praying the Queen to appoint Amyas Morse, since we have collectively some 65 years of experience on the Committee and thus of working with the Comptroller and Auditor General and the National Audit Office. We are satisfied that Amyas Morse is highly suitable for the post of Comptroller and Auditor General.&#148;</p>

 I am pleased to take part in the debate to confirm the appointment of Mr. Morse as Comptroller and Auditor General. Having seen him in the hearing, I have no doubt at all about his suitability. His experience of running a large international accountancy practice, PricewaterhouseCoopers, combined with his experience as commercial director of the Ministry of Defence, renders him highly suitable for this very difficult job.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o92"><a name="90520-0007.htm_para8"><a name="09052039000300">In appointing Mr. Morse as Comptroller and Auditor General, the Government are going to have to fix several things. It is a pleasure to see a number of former members of the Public Accounts Committee now sitting on the Treasury Bench and taking part in the debate. I saw the hon. Member for Hemsworth (Jon Trickett) earlier. When he was a member of the Committee, I always used to feel that he and I were hunting together as a pack when we were probing the civil servants before us. Unfortunately, he is now engaged on other responsibilities&#151;bunker maintenance might be the best description for them. There are others sitting on the Treasury Bench who have had recent PAC experience. I enjoyed their incisive contributions through the years when they were members.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o93"><a name="90520-0007.htm_para9"><a name="09052039000301">There are aspects of the Comptroller and Auditor General&#146;s access to the information he needs that will have to be fixed. The National Audit Act 1983 states that the Comptroller and Auditor General should have complete discretion in the exercise of his functions. One might assume that this is completely true, but in fact it is not true at all, as there are three obvious exceptions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o94"><a name="90520-0007.htm_para10"><a name="09052039000302">The first is the Financial Services Authority, to which the Comptroller and Auditor General does not have access. That means that he cannot carry out an audit of the effectiveness, efficiency and economy of the FSA in the way he can with, say, the Ministry of Defence or the Department of Health. I personally believe that that has had significant consequences&#151;for example, in respect of Northern Rock. When it got into huge difficulties, it was discovered to be subject to a regulatory system under which the different players did not know what they were doing. It became very obvious in the autumn of 2007, as seen in the National Audit Office report based on evidence from the Comptroller Auditor General,  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="20 May 2009">

<notus-date day="20" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>20 May 2009 : Column 1528</b><br>
that the three parts of the regulatory system did not know what the others were doing. That was the result of a lack of scrutiny of the FSA. The Comptroller and Auditor General would have carried it out, I believe, if he had had the right of access to do so&#151;but he did not, so when it was done, it was done by the Treasury.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o95"><a name="90520-0007.htm_para11"><a name="09052039000303">I am afraid that only once over a period of seven or eight years did the Treasury ask the NAO to look at the activities of the FSA. In that regard, it failed in its functions. I do not blame the Exchequer Secretary, who was a very incisive member of our Committee when she was on it. Functionally, however, the Treasury has failed, and Sir Nicholas Macpherson has more or less admitted that point and agreed to go back and look over the matter.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o97"><a name="90520-0007.htm_para13"><a name="09052039000309">My second point concerns the BBC, to which the Comptroller and Auditor General does not have access either. That has an impact on the effectiveness, efficiency and economy of the BBC and on the extent to which it is scrutinised. When Dame Ellen MacArthur sailed around the world, 64 television producers turned up in Falmouth to cover it. I am not sure that that would have happened if they had known that they were going to be subject to public audit in the way that most Government Departments are. That has nothing to do with editorial control.</p>

I hope that you will agree, Mr. Deputy Speaker, that it is directly relevant to this debate. What better time to appoint the nation&#146;s chief auditor than after what has happened over the last couple of weeks? I can think of no more important appointment for us to make. According to statute, the Comptroller and Auditor General has all the authority over the National Audit Office. As the Government well know, that is why we are soon going to see changes. As I say, the Comptroller and Auditor General has all the authority under statute and the NAO is organised under his control into value-for-money divisions and financial audit divisions.</p>

Previously, I had always thought that the auditors could go in and examine the House of Commons administration and do all the audit they needed to perform to satisfy themselves in exactly the same way as for Departments. It turns out, however, that for all these years, all they have been able to do is to compare the claims made by Members with the amounts paid and check that the two are the same&#151;that is all they can do.

In particular, he was the Treasury Officer of Accounts between 1993 and 1994 before moving to the National Audit Office to become a member of its management board. In 2000, he became deputy Comptroller and Auditor General, before assuming the office of Comptroller and Auditor General, on an interim basis, on 1 February last year.

 This is a very important point, which was carefully considered by the both the Commission and the Committee. There will be no disagreement because Sir Andrew Likierman will concern himself only with the corporate governance of the NAO. The CAG will have the absolute, independent, full and individual right to propose what he studies and to issue his results to the PAC. The PAC will never consider policy in itself, but only its effectiveness. I have chaired more than 450 meetings of the PAC, at which we have never had even one vote.

 That is a rather wider question than the question of the appointment hearing, but, as the hon.

 That is an important question. As was made clear during the passage of the Planning Bill and is made clear in the Act, sustainability must be at the heart of any national policy statement. I shall say more about parliamentary scrutiny shortly. I do not wish to mislead the House, but I seem to recall that the Sustainable Development Commission is one of the statutory consultees and will therefore have the opportunity to play a role in regard to national policy statements.</p>

 As I am sure my hon. Friend will acknowledge, that will depend on the nature of the national policy statement involved. It may well be that the price of carbon is not particularly relevant. When considering this matter, the House has been clear about the need for a flexible approach in that regard.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o111"><a name="90520-0008.htm_para2"><a name="09052039000339">The Planning Act, particularly section 9, provides for parliamentary scrutiny of a proposed national policy statement before it can be designated. Timing, in the general sense, is very important. The Government envisage that the Infrastructure Planning Commission will be established and able to start giving advice to potential applicants this autumn, and will be ready to begin receiving applications from the first half of 2010. We need to put the right procedures in place now, so that they are ready for the first statements, which are scheduled for publication for consultation and laying before Parliament later this year. It is important for parliamentary scrutiny of proposals for NPSs to be efficient and timely. Any delay, or ineffective arrangements, will pose the risk of disruption to a demanding timetable of planning reform for major infrastructure.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o112"><a name="90520-0008.htm_para3"><a name="09052039000340">To ensure that the process of parliamentary scrutiny is effective and efficient, the Minister for Local Government and the Leader of the House began discussions with the Chairmen of the relevant Select Committees when the Planning Bill was going through the House. Discussions have been followed by further discussions between the Deputy Leader of the House&#151;who I am pleased to see is present&#151;and the Chairmen of Select Committees in recent weeks. The Liaison Committee also considered this matter in October last year, and I have found its report incisive and illuminating.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o113"><a name="90520-0008.htm_para4"><a name="09052039000341">I pay tribute to the hard work undertaken by my colleagues and others, which has strengthened the proposed process.

<p><a name="stpa_o114"><a name="90520-0008.htm_para5"><a name="09052039000342">When the Planning Bill was first introduced, the Government suggested the establishment of a specific Select Committee to consider national policy statements, whose members might be drawn from the membership of relevant departmental Committees. However, it was made clear during the passage of the Bill that the wish of the House was that it should be for the House itself to decide what procedures were appropriate for each specific NPS. We recognise that that flexibility is vital.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o115"><a name="90520-0008.htm_para6"><a name="09052039000343">As I said a moment ago, the Liaison Committee also directly considered the matter of parliamentary scrutiny of NPSs, and provided helpful and reasonable suggestions on how the process could operate and be improved. The Chair of the Communities and Local Government Committee, my hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, South-West (Dr. Starkey)&#151;who I am pleased to see is also present&#151;feared that the system as then suggested would exclude members of her Committee with responsibility for, and expertise in, matters of planning policy and local government. As one who appeared before the Committee this week to discuss planning policy statements&#151;and I still bear the scars on my back from previous interrogations by it&#151;I can personally vouch for my hon. Friend&#146;s wise words. Moreover, the Chairmen of the departmental Select Committees directly concerned perceived the risk that a system in which ad hoc committees were drawn from existing Select Committees would disrupt those Committees&#146; work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o116"><a name="90520-0008.htm_para7"><a name="09052039000344">Together with the Chairs of the Select Committees, we developed the process that is proposed in the motion. Parliamentary examination of a national policy statement would take place through one of two routes: designation of a relevant departmental Select Committee to undertake the work, or the appointment of a national policy statement Select Committee. The decision on which option to take would be a matter not for the Government but for the Select Committees, via the Liaison Committee. Part A of the motion creates a new Standing Order setting out the governance and administrative arrangements for a new national policy statement Select Committee, including the number of members, what constitutes a quorum, the Committee&#146;s powers to take evidence and its ability to appoint specialist advisers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o117"><a name="90520-0008.htm_para8"><a name="09052039000345">It may be helpful if I briefly describe what I expect scrutiny of a national policy statement to entail. As I have implied, the precise details would be a matter for the Liaison Committee and the relevant Select Committee, but we envisage a process along the following lines. The relevant Secretary of State would lay the draft NPS, or draft amendment of an NPS, before Parliament and publish it for public consultation. At the same time, the Secretary of State would specify what is known as the &#147;relevant period&#148; during which consideration of the proposal would take place. We have agreed that this would need to be sufficient to encompass the period of public consultation plus additional time to allow for Committees of either House to report and for debates in this House and the other place to take place if required.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o118"><a name="90520-0008.htm_para9"><a name="09052039000350">Chairs of Select Committees and the House in general will wish to be reassured that a Secretary of State will not rush through an NPS via a truncated relevant period, and I will in a moment set out how that will not be allowed to be the case. A draft NPS will be screened by the Chairs of the relevant Select Committees and the Liaison Committee. Under this process, it will be decided which of the two routes for scrutiny to take: a relevant Select Committee or the bespoke national policy statement Select Committee. This body will then meet to agree its call for evidence, which will run in parallel with public consultation. The motion before us makes it clear that the Select Committee may invite individuals and organisations to appear before it to give oral evidence; I think that that point will reassure my hon. Friend that the SDC will, where relevant, be able to give evidence and appear before the relevant Select Committee. I hope I have reassured her on that point.</p>

 I have two points to make in response to that. First, it is my recollection that, in terms of all national policy statements, the SDC is a statutory consultee; I will write to my hon. Friend if that is incorrect. Secondly, I hope I am making it clear that it is not for the Government to decide which witnesses are to be provided in the consideration of any particular NPS. The relevant Select Committee, in conjunction with the Liaison Committee, would decide what evidence needed to be provided. It is, of course, open to the SDC to provide, where relevant, written evidence to a particular Select Committee. Therefore, I think there are checks and balances to allow issues and queries with regard to sustainability to be advanced.</p>

 The hon. Lady indicates that she served on the Committee and she raises the important point that timing is absolutely essential. We have said both throughout the passage of the Bill and now that it has been enacted that we need a national debate on what infrastructure is necessary for this country. Part of that debate is a public consultation, for which there is the statutory 12-week period. Alongside that, it is important that, in parallel, we have rigorous parliamentary scrutiny, and if the hon.

 The Minister&#146;s remarks are very interesting. The problem here is that these national policy statements will be overarching and interrelated, and because of the nature of Member involvement they will be interested in a number of different national policy statements at the same time. How will we manage that, unless we allow national policy statement proceedings to last for long periods of time? This point also applies to the various non-governmental organisations that will be interested. They will want to give evidence on a range of national policy statements at the same time. How does the Minister envisage that that will work?</p>

In practice, the relevant period will therefore usually be about six months, but my right hon. Friends the Secretaries of State who will be laying the proposals are fully aware of the need to consult Select Committees about the timing of the scrutiny process at an early stage.

 I apologise to the hon. Lady for not making myself clear.

That relevant period is the time scale within which this whole process will take place. The reason for the point about the report coming out 40 days before the end of that relevant period is to ensure that there could be a debate in this House or the other place if the Select Committee that scrutinised that NPS thought that that would be relevant, appropriate and worth while.

Although I accept that there has been a degree of constructive discussion and movement from the Government&#146;s original proposals, none of the proposals in the motion meets our basic issue of principle: proposals of this kind should ultimately be signed off in a substantive vote following a debate on the Floor of this House.

Member for Hayes and Harlington (John McDonnell), but for many people beyond the area. That is fundamentally wrong, and it sends the wrong message about the attitude of Government, as an institution, to the people on the receiving end of a planning application.

continuity of membership, so it has exactly the esprit de corps that I mentioned. The sort of Select Committee that is proposed will make it much harder to achieve that.

If the amendment is pressed to a vote, my hon. Friends and I will be minded to support it.

The reaction of my constituent was, &#147;Well, that is potty. What is the point of the Assembly then?&#148; I have a real fear that, at a time of grave concern about the relevance of the House, it is not helpful to suggest that key national decisions should be taken without this House, after scrutiny, having a substantive vote.

about whether Parliament is providing value for money, it ill behoves us as parliamentarians, when we are being given the ability to scrutinise more and a statutory place in the process that involves placing additional burdens on members of Select Committees, to say, &#147;We&#146;d rather not, thank you. We would prefer it if Ministers just got on with it in the normal way and we merely debated these things on the Floor of the House.&#148; That is not to say that debates on the Floor of the House are not important&#151;I do not want to be misinterpreted in that way.

 I do not think that there has been any suggestion in today&#146;s debate that the role of the Select Committee is not crucial.

had more effect on him. However, I do not want to take away from other people. I simply want to bring into the open part of the procedure that went on in this building&#151;not in public, because such meetings do not happen in public&#151;to demonstrate that more goes on in the House than what occurs in the Chamber or in Westminster Hall.</p>

 Like the hon. Lady, I think that the work of Select Committees is important and useful, as it provides a form of scrutiny that is not easily duplicated in the Chamber, but does she share my doubt about the number of Select Committee places that there seem to be? I am told by a colleague&#151;I do not know whether it is right&#151;that the numbers might have as much as doubled in the past few years and that there are too many places. As a result, MPs&#151;even if they are full time and fully committed&#151;have struggled to attend meetings and to do the necessary preparation that makes those meetings so useful.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman will be reassured to hear that that discussion has gone on in the Liaison Committee. I think that that Committee has expressed the view that it will want to see a review of the number of places on Select Committees. My personal view is that it was a mistake to increase the size of certain Select Committees, since it appears to me that that has put huge stress on the system without&#151;I shall choose my words carefully&#151;seeming to add unduly enormously to the work of those Committees. Any reduction in the number of places would obviously free people up without our needing to reduce the number of Committees, although there might be some duplication of Committees, too.</p>

Members who have been in local councils will know that planning is slightly different locally and at a national level from other matters that are discussed by councils and Parliament. We need to keep that in mind, as it has a bearing on the discussion about whether or not we should have a substantive vote on a planning document. I am sure that the Minister is better apprised of parliamentary rules than I am, but my understanding is&#151;the amendment might alter this, but I do not think that it does&#151;that there is no statutory requirement for a vote to take place before a statement can be designated as an NPS.

They are, of course, about balancing opposing rights and creating sensible land-use policy that meets needs locally, regionally and nationally. In my view, the process has to be seen to be fair and transparent, but it must not be subject to undue delay. I accept that the word &#147;undue&#148; is very subjective, and of course the process must be long enough to ensure that every organisation and person has a reasonable opportunity to put their point of view cogently. Of course, there needs to be sufficient time for those views to be considered and appraised and for decisions to be taken. However, I do not think that anybody&#146;s interests&#151;even those of the individuals or organisations that might be unhappy with the eventual outcome&#151;are served when the planning process is simply dragged out by endless delaying tactics.</p>

Many of the big infrastructure decisions that we have to take result from changing views about the importance of tackling climate change. Most of the reordering of our energy infrastructure, including the national grid, is necessary because we have to change the energy sources that we are using and the infrastructure in order to enable us to do that. There is an urgency to those changes that makes it all the more important that we should have a system for decision making that is not unduly lengthy and inefficient.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o149"><a name="90520-0010.htm_para10"><a name="09052039000426">My party has always agreed with the concept of national policy statements. The Minister for Local Government, who took the Planning Bill through Committee, was pleased that the concept met with almost universal approval. There is a determination to get beyond the problems described by the hon. Member for Milton Keynes, South-West (Dr. Starkey) because, ultimately, delaying tactics achieve a different result only when they delay progress so much that policy changes in the meantime. That may have happened on occasion, but I think that we all want a system that is transparent. The rules of engagement must be clear, both for people who support a proposal and for those who have real concerns about its potential impact, and I think that national policy statements take us closer to that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o150"><a name="90520-0010.htm_para11"><a name="09052039000427">It is important that we get the balance right on accuracy. As has been noted, national policy statements will be very significant for industry and our country&#146;s future, and also for communities in which or near which infrastructure projects are to be built. It is therefore crucial that we get the national policy statements right, and spending a little more time on them will ensure that applications can proceed as smoothly as possible. The Government have always talked about the need for speed, but speed is most necessary in the application process. We have a clear idea of how that will proceed, but it is even more important that we get setting the policy framework right. That is why I think that we need to explore the proposals before us in a little more detail.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o151"><a name="90520-0010.htm_para12"><a name="09052039000428">Setting planning policy is a much more political process than the determination of planning applications. However much people who either propose or oppose developments might like policy to exist for all time, the fact that we live in a democracy means that policy statements may change as a result of general elections or referendums. That is the case because all Governments have their own views about how issues can be resolved.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o152"><a name="90520-0010.htm_para13"><a name="09052039000429">For example, my party and the Government have different views about the use of nuclear technology in our future energy supply. I know that the Conservative party has a range of opinions on the matter, and it is probably fair to say that the same is true of all parties. A future Administration may adopt a different policy from the present Government&#146;s, with the result that the relevant national policy statements might have to be revisited. National policy statements will not be put in place once and for all, or for a period of 10 years, for example, because it is inevitable that things will move on and changes happen.</p>

 I am following carefully the hon. Gentleman&#146;s line of argument, but does he accept that a national policy statement may be something of a hybrid&#151;a mixture of a statement about Government policy made at the Dispatch Box, and something along the lines of a planning policy guidance note? He has noted that policy can change when the Government do, so does he accept that there may be a tension between a statement setting out Government policy and an NPS, which is quasi-judicial by nature? He has said that national policy statements can be altered by an incoming Government, so does he think that they will be the primary vehicle for such a Government to set out their thinking?</p>

 That is clearly a consideration, which is why we should look beyond the short to medium term and acknowledge that changes may occur. Some of the matters covered by national policy statements may become crucial issues of difference between parties and very important at any general election or referendum that might take place as the parliamentary process moves forward.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o153"><a name="90520-0010.htm_para14"><a name="09052039000432">How will the proposals contained in an NPS be scrutinised, and by whom? Will the House carry out that scrutiny and so have a say in what emerges, or will the process be led by the Government? The Minister for Local Government is on record as saying that the promotion of coherent policy is clearly a role for Government, but I agree with the hon. Member for Southampton, Test (Dr. Whitehead) that the NPS is something of a hybrid. While one would expect the Government of the day to put forward a proposal, it is legitimate for individual hon. Members to want to be able to offer input about site-specific concerns that might have far reaching consequences for their constituents.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o154"><a name="90520-0010.htm_para15"><a name="09052039000433">In passing, I want to say that my party is not convinced that implementing a framework of national policy statements necessitates an Infrastructure Planning Commission. The Government have said that there is a clear distinction between democratic involvement in setting policy and the far more dispassionate and objective process of determining applications. I shall return to that later in my remarks, and for now merely note that the Government are on record as setting out that as their position.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o155"><a name="90520-0010.htm_para16"><a name="09052039000434">Let me move on to consider the arrangements in more detail. During the Minister&#146;s contribution, there was a debate, conducted through intervention, about the time factor. As I mentioned in my intervention on him, it is sensible that there should be a period of 40 days in which the right information can be put before the House. That will follow a Select Committee process that has been far more rigorous, in which the Select Committee will have had the opportunity to consider evidence in more detail.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o156"><a name="90520-0010.htm_para17"><a name="09052039000435">However, I echo the comments made by the hon. Member for Milton Keynes, South-West about whether there is to be a minimum period over which the whole process takes place. I fear that it may call into question people&#146;s confidence in the process, if not its legitimacy, if the Secretary of State, who is ultimately the promoter of the policy, decides what the relevant period is. It would therefore help if there was a minimum period, or perhaps a range of time within which the House might expect consideration to take place. The relevant Secretary of State would determine a period within that range, as was appropriate, in consultation with the Liaison Committee and the Select Committee Chairs. That might help to raise confidence in the process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o157"><a name="90520-0010.htm_para18"><a name="09052039000436">There is also the issue of the interaction between the time scale for scrutiny and the consultation process going on in the real world. The Campaign to Protect Rural England has said that it is keen that there should be a period, after the public consultation, when the Select Committee is still giving the matter consideration, so that whatever is fed forward gets through to the Select Committee. That is absolutely right, because it means that the Select Committee can feel confident that it has had access to as much information, and as many of the views of the public, as possible.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right; he has put that on record, and I appreciate his intervention. We have had debates in public, including in the House today, about how the House and indeed the political process at all levels are viewed by the public.

When looking at the resources that are made available to Select Committees, we must bear in mind, especially where there are site-specific concerns, that members of the public may be intimidated, however eloquent and well-informed they are about what is going on in their local community, by being called before a parliamentary Select Committee, alongside organisations that are represented by public affairs consultants and lobbyists. Those members of the public need to be given support, too, to ensure that the excellent points that they have to make are put in the best light possible, and explored as fully as they would wish. I hope that the Minister will say how that concern might be addressed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o159"><a name="90520-0010.htm_para20"><a name="09052039000440">There is also a question to be asked about the policy background against which members of different Select Committees work. Where a Committee is drawn from the membership of different Select Committees, there should be a broad balance; for example, the Committee chaired by the hon. Member for Milton Keynes, South-West, has planning expertise. I have the honour to be on the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee; it should have an equal voice, or at least an appropriately strong voice, on a Joint Committee, alongside Committees that have more expertise in dealing with industry and so on, so that we can ensure that there is a balance of views across the piece.</p>

It is established, and Members are used to using it. There is expertise among the House authorities on how to support Select Committees, provide the information and ensure smooth proceedings. Despite my concerns about timing, and concerns that hon. Members have expressed about the work load, I think that the Select Committee process is the best way of proceeding.</p>

That is why I am pleased to see the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington (John McDonnell). It gets to the heart of what we discussed while the Planning Bill was making progress in the House. We discussed it again this afternoon. Ultimately, there needs to be a vote. There needs to be an opportunity for Members who have great concerns about an issue connected with a national policy statement to vote; they are elected on the same basis as those Members who serve on the relevant Select Committee. We all have equal legitimacy in this House. We are talking about issues that can affect all constituencies; indeed, they may well affect some constituencies considerably more than others. We may hear a little bit about that later. All Members should have a chance to have a final say. That is why I welcome the amendment tabled by the hon. Gentleman. I hope that he will seek to press it to a Division. My colleagues and I certainly wish to support it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o162"><a name="90520-0010.htm_para23"><a name="09052039000443">There is a great deal of work to be done. National policy statements, if handled properly, can make a significant contribution to ensuring that the planning process is more transparent and efficient, and is up to being challenged, as it should be, by the people out there. They may challenge its accuracy and ability to reflect the aspirations of the country as a whole, and the aspirations of local communities. If there are few points at which the democratic process is involved in the part of the planning system that we are discussing, and if decisions on individual applications are to be taken by appointed people, rather than elected people, we should remember, as the Minister for Local Government said in Committee, that it is when policy is set that the democratic voice must be heard. Ultimately, the only way that that can happen is if there is a vote in the House.</p>

 The timing of this debate could not have been more significant. Yesterday, we heard a statement saying that we in Parliament are about to clean up our act when it comes to expenses. I thought the Prime Minister made an excellent statement&#151;which had cross-party support, I noticed&#151;about our starting the process of restoring parliamentary democracy and restoring status to this House as the premises in which we will decide the future of our country in a democratic fashion. This is the first test of whether that statement is serious. I appeal to everyone here: this could be the first day of a new process.</p>

I do not want to talk just about Heathrow or anything like that; the issue is much more important than that. This is much more important than just an arid planning debate, too. The debate is about whether we were serious about the statements made yesterday, which had cross-party support in the House, and about restoring credibility to parliamentary democracy in this country. I urge Members, Ministers and others to say, &#147;Look, this could be the first day of a new debating fashion. This could be a new way to make decisions in this House.&#148; We could come out of the trenches and start talking about a serious way forward to improve the decision-making processes that will affect the lives of millions of our constituents.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o164"><a name="90520-0011.htm_para1"><a name="09052039000446">The discussion that we have had so far has been about how Parliament scrutinises the national policy statements that we have brought forward. I have to say that the debate that has taken place on the scrutiny process has been excellent. To a certain extent it has been on the Floor of the House, but it has largely taken place among Chairs of Select Committees and members of the Liaison Committee. Debate has been limited for those who do not serve on Committees, but as an observer with my nose pressed up against the window, at least I can see that there has been a good debate about how that scrutiny process will proceed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o165"><a name="90520-0011.htm_para2"><a name="09052039000447">But Parliament does more than scrutinise. Parliament has to decide. My amendment is about how the Chamber comes to decisions on critically important matters. I understand the criticism that the Floor of the House is not necessarily the best place for scrutiny and sometimes not the best place for decision making, but for some of us it is the only place. It is the long stop of democracy. It allows us to voice our concerns, move amendments and maybe&#151;not often&#151;secure the will of the House to change the mind of Government and others. There is no more important issue than the planning process that we are deciding today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o166"><a name="90520-0011.htm_para3"><a name="09052039000448">We are setting up the Infrastructure Planning Commission. Alongside that, we have to a certain extent&#151;I know some believe that others have exaggerated this&#151;curtailed some of the earlier planning processes in relation to individual applications to try to speed the process up. There are some concerns that members of the public, people who are affected, individual organisations, community groups and so on may not have as full a say and right of representation as they have in the past under previous processes. That is a matter for debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o167"><a name="90520-0011.htm_para4"><a name="09052039000449">If there has been some curtailment of the earlier process, it is critical that when we shape the IPC&#146;s decision-making process, we allow the fullest scrutiny and debate, and ultimately democratic decisions. The IPC will be guided by the national policy statements. It will set the parameters for consideration of and decisions on planning applications for major infrastructure projects which will determine the future shape of this country and its physical environment for generations to come. It will affect the lives of hundreds of thousands of constituents and millions of members of our communities. Such projects will include airports, nuclear power stations and major rail developments, most of which are extremely controversial because of their impact on local communities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o168"><a name="90520-0011.htm_para5"><a name="09052039000450">National policy statements are not general policy statements, as my hon. Friend the Member for Southampton, Test (Dr. Whitehead) pointed out. They are not like the old-fashioned planning policy guidelines. They are more than that. They are in some respects like White Papers, but more definitive. The White Paper on aviation, for example, which was mentioned earlier, was site-specific. National policy statements will set a policy and identify potential sites for the implementation of that policy. They will therefore narrow the decision-making process of the IPC.</p>

 I agree. That is why the present hybrid situation calls for greater democratic participation by the Chamber.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o169"><a name="90520-0011.htm_para6"><a name="09052039000453">I am aware of the issues in relation to the quasi-judicial aspects of planning. I have served on planning committees on a range of bodies, including the old GLC, and I have seen the mystification of the planning process through the concept of quasi-judicial roles. I learned the Wednesbury principles by heart, not least because at the GLC we had the Economic League threatening us with legal action almost on a daily basis. That mystifies the process. We are trying to set the parameters of policy making and define them for the IPC, which will set up the processes whereby individual decisions are made.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o170"><a name="90520-0011.htm_para7"><a name="09052039000454">Setting up national policy statements, agreeing to them and having them designated by the Government as guidance for the IPC is critical. I welcome the role of Select Committees. I accept that it will be an onerous task, but Members of Parliament can demonstrate that they can rise to the task. I urge Members who have been critical of the Select Committee process so far to engage in it. There is potential for more Members to become involved and become more aware, but I agree that the process requires the resourcing of those who will provide evidence to those Select Committees.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o171"><a name="90520-0011.htm_para8"><a name="09052039000455">I have attended planning inquiry after planning inquiry for years and I do not want to relive my experiences at the terminal 4 inquiry, the terminal 5 inquiry and all the rest. We know how evidence can be presented and shaped effectively by those who are well resourced. Those who may not have the ability to commission a bit of extra research&#151;on respiratory conditions in their area, for example&#151;are swamped by the heavy investment of those promoting a particular project or approach.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o172"><a name="90520-0011.htm_para9"><a name="09052039000456">There are some Members who do not serve on Select Committees. I cannot understand why&#151;further mystification, perhaps. I was offered a place on the Northern Ireland Committee on the basis that I dropped my opposition to the City of London (Ward Elections) Bill.

A vote makes scrutiny meaningful. We can all scrutinise something; we can all have general opinions about anything, but our constituents send us here not just to have opinions but to decide the policies of this country. That is what my amendment seeks to do.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o174"><a name="90520-0011.htm_para11"><a name="09052039000458">The amendment suggests that when the Select Committee process has ended, a report is provided to the House. If it is uncontentious and the Select Committee recommends approval, we have a debate for a maximum of one and a half hours, the Question is put and the statement is agreed or not. If it is contentious, and there are recommendations from the Select Committee not to approve the national policy statement, a debate of up to three hours is held, and then we vote on the matter.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o175"><a name="90520-0011.htm_para12"><a name="09052039000459">One and a half hours or three hours is not an undue delay in the planning process. It will add legitimacy to any decision on a national policy statement that will influence the IPC&#146;s decision, which will have consequences for decisions on major infrastructure projects affecting our constituents, many of them significantly. If we are not allowed a vote on those matters, that will undermine the legitimacy of the decisions that will eventually arise as a result of IPC considerations and IPC inquiries into individual matters.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o176"><a name="90520-0011.htm_para13"><a name="09052039000460">Let me give the example of Heathrow in the context of my amendment. Like every hon. Member, I stood for election, knocked on every door in my constituency over the years, and explained my views on particular issues. People voted and I had the honour of being elected to become the voice of my constituents in the House. As a result of a potential planning decision that will come through this process, a number of my constituents will lose their homes. We have debated the matter at length in the House&#151;700 homes could be lost at Sipson, and 2,000 residents could lose their homes. We have another meeting tomorrow night with BAA, and we think the figure is now 4,000 homes, as the Government predicted in the early 1990s, so perhaps 10,000 people will be affected, as well as their homes, schools, churches, the gurdwara and even a road through our cemetery. Those people want to know that they elected an MP not just to go to the House to talk on their behalf, but to participate in this country&#146;s democratic decision-making process that will determine the policy that eventually influences the final decision on whether they lose their homes and communities. That is all my amendment would do. It simply says, &#147;Allow Members to express their views, but then allow them to make the decision.&#148; That is democracy, is it not? Is that not what Parliament is for? Is that not what we all stood for election for?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o177"><a name="90520-0011.htm_para14"><a name="09052039000461">The argument is that a planning policy statement is different from any other decision, but when the Crossrail project went through the House, we had a Committee that brought a Bill before the House that we could debate and amend, and there was a full and democratic decision-making process. Why can we not just have a simple vote? I am not asking for enormous, lengthy Committee sittings. We have the Select Committee process, and there are relevant Members on those Committees, some with expertise going back many years, who can give us their views. We can listen to their opinion on the matter, the Government can state their argument and, at the end of the day, we can, I hope, come to a decision.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o178"><a name="90520-0011.htm_para15"><a name="09052039000462">Democracy is at stake. The issue is whether what we said yesterday about restoring the status and democratic credentials of Parliament was what we really intended, or whether it was just words upon the air and another form of spin. The forthcoming vote is one of the most important that we will ever have, because it will decide whether we are serious about restoring democracy. If the Government do not think again, and if we are not allowed the opportunity to vote on this issue, which could be influential and important to so many of our constituents, we will not just do ourselves a disservice, but, yet again, undermine the credibility of the House in the eyes of all our constituents.</p>

myself as a natural ally of his, on this legislation we have been at one, and on the Floor of the House we have regularly fought the battle to try to get a final democratic lock on national policy statements. I suppose that we should therefore congratulate ourselves on one thing&#151;the fact that we were able to do battle on the Floor of the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o179"><a name="90520-0011.htm_para16"><a name="09052039000464">I agree that, following the events of the past few weeks and yesterday&#146;s statements, it is so important for the House to get back its democratic accountability and credibility. This is a great opportunity for the Government to put their money where their mouth is and give back to Parliament some of the legitimacy that they have taken away over the past few years. I was therefore delighted when my hon. Friend the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Robert Neill), and constituency neighbour, indicated that we would support the amendment and, if there were an opportunity, go further&#151;although we will stick with what we have for now.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o180"><a name="90520-0011.htm_para17"><a name="09052039000465">The hon. Gentleman couched the debate in stark terms. There is no disagreement in any part of the House about the need for the national policy statements. We must replace and renew our infrastructure, and it is important that we get on with that work. We have put forward ideas for getting on with it in a practical sense and more rapidly than the current system, but we have always accepted the idea of the national policy statements. We have always been against the Infrastructure Planning Commission, however, because it is fundamentally undemocratic and we want to return to Parliament and to Ministers the responsibility that the British public believe they have to make the final decisions on planning. The hon. Gentleman said that that is the mystique of the quasi-judicial process, and we understand that, but to the British public, the Minister is the person who is responsible for making decisions about airports, roads, harbours, waste facilities, nuclear power stations and wind farms. That is absolutely correct, and the Planning Act 2008 does tremendous harm to the idea of the democracy of the people, because it allows Ministers to pass over to an unelected quango the decision that the British people feel Ministers were elected to make.</p>

As one who has sat on several Select Committees, I am deeply sceptical about the value of their work, and I apologise if there are people here who are wedded to the idea of them. However, I do not know whether I want the Whips to hear this, because I think that sitting on inquiries into the national policy statements would be a very interesting and worthwhile exercise. I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for West Chelmsford (Mr. Burns) has not made a note of that statement!</p>

Friend the Member for Hayes and Harlington (John McDonnell) admirably enumerated all the reasons why the House should support the amendment in his name and the names of colleagues such as me. Throughout discussion of the Planning Bill&#151;or the Planning Act 2008, as it is now&#151;I said that my starting point was to apply one test: how far did it maintain or improve the existing process in respect of my constituents, of me as their elected representative or of any other member of a community? My view is that the legislation dramatically failed that test.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o189"><a name="90520-0011.htm_para26"><a name="09052039000479">It would not be appropriate for me to rehearse that debate and I shall resist the temptation, as other Members have. However, there is a democratic deficit. The process that existed previously allowed the public not only to make a case at a public inquiry, but to subject the evidence to cross-examination; that is a fundamental democratic issue, and also one of fairness. There is now a major gap and chasm in the process. My hon. Friend has clearly defined why he tabled his amendment, and one of his reasons for doing so is to try to bridge that chasm.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o190"><a name="90520-0011.htm_para27"><a name="09052039000480">It has been said on a number of occasions in this debate that national policy statements will be a crucial framework. It is crucial, therefore, that we get them right. Once they are agreed, the die will be cast; they will be the tram lines on which public inquiries and the Infrastructure Planning Commission will run. We know from experience that communities often disagree with specific proposals put forward by developers, and that many of the protests that our constituents make will be overridden by reference to the existing national policy statement that governs the particular planning application or major infrastructure proposal under discussion. That is why we have to get NPSs absolutely right.</p>

Friend is recommending is a democratic backstop; he got there first in using that phrase, but I reiterate it. If our constituents, wherever they live, feel individually or collectively that they have been stripped of a right that currently exists, they will look to us, as their elected representatives, to perform that role of backstop, which is why the amendment is so crucial.</p>

They would probably think that common sense had gone out of the window, because although the motion is complex, it entirely misses the point that what the planning system lacks is real democratic accountability. The Government have underestimated the extent of public anger and suspicion about the planning process and the public&#146;s lack of trust in the planning process and in those who take planning decisions. In all the years that I have been involved in planning matters, I cannot recall a time when the planning system has been so characterised by confrontation and all-pervading conspiracy theories because of the lack of transparency that occurs in relation to almost any major decision. It would be easy to characterise that as nimbyism, and many do, but that is so insulting to the people and communities who have genuine concerns to raise about large projects. The attitude of the public owes a lot to the lack of democratic accountability in the system at all levels.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o195"><a name="90520-0012.htm_para4"><a name="09052039000486">The Minister referred to the need for consultation during the process.

People do not trust the consultation process, and I would like to hear whether he has any more ideas about how he is going to put trust back into it. Is it to be based around the sort of consultation that we have seen for some of the regional spatial strategies? In my area, the south-east plan did not go out of its way to involve ordinary people. It involved the great and the good&#151;even some of the great and the good in the county councils and district councils&#151;but it failed to have any resonance at all with ordinary people on the  <br>

<p><a name="stpa_o196"><a name="90520-0012.htm_para5"><a name="09052039000487">I am a great admirer of Select Committees. I know that I have not been here as long as many Members who are present in the Chamber, but I am on a Select Committee and enjoy its work very much. I particularly enjoy the opportunity that it provides to delve into matters in detail and question Ministers, officials and other experts at great length. However, that misses the point that what people want is the scrutiny and decision making in this House that, as my hon. Friend the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Robert Neill) said, allows a constituent to come and ask us, &#147;How did you vote on this particular issue?&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o197"><a name="90520-0012.htm_para6"><a name="09052039000488">The Floor of the House is a perfectly proper place for discussions on documents such as national policy statements, because they are not purely planning documents.

It is perfectly proper that that should be debated on the Floor of the House and, in fact, I would feel upset if I did not have the opportunity to influence a decision on such a wide issue.</p>

It is one of the most spineless inventions that we have seen in the planning system. As I said in my earlier intervention, over the past few years the planning system has been deliberately moved towards being the delivery arm of Government policy. That is the right direction, because planning does not exist in an isolated world of its own. It is there to deliver whatever the policies of the Government are, and I have no problem with that. I do have a problem with the inconsistency that follows, which means that when it comes to contentious national projects, the Government want to hide behind a whole new structure that takes them out of the picture.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o200"><a name="90520-0012.htm_para9"><a name="09052039000491">The planning system that we have at the moment is one of the most highly fragmented that I have come across. Bits of planning decisions are taken here, bits there and bits in other places. There is little interaction in the system between national policy statements and the planning policy statements and guidance. I join my hon. Friends in welcoming some form of national policy statement for infrastructure projects, but the debate has moved on. There must now be a big argument about whether it is right for national policy statements to be stand-alone documents or whether they should be included in something much broader that establishes an overall policy framework for the country, priorities within that and the tools and means of delivering it. If the Minister wishes to have an example of how that might work, let me point out that whenever I talk to planning consultants, they start to go weepy-eyed and enthusiastic about what   <br>

<a name="90520-0012.htm_brev1"><a name="09052039001729"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;In general, the use of judicial review should be considered very much as a last resort as it is risky&#148;&#151;</p>

 My hon. Friend the Member for Hayes and Harlington (John McDonnell) is right that there could not be a better time for the House to debate the amendment to the proposals for national policy statements. There is a call for a root-and-branch rethink of what Parliament is about&#151;not only how we manage our expenses, but how we accept responsibility for the big issues that affect people&#146;s lives and the country&#146;s future, and how we hold ourselves accountable in that process. It is also true, as my hon. Friend the Member for Pudsey (Mr. Truswell) said, that we lost the right in the Planning Act 2008 for the public to hold people to account for big decisions through planning inquiries. There remains the role of the House in holding people to account for the big decisions of state.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o204"><a name="90520-0012.htm_para13"><a name="09052039000496">Although it is important to build consultation and scrutiny into decision making, and both are necessary conditions of a democratic process, they are not sufficient to define its existence. The third element, which completes the process, is accountability. A great difficulty&#151;and a source of frustration to me during my time in Parliament&#151;is the way in which Parliament has been stripped out of the democratic process because we have farmed out accountability for decision-making responsibilities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o205"><a name="90520-0012.htm_para14"><a name="09052039000497">I am sure that the Minister has read the novel, &#147;Catch-22&#148;. I invite him to reflect on one of the characters: Major Major. He did not want to be in the army but ended up there because it was a family tradition, and became a major. However, he hated the responsibility for making decisions, so he found a way of surviving by introducing a rule whereby every member of the armed forces was free to consult him and put requests to him at any time, as long he was not there. Only when he was in his office were the doors closed. That was an effective way of not making any difficult decisions. My worry is that Parliament has been reduced to that position.  <br>

Whenever there were big decisions to be made, we were not there. That would persist under the proposed framework.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o206"><a name="90520-0012.htm_para15"><a name="09052039000498">Of course, we can have scrutiny and consultations, but when a matter comes before the House, we may, at best, be able to vote on a motion. As every Member knows, that often amounts to voting on no more than whether to adjourn. I am sure that most Members have experienced the great difficulty of explaining to their constituents their monumental and heroic stance in deciding whether to vote to adjourn the debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o207"><a name="90520-0012.htm_para16"><a name="09052039000499">Do we continue with a procedure that will take us nowhere, or abandon it? Such a procedure does not help with credibility; it does not cut much ice when we try to address the issue of the House accepting the responsibilities that go with our standing for election to make decisions about the major issues that affect people&#146;s lives. The amendment before us today would restore the House&#146;s right to cast a substantive vote. That does not seem a particularly radical proposal: it just says that the House takes itself seriously and that we recognise that there is often an important distinction to be drawn between the interests of the Government and the interests of Parliament. It is Parliament&#146;s role to hold the Government to account. The ways in which we do so include the right to have a vote on a substantive motion.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o208"><a name="90520-0012.htm_para17"><a name="09052039000500">I understand that the quasi-judicial interpretation of planning responsibilities is often wheeled out in an attempt to discourage politicians from interfering in decision-making processes. So too is the argument that, often, an issue will be of such enormous importance that it just has to be decided upon without undue delay. Our proposal would not cause any undue delay at all, but it does accept that the House can, and frequently does, bring to the scrutiny process something that can counteract the inequalities built into the consultation process, however open it may be.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o209"><a name="90520-0012.htm_para18"><a name="09052039000501">A number of hon. Members have mentioned the fact that huge inequalities of power, resources and influence are built into the planning processes. Those same inequalities are built into the ability to make representations to our Select Committee hearings. One countervailing power that is frequently demonstrated in the House is the ability of hon. Members from all parties to come here remarkably well informed and remarkably unafraid to put the arguments that many of their constituents are unable to muster either the confidence or the resources to put themselves.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o210"><a name="90520-0012.htm_para19"><a name="09052039000502">Our proposal would be an enhancement of the democratic process. It would give the House the right to define a position that may not suit what the Government want to do. Ultimately, if this House considers itself to be the guardian of democratic processes and part of the arm lock, which requires democratic accountability to be exercised in this Chamber, it is right that we should reserve the right to say no and to tell the Government of the day, whatever Government they may be, that we do not agree with their policy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o211"><a name="90520-0012.htm_para20"><a name="09052039000503">A substantive right to a vote on such statements would restore that to the House. It would indicate, at this hugely important point in restoring our democratic credentials for the future, that we are unafraid to put down a marker and exercise the one duty that every member of our electorate assumes that we have when we are elected, which is to come to the House and cast a vote that has a meaning.

<p><a name="stpa_o212"><a name="90520-0012.htm_para21"><a name="09052039000505">As I intimated in an intervention, my difficulty in approaching the motion relates to the status of a national planning policy statement, which will clearly be a hybrid. It will be based partly on what regularly happens at the Dispatch Box when a Minister makes a statement on Government policy, takes questions and sits down, with no vote being taken. Such statements can be prayed in aid, one way or another, in a planning inquiry, even though they are not specifically related to it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o213"><a name="90520-0012.htm_para22"><a name="09052039000506">On the other hand, the national planning policy statements that are envisaged will go substantially beyond the point at which they could be regarded simply as a Government statement&#151;they will be much more substantial. In some ways, they will more closely resemble planning policy guidance statements, which also are not subject to a vote on the Floor of the House before they are completed, but which nevertheless go before planning inquiries and play a substantial part in determining the framework of the inquiry. Indeed, people on both sides of the inquiry will refer to parts of the guidance statement to support their case.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o214"><a name="90520-0012.htm_para23"><a name="09052039000507">I thoroughly support the scrutiny that now takes place. A good job was done in ensuring that, by the time the Planning Bill became an Act, procedures had been incorporated to enable such scrutiny. The motion reflects the follow-on from what emerged in the Planning Act 2008.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o215"><a name="90520-0012.htm_para24"><a name="09052039000508">There is a choice between the scrutiny being undertaken by either a Select Committee or a Committee set up by the Liaison Committee specifically for the purpose, but I feel that a preference should be expressed. One might say that a Select Committee would normally be asked to scrutinise a proposed document and that, exceptionally, a Committee might be set up for the purpose. At the moment, there seems to be an either/or that is neutral on which option is preferred. Perhaps we should suggest a preference.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o216"><a name="90520-0012.htm_para25"><a name="09052039000509">Should a Select Committee discuss a planning statement? Because it is a statement, it is extremely unlikely that the Committee would simply say, &#147;No, we don&#146;t like the apparent policy behind the statement, so we will not endorse it in any way, shape or form&#148;, in order to bring it back to the House. Instead, it would discuss the detail, as in a Bill Committee, and report its conclusions. It might suggest a number of changes to the detail, but it is extremely unlikely&#151;to the point of its not happening&#151;that a Select Committee would fundamentally disagree with the concept behind it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o217"><a name="90520-0012.htm_para26"><a name="09052039000510">I therefore have some difficulty with the amendment, which appears to suggest that a member of a Committee could come before the House and say, &#147;No, we don&#146;t like the whole idea of the policy,&#148; and we would have to debate that and vote.</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o219"><a name="90520-0012.htm_para28"><a name="09052039000512">However, if either House of Parliament passed a policy resolution on the proposal, it would not be logical for the Secretary of State simply to lay a statement responding to the resolution, because the resolution would essentially override what the Secretary of State might say about the policy principle behind the planning document being considered by the Select Committee.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o220"><a name="90520-0012.htm_para29"><a name="09052039000513">Let me provide an example. I support in principle the National Planning Commission dealing with large infrastructure projects and nationally significant planning proposals. I do so partly because I would like a number of issues relating to the development of renewable and sustainable energy to be dealt with speedily and effectively&#151;with proper consultation and discussion, but without the immense delays that we sometimes encounter. I also accept, however, that the same process could speed up development of nuclear power, which I think is a bad idea for this country&#146;s energy policy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o221"><a name="90520-0012.htm_para30"><a name="09052039000514">We should not forget that the purpose of national policy statements is to inform the considerations of the National Planning Commission. If, before the proposals in either of the two examples I have given had reached the point of being scrutinised by a Select Committee or gone through the Infrastructure Planning Commission&#146;s planning inquiry process, the House considered a motion stating that either nuclear power or large-scale offshore wind was a bad idea, that would presumably trump or prevent Select Committee discussion of any statement. Indeed, that consideration is more important than requiring the Secretary of State to lay before Parliament a statement setting out his response to the resolution or recommendations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o222"><a name="90520-0012.htm_para31"><a name="09052039000515">The Secretary of State may lay before Parliament a statement on the recommendations of a Select Committee, but if he was laying a response to a resolution that overrode the policy behind the statement, it would be insufficient and inappropriate simply to respond by laying a statement before Parliament. That underlines the hybrid nature of national planning statements. On the one hand, they are a statement of Government policy, but on the other, they are a planning policy guideline&#151;and even if they are a statement of Government policy, they are a statement in the context of a wider palette of policies that can properly be the subject of a resolution before the House to define whether that policy is appropriate. That is an important element in these proceedings. I would be grateful for the Minister&#146;s clarification of whether my understanding of the process is accurate.</p>

I have complete confidence in the bona fides of my hon. Friend the Minister and, indeed, those of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State, but I am not necessarily confident that, for all time, everyone will be in exactly the same position. The motion should be amended to ensure that the process of bringing documentation to the Floor of the House for guaranteed debate is followed through.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o226"><a name="90520-0012.htm_para35"><a name="09052039000519">I have concerns about how a substantive vote at the end of that process is to be interpreted, bearing in mind what I said about a resolution. However, today&#146;s debate has drawn attention to a lacuna in how the process might reach its logical conclusion. If we can get that right, we shall have a process that deals with how statements are presented to the House and how they interact with the planning process, and that ensures that proper scrutiny and the voice of the House are taken fully into account.</p>

 I apologise for not being present at the start of the debate. As I explained to you, Madam Deputy Speaker, I was engaged in specific business for my constituents.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o227"><a name="90520-0013.htm_para0"><a name="09052039000521">The 2008 Act represents all that is wrong with Parliament today. Had it existed years ago when my predecessor, Sir Bernard Braine, was around, he would not have been able to defend the people of Castle Point from dangerous industrial petrochemical operations on Canvey Island. The people of Castle Point feel that the Act removes their democratic rights and protections. To say that they are deeply worried about the removal of their right to be represented in the House, and the right of their Member of Parliament to defend them again, as I certainly would, is an understatement. In fact, they are deeply angry about the Act, which is why I wholeheartedly support the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington (John McDonnell). We are indebted to him for his efforts.</p>

It is a COMAH site&#151;COMAH stands for &#147;control of major accident hazards&#148;&#151;that is operated by Calorgas, which wants massively to intensify its use of the site. The Health and Safety Executive is conducting a criminal investigation into a recent spillage of 163 tonnes of liquefied petroleum gas, which caused an unconfined vapour cloud. Had the cloud met a source of ignition, we would have experienced a Buncefield with bells on&#151;a much greater accident with multiple tank involvement.</p>

<p><a name="st_o251"><a name="09052039000524"><a name="90520-0013.htm_spmin0"><a name="09052039002077"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government (Mr. Iain Wright):</b>
 I thank hon. Members for their incisive contributions, and I wish to respond to some of their concerns.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o230"><a name="90520-0013.htm_para3"><a name="09052039000525">Essentially, there have been two interlinked themes to the debate. First, there is a wish for reassurance on the relevant period&#151;the time scale for public consultation and, more crucially in this case perhaps, for the House to debate these important matters of national infrastructure. Secondly, there is concern about the role of Divisions, votes and debates as part of the planning consultation process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o231"><a name="90520-0013.htm_para4"><a name="09052039000526">Several Members wanted assurance that the Secretary of State will determine the relevant period in consultation with the Liaison Committee and be prepared to extend it whenever necessary. My hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, South-West (Dr. Starkey), Chair of the Communities and Local Government Committee, asked that the period be not less than six months. The relevant period needs to be long enough to incorporate three important underlying elements: the period of public consultation, which is normally three months; the overhang period of four to six weeks after the close of public consultation during which the relevant Select Committee scrutinising the matter will conclude its report; and the crucial further period of six weeks or 40 days in which the Government would&#151;not might&#151;make time for debate if the Committee recommended that that was warranted. In reality, the relevant period would be about six months, but we did not want the motion to impose a rigid time scale because we think it is important for the Select Committee to have flexibility. That third element that I mentioned is crucial: whether there should be a debate and a vote is decided not by the Government, but by the Select Committee.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o232"><a name="90520-0013.htm_para5"><a name="09052039000527">Let me move on to my second point, on debates and holding Ministers and policy to account.</p>

<p><a name="st_o252"><a name="09052039000528"><a name="90520-0013.htm_spnew1"><a name="09052039002078"><b>Dan Rogerson:</b>
 Before the Minister moves on, may I make a point? He used the word &#147;normally&#148; in his responses on the previous issue. While I very much welcome the proposal for a 40-day period, there is to be no indication to a Secretary of State on what the overall period should be. I see no objection to setting out a minimum period.</p>

<p><a name="st_o253"><a name="09052039000529"><a name="90520-0013.htm_spnew2"><a name="09052039002079"><b>Mr. Wright:</b>
 There might be an amendment to a national policy statement, or the matter being considered might be relatively minor, and in those circumstances there would be no benefit in having a rigid six-month policy. The time necessary can be determined by liaison between the relevant Secretary of State, the Select Committee and the Liaison Committee, in accordance with an assessment of the importance of the matter being scrutinised. Through providing such flexibility and ensuring that the Select Committee is in the driving seat, we have demonstrated that we consider parliamentary scrutiny to be vital. We welcome that, we want it and we have introduced the motion to ensure that it happens.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o233"><a name="90520-0013.htm_para6"><a name="09052039000530">Several hon. Members made the point that national policy statements are policy statements and that is, of course, correct. As such, national policy statements are the Government&#146;s responsibility. It is the job of the House to scrutinise and challenge, and to hold Ministers to account, and the motion permits that. To borrow the vivid words used by my hon. Friend the Member for Hayes and Harlington (John McDonnell), the motion allows hon. Members to help to change the Government&#146;s mind where that is necessary. None of our proposals would prevent that from happening. Importantly, they provide the flexibility to allow that to happen.</p>

 If the hon. Lady will forgive me, I will not, as I want to move on, and, with the greatest respect, she has not been present for the whole debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o234"><a name="90520-0013.htm_para7"><a name="09052039000533">Given that the motion provides flexibility and the important opportunity for rigorous challenge of Ministers, it ensures that the House has the utmost ability to scrutinise national policy statements in Parliament.

<a name="90520-0014.htm_brev38"><a name="09052039001773"><ul><p class="tabletext">That the Communications (Television Licensing) (Amendment) Regulations 2009 (S.I., 2009, No. 505), dated 26 February 2009, a copy of which was laid before this House on 9 March, be revoked.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o239"><a name="90520-0014.htm_para1"><a name="09052039001512">It is a pleasure to be supported by so many staunch supporters of the BBC on the Conservative Benches.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o240"><a name="90520-0014.htm_para2"><a name="09052039001513">The Communications (Television Licensing) (Amendment) Regulations 2009 came into force on 1 April. They increase the cost of a black and white television licence by &#163;1 to &#163;48, which may or may not trouble the hon. Member for Sunderland, South (Mr. Mullin) who, we learned today, has had the same black and white television for 31 years, to his credit. The regulations increase the price of a colour TV licence from &#163;139.50 to &#163;142.50.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o241"><a name="90520-0014.htm_para3"><a name="09052039001514">Why have we called this debate over a &#163;3 increase in the licence fee? We have done so partly because of the MP expenses issue that has engulfed the House over the past two weeks. It has shown that the public are justifiably angry about the misuse of their money, whether in small sums or large, which has reminded the House to respect the taxpayers who pay our salaries. The same surely applies to all publicly funded organisations, including the BBC.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o242"><a name="90520-0014.htm_para4"><a name="09052039001515">We have called for the debate also partly because the economic situation has changed beyond recognition since January 2007, when the current licence fee settlement was made. With 2.2 million people unemployed and many people facing dire personal financial circumstances, it is surely right to ask whether an increase that may have seemed reasonable in 2007 is still justified.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o243"><a name="90520-0014.htm_para5"><a name="09052039001516">We should also put the rise in context. In 1997, the licence fee was &#163;91.50. Since then, it has increased by 56 per cent.&#151;almost double the retail prices index rate of inflation. When the BBC&#146;s commercial rivals are struggling, sometimes for their very existence, licence fee payers have been treating the BBC incredibly generously.</p>

 Does my hon. Friend agree that his last point gets to the heart of the matter? Since the licence fee settlement was agreed, broadcasting&#146;s economic climate has changed, and it is unsustainable for every other, commercial, broadcaster to manage on less money each year while the BBC has a never-ending increase in its income.</p>

<p><a name="st_o258"><a name="09052039001518"><a name="90520-0014.htm_spnew2"><a name="09052039003047"><b>Mr. Hunt:</b>
 My hon. Friend does a very good job of developing my argument for me. I shall continue if I may, but he is absolutely right and his point is an important one, because the 2007 settlement was based on some key assumptions about the broadcasting market. The first was about the rate of inflation. That year, RPI inflation was 4.3 per cent., and as hon. Members may recall, that was the year in which the Governor of the Bank of England had to send a letter to the Chancellor, apologising for the fact that he had overshot his target. It was also the year in which there was an assumption that, as the commercial broadcasting market grew, the BBC would need to keep up. Both assumptions must be radically re-examined.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o244"><a name="90520-0014.htm_para6"><a name="09052039001519">Yesterday, RPI inflation fell to minus 1.2 per cent., the steepest fall since 1948. That means that programme inflation, the cost of buying and commissioning programmes, is also falling, and with Channel 4&#146;s revenues down 18 per cent. and ITV&#146;s revenues down 19 per cent. in the first part of this year, there is less competition to buy and commission programmes. The traditional parity between licence fee revenue and the revenue that goes to commercial broadcasters funded by advertising has been lost. Last year, there was a broad equivalence between the two sums of money, but this year it is expected that licence fee revenue will amount to &#163;500 million more than the entire sum received by all the commercial broadcasters funded by advertising put together.</p>

<p><a name="st_o259"><a name="09052039001520"><a name="90520-0014.htm_spnew3"><a name="09052039003048"><b>Mr. William Cash (Stone) (Con):</b>
 On the question of independent producers, is my hon. Friend concerned about the uncompetitive nature of some contracts that the BBC enters into in-house? I believe that such cosy contracts do exist. If producers inside the BBC are being subsidised and independent producers are not able to compete fairly, does not my hon. Friend think that the Public Accounts Committee should have the right to examine the BBC&#146;s accounts, as I and the Committee&#146;s Chairman, my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough (Mr. Leigh), have argued for many years?</p>

<p><a name="st_o260"><a name="09052039001521"><a name="90520-0014.htm_spnew4"><a name="09052039003049"><b>Mr. Hunt:</b>
 I absolutely agree with my hon. Friend on that point. I visited some independent production studios in Kent, which made that very point to me, saying that they were unable to compete for contracts to produce BBC programmes because they were outbid by the BBC&#146;s in-house production facilities, which the independents believed were less competitive than they were. There are problems, and I wholeheartedly agree that the National Audit Office should be able to examine the BBC&#146;s accounts at will and without permission and prior agreement, just as it can with most other public bodies. That is a very important point.</p>

 Before the previous intervention, the hon. Gentleman made the entirely accurate point that the advertising slump has seen a huge chunk of money taken out of ITV&#146;s revenue and therefore out of commercial production. However, there seems to be an odd logic in saying that ITV&#146;s losing &#163;500 million is a pretext to take tens of millions of pounds out of the BBC&#146;s budget. If we are losing hundreds of millions of pounds from production because of the advertising slump, is it not true that now is not the time to cut the licence fee?</p>

<p><a name="st_o262"><a name="09052039001523"><a name="90520-0014.htm_spnew6"><a name="09052039003051"><b>Mr. Hunt:</b>
 Is the hon. Gentleman suggesting that the only way to deal with the commercial predicament faced by ITV, Channel 4 and all the other commercial broadcasters is to pump more money into the BBC through the licence fee? ITV says that, next year, the disparity between advertising-funded broadcasters and the BBC will be &#163;1 billion. There comes a point when commercially funded broadcasters are simply not able to compete with the BBC in producing programmes for large audiences. When the BBC&#146;s commercial rivals can spend less on programming and when the BBC&#146;s own costs are falling, we have to ask whether it is appropriate for the corporation to have an inflation-busting &#163;68 million rise.</p>

 I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman, who has been generous in giving way.

He is remarking that hundreds of millions of pounds have been taken out of broadcasting because of the advertising slump and saying that we should therefore take another &#163;75 million from the BBC.

 I should like to pick up the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Inverclyde (David Cairns). The hon. Gentleman has said that he has spoken to independent producers who cannot get their programmes on the BBC because of unfair competition within the corporation. However, despite the quotas that the BBC already has, if more money is taken from the corporation there will be less chance of getting more independent production into the BBC. The hon. Gentleman is arguing against his own case.</p>

 I am grateful to the hon. Lady for her intervention. We are talking about a &#163;68 million rise in the licence fee in the context of a total licence fee income of &#163;3.6 billion. I do not believe that it would be impossible for the BBC to find savings of &#163;68 million without its ability to commission programmes from the independent sector being affected in any way.</p>

 In Yorkshire, we have just discovered that ITV is closing down &#147;Heartbeat&#148;, &#147;A Touch of Frost&#148; and &#147;Sharpe&#148;&#151;excellent productions that attract high-volume audiences. I do not know what we are going to do about that, and it is not the BBC&#146;s responsibility. At the same time, the BBC is investing, certainly in the north-west. For the sake of creative talent, surely this is not the time to start cutting back on funding for the BBC.</p>

 It is excellent that the BBC is investing in our regions. However, we also have to consider whether it is giving value for money; &#163;3.6 billion is a lot of money. I shall go on to talk about some of the things on which it spends the money&#151;things that I think do not represent good value for money. At a time of great economic difficulty for many licence fee payers, it is legitimate to ask whether the money is being well spent.</p>

 Does my hon.

It is not like the private sector; I do not mind people earning a lot of money if others pay willingly for their services. Should not the BBC look at all its people who are paid very much more than the Prime Minister, many of them with the opportunity to earn outside the BBC as well? I do not begrudge them doing that, but should we not at least control their BBC wages?</p>

 My right hon. Friend makes an important point. In fact, 50 people at the BBC are paid more than the Prime Minister. I thought that his point about taking care with small sums of money from people who might well not be able to afford an additional rise would be well taken by Labour Members, particularly as the Leader of the House announced today that the licence fee will not be eligible for the additional costs allowance. If any MPs were wavering on this issue, that should completely persuade them to support the motion.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o245"><a name="90520-0014.htm_para7"><a name="09052039001532">We have had a week when many have questioned the very roots of our democracy, and there is a democratic issue at stake in this context too. A free society needs multiple and varied media sources. However excellent the BBC is&#151;I believe that much of what it produces is world class and a credit to the UK&#151;other broadcasters need to be able to flourish as well, and different voices need to be able to be heard, because that is how we provide choice for consumers and engagement for citizens. Conservative Members have always recognised the importance of plurality of provision. It was Conservative Governments who licensed ITV in 1955 and Channel 4 in 1982, unleashed the satellite and cable revolutions of the 1980s, and licensed Channel 5 in 1997.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o246"><a name="90520-0014.htm_para8"><a name="09052039001533">What has the BBC done when faced with all this competition? It has flourished. It is completely false to say that there is a choice between competition and quality. It is because British public service broadcasting is the most competitive in the world that many people think that it is of the highest quality in the world. In order for that to continue, there must be a sensible balance between the revenue that commercial broadcasters are able to raise and what the BBC gets, and many will ask whether that is possible if there is a &#163;1 billion gap between state-funded broadcasters and the rest.</p>

 The point about the current impact on production has been well made by my hon. Friends. The BBC is also clearly playing a vital role in digital switchover. Its business plan has been well developed following a settlement in 2007 that was much below what it wanted. The hon. Gentleman&#146;s proposals could destabilise that business plan. In the Select Committee on Culture, Media and Sport, we examine the BBC all the time. I am sure that no member of the Committee would like to pre-empt the conclusions of a possible future inquiry. Nevertheless, we have considered top-slicing and recommended it in relation to Channel 4, and encouraged the BBC not to draw down the whole of the licence fee, and no member of the Committee has endorsed any such proposals as the hon.

The Government may say that we are attacking the principle of six-yearly settlements, so let me scotch that. We support the idea of multi-year settlements because it is important to protect the editorial independence of the BBC. The BBC must be impartial. It should not be subject to the political weather, but it should respond to the economic climate, and that is what this debate is about.</p>

The BBC, too, needs to maintain its bond of trust with the British people, which means understanding that when times are tough, it should not just pocket the money allocated to it in happier times. It should listen to people&#146;s concerns and respond to the changed economic circumstances of 2009. Waiving this year&#146;s 3 per cent. licence fee rise would do just that, and I urge wiser heads at the BBC, in the Government and in the House to respond accordingly.</p>

Friend the Member for Dulwich and West Norwood (Tessa Jowell), the then Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, struck precisely that careful balance between the interests of the BBC and those of licence fee payers when she set out to the House the current six-year settlement&#151;annual nominal increases in the licence fee of 3 per cent. for the first two years; 2 per cent. in years 3, 4 and 5, and between 0 per cent. and 2 per cent. in the final year.</p>

Let me remind the House that the retail prices index was 4.3 per cent. and the consumer prices index was 2.3 per cent. in 2007. In 2008, RPI was 4 per cent. and CPI was 3.6 per cent. For the past two years, the BBC&#146;s funding increases have, on the whole, been below the prevailing rate of inflation. That is an important context for today&#146;s debate.</p>

I recognise our responsibility to licence fee payers, particularly in these difficult times. However, the interests of licence fee payers do not revolve solely around cost. The quality of what they receive in return is also crucial. Overall, the BBC remains good value for money, although, as has been said, on some matters it needs to respond to changing public moods and changing times.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o255"><a name="90520-0015.htm_para8"><a name="09052039001567">We need to take care, however, not to damage or destabilise one of the great British institutions, which is respected and revered around the world.

<p><a name="stpa_o256"><a name="90520-0015.htm_para9"><a name="09052039001568">First, let me deal with principle. Let us be clear: the Conservative party today challenges the basis on which the BBC has been funded for decades. Multi-year funding deals are important, not only for the planning stability that they bring, but because they protect editorial independence and act as a bulwark against undue political interference.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o257"><a name="90520-0015.htm_para10"><a name="09052039001569">The Leader of the Opposition said that his party</p>

Instigating annual funding settlements would fundamentally alter the BBC&#146;s character, independence and impartiality, its relationship to Parliament and its role in public life. Would any Government be properly challenged by the BBC when the corporation&#146;s fate was always under review and the corporation was engaged in almost never-ending debate with civil servants and Ministers about its funding?</p>

 Let me make it absolutely clear that the Secretary of State is distorting what the Leader of Opposition said. He did not say that we should move to annual settlements for the BBC, and that is not our party&#146;s position, as the Secretary of State knows perfectly well. The current settlement, which started in 2007, is a six-year settlement, but the amount by which it will rise in the sixth year is to be determined at a later date. If it is so important not to settle the licence fee every year, even though it is possible to determine the amount received in the sixth year at a later date, why, given the extraordinary economic circumstances of the past six months, is it not sensible to review the position in the third year as well?</p>

 I would like to declare an interest: I am a supporter of some parts of the BBC. Talking about old ways, does the Secretary of State agree that, to help his justification of the case for increasing the licence fee, it would be helpful if the BBC followed this Parliament in opening up its books, in particular that on the salaries of all its staff? Its staff are paid by the taxpayer, like every hon.

 Perhaps I should have made the point to the hon. Member for South-West Surrey a moment ago that the chairman of the BBC Trust commented on that earlier today and said there had been a move towards greater transparency in recent times. However, I do not believe that the hon. Gentleman publishes all the salaries of his staff, and it is not necessarily right just to say that everything should be in the public domain. Let us have appropriate transparency and accountability. I do not necessarily disagree in principle, but let us ensure that things are done appropriately.</p>

 It is important that the BBC does not get too big for its boots&#151;indeed, the Select Committee on Culture, Media and Sport was recently critical of BBC Worldwide. The demands on the BBC are growing with, for instance, the current discussions about Channel 4&#146;s funding gap. What would be the effect on sensible business negotiations if the BBC&#146;s settlement was simply ripped up in the way proposed?</p>

 My hon. Friend makes a powerful point and I will deal with precisely that issue now. I said that the Conservatives were wrong in principle, but they are wrong in practice, too. As well as causing a loss of independence, annual funding would take away the stability and certainty that a broadcaster needs to operate successfully. The BBC would lose its capacity to plan for the long term, commission the highest quality content and invest in the technologies of the future, such as the iPlayer, which so many of us benefit from and enjoy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o262"><a name="90520-0015.htm_para15"><a name="09052039001586">More specifically, the cuts that the hon. Member for South-West Surrey is today calling for could have the direct effect of damaging programme making, draining funding from the creative economy at a time when other revenue sources are drying up and undermining the successful delivery of projects of importance to the future of this country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o263"><a name="90520-0015.htm_para16"><a name="09052039001587">Let me remind the House that, within the funding settlement agreed in 2007, the BBC has already made major efficiencies and is mid-way through a programme to save a total of &#163;1.9 billion during the current licence fee period via an annual efficiency target of 3 per cent. Pay and bonuses for senior managers have been frozen for 18 months. Posts have been reduced by 7,200 since 2005, and there are a further 1,200 to go as part of further savings.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o264"><a name="90520-0015.htm_para17"><a name="09052039001588">Alongside this, the BBC was charged with delivering changes of critical importance. First, out of funds in the six-year settlement, it was asked to play a crucial role in the national digital switchover project by providing practical help, through the help scheme, to ensure that the most vulnerable and disadvantaged in our community can make the switch.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o265"><a name="90520-0015.htm_para18"><a name="09052039001589">Secondly, over the next two years, the BBC is relocating 2,500 staff to MediaCity in Salford, helping to form the first purpose-built media community in the UK, and permanently rebalancing media power in this country away from the capital and into the regions. This will bring huge benefits to the economy in the north-west, estimated at &#163;1.5 billion and 15,500 jobs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o266"><a name="90520-0015.htm_para19"><a name="09052039001590">Two further asks of the BBC have emerged since the current licence fee was settled. In response to calls from colleagues in this House, the BBC Trust has committed the BBC to making significant increases in its programme making in Scotland and Wales so that, by 2016, 50 per cent. of network productions will be made outside London.</p>

<p><a name="st_o308"><a name="09052039001591"><a name="90520-0015.htm_spnew33"><a name="09052039003097"><b>David Cairns:</b>
 My right hon. Friend is a great champion of broadcasting in the nations and regions. He has already mentioned the &#163;182 million studio at Pacific Quay in Glasgow, the finest studio of its type in Europe. Is he aware that the BBC is responsible for 85 per cent. of all TV production across the whole of Scotland, and that original production from Scotland for the networks is increasing after years of going down? Would he like to speculate on the impact that a big cut in the licence fee would have on the progress that we have seen over the past couple of years?</p>

 My hon. Friend makes an important point. Having visited a couple of times, I know that there is a developing, but quite fragile, creative economy in that part of Scotland. There is a tendency to claim that this is all about bloated BBC pay and executives, but a point that is often missed is that much of the money goes to independent producers and small start-up creative businesses in Scotland, as my hon. Friend and I saw when we visited. That is a crucial source of funding that would be severely missed if it were to be reined in.</p>

The media industry has changed profoundly during that time and continues to change at great speed. As a result, and as I have said before, it is vital that the BBC step forward to play a bigger role as a partner and an enabler of other public service content, and I welcome the moves it has made in this direction. This is firmly in the public interest, as it helps to sustain programmes that the public value. According to the hon. Member for South-West Surrey&#146;s logic, if commercial TV is shrinking, the BBC must shrink too. My argument is that the BBC should put a helping hand under other parts of the system that are struggling, so as to maintain the content that the public enjoy, value and depend on. That is the fundamental misunderstanding in his remarks today.</p>

At a time when our commercial broadcasters are facing economic difficulties, this work only serves to underline the importance of a properly funded BBC as the backbone of our creative economy and the cornerstone of public service broadcasting. Two months ago, we saw a prime example of this with the memorandum of understanding between the BBC and ITV plc to enter into news gathering and production partnerships that will deliver cost savings rising to an estimated &#163;7 million by 2016 in the provision of regional news in England and Wales on ITV.</p>

 I am extremely grateful to the Secretary of State, who is being most kind in finally giving way to me. He keeps saying that the BBC must have certainty in order to develop its offerings for the future, but I put it to him that the commercial sector&#151;whether it be publishing, which competes, or broadcasting&#151;has to make do with the income that comes its way. It is coping with greatly reduced incomes at the moment, yet it sees the BBC being given absolute guarantees, which is a monopoly being solidified. That is why my hon. Friend the Member for South-West Surrey (Mr. Hunt) is right to suggest that the BBC should share the pain with the rest of the British economy.</p>

 The BBC fulfils a different role; it is not a commercial broadcaster. It is there to provide content that the commercial sector would not provide.

 When in January 2007, my right hon.

She did so in order to provide a platform of stability and strength in a period of flux and change, and she did so on the basis of the best possible combination of independent advice, high-quality research and public debate. It was a settlement with a vision for the future of the BBC and its role. Now is not the time to rip up that settlement or to be thinking of taking money out of the system and risk destabilising not just the BBC, but our creative sector as a whole.</p>

 For once, I am delighted to follow the Secretary of State.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o272"><a name="90520-0016.htm_para5"><a name="09052039001622">In my view, the Tory proposal is a dangerous, badly timed and, frankly, pathetic gimmick. Although, as the Secretary of State has said, the BBC is rightly the envy of the world, the whole House would acknowledge that it does not always get it right. I have been very critical of a number of its actions, which in recent times have included the aggressive approach to licence fee collection, the slow reaction of management over the Ross-Brand affair, the phone-in scandals, the excessive expenditure on taxis, aeroplanes and even Christmas parties, and the over-the-top payments to some presenters and so-called top talent. Despite that, however, I value the BBC and I value the values for which it stands.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o273"><a name="90520-0016.htm_para6"><a name="09052039001623">Introducing the debate, the hon. Member for South-West Surrey (Mr. Hunt) said that it had come at a time when there was a huge debate about trust in politicians. He is right, but let me remind him that trust in the BBC has never been greater. A recent poll by the BBC Trust showed that 85 per cent. of the British people support the BBC, up from 70 per cent. two years ago. I think that we obtain phenomenally good value from the BBC. For 39p a day, licence-holding households receive 10 TV channels, some with high definition, 10 UK-wide radio stations, 46 national and regional radio services, interactive services on BBCi, the huge benefits of the iPlayer and,  <br>

in bbc.co.uk, a website that gets 17.5 million unique hits every week. I think that that is pretty good value for money. The BBC also provides high-quality, UK-produced, impartial broadcast content. I believe that it is vital to our democracy, to our sense of national identity, and to the success of our creative industries.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o274"><a name="90520-0016.htm_para7"><a name="09052039001624">Last night, in an interesting and somewhat provocative speech, the chairman of the BBC Trust, Sir Michael Lyons, argued that the way in which people think about the BBC is different from the way in which they think about commodities. The hon. Gentleman&#146;s approach seems to be that they just think about commodities, but they do not. As Sir Michael said, the British people see themselves as shareholders in the BBC, and therefore have a vested interest in its long-term future. The Tory proposal ignores that relationship, and crucially&#151;as the Secretary of State said&#151;it ignores the vital independence of the BBC from Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o275"><a name="90520-0016.htm_para8"><a name="09052039001625">As we have heard, the planned increase is part of a six-year settlement. Not only is the length of that settlement critical to the BBC&#146;s ability to plan ahead, but it underpins the BBC&#146;s editorial independence. Voting against the order and for the Tory proposal would set a dangerous precedent whereby the licence fee settlement could be redrawn each year, year on year&#151;as the Tories&#146; leader has said&#151;according to political whim. It would represent a fundamental and undesirable shift in the relationship between the BBC and Parliament. In short, the motion is highly dangerous, and prompts the question &#147;Will the BBC, and especially its independence, be safe in Conservative hands?&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o276"><a name="90520-0016.htm_para9"><a name="09052039001626">It is no wonder that, on Monday this week, <i> The Guardian</i> quoted an unnamed Tory source as saying:</p>

It says that if it is a one-off cut, it will actually be &#163;75 million, but, unless he is proposing that in subsequent years there be a way above inflation-busting increase to get the BBC back on track, the cumulative impact of his proposal will actually be a cut of &#163;325 million.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman asks me to suggest ways in which that &#163;68 million can be found. We have talked about the taxi bill. What about the &#163;108 million spent on imported programming, much of which could be viewed on the commercial channels if it was not being shown on the BBC?</p>

 I wish I had not given way to the hon. Gentleman because I asked him a clear question: where does his figure of &#163;68 million come from, as it is incorrectly calculated? A one-off cut would be &#163;75 million, and carried through to the end of the licence period the cut would amount to &#163;325 million. A cut of that magnitude must be considered in the context of what is happening within the BBC. The Secretary of State has already referred to that, but we must recall that, since 2001, the BBC has already made cumulative savings of &#163;2.2 billion, 7,200 posts have gone since 2005, and it already has plans in place for a further 15 per cent. of efficiency savings amounting to a cut of &#163;1.9 billion by the end of the licence period, during which a further 1,200 posts will go. We also already know that pay and bonuses for senior managers have been frozen for 18 months, licence fee collection costs have been reduced by &#163;32 million, and spending on top talent has been reduced&#151;and the list goes on.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o279"><a name="90520-0016.htm_para12"><a name="09052039001633">The hon. Gentleman said, however, that the BBC has to do what all other businesses have to do: cope with the impact of the recession. Because he has done his research, he should be aware that, in addition to all the planned cuts, the BBC now has to cope with a reduction in anticipated income because the number of new households is lower than was expected so there will be fewer new licences and because the money it will get from the sale of property in White City has massively reduced as a result of the impact of the recession on the property market. Those factors combined mean that the BBC has to find a further &#163;400 million in cuts because of the recession.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o280"><a name="90520-0016.htm_para13"><a name="09052039001634">The idea that the BBC is swimming in cash and can make additional savings at the drop of a hat is, therefore, out of date. It is unprepared for the retrospective cut that the Tories are asking for. The Tories have to say which services should be cut, too: local radio services, or the children&#146;s channel, or the parliamentary channel, or a national radio station or two? Perhaps still more importantly, what damage would the cut do to the creative industries?</p>

 I will give way to the hon. Gentleman shortly, if he wishes to intervene then. We know that the BBC&#146;s activities put &#163;5 billion per annum into the creative industries. It has already been pointed out that the other broadcasters are reducing their expenditure. If there is a further BBC cut, that will have a direct impact on the creative economy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o281"><a name="90520-0016.htm_para14"><a name="09052039001637">This is a dangerous proposal that would undermine the independence of the BBC and that would, by failing to take into account recent and planned efficiency savings, put programmes and services at risk. It is also badly timed. This is a retrospective cut, and no mention has been made of the cost that would be incurred in implementing it retrospectively. Again, I have received advice, and I have been told it would be in the order of &#163;4.3 million.</p>

The public do not want the BBC to be damaged or its independence to be threatened, and they will see this as a cheap gimmick. By using the BBC as a political football, the Tories have scored an own goal. It is absolutely clear that the BBC will not be safe in Conservative hands.</p>

 I have not signed the early-day motion in question, and I rise briefly to support the Government and oppose the Opposition motion. First, I wish to deal with the argument made by the Conservative Front-Bench team that advertising has declined for commercial broadcasters and thus, by implication, that the BBC is becoming too dominant in the market. It is important to be accurate with the figures. The amount of the licence fee money that is spent on BBC television programmes is about &#163;2.5 billion, which is roughly what will be raised this year by the traditional terrestrial commercial broadcasters in advertising income&#151;the ratio is about 50:50; the BBC&#146;s figure could be a little higher than that of commercial broadcasters, or vice versa. Obviously, the BBC does not spend all its licence fee income on television, because it supports radio and online services too.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o283"><a name="90520-0016.htm_para16"><a name="09052039001640">That argument from the Conservatives seemed to me to belong to 20 or 25 years ago, because it completely neglected the fact that a great deal of broadcasting income these days comes from subscription TV. I believe that BSkyB has a subscription income of about &#163;3.7 billion, and the figure for Virgin&#151;Richard Branson&#146;s company&#151;is about &#163;600 million, so a total subscription income of well over &#163;4 billion, in addition to the advertising income for commercial broadcasting, has to be considered. The BBC is a much smaller player than it was 10 or 20 years ago, and it is not in any danger of becoming dominant in the market. Indeed, 10 years ago, people were fearful as to whether the BBC would have relevance, given that competition. As Front Benchers have recognised, the BBC has responded well to that competition: BBC 1 remains the most watched TV channel in the nation; BBC radio still attracts about 50 per cent. of the radio listenership throughout the country; and BBC Online is looked at by at least half the population on a regular basis.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o284"><a name="90520-0016.htm_para17"><a name="09052039001641">There are two reasons why it is important that the BBC&#146;s licence fee is determined over a long period, not a short one&#151;they have been mentioned but they are worth repeating even though they are both matters of common sense.

established over 80 years of BBC history and, as the Secretary of State said, it would be problem if the BBC director-general had to troop into the Treasury on an annual basis and, depending on what the controversy of the moment was, had to speak in the press, tailor his argument and so on. Would Jeremy Paxman be quite so aggressive to us all and would the &#147;Today&#148; programme be quite so pressing of the day&#146;s issues if that were the situation?

It should be valued&#151;there is no point in having the BBC and in having the licence fee if that independence is not preserved&#151;because it is crucial, not only to news coverage, but to the BBC&#146;s entire output.</p>

 Is the hon. Gentleman suggesting that in the run-up to the previous BBC settlement, the BBC was, in some way, restrained in its criticism of the Government? I do not believe that his Front-Bench team would feel that that was the case at the time of Hutton.</p>

 This is a question of balance, and of whether we should have the review once every six or seven years, or once a year. An annual review would clearly mean that the process is ongoing; there would never be a time when the BBC licence fee would not be under debate. We should be talking about relatively short periods, when the charter is reviewed, whereby we decide whether we want the BBC to continue or not, then decide what the licence fee should be and then let the BBC get on with doing its job.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o286"><a name="90520-0017.htm_para1"><a name="09052039001647">We rightly make huge demands of the BBC, because of its privilege in getting the licence fee. Some of those have been mentioned, and they concern not only top quality content or maintaining standards. When the BBC falls short of those standards, it causes controversy because of the affection in which it is held. The demands also relate to how in this licence fee settlement, as has been said, we are asking the BBC to engage as never before with the nations and&#151;as the right hon. Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood) has left, I believe that I can say this&#151;with the regions of England too. The BBC is doing that in an unprecedented way. A third of BBC output will come from the regions by 2016, whereas only a quarter does so now. In Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales, the figure will triple to some 17 or 18 per cent. of output. The partnerships that we are rightly demanding of the BBC&#151;to advance digital radio, to preserve regional news and to get involved in all sorts of technological developments&#151;mean that we have to ensure that it has a predictable income.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o287"><a name="90520-0017.htm_para2"><a name="09052039001648">The last settlement was quite tough, and it has fallen below inflation for the last couple of years, as the Secretary of State said.

 I warmly congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for South-West Surrey (Mr. Hunt) on initiating this debate on the licence fee. If ever there was a time when it was right to ask again whether the licence fee should continue to increase, it is now. My hon. Friend set out some of the background to the increase in the fee against the rate of inflation, but the BBC&#146;s income is determined not just by the level of the licence fee, but the number of households that pay it, which also has been going up. As a result, the BBC has enjoyed perpetual income increases, year on year, at a time when the rest of the media sector is facing its worst crisis for 50 years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o291"><a name="90520-0017.htm_para6"><a name="09052039001653">The media are affected by the recession in the same way as every other industry. As many people who have been in business will know, one of the first casualties in a recession is advertising spend, and there has been a significant drop in advertising expenditure across the board. On top of that, we are seeing a fundamental structural change in people&#146;s consumption of media. More and more people consume media online, and as they move from traditional media outlets advertisers are following them. The result is that every commercial operator is under greater pressure than ever before. ITV has moved from children&#146;s programming and regional programming, and it has now pulled out of arts programming with the ending of &#147;The South Bank Show&#148;. It has also cut drama. Channel 4 has identified a &#163;150 million gap in its funding. Channel 5 is struggling to survive. Every commercial radio station is now considering its economic prospects and wondering whether it will still be in business in a year&#146;s time. As we know, local newspapers are going out of business every week.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o292"><a name="90520-0017.htm_para7"><a name="09052039001654">All those sectors face competition from the BBC, and that has always been a matter for concern, but the disparity between the amount available to commercial media and that available to the BBC has now become enormous, and it is distorting the market. For the first time, the BBC&#146;s income will exceed the total advertising revenue of the entire commercial sector. That gap will grow to more than &#163;1 billion.</p>

 We simply cannot ignore the environment in which the BBC is operating. That is not to say that the BBC does not do masses of things that are essential. However, my question is whether it needs &#163;3.6 billion to do them. The BBC will always point to its comedy, drama, children&#146;s television, regional television and its religion, arts and education coverage. However, just because the BBC produced &#147;Cranford&#148;, &#147;Life in Cold Blood&#148; or &#147;Panorama&#148; does not necessarily justify &#163;3.6 billion. We have to ask whether we need all the channels that the BBC produces. BBC 3 has cost more than &#163;500 million since it was set up, and to be honest I do not believe that the amount of product that has appeared on BBC 3 justifies that amount.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o293"><a name="90520-0017.htm_para8"><a name="09052039001659">The Secretary of State said that &#147;The BBC is there to provide content that the commercial sector would not&#148;. I entirely agree, but too often the BBC is providing content that looks very similar, if not wholly identical, to the content that the commercial sector provides. One has to ask whether it is justified for the BBC to go on paying the amount that it does in recruiting talent, top salaries, competing against commercial providers and, as my hon. Friend the Member for South-West Surrey said, bidding against commercial television to acquire imported American television or to acquire Hollywood movies&#151;in that case, the only beneficiaries are the Hollywood studios.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o294"><a name="90520-0017.htm_para9"><a name="09052039001660">The BBC does not need all the money it receives and, in the longer term, we need to be having a bigger debate necessarily about whether the BBC needs this amount or that amount, but about how we can sustain public service broadcasting in this country. There is a desperate crisis, and it is essential that the BBC is not left as the sole provider of public service broadcasting. If we are to sustain plurality, we must support commercial providers&#146; continuing to provide public service programming. That might well need public support, and the obvious source for that is the licence fee.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o295"><a name="90520-0017.htm_para10"><a name="09052039001661">Is it more in the interests of the public and the viewing public in this country that we should go on sustaining BBC 3 or yet another American import, or should we be using that money to ensure that regional news does not just appear on the BBC but continues to be broadcast on ITV? Should there be other providers of children&#146;s programming outside the BBC? I welcome that debate, which Lord Carter is currently conducting, but those points have to be taken into account in this debate.</p>

When he suggests that it was somehow wrong for the Opposition to table this motion today, I have to say that he is straying on to political territory, which is very dangerous. He is also questioning the right of Parliament to determine the appropriate level of funding for the BBC. Of course Parliament should not interfere in the BBC&#146;s editorial independence, but debating the right amount of public money to go to the BBC is not interfering in editorial independence.

It was far from a generous settlement&#151;it led to redundancies at the BBC when it was reached&#151;but the BBC is working on the basis of it. The organisation needs stability. It is implementing a decision to make efficiency savings of 2 per cent. a year, and is doing quite well in that respect; the process is producing more redundancies than I would like.

I am afraid that when one looks at the guidelines and then at the charter, it is evident that the guidelines are largely written for the benefit of getting the BBC to be able to control the conduct of editorial policy. The charter is much clearer. It refers to the question of impartiality in relation to public policy. Frequently we find ourselves caught up in the argument about whether the BBC is partial or impartial, according to party policy. That is not the issue. There are many subjects on which it is essential that the BBC should focus impartially on public policy, not merely party policy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o307"><a name="90520-0017.htm_para22"><a name="09052039001681">We are about to move forward in an extensive and necessary reform of Parliament. Our Parliament has become a sham and it is essential that we address the problems ourselves. It is essential that we look at the BBC in the same light. It is important that the BBC provides from within itself the processes of regulation and self-regulation to ensure that we get what the BBC is capable of producing. It has been and it can be a first- class organisation. I strongly believe that we need a system of enforcement of the BBC&#146;s obligations in relation to impartiality and inaccuracy. That is important for the BBC, as Sarah Montague made clear this morning. It is essential for the BBC as a whole, from the director-general downwards.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o308"><a name="90520-0017.htm_para23"><a name="09052039001682">There has been a severe lack of impartiality on a very big issue that is before the electorate&#151;the European question. There has been a failure to address that&#151;<i> [Interruption.]</i> As my hon. Friend the Member for Shipley (Philip Davies) says, the BBC has admitted that. I have the papers and correspondence that I have had with the BBC on that subject. It is important for this good reason: if we are to reform our Parliament, we must ensure that we return power where it belongs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o309"><a name="90520-0017.htm_para24"><a name="09052039001683">The BBC has more power and influence in many respects&#151;probably in most respects&#151;than Parliament. The best way to keep a secret is to make a speech in the House of Commons. The BBC&#146;s presenters and interviewers can ask questions and supplementaries, and they can do things that we cannot do, but we are elected. I am sure they understand that, but I wish they would demonstrate it rather more and make sure that they are as impartial as we believe they should be, and as we try to be in this place.</p>

 I am a supporter of the BBC and value its history. I had intended to spend some time talking about the great contribution that the BBC has made to this country and the world over many years. That was until I heard Sir Michael Lyons this morning on the radio, so I will take all that good stuff as read. On Radio 4 he suggested that if Parliament stopped the rise in the licence fee, it was a recipe for curbing the independence of the BBC. What absolute nonsense. It strays dangerously into politics. My hon. Friend the Member for Stone (Mr. Cash) was right about that, and Sir Michael should have stayed well away from the issue, because the public no longer  <br>

trust the BBC rigorously to enforce balance as it once did and was once famous for. The latest reported indiscretions involve the complaints that the BBC Trust upheld about the accuracy and bias of Jeremy Bowen in an article that he published marking the 40th anniversary of the six-day war. The trust said that Bowen</p>
<a name="90520-0018.htm_brev0"><a name="09052051000597"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;should have done more to explain that there were alternative views on the subject which had some weight&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o310"><a name="90520-0018.htm_para0"><a name="09052051000004">That breach of impartiality guidelines underlines the BBC&#146;s failure in recent years to stop its innate liberal bias from turning into unbalanced reporting. The BBC&#146;s pro-metropolitan, liberal attitude is well documented. Some of the most significant work on the topic was compiled by ex-BBC producer Antony Jay for the Centre for Policy Studies. In his pamphlet entitled, &#147;Confessions of a Reformed BBC Producer&#148;, he describes the tribal-like mentality of BBC employees. Jay claims that BBC staff worked and socialised with people who have the same experiences and believe in the same principles, naturally reinforcing their pre-existing prejudices. Jay confessed:</p>
<a name="90520-0018.htm_brev1"><a name="09052051000598"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;We so rarely encountered any coherent opposing arguments that we took our group-think as the views of all right-thinking people.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o311"><a name="90520-0018.htm_para1"><a name="09052051000005">More recently, Andrew Marr famously described the BBC as not &#147;impartial or neutral&#148;, arguing that it had a &#147;cultural liberal bias&#148; due to the type of people who were attracted to work there.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o312"><a name="90520-0018.htm_para2"><a name="09052051000006">The European elections in June represent a particularly difficult challenge for the BBC: licence fee payers expect the BBC not only to give a fair hearing for the major political parties, but to report impartially on the debate between European integrationists and Eurosceptics. So far, it has been a challenge too far. An internal report for the BBC in 2005 found that its news suffered from an &#147;institutional mindset&#148; that led to a</p>
<a name="90520-0018.htm_brev2"><a name="09052051000599"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;reluctance to question pro-EU assumptions&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o313"><a name="90520-0018.htm_para3"><a name="09052051000007">It said that the BBC journalists are ignorant of how the EU works and have failed to show how much of British policy originates in Brussels, and it criticised managers who</p>
<a name="90520-0018.htm_brev3"><a name="09052051000600"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;appear insufficiently self-critical about standards of impartiality&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o314"><a name="90520-0018.htm_para4"><a name="09052051000008">The report concluded that</p>
<a name="90520-0018.htm_brev4"><a name="09052051000009"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;the BBC is getting it wrong, and our main conclusion is that urgent action is required to put this right&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o315"><a name="90520-0018.htm_para5"><a name="09052051000010">Unfortunately, urgent action has not been forthcoming. Another internal investigation in 2007 accused the BBC of trendy left-wing bias and stated that it was guilty of omitting opinions that were</p>
<a name="90520-0018.htm_brev5"><a name="09052051000601"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;off limits in terms of a liberal-minded comfort zone&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o316"><a name="90520-0018.htm_para6"><a name="09052051000011">The report noted that the BBC had come late to several important issues, including Euroscepticism and immigration.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o317"><a name="90520-0018.htm_para7"><a name="09052051000012">The BBC&#146;s liberal obsession with multiculturalism means that it has become completely out of touch with large swathes of the country. The corporation has effectively censured the topics that people care about, because of its culture of uber-political correctness. That is also why the BBC gives a fairer hearing to trendy left-wing organisations such as Amnesty International and Liberty yet treats spokespeople for the Countryside Alliance and Migrationwatch UK as eccentric bores.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o318"><a name="90520-0018.htm_para8"><a name="09052051000015">The BBC continues to demonstrate scant regard for balance and decency. At the heart of the issue, I fear, is the lack of willpower on the part of BBC senior executives to stand up to its high-profile broadcasters and performers. The BBC cares more about its high-profile and well-paid employees than about the people who actually pay their wages. That is why my constituents, like my colleagues, will not accept willingly an increase in this TV tax.</p>

 I am sure that one minute is about as much as people will be able to stomach from me anyway; your judgment is wise, Mr. Deputy Speaker.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o319"><a name="90520-0018.htm_para9"><a name="09052051000021">The issue before us is whether the BBC needs an increase in funding. I have been prompted to speak because of the appalling mathematics that have been on show in the House, particularly from the hon. Members for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell) and for Bath (Mr. Foster). The issue is not about making a cut to the BBC&#146;s income, but about not giving the BBC an increase. When somebody&#146;s pay is frozen, it is frozen, not cut&#151;they have just not been given an increase. The BBC&#146;s problem is that it sees no increase as a cut, because it has become so feather-bedded by the licence fee and the taxpayer. It has become totally out of touch with the economic reality faced by everybody else.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o320"><a name="90520-0018.htm_para10"><a name="09052051000022">I should like to make a particular point before I conclude. The BBC is supposed to be for the whole country, but recently, for example, it made a decision about horse racing, which is a sport that cuts across the social divide like nothing else. The BBC is trying to abandon such projects to go for the high-profile stuff; it completely lacks a good sense of priorities. It should concentrate on things that the British people as a whole want. The issue is about priorities. The BBC does not need all this increase, and that is why I will support the motion.</p>

 With the leave of the House, Mr. Deputy Speaker, I should like to make a few brief comments in conclusion. It has been an excellent debate. The hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster) made an excellent speech, and said two things with which I profoundly agree. He said that the BBC does not always get things right; he was right to say that, and it is right for it to be acknowledged. He also said that the BBC was not safe in Tory hands, and some of the views emanating from the Conservative  <br>

Benches this afternoon made that point abundantly clear to anybody who cared to pay attention. The argument from those Members was that the rest of the media industry was under pressure, so the BBC should be under pressure&#151;the quality of all the media must go down. That is an awful argument.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o321"><a name="90520-0018.htm_para11"><a name="09052051000024">There was a revealing moment when the hon.

 On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. There are now at least 25 flags of a proscribed terrorist organisation flying over Parliament square. You will have heard numerous points of order about the obstruction, expense and conduct of the Tamil demonstration. Although I understand that decisions about the conduct of public order are an operational matter for the police, the message being sent out about our tolerance of terrorism is a wider policy matter of importance to us all. I would invite you, as a matter of urgency, to communicate to the relevant authorities the view that the unimpeded and open support of a terrorist organisation in front of Parliament sends the most unhelpful wider message about the conduct of our counter-terrorist strategy.</p>

Gentleman knows, we do not have the full scope of authority to deal with the situation. However, I am grateful to him for putting the latest situation on the record, and I am sure that the relevant authorities will take note.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o333"><a name="90520-0019.htm_para8"><a name="09052051000545">I want to say a few words about the history, which illustrates the CCO&#146;s long-standing contribution to cancer services in Britain and to its locality. The centre&#146;s roots date back over a century to the Liverpool hospital for cancer and diseases of the skin, which was established in 1862. In 1882, the hospital moved to a new site and was renamed the Radium Institute. The first Roentgen ray apparatus was purchased in 1901 and the centre gradually developed into one of the two major radiotherapy centres in the north-west of England. The centre has been at Clatterbridge since the early 1950s. It has provided chemotherapy since the 1970s, and CCO consultants were among the first to use multiple-drug chemotherapy. Today, the centre is thriving. It became a foundation trust hospital in 2006. Patient numbers are continually rising, with an average of 50 treated on each accelerator every day. Over 7,000 new patients are registered at the hospital each year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o334"><a name="90520-0019.htm_para9"><a name="09052051000546">The CCO has received significant investment in recent years and is now one of the best-equipped radiotherapy centres in Britain. Facilities include nine linear accelerators, which I am going to call &#147;linacs&#148;, a cobalt unit, superficial and orthovoltage X-ray machines, two simulators, two scanners, tomography simulators and so forth. The centre places great emphasis on research and development, regularly participating in national and international  <br>

The Healthcare Commission rated it as excellent for quality and use of resources; and Monitor awarded the CCO green for governance and the provision of mandatory services, and gave it 5&#151;the highest possible mark&#151;for financial viability. It is in excellent financial shape.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o336"><a name="90520-0019.htm_para11"><a name="09052051000548">The quality of the treatment provided is matched by the service delivery record.

That is important for the comfort and convenience of patients.</p>

The crux of the issue is that the Merseyside and Cheshire Cancer Network has put forward proposals for two satellite sites with linacs used in radiotherapy treatment. One satellite at Aintree, to be run as a CCO operation, has been agreed and no one contests that it will make an important contribution to providing accessible services for those living in and around Liverpool. However, I am not sure that the case has been made&#151;my hon. Friend may well disagree with me on this point&#151;for a second satellite at the Royal Liverpool hospital, only 5 miles from Aintree. Let me say a little more about this.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o338"><a name="90520-0019.htm_para13"><a name="09052051000552">What are the reasons put forward in favour of these proposals? I am told that the two satellites are necessary to</p>
<a name="90520-0019.htm_brev14"><a name="09052051000616"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;meet demand for these services north of the River Mersey, as this area has some of the highest cancer death rates in the country&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o339"><a name="90520-0019.htm_para14"><a name="09052051000553">It is assumed that the establishment of a second satellite only 5 miles from the first will inevitably improve cancer outcomes in Liverpool and satisfy unmet demand. Clinical opinion at the CCO, however, states that patients from the region, and particularly in Liverpool, already receive the best treatments available and that the outcomes following diagnosis are similar to the national rate. In fact, the cancer reform strategy and the north-west cancer plan both argue that late diagnosis is the major contributing factor to poor cancer survival rates. There is no evidence to suggest that providing more non-surgical oncology services in a given area&#151;in this case, in Liverpool city centre&#151;would have a direct impact on survival rates. Improved screening programmes and public awareness campaigns are considered more likely to make a difference.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o340"><a name="90520-0019.htm_para15"><a name="09052051000554">A related argument presented in favour of a second satellite at the Royal is that Clatterbridge is too far away for patients in Liverpool and that more non-surgical oncology services, over and above those planned for Aintree, are necessary to improve access. I am not wholly convinced that cancer services cannot be accessed within a reasonable travel period by people in Liverpool, or more generally in the Cheshire and Merseyside area that the CCO covers. The cancer reform strategy recommends that travel times to services should not exceed 45 minutes, and 92 per cent. of CCO patients travel by car, ambulance or taxi and are able to obtain their treatments within that time&#151;and in many cases more quickly. When the Aintree site is fully functioning, times will be even shorter.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o341"><a name="90520-0019.htm_para16"><a name="09052051000555">I want to emphasise that I accept the need for some non-surgical oncology services to be provided at a satellite in Liverpool. Along with the CCO and others involved, I very much support the establishment of the site at Aintree, which the CCO will provide. However, in that light, it is very difficult to see why we need a second site only five miles away. Projections suggest that the Aintree site will provide enough linacs to meet demand until 2017, so the second satellite will lead to overcapacity. Resources, which are always finite, will be hard pressed in the current economic climate; and it seems to me that overcapacity in Liverpool across the two sites will inevitably lead to a reduction of services at the CCO.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o342"><a name="90520-0019.htm_para17"><a name="09052051000556">Furthermore, even if it could be proved that there is a need for additional linacs beyond those already provided at the CCO and at the Aintree satellite, that would not necessarily provide an argument for the establishment of a second site. Surely it would be logical and cost-effective to increase the number of linacs at Aintree. I am told that the site could incorporate that, and it would prevent the expenditure involved in building another site.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o343"><a name="90520-0019.htm_para18"><a name="09052051000557">All this must be seen in the context of wider proposals for relocating the CCO to Liverpool, which are outlined in the Baker review. There is now general agreement that such a move, which would cost approximately &#163;150 million, is inconceivable in the current economic climate, and it has been put on the back burner for at least the next five years. However, the chairman of Cheshire and Merseyside strategic health authority has confirmed that it is the &#147;direction of travel&#148; towards 2020.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o344"><a name="90520-0019.htm_para19"><a name="09052051000558">That bothers me. I challenge the fundamental assumption that the primary centre for non-surgical oncology services in the region should necessarily be in Liverpool. The existing Clatterbridge location is liked by patients, it ain&#146;t broke, it is a pleasant environment and, as I have said, it makes an important contribution to the local community. To move it would involve unnecessary and unwise expenditure, and in my view the idea has no obvious merit. Furthermore, proposals to move the centre seem to reflect a city-centric point of view. In fact, the CCO serves Cheshire and Merseyside and, as we have just heard, part of north Wales&#151;Alyn and Deesside&#151;and in that sense it is centrally located.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o345"><a name="90520-0019.htm_para20"><a name="09052051000559">The case that the Royal is a desirable location for these services rests on two central arguments. The first is that it would allow cancer services to be in close physical proximity to acute facilities. Although I see the merits of that argument, it does not necessarily provide a reason for the centre to be moved to Liverpool. The CCO is about 15 minutes&#146; drive from Arrowe Park  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="20 May 2009">

Hospital. It is also developing its own high-dependency unit to support patients who become acutely ill during their treatment at the centre.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o346"><a name="90520-0019.htm_para21"><a name="09052051000560">Secondly, it has been argued that the Royal location has advantages in terms of its academic links. However, the first satellite is to be built on the campus of the University Hospitals Aintree NHS Foundation Trust, which enjoys the same status as the Royal in terms of well-established academic links with Liverpool university. It seems to me that there is some confusion between academic status and proximity to the university itself. Moreover, the CCO is committed to developing its academic links and research. I am not convinced that the case for relocation at the Royal has been fully demonstrated either by the arguments about its acute facilities or by those about its academic links.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o347"><a name="90520-0019.htm_para22"><a name="09052051000561">As I have said, for the time being there are no clear plans for a full-scale relocation, but I fear that, in the short term, the creation of a second satellite may constitute a piecemeal development, which the Cancer Network, the Royal and PCTs hope will eventually lead to the establishment of a cancer centre at the Royal. The second satellite was originally suggested in the context of relocation of the whole centre, in the light of the Baker report. It does not make sense on its own merits. However, the Cancer Network and PCTs preferred to push on regardless, apparently on the primary basis that if the money was available, why not?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o348"><a name="90520-0019.htm_para23"><a name="09052051000562">This raises important question about how decisions are made about cancer services in the region. I am deeply concerned that PCTs, which have the power to determine the expenditure of large amounts of money&#151;for instance, on the establishment of the proposed satellites&#151;are, in my experience, only notionally accountable and often, I am afraid, profligate. They have not consulted me or other local Members of Parliament&#151;or as far as I am aware, others&#151;about the current round of proposals. If the PCTs are only notionally accountable, the Cancer Network is wholly unaccountable. Although it can only make recommendations rather than decisions, the PCTs do not appear to have probed its proposals sufficiently before endorsing them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o349"><a name="90520-0019.htm_para24"><a name="09052051000563">There is a clear need for cancer services in the region to be viewed on a strategic basis. Resources must be allocated and services located in a logical and transparent way, based on an assessment of the current and future needs of all local people and on expert advice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o350"><a name="90520-0019.htm_para25"><a name="09052051000564">I have described the CCO as a centre of excellence, and as such it is worth protecting for a number of reasons. It houses an impressive concentration of services and expertise, and continues to develop, improve and carry out research. As such, it is in a strong position to attract investment. In the current economic climate, funding will of course be scarce. Public money must be used even more wisely and cautiously than usual. If services are salami-sliced away from Clatterbridge with no clear plan, and cancer services in Merseyside are spread across multiple sites, no one institution in the area will draw the substantial funding that will be required in future years. Furthermore, if services are gradually moved from Clatterbridge, eroding the critical mass, the centre may well suffer a loss of confidence. It will fail to attract the best qualified staff, and it may start to decline.</p>

However, in none of the correspondence that I have received from either of those organisations is there any evidence that they have taken account of the views of the CCO, or, indeed, of the concerns expressed by me and my hon.

Can the Minister assure me that she will take account of them in her response, and may I tell her that although what is proposed is euphemistically presented merely as a long-term &#147;direction of travel&#148;, in my view it is a wrong direction for which the case remains unproven and the costs very large?</p>

 I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Wirral, South (Ben Chapman) on securing the debate. He has shown an acute interest in the welfare of his local health services, and in particular the cancer services, and I commend him for the dedication with which he serves the needs of his constituents. I am also pleased that my hon. Friends the Members for Wirral, West (Stephen Hesford), for Alyn and Deeside (Mark Tami) and for Liverpool, Walton (Mr. Kilfoyle) are present.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o352"><a name="90520-0020.htm_para0"><a name="09052051000567">On 3 December 2007, the Government launched the cancer reform strategy, which sets out plans to improve further and develop cancer services across England over the next five years. It includes measures to improve cancer prevention, speed up the diagnosis and treatment of cancer, reduce inequalities, ensure that care is delivered in the most appropriate settings, and ensure that patients can access effective new treatments quickly. I am sure that we all can remember that at the time when our Labour Government came to power, patients with cancer were having to wait for many months, and sometimes a year or more, for treatment. The latest published data show that 93.9 per cent. of patients diagnosed with cancer start their treatment at the Clatterbridge Centre for Oncology within 62 days of referral from their GP. That represents remarkable progress, and I commend the efforts of the staff in making it possible, backed, of course, by the financial commitment of the Government. We must not be complacent, however, and we must do more to achieve even more progress.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o353"><a name="90520-0020.htm_para1"><a name="09052051000568">I have listened carefully to the arguments of my hon. Friend the Member for Wirral, South in support of the CCO. I am informed, as was stated at our meeting, that the Merseyside and Cheshire Cancer Network undertook on behalf of local NHS organisations a review of how and where patients in the area who require cancer treatment might receive it in future. Its purpose was to ensure that the aspirations of our Government&#146;s cancer reform strategy are achieved locally.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o354"><a name="90520-0020.htm_para2"><a name="09052051000569">The current situation in Merseyside is that most patients who require cancer treatment and who live north of the River Mersey travel to the CCO for that treatment. I am also advised&#151;this is very worrying&#151;that residents living north of the River Mersey experience the highest rate of cancer deaths in the locality. Indeed, the figures are some of the highest nationally.</p>

 If it is the case that a higher level of cancer deaths are suffered north of the river, would that not best be tackled by early diagnosis? I have seen no evidence that the travel time makes that statistic at all difficult.</p>

 I hope that, as my speech progresses, we will come to a greater understanding of that issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o355"><a name="90520-0020.htm_para3"><a name="09052051000572">I should restate that these are among the highest figures nationally, and currently these patients north of the Mersey, who make up 67 per cent. of the Mersey and Cheshire Cancer Network, face longer journey times to the CCO for treatment that may last only a matter of minutes. The review therefore made several recommendations. One of them was to look at the possibility of relocating some services from the CCO to the Royal Liverpool university hospital.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o356"><a name="90520-0020.htm_para4"><a name="09052051000573">I am advised, and I understand that my hon. Friend has been too, that there is no immediate proposal to relocate the Clatterbridge centre to Liverpool in the foreseeable future. There is a recommendation to that effect by 2020, but that would require the development and approval of a formal business case, and full public consultation. I understand that the strategic outline case for these proposals will not even be complete until 2010-11.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o357"><a name="90520-0020.htm_para5"><a name="09052051000574">At this stage, I should also point out that the configuration of services is a matter for the NHS locally. I am also happy to restate that no decisions on these proposals have been taken. It would therefore be totally inappropriate for me to intervene in this locally driven process or to comment on the options available. However, I am assured that any potential relocation will be subject to due diligence, and that the process will be objective, transparent and robust and will take account of all stakeholders.</p>

 My hon. Friend rightly says that if no decision has been taken and there remains an interest in the process of reaching any decision, it might be premature for her to intervene, but surely in order for that process to give consideration to the right principles and the right issues she can take an oversight view. When one is talking about potentially spending &#163;150 million of public money in the wrong direction&#151;my hon.

Members must be involved in it. The cancer strategy and the cancer team were present at the meeting. I commend those present, as Members of Parliament for the area, for continuing to push for their constituents&#151;that is what we expect them to do in this House&#151;but at the same time they must have regard for local decision making, the way in which the consultation will be drawn up and how it is difficult at this moment for me to intervene in any way other than the way in which I am trying to help tonight.</p>

for patients who endure some of the worst cancer outcomes in the country. We must commend PCTs in Cheshire and Merseyside for taking steps to address these issues. I must stress that these proposals concern providing additional radiotherapy services in the Merseyside area to meet the demand that I have outlined. I am assured that those additional services do not represent any removal of services from the Clatterbridge centre. In addition, I am informed there will be no job losses as a result of any of these proposals.</p>

 I apologise for intervening again, and I shall try not to do so again. Even if there is a case for transferring resource from Clatterbridge to Liverpool, such a move must reduce the critical mass at Clatterbridge.

This package of developments will, in fact, require significant increases in the oncology work force. Today&#146;s technology makes it possible to deliver most radiotherapy treatment close to where patients live. As typical radiotherapy treatments are delivered over a period of several days or weeks, it is beneficial to the patient to have to travel as little as possible to access this vital treatment&#151;</p>

 I understand that a typical patient may make 15 daily visits to a radiotherapy unit during their treatment.

I understand that the groundworks for a new building at Aintree hospital&#151;I have noted that my hon.

<p><a name="stpa_o362"><a name="90520-0020.htm_para10"><a name="09052051000586">More action is needed to address the provision of radiotherapy services for residents north of the Mersey. I remind my hon. Friend the Member for Wirral, South that clinical reports, such as the one produced by Dr. Cottier of the national cancer services analysis team review, suggest that the majority&#151;67 per cent.&#151;of cancer sufferers requiring treatment live north of the Mersey. The additional services at Aintree are currently estimated to provide only 30 per cent. of the population needs from the north of the Mersey, and the remaining 70 per cent. will still need to travel to Clatterbridge for their treatment, typically on numerous occasions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o363"><a name="90520-0020.htm_para11"><a name="09052051000587">I am also informed that population and disease trend analysis suggests that demand for radiotherapy in Merseyside will rise by 26 per cent. by 2016, from a 2006 baseline. It is for these reasons that the Royal Liverpool University hospital has been identified as the preferred second location for additional radiotherapy services. I am informed that this proposal was put forward after considering the need for greater alignment of associated clinical services and specialist multidisciplinary teams for cancer. I also understand that the proposal has the potential to improve the strength of cancer research in Merseyside and Cheshire by developing closer links with the university of Liverpool and its Cancer Research UK centre, which, as my hon.

 I accept my hon. Friend&#146;s reluctance to accept my argument during this debate. I feel confident that the argument will continue outside the Chamber. I ask him to look at the figures and to accept that the link with the university of Liverpool and its Cancer Research UK centre is, as I am sure he will agree, an enormously valuable possibility.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o365"><a name="90520-0020.htm_para13"><a name="09052051000591">I am aware that Cheshire and Merseyside primary care trusts, with support from the cancer network, are in the process of developing a specification for the additional radiotherapy units. I have been informed that the latest position is that Cheshire and Merseyside PCTs will consider the proposal of additional radiotherapy provision north of the Mersey at Aintree and the Royal at their next round of board meetings in June of this year. It is important to note that this review, when fully implemented, will lead to a substantial investment in non-surgical oncology, as some &#163;30 million is being invested to bring new radiotherapy treatment facilities north of the Mersey.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o366"><a name="90520-0020.htm_para14"><a name="09052051000592">However, it is equally important that services are improved for Wirral and western Cheshire patients at the Clatterbridge Centre for Oncology. It is crucial that any improvement builds on the current excellent performance and services offered to all patients by this specialist cancer trust, which was scored excellent for both quality of services and use of resources by the Healthcare Commission in 2007-08.</p>

The past 10 years have witnessed real progress in cancer services nationally. I hope that the proposals that he has brought to our attention today will make a real and tangible difference to the people of Merseyside. I know that the prevention of inequalities and the work that has to take place to reduce those figures and that worrying trend are also part of our work as Members of Parliament and as Ministers. I want to express my best wishes to all those involved in the process of achieving those aims.</p>
