For example, we are currently establishing a network of regional and national champions, including for the west midlands, who will help to lead local partnerships to increase financial inclusion.</p>

 My hon. Friend represents a constituency in that situation, as do many others. The Department has done some mapping across the country to help to establish which areas are in the greatest need of additional resources. Several things are being done to address his specific concerns. First, as I have said, we co-operate with colleagues in the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform, and they are running crackdowns on illegal lenders in areas where they are at work. My Department is also doing some work through the growth fund, which is investing in credit unions and helping them to grow. Where we have invested, credit unions are growing rapidly, providing a source of affordable credit in the community so that people do not have to turn to, or rely on, doorstep lending or loan sharks.</p>

 The single most important thing that the Government can do to ensure financial inclusion in remote rural and deprived urban communities is to ensure access to cash. In that context, will the Minister assure me that the Department will do all that it can to ensure that it and all its agencies give equal prominence in, for example, every letter sent to benefit claimants to the opportunity to obtain cash at the post office through the Post Office card account? Will he join me in deploring the Pension, Disability and Carers Service in particular, which has been actively misleading clients about the future of the POCA and, in many letters, failing even to say that it is available?</p>

 No, we have lifted 600,000 children out of poverty and, as I said in my answer, another 500,000 are in the pipeline, so to speak. Interestingly, the hon.

We are committed to the target; the Opposition are not. We care about child poverty; they do not. That speech shows that the Tories have not learned the lessons of the 1980s and would be exactly the same if they were to return to power. The hon.

 May I say that, on reflection, the Secretary of State might regret comments suggesting that caring about child poverty is purely a party issue? He might want to reshape those remarks when he gets a chance. Is he not concerned that the figures show that the percentage of children risking poverty in two-parent families is hardly different from 1997? In fact, percentage-wise, the figure has gone up slightly. In caring for children in poverty, will the Secretary of State see whether he could do something more about how welfare policies act on two-parent families, because we all care about the issue?</p>

 The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right that we need to support two-parent families as well as lone-parent families.

We need to get partners in two-parent families into work to reduce child poverty, and we need to do the same for lone parents, but caring about child poverty means doing something about it.

Given that huge sums will not be available to increase tax credit payments still further, does he believe that the Government should reschedule the priority that they give to moving claimants from benefit into work so that we achieve the target?</p>

 My right hon. Friend is absolutely right to say that the figures for the past two years have been disappointing. We said that. That is exactly why we redoubled our efforts and put in the extra &#163;1 billion. He is right, too, that reducing child poverty is not just about tax credits and benefits, but about getting people back into work. Our goal is to do both. Talking about only the causes of poverty ignores the fact that one of its causes is not having enough money. That is why we also believe in increasing the money that goes to tax credits and child benefit, which we did at the previous Budget.</p>

 One group who can experience particularly severe poverty is disabled children. The Secretary of State will know that receipt of disability living allowance grants access to a range of other benefits that go alongside it, including disabled premiums on tax credits, and that, without it, families can miss out on upwards of &#163;10,000 a year. Given that the Government are unable to provide figures on DLA take-up rates, what action will his Department take to increase take-up of DLA and reduce the dire poverty faced by those particularly vulnerable children?</p>

 We are working to increase the take-up of DLA among families with disabled children. I recently met the Every Disabled Child Matters campaign, and we are working with it and others to increase take-up. We are spending money on a take-up campaign to ensure that everybody who is entitled to DLA claims it. Hon. Members can play their part, too, by ensuring that their constituents know that they should be claiming DLA if their children face those issues.</p>

 The Secretary of State talks about getting people back to work, and he is right to do so. He will be aware that half of children in poverty have a parent in work and that more than a fifth of poor children have a parent who works full time. What will the Government do to address the needs of that group of parents who earn enough to keep their children out of poverty but are then taxed to below the poverty line, even after receipt of tax credits?</p>

 The issue is about helping partners into work and making sure that we provide more money through tax credits, which is exactly what we did in the previous Budget. We want to consider how we can help partners to work, because very few families in which one partner works and the other works part time, or in which both work, are in poverty; I think that about 2 per cent. of children, a very low percentage, in such families are in poverty. We want to help people to work, and we want to give them more money, too. We want to tackle the causes of poverty and to give people more money through tax credits.</p>

 As my hon. Friend knows, I was very pleased that Remploy in my constituency was removed from the list of closures, but its continuing existence depends on it securing contracts. It supplies health care products to England and to Scotland but has no contracts in Wales. I made every effort to secure those contracts, but what else can the Government do  <br>

 The Government&#146;s fuel poverty target has, according to their own advisers, been missed, so I wonder what warm words they can offer elderly people and pensioners who face dramatically increased fuel costs.

An extra &#163;400 in winter fuel payments will be paid to those aged over 80. Indeed, we are going further than that by taking powers in the Pensions Bill, which is currently going through the other place, that will enable the data sharing of information with suppliers so that poorer pensioners can be put on to lower social tariffs, ensuring that they pay lower bills and get insulation. Warm Front has given 1.7 million homes assistance on insulation: an average of &#163;2,700 has been provided to ensure that homes are insulated and fuel bills are kept down, so quite a lot is happening in this respect.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman will be aware that pensions are for the long term and that investments go up and down. Therefore, deficits appear in schemes at different times, which sometimes go into surplus. Such changes occur. The only people immediately at risk would be those in a scheme where the employer moved into insolvency and there was a significant deficit. That is why the Pension Protection Fund has been set up. I remind the hon. Gentleman that the Government have restored confidence in pensions, not only by setting up the PPF, which ensures that people have a kind of insurance scheme, and creating the regulator that oversees risk in the pensions market, but by sorting out the financial assistance scheme and ensuring that those 140,000 people got justice. We are in the process of restoring confidence in pensions&#151;a confidence that was seriously damaged by his Government.</p>

 The Government&#146;s position on restoring the earnings link is that we will do so by 2012 or during the course of the next Parliament. The Government have been very explicit about that. The reason that we enshrined that commitment in law in the Pensions Act 2007 is that it is a fundamental part of our view that we need to restore full confidence in pensions as a whole. If the current operating policies were to continue, the value of the basic state pension would be about &#163;45 a week, and more than 75 per cent. of the pensioner population would end up on pension credit by 2050. We therefore have to reform the system. Uprating the basic state pension by earnings from 2012 will more than double the basic state pension by 2050, compared with its value if current uprating policies continued. The basic state pension earnings uprating, together with other reforms, will mean that about 30 per cent. of pensioner households will be entitled to pension credit by 2050, compared with over 75 per cent. if the present policies continued. The reform is therefore fundamental.</p>

That will be a stronger feature of the new employment and support allowance than it is of the current arrangements. If there are particular difficulties in the hon.

 With permission, Mr. Speaker, I wish to make a statement about the Government&#146;s plans for tackling bovine TB in England. In doing so, I would like to thank the Select Committee on Environment, Food and Rural Affairs both for its comprehensive and thoughtful report and for allowing me additional time to respond to it, which I have now done. I am also grateful to Professor Bourne and the members of the Independent Scientific Group for their thorough scientific study.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o5"><a name="80707-0004.htm_para0"><a name="08070711000155">Bovine TB is not a new problem. For more than 70 years, successive Governments have implemented cattle controls based on surveillance, testing and the slaughter of reactors. Those have been designed to protect public health, reduce the economic impact of the disease on farmers and, more recently, to comply with our obligations under European legislation. By the mid-1970s, the incidence of TB in cattle had reached an all-time low. However, since the 1980s, disease incidence has increased again&#151;with a significant rise following the 2001 foot and mouth epidemic&#151;and last year, nearly 3,200 new TB incidents were recorded and 18,543 reactor cattle were slaughtered in England.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o6"><a name="80707-0004.htm_para1"><a name="08070711000156">Bovine TB is a serious problem, particularly in the south-west and the midlands. Although more than 90 per cent. of herds are TB free at any one time and some significant cattle farming areas are largely without the disease, I know from listening to farmers living with it just how difficult it is, and, for those most seriously affected, I know that the economic and human consequences are simply devastating. That is why we should take the right decisions to help.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o7"><a name="80707-0004.htm_para2"><a name="08070711000157">Bovine TB is transmitted between cattle, and between cattle and badgers, but what has dominated the debate is whether badger culling could be effective in controlling the disease. The 10-year randomised badger culling trial overseen by the Independent Scientific Group on cattle TB, culled some 11,000 badgers to discover what impact it would have. The ISG&#146;s final report, published last year, concluded that reactive culling&#151;killing badgers in areas where there had been local TB breakdowns&#151;made the problem worse; and that proactive culling, which involves taking an area of about 100 sq km and repeatedly culling badgers over a number of years, produced only marginal benefits because although TB was reduced in that area, it increased outside of it because of the disturbance and movement of badgers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o8"><a name="80707-0004.htm_para3"><a name="08070711000158">While scientists agree that a prolonged and effective cull over even larger areas&#151;some 250 to 300 sq km&#151;could reduce the incidence of bovine TB, the ISG&#146;s judgment was that the practicality and cost of delivering a cull on that scale meant that</p>
<a name="80707-0004.htm_brev0"><a name="08070711000367"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;badger culling cannot meaningfully contribute to the future control of cattle TB&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o9"><a name="80707-0004.htm_para4"><a name="08070711000159">Having listened carefully to a wide range of views from scientists, farming, veterinary and wildlife organisations, and many others, and having considered all the evidence, I have decided that although such a cull might work, it might also not work. It could end up making the disease worse if the cull was not sustained over time or delivered effectively, and public opposition,  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="7 July 2008">

<notus-date day="7" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>7 July 2008 : Column 1154</b><br>
including the unwillingness of some landowners to take part, would render that more difficult. It would not be right to take that risk. Therefore, in line with the advice that I have received from the Independent Scientific Group, our policy will be not to issue any licences to farmers to cull badgers for TB control, although we remain open to the possibility of revisiting that policy under exceptional circumstances, or if new scientific evidence were to become available.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o10"><a name="80707-0004.htm_para5"><a name="08070711000160">This has been a difficult decision to take, and I know that farmers affected will be disappointed and angry. We all want the same thing&#151;to beat this terrible disease&#151;but I have had to reach a view about what will be effective in doing so, guided by the science and the practicality of delivering a cull. Having made a commitment to farmers and others that I would take a decision, now that it has been made, we need to put all our efforts into working together to take action that can work in all affected areas.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o11"><a name="80707-0004.htm_para6"><a name="08070711000161">I have therefore also decided to make vaccination a priority, as recommended by the Select Committee. Effective vaccines could in future provide a viable way of tackling disease in both badgers and cattle. We have invested &#163;18 million in the past 10 years in vaccine development, which has delivered good results, including: evidence that vaccinating young calves is effective; making progress towards developing a test to distinguish between infected and vaccinated cattle; showing that injectable BCG can protect badgers; and developing oral badger vaccine baits. I now intend to increase significantly our spending on vaccines by putting in &#163;20 million over the next three years to strengthen our chances of successfully developing them. I will also provide additional funding to set up and run a practical project to prepare for deploying vaccines in future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o12"><a name="80707-0004.htm_para7"><a name="08070711000162">It could be some time before an oral vaccine for badgers, or a cattle vaccine, becomes available, so for now we must reduce the spread of the disease, and try to stop it becoming established in new areas. We have cattle controls in place to tackle TB, and have strengthened them in recent years with the introduction of pre-movement testing and the targeted use of the more sensitive gamma interferon test. But the action that individual farmers take, in particular to deal with the risk of importing disease into their herd, will also remain critical.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o13"><a name="80707-0004.htm_para8"><a name="08070711000163">Disease control is not just a matter for Government, notwithstanding the considerable cost. Farmers have the main interest&#151;the burden of controls falls most heavily on them&#151;and they must be involved in working out how we go forward. It would be possible to tighten cattle measures still further as recommended by the ISG report, but that would come at a high cost. Whether it would be worthwhile is as much, if not more, a question for the industry as it is for Government. There is a choice to be made. That is why I have decided to set up a bovine TB partnership group with the industry to develop a joint plan for tackling bovine TB. We will discuss with the industry who should be on the group and how it should work, and I want to get started as quickly as possible.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o14"><a name="80707-0004.htm_para9"><a name="08070711000164">The group will have full access to information on the TB budget and will be able to make recommendations about its use. It will be able to propose further practical steps to tackle the disease, including, for example, whether there should be tighter cattle controls. It will help to reach decisions about the injectable vaccines deployment  <br>

project. It will be able to look at ways of helping farmers to manage the impact of living under disease restrictions, for example by providing incentives for biosecurity, or maximising the opportunities to market their cattle by looking again at the restrictions around red markets and encouraging the establishment of more exempt and approved finishing units. I am prepared to make additional funding available to support such initiatives if the group makes a strong case for doing so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o15"><a name="80707-0004.htm_para10"><a name="08070711000165">The House is united in its determination to overcome bovine TB, and much as we would all wish it, there is no quick or easy way of doing so. But our best chance is to work together, and I therefore hope that the industry will respond to my proposals so that we can get on with it.</p>

Was the reason that he did not wish to upset farmers before he attended?</p>

Will he also confirm that since 1997 more than &#163;600 million has been spent on combating the disease and 200,000 cattle have been slaughtered&#151;for what benefit?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o19"><a name="80707-0004.htm_para14"><a name="08070711000170">In that time, as the Secretary of State has said, the Government have produced just two initiatives, pre-movement testing and gamma interferon. Last year another 28,000 cattle were slaughtered, and perhaps the Secretary of State will confirm that according to figures for the period up to the end of April we are on course to slaughter 40,000 this year. There have been more than 1,400 new incidences this year, and nearly 5,500 herds were affected at the end of April. What would the Secretary of State say to a farmer to whom I spoke recently, who had just had a number of pedigree cattle taken? Yes, she had been compensated, but her complaint was about the waste of good cattle and taxpayers&#146; money, and about the fact that we were getting nowhere.</p>

How much is he planning to spend on TB in each of the three years of the current comprehensive spending review, and what is the projected number of cattle to be slaughtered in the setting of those budgets?

While we welcome the extra resources for vaccine development, given his predecessors&#146; commitments, how much more quickly does he expect it to produce results? What steps is he taking to examine other factors, such as the role of maize and possible trace element deficiencies in the spread of TB? Does he believe that the current frequency of testing is adequate, especially in areas that are adjacent to infected areas? Let me also ask him about the European context. Is it not the case that we are required to have a programme to eradicate TB?

an opportunity to run a selective removal programme, either using local knowledge&#151;as the proponents suggest&#151;or to validate the use of the PCR&#151;polymerase chain reaction&#151;test to establish whether setts contain infected animals? If it can be shown that removal was primarily of infected animals, would not that make it more acceptable and in the interests of badgers as well as cattle? I know that some of the right hon. Gentleman&#146;s advisers will say that the PCR test is not sufficiently accurate, so why is he content to slaughter thousands of cattle using a test with a sensitivity of only 80 per cent.?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o28"><a name="80707-0004.htm_para23"><a name="08070711000179">Nobody wants to remove large numbers of badgers but the Secretary of State cannot deny that this is also a disease that affects them. Badgers with TB die a nasty, lingering death. They are evicted from their family setts and wander around the country spreading the disease. Surely it is in the interests of a healthy badger population, as well as a healthy cattle population, that we tackle the disease from all angles. It is clear from the statement today that the Government are not prepared to do so.</p>

 First, I am happy to confirm that the statement represents the Government&#146;s policy on what we should do. The hon. Gentleman did not really respond to the question about badgers and the evidence. I disagree with his interpretation. In the end, it is no good taking a decision to allow something to happen that might not deliver the desired effect. The ISG report came as a great surprise to lots of people, as the hon. Gentleman will be only too well aware, and Professor Bourne made clear that what it found was counter-intuitive. But in the end the ISG&#146;s conclusion was, and I repeat it, that badger culling cannot meaningfully contribute. I have listened very carefully to that advice and have formed my judgment. I remain very clear in my view that it is the right decision to take.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o30"><a name="80707-0004.htm_para25"><a name="08070711000182">Secondly, the budget will depend on the progress of the disease, so it is not possible to give a forecast of the spend. It will depend on what happens, and the same is true for any forecast about the number of cattle that might be slaughtered. If the hon. Gentleman looks at the figures for England over the last five or six years, he will see that the number has gone up and down during that time. Investment in vaccines will give us greater prospect that a usable vaccine will be found and, in the end, we need to focus our effort on something that will enable us to deal with the problem of bovine TB in all the areas where it is to be found. Even those who advocate selective culling would recognise that that is not a policy that would work everywhere. We have absolutely not given up on control, and the PCR test is not capable of being used in the way that the hon. Gentleman described it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o31"><a name="80707-0004.htm_para26"><a name="08070711000183">On the effectiveness of our current measures, these are precisely the questions that I want to put, but not to another &#147;study group.&#148; The hon. Gentleman will be aware of how we have worked with the industry in tackling bluetongue, and that has been a successful partnership group. Why? Because we have sat down together, put the problems on the table, shared the responsibility and taken decisions accordingly. That is exactly the model that I wish to use now that I have taken a decision about badger culling.</p>

 I agree with my right hon. Friend about the impact of the disease and the effect it has on the farmers who are suffering as a result of it. We need to take all the measures that the evidence says will work and which are effective in dealing with the problem. That is why we have made changes in recent years, including bringing in the pre-movement testing which began for animals over 15 months of age in March 2006, and then extended to all cattle aged over 42 days. The straight answer is that it is probably still too early to tell exactly what the impact of that has been, which is why we must continue to monitor. It is important that we maintain the controls we have in place, and have an honest conversation with the industry about whether further cattle controls is the right step to take. I think it is right and proper to ask the industry what its view is precisely because of the impact on farmers, as opposed to me standing before the House today and saying that I have decided to impose those controls myself.</p>

I agree that it would be good to understand better the precise means of transmission, but all I can say to him on that is that, as his Committee&#146;s report set out very clearly, we still do not know quite a lot and it is important to continue with research to try to find the answers, but it is even more important that we make sure that effective controls are in place.</p>

I also wish to draw attention to my declaration of interests in the register, and to say that the farming business for which I have a responsibility recently underwent a tuberculin test and three cattle were found to be reactors and the results for 11 were inconclusive.

Where does he see that evidence coming from, and what research has he commissioned on that? The right hon.

He says that some landowners may not have supported the badger cull, but how many farmers will support the proposed bovine TB partnership group when they feel so let down and demoralised at the moment? With outbreaks of bovine TB increasing rapidly, what will the cost to the country be over the next three years? Will the Secretary of State revisit the compensation payments for pedigree and highly valuable stock?</p>

 I agree with the hon. Gentleman when he describes the situation as very sad, and I am sorry to hear about the effect on his herd. However, the answers were not based on populism: they were based on an assessment of the science. I assure him that I ignored nothing. I apologise to the House for having taken a year to reach a decision on this issue, but I took the responsibility placed on me very seriously.

Self-evidently, if all the badgers were, for the sake of argument, to be culled&#151;[<i> Interruption.</i>] I know that no one has argued for that, but my point is that the science only takes us so far. I also have to consider practicality and effectiveness, and whether a cull could be delivered. My judgment is that it might not work in those circumstances. The evidence base is strong, because the one substantive bit of evidence that we have about the impact of culling is the randomised badger trials, which were carried out over 10 years.</p>

their own decision and of course I considered that. I weighed very carefully in my mind what the Select Committee had to say. It was an outstanding report, but, in all honesty, I formed the judgment that I have, which I have told the House about today. The judgment had to be made about whether, in the light of the science, it was worth taking the risk when one could not guarantee that a cull on such a scale could be sustained given the strength of feeling about the question on both sides of the argument.

 Having been a member of the Government who set up the original Krebs inquiry, I was disappointed that Krebs did not take into account the work done in the Republic of Ireland by the East Offaly project.

 I have looked at all the evidence. Clearly, the circumstances in the Republic of Ireland are different from those in England. It is true that the Republic has culled badgers. As the hon. Lady will be aware, herd incidence fell from 6.4 per cent. in 2002 to 4.9 per cent. in 2004 in the Republic. It has subsequently risen again to a provisional figure of 6.1 per cent. in 2007. Based on those figures, it is difficult to form a judgment about the impact of culling or other measures that the Government in the Republic of Ireland are taking. I draw the hon. Lady&#146;s attention, too, to the experience in Northern Ireland, where, as she will know, there has been no culling. Cattle measures were tightened in Northern Ireland and the herd incidence decreased from 9.9 per cent.  <br>

 I congratulate the Secretary of State on making the decision, because it must have been very tempting to kick the issue into the long grass and go on holiday. Time will tell whether the decision is right or wrong, but is not the reality that the science did not justify a cull, and that the practicalities make a cull impossible?

As I said, we should all want to be able to move to a different way of dealing with this disease.

That is not what people expected, but it is what was found, and I must act on that judgment. I recognise that it is very difficult. We know that badgers are infected and are a source of infection&#151;no one argues about that.

Why would I want to do something that might make the matter worse, leading to more cattle being culled and more money being spent on compensation?</p>

 May I invite the Secretary of State to emphasise that his statement today was not about whether we should kill or not kill animals, but about which animals we should kill? So that we can educate our constituents more fully, will he remind us&#151;for the last period he has easy access to&#151;how many animals were killed, and what the cost of that was to taxpayers?</p>

 For England, the number of cattle slaughtered in 2007 was 19,800. The previous year it was 16,000; the year before, it was 23,000; the year before that, it was 17,300; and the year before that, it was 17,551. The House will see that the numbers go up and down, depending on the progress of the disease.

Since the Secretary of State has mentioned it twice, will he come down to Somerset and meet some real farmers on Exmoor? They want to know why they should be in livestock production when every time they test their herds, they find TB again, and they go round in a circle of slaughter and re-equipping.

 The legal position is extremely clear under the Protection of Badgers Act 1992. I very much hope that no one will be tempted to do what my hon.

 Although the Secretary of State is a very reasonable man, farmers in Gloucestershire, where the hot-spot areas are, will greet his announcement with absolute dismay and annoyance. In the past 10 years, 200,000 cattle have been slaughtered and we may be on course for 50,000 cattle to be slaughtered this year alone. That is a huge cost in human and animal misery, and in financial terms. The Secretary of State said, even today, that a proactive cull with hard boundaries may well produce some results.

 I sympathise with my right hon. Friend, who has had to make a very difficult decision. He has made the right one, and done so on the basis of practicalities as well as scientific evidence.

 With permission, Mr. Speaker, I would like to make a statement on biofuels.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o50"><a name="80707-0006.htm_para5"><a name="08070711000259">There is widespread agreement in the House and the country that we must step up efforts to tackle climate change through dramatic and global cuts in greenhouse gas emissions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o51"><a name="80707-0006.htm_para6"><a name="08070711000260">One of the most difficult challenges that we face is the use of fossil fuels for transport. Our cars and other forms of transport are the third largest source of carbon dioxide emissions in the UK. That is why the use of a clean, renewable energy, which can partly replace carbon-based fuels, was seen by experts, environmental campaigners and Governments around the world as a welcome and practical way of slowing emissions growth.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o52"><a name="80707-0006.htm_para7"><a name="08070711000261">In March 2007, after four years of encouraging biofuel use, the EU went further and set an ambitious target of 10 per cent. of transport fuel from renewable sources by 2020. In the UK, the Government introduced the renewable transport fuel obligation, which came into force earlier this year. That requires biofuels to make up 2.5 per cent. by volume of road transport fuel sales in the UK, increasing by 1.25 per cent. a year to 5 per cent. by 2010-11.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o53"><a name="80707-0006.htm_para8"><a name="08070711000262">The UK has also been at the forefront of global efforts to develop robust, and workable, sustainability standards for biofuels. As part of the RTFO, we introduced a requirement that transport fuel suppliers should report on the environmental performance of their biofuels. That will give us evidence on the impact of biofuels, as well as creating an incentive for suppliers to source the best biofuels.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o54"><a name="80707-0006.htm_para9"><a name="08070711000263">We also made a commitment to introducing at the earliest opportunity legally enforceable standards, which will ensure that biofuels are produced sustainably. However, in recent months questions have been asked about the more intangible, indirect effects of biofuels on food supplies and prices and on deforestation, and their overall impact on greenhouse gas emissions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o55"><a name="80707-0006.htm_para10"><a name="08070711000264">I am sure the House will agree that our policy on biofuels should be based on the best possible science. So in February, I asked Professor Ed Gallagher, the chair of the Renewable Fuels Agency, to examine the latest available evidence. I welcome the publication of his report today and want to thank Professor Gallagher and his team for their thorough work on a highly complex matter.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o56"><a name="80707-0006.htm_para11"><a name="08070711000265">Let me outline Professor Gallagher&#146;s main findings. Overall, the report confirms that biofuels can play a role in tackling climate change and that</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o57"><a name="80707-0006.htm_para12"><a name="08070711000266">It finds that by 2020</p>
<a name="80707-0006.htm_brev1"><a name="08070711000374"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;biofuels have the potential to deliver annual global greenhouse gas savings of approximately 338 to 371 million tonnes of carbon dioxide&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o58"><a name="80707-0006.htm_para13"><a name="08070711000267">But Professor Gallagher also concludes that there is a risk that the uncontrolled expansion and use of biofuels could lead to unsustainable changes in land use, such as the destruction of rainforest to make way for the production of crops. That might, in turn, increase greenhouse gas emissions, as well as contributing to higher food prices  <br>

and shortages. The Gallagher report therefore concludes that the introduction of biofuels should be slowed until policies are in place to direct biofuel production on to marginal or idle land and until these are demonstrated to be effective. The detail of these control mechanisms would need to be agreed internationally.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o59"><a name="80707-0006.htm_para14"><a name="08070711000268">However, the report rejects calls for a moratorium on biofuels. It concludes that</p>
<a name="80707-0006.htm_brev2"><a name="08070711000375"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;a moratorium will reduce the ability of the biofuels industry to invest in new technologies&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o60"><a name="80707-0006.htm_para15"><a name="08070711000269">and</p>
<a name="80707-0006.htm_brev3"><a name="08070711000376"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;will make it significantly more difficult for the potential of biofuels to be realised&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o61"><a name="80707-0006.htm_para16"><a name="08070711000270">In short, the report concludes that</p>
<a name="80707-0006.htm_brev4"><a name="08070711000377"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;the Government should amend but not abandon its biofuel policy&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o62"><a name="80707-0006.htm_para17"><a name="08070711000271">The report recommends that the rate of increase in the RTFO in the UK should be slowed to 0.5 per cent. per annum, so that the RTFO reaches 5 per cent. in 2013-14, rather than in 2010-11 as currently planned.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o63"><a name="80707-0006.htm_para18"><a name="08070711000272">At the EU level, the report concludes that a mandatory 10 per cent. renewable transport fuel target is not currently justified by the scientific evidence, but that a target of 10 per cent. by 2020 could be possible if a number of important conditions are met. Those conditions include sufficient controls on land use change being enforced globally, as part of a new climate agreement, and new evidence providing further confidence that the target can be met sustainably. In the meantime, Professor Gallagher says that a more appropriate range for the 2020 biofuel target would be around 5 to 8 per cent. by energy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o64"><a name="80707-0006.htm_para19"><a name="08070711000273">I agree with those key findings. Given the uncertainty and the potential concerns that Professor Gallagher sets out, it is right to adopt a more cautious approach until the evidence is clearer about the wider environmental and social effects of biofuels. We also need to allow time for more sustainable biofuel technologies to emerge. I therefore intend to consult formally on slowing down the rate of increase in the RTFO, taking the level to 5 per cent., as Gallagher recommends, by 2013-14, which would be subject to further confirmation in 2011-12.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o65"><a name="80707-0006.htm_para20"><a name="08070711000274">Professor Gallagher&#146;s findings are particularly significant in the context of ongoing debates about biofuel targets across the EU. To help to ensure that sustainability is put at the heart of those debates, the Environment Secretary and I are today jointly sending a copy of the Gallagher report to the relevant European Commissioners and to all EU Environment and Transport Ministers. In response to those concerns, including over rising global food prices, the Prime Minister has today been pushing for the G8 to work to develop new global benchmarks for sustainable biofuel production and use.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o66"><a name="80707-0006.htm_para21"><a name="08070711000275">The Government believe that the EU target of 10 per cent. renewable transport fuels by 2020 can remain an overall objective, but subject to clear conditions. I would like to set those out. First, the EU-level sustainability criteria currently being negotiated must address indirect, as well as direct, effects on land use. Secondly, the 10 per cent. target must be subject to rigorous review in the light of the emerging evidence, so that we can make an informed decision at EU level in 2013-14 about whether the target can continue. As Professor Gallagher also suggests, I agree that we should aim to target support on the development of lower carbon and other so-called &#147;second generation&#148; biofuels.</p>

 I thank the Secretary of State for advance notice of her statement. The Opposition have been telling the Government for months to think again on their biofuels policy. The Conservatives were the only political party to vote against the renewable transport fuel obligation. Although we believe that biofuels can have a role to play in tackling climate change, there must be safeguards to ensure that they come from sustainable sources and we must address the impact of biofuel production on land use and fuel prices. Frankly, the RTFO does neither of those things, and the statement provides only limited reassurance. The RTFO has come under sustained attack from groups such as Friends of the Earth, Oxfam, the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, the Royal Society and the Environmental Audit Committee, and today the Government&#146;s own Gallagher report confirms that biofuel targets set by the Government could lead to unsustainable changes in land use, higher food prices and a net increase in greenhouse gas emissions.</p>

I certainly welcome the slowdown that the Government have suggested they might undertake in relation to the 5 per cent. target, but a partial retreat is not enough.

It has failed the poor of the developing world because it was introduced without safeguards to tackle the problems that are caused when biofuel crops compete with food production.

 The hon. Lady has posed a series of questions, and I will answer as many as possible in the parliamentary time available. Let us avoid political point scoring for a moment and take a step back to look at the report in front of us. Surely she and her colleagues will acknowledge that&#151;as Gallagher found in his comprehensive review of the evidence&#151;there is a future for a sustainable biofuels industry. Indeed, just three years ago there was consensus on the issue among the Government, industry, environmentalists and, of course, her own party. It was only at the end of 2005, at a speech to the Renewable Energy Association, that her party leader, the right hon. Member for Witney (Mr. Cameron), said:</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o75"><a name="80707-0007.htm_para8"><a name="08070711000286">The hon. Lady must also acknowledge that the UK has been at the forefront of efforts to promote sustainability in respect of biofuels. She asked why we did not set up the review to examine indirect land use change before we introduced the RTFO. When she has time to read the Gallagher review, she will see that it says very clearly that the RTFO was established before evidence of the  <br>

scale of possible indirect effects was known. Indeed, a particularly influential paper from a US economist in February changed the terms of the debate, and the evidence has changed very rapidly over the past few months. It was precisely because the scientific evidence had been changing that I asked Professor Gallagher to review the evidence&#151;the latest evidence&#151;and to make recommendations about the way forward.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o76"><a name="80707-0007.htm_para9"><a name="08070711000287">We now face a clear choice: either we do as the hon. Lady suggests&#151;abandon our biofuels policy and put the RTFO on hold or, indeed, abolish it&#151;or we amend our policy and proceed more cautiously while collecting the evidence, narrowing the range of uncertainties and putting in place the appropriate safeguards. Professor Gallagher is very clear about the responsible way forward, and he thinks we should continue with our policies because there are such things as good biofuels. We need to encourage them and to put in place the sustainability that the hon. Lady and I both want, but we cannot risk all the investment in the sector, not only throughout the world but in our country, which might make it possible. Biofuels have the potential to produce very serious greenhouse gas emissions reductions if indirect land use change is avoided. That is the Gallagher review&#146;s overall finding, and it is one I accept.</p>

 My hon.

One recommendation of the Gallagher review is a specific target, negotiated at EU level, to try to encourage the production of advanced or second generation biofuels. We all need to think about that very carefully.</p>

Nevertheless, the broad conclusion that we should not abandon but amend the policy on biofuels is correct. Clearly, some biofuels are being produced unsustainably, but we should not throw out the biofuel baby with the bathwater, as some apparently would wish.</p>

Secondly, what steps is she taking to improve the sustainability criteria and certification of existing biofuels so that there are no problems with them, given the poor EU regulations on the matter?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o79"><a name="80707-0007.htm_para12"><a name="08070711000293">Thirdly, what discussions is the Secretary of State having with businesses involved in the development of second generation biofuels, which we all agree we should promote? There is an opportunity to progress that, and I hope that she can take it forward. Fourthly, what is she doing about what I think are the improper subsidies for biofuels from the US? I am thinking particularly of corn-based ethanol and the disgraceful splash-and-dash arrangements, which mean that adding 1 per cent. of US diesel qualifies the fuel for subsidies when it comes into this country. That is bad for climate change as well as for the economy.</p>

 First, I should say to the hon. Gentleman and the House that I take my obligations to the House extremely seriously. The press speculation about the content of this statement was not always well informed and certainly did not reflect the detailed content of the report. However, I welcome the tone of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s comments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o81"><a name="80707-0007.htm_para14"><a name="08070711000296">We do face a choice whether we should abandon the greenhouse gas savings that may come from biofuels&#151;if not now, then potentially in the future&#151;or whether we should scrap our commitment to biofuels and argue that Europe and the wider world should do so too. As I said, Professor Gallagher is clear about his view: we should proceed, albeit more cautiously than we had assumed we should in the past.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o82"><a name="80707-0007.htm_para15"><a name="08070711000297">The hon. Gentleman asked about food prices; the report has a chapter about the impact of biofuels on those. Professor Gallagher is clear that biofuels are not the only reason food prices have increased in recent years. Other, more important factors include smaller harvests last year because of droughts, higher fertiliser prices, rising gross domestic products and changing diets in the far east. The Gallagher review concludes that increasing demand for biofuels contributes to rising prices for some commodities, notably oil seeds. However, it says that the price rises are rarely more than 5 per cent. for most crops. That is one of the reasons it is suggesting a more cautious approach. In some areas, there is a marked impact, particularly in the short term, on particular populations in respect of some crops and some biofuels. That is why Professor Gallagher says that we ought to identify those specific effects and take global action to try to mitigate their impact.</p>

indirect effects of biofuels use. He also asked about second generation biofuels. One of the more surprising conclusions of the Gallagher review was that such biofuels do not always have a clear advantage over first generation biofuels, particularly when land use change is taken into account.</p>

Overall, the picture is much more complex than it sometimes appears at first sight; nevertheless, there is potential in exploring further the contribution of second generation biofuels.</p>

The Gallagher report says that a 10 per cent. transport renewables target could still be appropriate, provided that certain evidence emerges and that appropriate safeguards are in place. It is important, of course, that we should keep that under rigorous review and take any necessary action if evidence emerges that the target is too ambitious.</p>

Have we not an obligation to do all we can to reduce the production of maize-based ethanol, which is neither particularly effective nor particularly efficient and damages the livelihoods of many of the poorest people all around the world? The whole strategy ought to be about reducing the consumption of fuel by private road transport.

 My hon. Friend gives a very specific example of bad biofuels. He is absolutely right to suggest that we have a moral obligation to try to weed out, as it were, the impact of bad biofuels on food prices, as well as the potential risk of increasing overall CO2 emissions. The Gallagher report is clear, however, that there are sustainable biofuels and that we should direct their growth on to idle and marginal land. That is one way of minimising their impact.</p>

We have sizeable moral obligations as Governments across the world to try to think through the wider implications of how we feed the world.</p>

 It is true that hybrid and electric cars may well have an important role to play in the future. Indeed, Professor Julia King, who looked into the fuel efficiency of cars and potential technological solutions in future as a means of minimising the impact on the environment, suggested that those vehicles could have an important role after 2020. I have already had conversations with people who are interested in bringing more electric vehicles into the country. It is not necessarily a matter of financial incentives, as it is more about facilitating, particularly through the planning system, the infrastructure necessary to promote the use of those vehicles. Clearly, when people drive such a car, they need somewhere where they can plug it in to charge up. We are having discussions about this issue across government, but it is absolutely right to say that electric cars could have an important role to play in the future.</p>

 I hear what my right hon. Friend says. Speaking as someone who saw the advantages of the RTFO, I have not quite changed my mind, although I can also see some of the dangers. The reality of the statement is that we should be entering into international discussions with countries such as Brazil, where the biofuels industry is a major factor in development, and try to persuade them to look at using waste products such as molasses rather than corn or wheat, which my hon.

 I thank my hon. Friend for his comments. One of Gallagher&#146;s interesting conclusions is that the best and worst forms of greenhouse gas savings on biofuels are currently achieved from sugar cane. Even within Brazil, there are very good examples of biofuel production that are energy efficient and high yield. Some Brazilian mills even export electricity to the grid. What we need is a debate in global forums as well as within the EU about how to encourage the use of sustainable biofuels. One challenge that we have set the Renewable Fuels Agency, which will operate at arm&#146;s length from the Government, is to use the report and work with our international partners to establish more evidence and to try to encourage people to think differently about the way biofuels are currently grown.</p>

 The right hon. Gentleman makes an incredibly important point. In the north-east of England with the Ensus site, but also on other sites, the production process has very substantial direct greenhouse gas savings from well to wheel. Part of the reason for that is, as I have explained, that the co-products are also used to substitute for animal feed. What it does not take into account is the indirect impact. The report suggests that even in those cases we ought to think through the indirect impact.

The report sets out a cautious approach that will give us time to have those global negotiations to put in place progressive measures to control land use, and to make sure that as far as possible&#151;it will not always be possible&#151;first or indeed second generation biofuels are produced on idle or marginal land.</p>

The reason that investors are prepared to invest in clean technology and think about second generation biofuels is that there is a market for biofuels.

 The rush to biofuels seems to have led to at least three unexpected consequences: first, higher food prices; secondly, deforestation; and, thirdly, a sliver of sanity belatedly creeping into the Government. The Secretary of State knows that the 10 per cent. by 2020 target is dear to the heart of Jos&#233; Manuel Barroso, the European Commission President. Although she is clearly doing the right thing in sending out signed copies of the report to any interested parties in the EU, she must also remember that the largest biofuels producer is France, which has just taken over the presidency of the EU.

 I thank the hon. Gentleman for his comments. I will seek to persuade my European partners and the European Commission to take such evidence seriously, and to encourage them and their scientific experts to work with those in the RFA in examining it. However, to say that biofuels inevitably increase food prices is a bit simplistic. One of the messages of the report is that some biofuels have a significant impact, especially in the short term and on certain types of rural poor. In the longer term, the effects are much mitigated, and the world should perhaps be thinking about policies to mitigate those impacts in the short term too. It is important to have a balanced approach, and to encourage France and Italy, which are already showing signs of working with us in this area, to continue the pursuit of a sustainable biofuels industry.</p>

Given that the decision on the draft EU directive will be taken by majority voting, what confidence does she have that her new conditionality and different target will be accepted, as the directive is, after all, mandatory?</p>

 I said that we should be arguing for a non-binding target, but a target of 10 per cent. conditional on certain elements: first, second generation biofuels should emerge; and secondly, unsustainable land use change should be avoided and sustainability safeguards adopted. I said that we should review the evidence in 2011-12, and again later, to confirm those targets.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman asks what confidence I have in the sustainability criteria that are currently being negotiated. The report concluded that they ought to be made more sophisticated. Although we have tried to capture the direct impacts on greenhouse gas emissions from well to wheel, we have not yet attempted to calculate the impact of the indirect effects of biofuel production, which is an incredibly difficult calculation. Before January this year, hardly anyone with an interest in the subject even considered the possibility of significant indirect effects on either greenhouse gas emissions or food prices. One of the challenges that we face is to work with our European partners intensively over the next few months to develop a set of sustainability criteria that include a measure of indirect impact.</p>

 The Secretary of State admitted a moment ago that growing food shortages and soaring food prices had rendered the redirecting of cereal and root crops to biofuel production highly questionable. She is presumably aware that much of our current biodiesel production results from the refining of used cooking oil. Can she tell us what percentage of it comes from that source, and has she any idea of the potential annual tonnage?</p>

However, I have talked to suppliers about their innovations in that regard. The hon.

 I very much welcome the decision to have in this important estimates debate a discussion on the Transport Committee&#146;s report on ticketing and concessionary travel on public transport. That report focuses on the new national concessionary local travel scheme for older and disabled people. It also discusses a number of other important issues, including integrated ticketing, smartcard technology and revenue protection, which includes looking at how to minimise fare dodging. All those issues are extremely important for passengers and public alike and it is extremely important that we have the opportunity today to discuss both the report and the issues raised in it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o91"><a name="80707-0008.htm_para4"><a name="08070711000334">A great deal of attention was attracted by the inquiry. More than 40 organisations and individuals submitted written evidence and the Committee held four oral evidence sessions, questioning 24 witnesses including the Under-Secretary of State for Transport, my hon.

important that a scheme that is popular and welcome should be funded properly and fairly. Although the concessionary passes are Integrated Transport Smartcard Organisation&#151;ITSO&#151;compliant smartcards, only 5 to 10 per cent. of the bus fleet will be equipped to process them by the end of 2008. Part of the reason for that appears to be the cost to the bus operators of installing the equipment to use those cards to their full. That is not a satisfactory situation. The Government must speed up this process, both to secure the best and optimum use of the card and to obtain more accurate information about who is travelling using the card. That is extremely important in relation to the revenue issues to which I have referred.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman makes an important point, and anticipates my next comment. The report considered this issue. Concessionary fare schemes are very much to be welcomed, but the transport has to be there for people to be able to enjoy them. The Committee raised the question of community transport, and called for more support to enable more community transport to be provided and for that to be eligible for the concessions, or equivalent concessions, so that people, and particularly those living in rural areas, would be able to benefit from widened opportunities in terms of transport. That is what the scheme is all about.</p>

 I wish to reiterate what my hon. Friend the Member for Macclesfield (Sir Nicholas Winterton) said about rural counties. In Shropshire this month, many bus services are being stopped. Although it is great that the Government want to have concessionary travel, my constituents are extremely concerned that if there are no services in some places, there will be two classes of citizen.

 The absence of bus services in some areas is a very important issue, and it is one of the consequences of deregulation.

 The point the hon.

 The important point the hon.

His point has been raised by a number of local authorities, and our Committee&#146;s report talks about the importance of evaluating the scheme and of a re-evaluation of how the money is allocated.

Would it not have been better if the Government had said that, for the first couple of years, local authorities would be able to work out their costs, indent for them, and then have an evaluation and a formula? Instead, we will have winners and losers and will have to work out what to do about that.

whole journey. Here we found a great difference between rail travel and bus travel. On rail, because of the Government&#146;s actions in ensuring that provision was made through the franchises, arrangements ensure through ticketing on the national network, and that is of great importance to passengers. However, wider concerns remain about the wider issue of ticketing, including the availability of tickets.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o95"><a name="80707-0009.htm_para1"><a name="08070711000350">Closure or minimal staffing of ticket offices may force passengers to use the internet or ticket machines when they do not want to. Indeed, some tickets are available only on specific websites and machines do not operate for all ticket types. It is important that all passengers have access to all tickets and can get the best deal when they travel by train.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o96"><a name="80707-0009.htm_para2"><a name="08070711000351">Since the report was completed, announcements have been made that fares, and the tickets that go with them, are to be simplified. It will be important to look at that in more detail. Simplification of the fare structure is to be welcomed, but concerns have been raised about whether the simplification will mask large price rises. That is a matter that we will need to look at in the future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o97"><a name="80707-0009.htm_para3"><a name="08070711000352">The situation with integrated ticketing on buses is highly unsatisfactory. Concerns about breaching competition law have impeded action in addressing the problem that several different tickets may be required for one journey. The Government must ensure that the new Local Transport Bill provides the means, perhaps through quality contracts, to resolve that. It is important that any measures introduced should be strong enough.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o98"><a name="80707-0009.htm_para4"><a name="08070711000353">I am pleased to see in the Government&#146;s reply to the report that they will consider a recommendation that traffic commissioners have the power to arbitrate if local authorities and bus operators cannot agree on the pricing of multi-operation travel cards. More needs to be done on integrated ticketing on buses, and the Bill may help, but we must ensure that the problems are resolved. The Committee also noted that insufficient attention is given to travelling by coach. Many people travel by coach, yet there is little integrated ticketing and little attention is given to coach travel as a mode of transport.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o99"><a name="80707-0009.htm_para5"><a name="08070711000354">We were told in one of our Committee sessions by the director of fares and ticketing at Transport for London that tickets were introduced in 1853 to prevent bus conductors from pocketing fares. He told us that 70 per cent. of revenues used to disappear and that was why tickets were introduced. It now appears that tickets are giving way to the plastic smartcard and, indeed, to other technologies. We looked at the successful Oyster card scheme in London and at other local smartcard schemes. TFL anticipates that the Oyster pay-as-you-go system will be linked to the national rail network in London by 2010.

Industry experts assess the costs of smartcards and rail franchises at &#163;100 million per scheme and it costs &#163;3,000 to equip a bus with equipment for the cards. Technology is important but the Government must show the benefits and how the cost is justified.</p>

 To go back to the subject of concessionary fares, and as the hon. Lady has been talking about trains, did her Committee consider the merits or otherwise of extending the concessionary fare scheme for pensioners to allow them to travel on trains, too? Obviously, train operators have expressed some concerns that they are losing out on some of their custom. Given her talk about integrated ticketing systems, does she think that the future for concessionary bus fares is that they will be extended to rail services, too?</p>

<p><a name="st_o209"><a name="08070711000357"><a name="80707-0009.htm_spnew1"><a name="08070711000614"><b>Mrs. Ellman:</b>
 We received some limited evidence on that issue. We felt that we were not in a position to make recommendations, but that it might well be considered in the future. We stated that it was very important for local additions to the national scheme to be considered locally.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o101"><a name="80707-0009.htm_para7"><a name="08070711000358">We also looked at revenue protection and preventing fare dodging. We felt that that should have a much higher priority, particularly as fare evasion is often linked to antisocial behaviour. In 2006-07, there were 299 recorded attacks on staff connected with revenue collection in London stations alone. The Association of Train Operating Companies reported that 8 per cent. of revenue&#151;that is, &#163;400 million&#151;is lost through passengers not paying fares. How much of that is deliberate evasion is unclear. It is clear that the availability of staffed ticket offices is important both to prevent fare evasions and to minimise aggressive behaviour, which has been reported when there are no staff in the area.</p>

 Should not the train operating companies and bus operators that allow off-duty police constables on their services for free be applauded? When fare evaders are caught, they can often cut up rough, and it is reassuring for passengers and revenue protection officers if off-duty police constables are encouraged to use public transport where appropriate.</p>

 I agree with the hon. Gentleman. Indeed, we recommended that there should be additional staff involved and we were sorry that the Government did not accept some of our recommendations on that. We also called for a more independent appeals process for passengers who were accused of deliberate evasion. Again, we regretted that the Government did not feel able to support our cause. We hope that they will reconsider.</p>

We looked to the future and suggested that concessionary schemes for young people could be considered. We decided to broaden the terms of reference of the inquiry that we are conducting on school transport to enable us to consider in more detail matters such as concessionary schemes for young people. I hope that we will receive appropriate evidence on the subject, because it is extremely important. All the issues that the Committee considered in its inquiry&#151;concessionary fares, ticketing, revenue protection and integration&#151;are important for passengers. They all contribute to the important task of making public transport accessible and attractive.</p>

 The hon. Lady has not really touched on the issue of the complexity of buying the best value ticket. I am concerned about the elderly who need to use public transport, whether they travel by bus, coach or train. Is she concerned about the fact that elderly people, in particular, may not be getting value for money or a fair deal, because the system is so complicated that they do not understand how to go through it, and ticket sellers at bus stations or railway stations will not always give them the best-priced ticket?</p>

 The hon. Gentleman is right to emphasise that point. The Committee conducted an inquiry on the issue, in which it drew attention to the problems that older people and other passengers had in accessing the best value tickets simply. Earlier this afternoon, I referred to people being forced to use the internet or machines, and mentioned the problems relating to that.

The Transport Committee, of which I was a member for my first 18 months in Parliament, has a reputation for having formidable Chairmen, and I am sure that she will establish her credentials in that regard. First, I must declare a non-pecuniary interest: one of the largest employers in my constituency is the Plaxton coachworks, part of the Alexander Dennis group, which makes not only coaches but buses. Some 550 people in my constituency rely on the public taking buses and making coach journeys, so I certainly have a constituency interest in promoting the use of buses and coaches.</p>

 My hon.

Perhaps it is not as safe a topic of debate as he suggests.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o106"><a name="80707-0009.htm_para12"><a name="08070730000005">Some people have described the concessionary scheme for the disabled and over-60s as a vote-catching gimmick. I reject that categorically, as to judge from the polls it has not caught many votes. I suspect that last month some of the voters of Crewe and Nantwich may even have used their concessionary tickets to go to the polling stations to vote Conservative for the first time. Eleven million people are now able to take advantage of their new right to off-peak bus travel across the borders of their travel concession authorities, whereas previously they could only use that concession locally. Our concern is about how the scheme may have been implemented and funded, and that is echoed by many of the points raised in the Select Committee&#146;s report.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o107"><a name="80707-0009.htm_para13"><a name="08070730000006">I do not often say this, but in many ways the Government have been a victim of their own success.</p>

Nationwide, the use of concessionary fares has increased by between 30 and 50 per cent., and by even more in some areas&#151;for example, Gloucester and Cheltenham have experienced growth of 120 per cent. In Greater Manchester, passenger journeys have increased by more than 10 million since the introduction of free travel for the over-60s and disabled. That is in the context of falling bus ridership outside London.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o109"><a name="80707-0009.htm_para15"><a name="08070730000010">The bill is picked up by the local authority where the trip originates. That has led to an increase in costs for some authorities, particularly in hot-spot destinations such as coastal towns and urban centres, where the share of the extra &#163;212 million for this year has fallen short of the demand. Other local authorities in places such as Surrey have made a profit where resources have been over-allocated. Examples include Basildon, where a &#163;500,000 shortfall was projected this year. In Blackpool, a &#163;200,000 shortfall was projected. That does not cover the scheme that the council has had to introduce for its trams&#151;because no one would use the trams when they had a concessionary ticket to use the buses, the authority has had to introduce a parallel scheme for the trams at additional cost to it. In Carlisle, a &#163;272,000 shortfall has been projected. All the Essex authorities, including Chelmsford, Maldon&#151;</p>

 As my hon. Friend says, this debate is about scrutinising the Government. We are arguing not with the overall budget for the scheme but about its allocation&#151;some local authorities have been allocated more money than they have used.

When I brought the deputy leader of Worthing council, Ann Barlow, and the leader of Adur council, Neil Parkin, to see the Minister, they said that they would rather the scheme were not funded through them. Why do local authorities need to control this scheme? They are losing money that will be made up by council tax payers, or by the cutting of local services. Why can the Government not fund what is supposedly a fully funded scheme and operate it themselves, rather than operate it through local authorities, which have to pick up the bill for what is, in our case, not a fully funded scheme?</p>

 I shall make some progress, if I may. I suspect that I anticipate the point that the hon. Gentleman wants to make.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o120"><a name="80707-0010.htm_para3"><a name="08070730000041">Secondly, councils are cropping other services not connected to travel to balance their books. A recycling programme in Christchurch has had to be scrapped as a direct result of underfunding for concessionary fares.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o121"><a name="80707-0010.htm_para4"><a name="08070730000042">Finally, a number of local authorities have been left with no option but to increase council tax. Adur in West Sussex, Worthing and Torbay are just three examples of that. According to a representative of Suffolk Coastal district council,</p>
<a name="80707-0010.htm_brev1"><a name="08070730000074"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;last year&#146;s Council Tax increase almost all went towards supporting the concessionary travel costs&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o122"><a name="80707-0010.htm_para5"><a name="08070730000043">The situation is little better for bus operators. Mr. Peter Shipp, the chairman and chief executive of the East Yorkshire Motor Services group, has described the situation as</p>
<a name="80707-0010.htm_brev2"><a name="08070730000075"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;even more of a financial and operational disaster than I predicted&#148;,</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o124"><a name="80707-0010.htm_para7"><a name="08070730000045">The new concessionary fare scheme is having a destructive effect on partnerships between local authorities and bus operators, which is jeopardising improvements to local networks. Bus operators have had to spend a considerable proportion of their time on concessionary fares administration and appeals&#151;time that could more productively have been spent improving bus services. It is clear that the uncertainties of reimbursement are affecting the bus operators&#146; attitude to risk, which may be reflected in tender prices for bus contracts.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o125"><a name="80707-0010.htm_para8"><a name="08070730000046">The principal bone of contention between local authorities and operators relates to calculating the so-called general travel factor, which means the travel pattern that would have been experienced without the concessionary fares. That factor is used as the basis of reimbursements paid to the operator. In many cases, that leads to appeals by operators. A bus operator can appeal if it feels that it has been inadequately reimbursed by the local authority, but it is worth noting that the local authority cannot appeal if it feels that it has been inadequately reimbursed by the Government. Will the Minister let us know how many appeals have already been lodged with her Department?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o126"><a name="80707-0010.htm_para9"><a name="08070730000047">Another common complaint is that whereas operators can increase fares without consultation, the grant awarded to local authorities to reimburse operators will increase only with inflation. If a bus company is in financial difficulties, it can raise fares. Because local authorities must reimburse it for revenue forgone based on a percentage of revenue, it will be the council that loses out.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o127"><a name="80707-0010.htm_para10"><a name="08070730000048">Mr. Shipp wrote to me at the end of May outlining the bureaucratic nightmare that is unfolding for companies such as his. He stated that one natural result of the new reimbursement arrangements is that he is paid a different amount by Scarborough borough council for a journey to Beverley than by East Riding of Yorkshire council for the return journey. Even worse, because East Riding is offering its residents a &#163;15 pass to enhance the national scheme and provide pre-9.30 am travel to and from Hull, East Yorkshire Motor Services has to bill East Riding council for journeys made by its residents from Hull before 9.30 am, but Hull city council for the same journeys after 9.30 am. That is an example of the bureaucratic morass that such companies are having to deal with.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o128"><a name="80707-0010.htm_para11"><a name="08070730000049">Such companies are also finding that on sunny days, a large number of people entitled to concessionary fares are turning up for leisure journeys. All well and good, one might say, but as a result they are leaving regular fare-paying passengers behind because there is no room. Because of that, East Yorkshire Motor Services has just cancelled a &#163;6,000 summer marketing campaign for fear of encouraging fare-paying families who would otherwise have been using their cars to turn up for buses that they cannot get on because they are full of pensioners.</p>

 It is important that, when local people vote for their councillors, they can vote for extensions to the scheme.

 We are not the party of government at this time. We are debating a scheme, which the Government introduced. The Select Committee has made some criticisms of it and it is only fair that the Government should respond to the points made in the debate. I simply make the point that companies throughout the country, not only in Yorkshire, are finding the scheme difficult to implement. Surely that cannot be laid at the door of the Opposition, who are not responsible for it.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman has been generous in giving way. He rightly said, in answer to the hon. Member for Telford (David Wright), that he does not speak for the party of government.

 We have made and continue to make the point that we feel that the funding that the Government have allocated&#151;&#163;214 million this year, increasing in future, with a total budget of approximately &#163;1 billion for a billion journeys&#151;is adequate for the scheme. The problem is its allocation to local authorities and the way in which some local authorities pocket a surplus and others, such as Worthing, which my hon. Friend the Member for East Worthing and Shoreham (Tim Loughton) represents, lose out. Those in Surrey have a surplus and I am sure that, although the authorities that labour under a deficit are knocking on the Minister&#146;s door almost every day, the ones that have a surplus do not do that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o129"><a name="80707-0010.htm_para12"><a name="08070730000056">It is important to have equitable funding. I am not sure, even after reading the report, how the Government have arrived at some of the figures. Are they simply good guesstimates?</p>

 My hon. Friend has made it clear that anomalies already exist in the funding formula and they need to be addressed. However, he and others also clearly said that we proposed an amendment to the Concessionary Bus Travel Act 2007 to provide for an automatic review of the way in which the funding formula worked in two years to try to iron out some of the anomalies. Of course, the Government rejected that. They had an opportunity in the measure to ensure that the funding formula could be examined shortly. It is already going wrong, but the Government would not allow us to include in the Bill a provision for examining the matter in two years. Surely we have given that undertaking.</p>

First, does she intend to tackle cross-border journeys in the United Kingdom? Hon. Members who have constituencies near the Welsh border have raised that point and the right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Sir Alan Beith) has raised the matter in the House in connection with the Scottish border.

that, but the matter has been raised and places genuine limitations on those living near the border. We must bear it in mind that we live in a United Kingdom, not separate countries.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o131"><a name="80707-0010.htm_para14"><a name="08070730000060">Secondly, will the grant&#151;I believe that it is around &#163;4.50 per pass&#151;paid to local authorities for issuing passes be available for renewal after they run out in three years, or is it a one-off payment to local authorities for the initial issuing of the first passes?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o132"><a name="80707-0010.htm_para15"><a name="08070730000061">Thirdly, although we do not argue about the amount of the Government grant to fund the scheme, will the Minister carry out an urgent review of the allocation process, and possibly consider the Local Government Association&#146;s suggestion of distributing the grant on a per journey basis, as well as other solutions that could improve the scheme?</p>

My hon. Friend will have received a letter from a Geraldine Roberts, who is the chair of the residents against station closures group, concerning Sheffield Midland station and the development there. Those who have had the opportunity&#151;in fact, the pleasure&#151;to come to Sheffield will have arrived at a station that has now been refurbished. The entrance has been developed and the walkway into the centre of Sheffield is now commensurate with a modern European industrial city.</p>

The franchise that has been obtained by Stagecoach, in its bid for the east midlands franchise, is now creating problems in the operation of Sheffield Midland station. There have been two major developments in Sheffield, on each side of the station, one of which is the Park Hill flats. Those who come into Sheffield will know that the block has been there since the 1960s. It has undergone a massive refurbishment by English Partnerships and Urban Splash. On the other side of the station is Sheffield Hallam university, a very good university that is driving major parts of Sheffield&#146;s regeneration, part of which involves the creative industries quarter and the digital centre.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o136"><a name="80707-0010.htm_para19"><a name="08070730000066">The franchise said that gating could be installed, in order to protect the companies from fraud and the lack of fares, as well as to reduce crime. Both of those considerations we accept. However, we want a proper cost-benefit analysis, because the movement of population from one side of the station to the other is very much through the station&#151;indeed, it is an historical fact of the development of Sheffield&#146;s railway network, city centre and university, as well as the residential area in and around Park hill.

under &#147;Ticket gates&#151;not the only solution&#148;, which is a fair one, challenges some of the franchises that have been given out, particularly on the east coast main line. I hope that the issue can be revisited, as the report asks, to ensure that the cost-benefit analysis is done.</p>

It is not necessary to reiterate all the points that I made on that occasion, not least because some of them have been made already by the hon. Member for Scarborough and Whitby (Mr. Goodwill). However, I should like to stress the need for an evaluation, which the hon. Lady mentioned. The scheme is new and a lot of kinks and quirks have appeared, perhaps inevitably. It is very important indeed that there should be a proper evaluation, as she correctly said.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o141"><a name="80707-0010.htm_para24"><a name="08070731000003">When I asked for such an evaluation in the debate on 25 March, the Minister made no commitment to one.

Like most hon. Members, I make that call not out of mischief, but because there are genuine problems and kinks in the scheme as it is currently working. If the hon.

That is particularly the case for seaside towns and attractive areas such as Lewes, which is considerably out of pocket, as well Worthing, which has now been mentioned for the fourth time in this debate. However, some authorities have been gaining money for which, frankly, there is no justification. Obviously those authorities keep quiet about that; nevertheless, there is an imbalance in the way in which the money is distributed.</p>

 My hon. Friend is right to draw attention to the problems in funding the scheme. However, does he agree that another important consideration is that in many cases passenger transport authorities have underestimated what their response to the scheme should be? For instance, Greater Manchester passenger transport authority has been totally overwhelmed by the number of applicants for the new passes. As a consequence, many residents are still waiting for their passes, and will be waiting for another several months.</p>

 My hon. Friend is absolutely right. Many local authorities were not entirely ready for the scheme when it was introduced, but that was not necessarily their fault. It is a question of how the scheme was rolled out, the availability of smartcard technology and other matters, which I shall come to. However, we have not yet seen the full picture, which is perhaps another reason for a full evaluation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o143"><a name="80707-0010.htm_para26"><a name="08070731000007">It is quite clear from the responses that I have received&#151;I imagine that this is true of the responses that the hon.

Part of the reason for that deficit is that the Government have been successful in their concessionary fares scheme. They have encouraged more people to use public transport and, by getting people on to buses, met some of their objectives on social exclusion and even, one might argue, on climate change.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o144"><a name="80707-0010.htm_para27"><a name="08070731000008">The Government can say, &#147;Here is a success,&#148; but they cannot say that there is no extra cost to councils as a consequence.

I have talked to our shadow Chancellor, my hon. Friend the Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable), who is a hard man to get money out of.

That is exactly the sort of thing that the Committee should be doing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o147"><a name="80707-0011.htm_para1"><a name="08070731000013">The report is not just about concessionary fares; it also deals with other matters. The hon. Member for Liverpool, Riverside mentioned fare evasion, which is an important issue. I support her suggestion that there should be a better independent appeals body. It is quite right that those who are seeking to avoid paying their fare should be caught and dealt with properly. It is unacceptable to the proper fare payer that others are getting free travel by seeking to avoid payment. However, people are sometimes given unjustified penalties. A constituent of mine, a young student, got on a train without having paid the fare because there was no one in the booking office. They were subsequently charged a penalty fare because they had not seen the conductor on the train to get a ticket as soon as they got on. That cannot be right, and we need to resolve issues such as those. An independent appeal body that works would be the right way forward, and I fully endorse the hon. Lady&#146;s proposal for such a body.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o148"><a name="80707-0011.htm_para2"><a name="08070731000014">One way of dealing with such problems is by gating stations. I do not pretend that that is the full answer, but I know from speaking to Transport for London that it has massively increased its fare income&#151;by 15 to 20 per cent., I think&#151;by putting gates on the North London line, which it has taken over from a British Rail-type body. I am not sure which of the train operating companies it was. TFL has improved its income stream markedly by gating those stations. Technology can therefore help to provide answers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o149"><a name="80707-0011.htm_para3"><a name="08070731000015">I want also to deal with integrated ticketing, but I shall preface my remarks by saying that we need to recognise that there is a problem with the bus services that are provided in this country. The problem dates partly if not wholly back to deregulation in the 1980s. The statistics from the Department demonstrate that the average cost of bus fares has increased markedly above inflation in the intervening years, and particularly since this Government came to power in 1997. The average cost of bus fares has increased by 13 per cent. above inflation since 1997.</p>

The cost of travelling by bus has gone up by more than the cost of travelling by train and, dare I say it, by more than the cost of motoring in those years, notwithstanding recent fuel price increases.</p>

The subsidy to bus services in 1986 was &#163;847 million. When this Government came in, it was largely unchanged at &#163;881 million. By 2006, however, it had rocketed to &#163;2,452 million. That represents a tripling of the subsidy in the 11 years of this Government, at a time when fares have been increasing at above the rate of inflation and bus passenger numbers have continued to fall. That is not a success. Between 1985 and 2006, the number of bus journeys in Scotland fell by 30 per cent., in Wales by 28 per cent. and in the non-metropolitan areas of England by 22 per cent. It is only in London  <br>

 To be fair to the Government, they have started to go along that track with their proposals in the Local Transport Bill. They will make it easier to bring in quality contracts and give local authorities more control over the type of bus operations in their area. We would go further than the Government are going, however, and I have tabled amendments to the Bill to try to achieve that, as the Minister knows. Collectively, however, we all have to recognise that the statistics that I have just given demonstrate a failure of bus policy over 20 years, and unless there are proposals to remedy that&#151;such as those that we have put forward and, to some extent, those from the Government, though they are not enough&#151;the failures, including decreasing patronage and increasing costs, will continue.

It is easier for people to use public transport if their tickets are integrated. They want to be able to buy just one ticket for their whole journey. Integrated ticketing also helps to avoid extra costs. The hon. Member for Liverpool, Riverside rightly drew attention to the fact that people often have to buy multiple tickets, which drives up the cost of their journey. Even in London, someone who gets off one bus and gets on another has to pay again, until they have reached the ceiling on their Oyster card.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o154"><a name="80707-0011.htm_para8"><a name="08070731000024">The fact is that no real attempts are being made to make integrated ticketing work. Paragraph 1 on page 30 of the report states:</p>

of cross-ticketing arrangement with buses. More than 200 towns and cities outside the metropolitan areas are covered by the scheme, which is fair enough, but there are many areas that are not covered. It is not sufficient to rely on local initiatives to make up the difference. It would take a very long time to achieve that, and the Government need to be more proactive in encouraging integrated transport ticketing, between rail and bus services in particular, but also between bus operators.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o157"><a name="80707-0011.htm_para11"><a name="08070731000027">I have to tell the hon.

For example, we wanted to make it a requirement for those involved in local quality contracts to consult Network Rail and the train operating companies, but that proposal was rejected by the Government, so our proposal to help to achieve integration was actually voted down by her colleagues. I hope that she will take that up with the Minister at some point.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o158"><a name="80707-0011.htm_para12"><a name="08070731000028">Integrated ticketing will be helped by the roll-out of smartcard technologies, and I think that we are all in favour of that. We have only to look at London to see what a great success the Oyster card has been. Incidentally, I hope that we will soon reach the stage at which Oyster cards can be used on mainline suburban rail services as well as on the underground.

How much does she estimate it would cost to put smartcard readers on all buses? I understand that the Department for Transport has made a rough estimate of the cost, but we have failed to see answers to these questions so far. She doubtless shares our vision that that system should be rolled out, so, having given us an estimate, will she tell us how she thinks that the system should be applied to buses?

 My hon. Friend the Member for Scarborough and Whitby (Mr. Goodwill) made a very good speech highlighting some of the deficiencies in the Government&#146;s concessionary travel funding for local councils. I applaud the fact that he has raised the issue, because Shrewsbury and Atcham borough council has been grappling with it for a long time. When he raised it, various Labour Members tried to suggest that we were making party political points, but it is a genuine issue, and my local council&#146;s finance director, Mr. Campbell Thomson, has written to me on more than one occasion to highlight the deficiencies&#151;the big gaps&#151;in Government funding. The council has to find funding from elsewhere to cover the concessionary travel scheme, and it is running to hundreds of thousands of pounds. That is a point well worth making, and I hope that the Minister will assure us of increased funding for Shrewsbury and for Shropshire.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o166"><a name="80707-0011.htm_para20"><a name="08070731000041">I want to highlight for the Minister some specific points about Shropshire. Shropshire has a much higher percentage of over-85-year-olds than anywhere else in the country, and Shrewsbury has been voted the number one retirement destination in England, because it is such a beautiful town. [<i> Interruption.</i>] It is much nicer than Worthing. I want the Minister to take that into consideration, because with so many senior citizens in Shrewsbury, the travel scheme will be even more popular.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o167"><a name="80707-0011.htm_para21"><a name="08070731000042">The Minister will know just how rural Shropshire is. There are some very big distances between the many villages in my constituency and the county town of Shrewsbury, and as I said in an intervention on the hon. Member for Liverpool, Riverside (Mrs. Ellman), we have a genuine problem with the growing number of bus services that are being cut in rural Shropshire. I say so impartially again. Just last week, a delegation of senior citizens from the village of Pontesbury highlighted yet another bus service that, regrettably, must stop. They are obviously determined to ensure that I campaign to try to save it, so I should stress to the Minister that, although I applaud her Government for having introduced the concessionary scheme, and I rarely praise socialists or indeed this socialist Government, the scheme must be funded properly and there must be special, extra help for rural areas such as Shropshire, which have large numbers of senior citizens.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o168"><a name="80707-0011.htm_para22"><a name="08070731000043">My hon. Friend the Member for Scarborough and Whitby also mentioned the important issue of cross-border traffic. Shrewsbury is a border town&#151;my constituency ends on the Welsh-English border&#151;and many constituents on both sides of the boundary travel backwards and forwards across it. Shrewsbury is the main destination for many people living in Wales who travel across the border from villages to shop there, and they also use vital services in Shrewsbury. There are no major hospitals in mid-Wales, so they use the Royal Shrewsbury hospital. They also use education services. I noticed that when that point was made, the Minister looked somewhat perplexed, because the issue is very thorny and potentially costly. However, as my hon. Friend said, we live in the United Kingdom. We live in one country, and some of us feel very passionately about that, so we want to ensure that citizens&#151;our constituents&#151;on either side of the border, living cheek by jowl, are not discriminated against because they live on the wrong side of it.</p>

Mrs. Sue Wood, who runs it, wanted me to raise the following issue with the Minister. I do not know whether things have changed since Mrs. Wood acquired this information, but she is under the impression that the concession is available only after 9.30 am. I agree with what was said earlier. Local councils should have the freedom to decide some of the scheme&#146;s nuances, and no mandate from central office&#151;I mean central Government; there&#146;s a Freudian slip&#151;should dictate that everything be done uniformly. The Opposition are always calling for local flexibility, but I very much hope that the Minister will assure us that there will be certain guidelines for councils. It would be rather iniquitous for any council to allow a disabled person to use the scheme only after 9.30 am if that person were trying to get to work. Very few people whom I know start work at 9.30 am. [<i> Interruption.</i>] The Minister says that it is up to the councils, but I am asking her whether there are any guidelines.</p>

I should like to inform the Minister that the largest organisation in my constituency is the Shrewsbury Senior Citizens Forum, which has 5,000 members and is rapidly becoming one of the largest senior citizens organisations in the country. It liaises with other senior citizens forums throughout the country, and a few months ago, it organised a national conference in Shrewsbury, with organisations throughout the country attending to debate various senior citizens issues. Bill Harris, the organisation&#146;s eminent chairman, would like to meet the Minister to discuss some of the concessionary scheme issues that the forum thinks are important. I very much hope that rather than just talking to politicians such as me, she will take an interest in that body and extend an invitation to its members.

Obviously, a lot of senior citizens will want to use the service; I am constantly asking senior citizens in my constituency to do so. I hope that the Minister will give me an assurance on what programmes or Government incentives there are for train operators to have the most imaginative and innovative policies for senior citizens. She may think this an outlandish suggestion, but perhaps there could be Government awards or a national competition for train operators. In that way, we would know which United Kingdom train operator had brought out the most innovative and imaginative schemes to get senior citizens on the trains and give them the best concessionary fares.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o177"><a name="80707-0012.htm_para3"><a name="08070731000059">The Minister knows that full well because, in her absence over Christmas, I took a delegation to see the Minister for Local Government, the hon. Member for Wentworth (John Healey), and I had a follow-up meeting with her later. She has had a number of detailed representations from council leaders, council officers and the two Members of Parliament representing the Adur and Worthing authorities. She is in no doubt about the problems that the scheme is causing us.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o178"><a name="80707-0012.htm_para4"><a name="08070731000060">I will cite the figures: the estimate is that there will be a shortfall of between &#163;600,000 and &#163;650,000, possibly in Worthing alone. In Adur district next door, the shortfall for this year has been estimated at &#163;238,000, which is equivalent to 4.3 per cent. on the council tax. The council leader has estimated that if we had not had to subsidise this supposedly fully funded Government scheme, we virtually need not have increased council tax this year at all. All the other savings that have been made have been wiped out by the additional costs of the scheme, which have fallen on Adur council tax payers; the scheme has not been fully funded as the Government had claimed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o179"><a name="80707-0012.htm_para5"><a name="08070731000061">There are winners and losers among the 324 authorities that are operating the scheme. There are particular losers among authorities that include resorts, particularly seaside resorts, that rightly attract people on day trips or short-stay holidays. That is why Sussex, which has a number of seaside resorts, has been disproportionately hit. I repeat that the scheme is good, but it has already become subject to the law of unintended consequences, and that is having a detrimental financial effect on my councils and therefore my council tax payers. Sarah Gobey, the assistant director of financial services at Worthing council, has provided me with a brief. She writes that Worthing borough council</p>
<a name="80707-0012.htm_brev0"><a name="08070731000084"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;is extremely disappointed to see that the Department for Transport is only willing to consult on proposals to distribute the grant on a formula basis. At this early stage in the scheme it is almost impossible to derive a formula which will match the pattern of actual costs&#151;the empirical information is simply not there.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o180"><a name="80707-0012.htm_para6"><a name="08070731000062">I should remind the House that the Government adopted a reimbursement formula based on a combination of eligible population, bus passenger journeys, overnight visitors and retail floor space&#151;a very difficult calculation to make.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o181"><a name="80707-0012.htm_para7"><a name="08070731000063">Sarah Gobey went on:</p>
<a name="80707-0012.htm_brev1"><a name="08070731000085"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;This Council would prefer to see the grant paid to reimburse the actual additional costs experienced at a local level. This would ensure that there are no &#145;gainers&#146; or &#145;losers&#146; in the new system. The preliminary forecast received from the Council&#146;s consultants would indicate that whilst Worthing will be a &#145;loser&#146; under the proposed arrangements, other Councils within West Sussex would appear to &#145;gain&#146;. We fail to see how this can be justified, yet the Department for Transport refuses to see why using a formula to distribute the funding is flawed. The Government has told local government that there is sufficient funding available for the new scheme, consequently there is absolutely no rationale in allocating grant on any other basis than actual expenditure.&#148;</p>

By 2008-09, the Council estimates that the cost of the current scheme will have increased by &#163;860,000 since the introduction of the free bus pass. In 2006-07, the Council received additional funding of &#163;610,000 via Revenue Support Grant. As a &#145;floor&#146; Authority, this funding has barely kept pace with inflation, whilst over the same period the Council has seen costs increase by over 20 per cent. per year. Consequently, the Council estimates that the current scheme is underfunded by at least &#163;200,000.&#148;</p>

So there has been an accumulation of losses over some years, to which the national bus scheme is a further addition. It is a double whammy. As Sarah Gobey concludes:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o187"><a name="80707-0012.htm_para13"><a name="08070731000069">The Government announced this scheme to great acclaim and we all support it and want to see it flourish because it is good for transport, good for the environment and, most of all, good for elderly and disabled people who can travel more, but it is clearly having a very detrimental effect as certain councils, particularly mine, are suffering from a large shortfall.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o188"><a name="80707-0012.htm_para14"><a name="08070731000070">That explains why certain councils, including mine, have chosen to time their scheme so that it starts at 9.30 am rather than at 9 o&#146;clock, as 9.30 is the latest allowable time for authorities to commence the scheme. Some neighbouring councils, which are not suffering from the same shortfall, have been able to start their scheme from 9 o&#146;clock, so further confusion is ensuing. My local councils are, quite understandably, trying to limit the impact that the shortfall in funding is having by just about the only mechanism available, which is to start the scheme at 9.30 rather than earlier.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o189"><a name="80707-0012.htm_para15"><a name="08070731000071">Now, however, we have people travelling between local authorities whose start time is different, which is causing a good deal of confusion and no little resentment by some people who think that certain councils are pulling a fast one. Well, if anyone is pulling a fast one, it is the person who invented this funding formula, which is leading to serious underfunding for my councils, which are then quite unreasonably getting the flak for what is happening.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o190"><a name="80707-0012.htm_para16"><a name="08070731000072">As my hon. Friend the Member for Scarborough and Whitby (Mr. Goodwill) said, the scheme has also been a victim of its own success, as there has been a big increase in the number of bus journeys. On the face of it, that is absolutely right, and I see many people around Worthing getting on buses, so the buses are being well used. I have to say, however, that many of the people who get on those buses do not get off them<i> &#151;[Interruption.]</i> The Minister might say &#147;Not ever&#148;, but there have been a number of cases involving people who, knowing that they can travel for free, get on the bus and travel all the way down the coast to Chichester or Lewes or perhaps on to Hastings or wherever without getting off. They go for the trip. That is terribly nice and lovely, but they do  <br>

it again the following day and the one after that and the one after that. Bus drivers now have regular customers who travel on the bus for the sake of it. That may not be typical, but some people are making use of the system, travelling up and down the coast and having a lovely ride. To be honest, that is not the purpose for which the scheme was intended.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o191"><a name="80707-0012.htm_para17"><a name="08070731000073">I have another extraordinary situation in my constituency. There is a residential building of about 90 sheltered flats where a number of pensioners live. It is very well run by the local housing association. It is on a busy road just on the outskirts of Worthing. The bus going into town picks up pensioners from that building so that they can do whatever they want to do in Worthing. When they come back, however, the bus stop is on the other side of the road, but the road is so busy that many of these pensioners are too scared to cross it, so they stay on the bus, travel several more miles into the next town until the bus turns around and comes all the way back in order to deposit them on the right side of the road. That seems absurd, but it is happening. It provides another example of excessive bus journeys, which have to be accounted for by the local bus company. I am trying to address the problem by getting the local authority to put a pedestrian crossing of some description on that part of the road, which should help. <i> [Interruption.]</i> The serious point I am making is that many more people than were ever anticipated are using the buses; and I have to say that it seems to be happening to a greater extent in Worthing and Adur than in other parts of the country, which exacerbates the problem of the number of journeys and the underfunding.</p>

 Well, Lewes is a nice place to get off. Has the hon. Gentleman seen a copy of Scotland&#146;s <i> Sunday Post</i>, which drew attention to a different sort of problem with bus journeys?

As I have explained, the councils are saying that the scheme is great, but they do not want to have to run it and pick up the tab. The Government have to acknowledge that however well intentioned the scheme, and whether or not &#163;1 billion is or is not sufficient to run it nationally, in certain parts of the country&#151;Adur and Worthing are not untypical&#151;councils are having to pay a substantial amount to run it. I urge the Government to look again at the formula and see whether they can better reflect journey usage. They need to refine the formula and ensure that a good scheme does not become a victim of its own success, leading to the law of unintended consequences, whereby my council tax payers effectively have to pay twice. I am not saying that I want the scheme reduced in any way. I want to ensure that it achieves its intended purpose of enabling more pensioners and disabled people to get out of their houses, use essential services or go out for pleasure journeys or whatever; at the same time, however, it should not be unfair to other council tax payers who have to foot a bill&#151;in the case of Adur, a bill of 4.5 per cent., which could have wiped out the council tax increase this year.</p>

 This has been an excellent debate on a good and interesting report. I pay tribute to the Transport Committee for considering integrated ticketing and concessionary travel. The report was carried out when Mrs. Dunwoody was the Committee&#146;s Chairman, and it is a great tribute to her that she wanted to consider the subject, which might not appear to be at the heart of transport debates.

In addition, the sale of rail tickets over the internet and the introduction of advance ticket machines have freed up railway staff to do other jobs, particularly helping out passengers on the concourse or platform. My hon. Friend the Member for Telford (David Wright) said how important it was that staff were able to help people with disabilities.

 I certainly agree with that. We have discussed today the need to ensure that people can navigate their way around the system using new technology. Of course, people need assistance to do that, but at the same time staff can be freed up to undertake other duties.</p>

Friend said. Last year&#146;s White Paper, &#147;Delivering a Sustainable Railway&#148;, set out our vision of simpler fares, modernised ticketing and information, and how best to meet the needs of disabled passengers. In April, we welcomed the announcement by train operators of the new, simplified and more transparent fares structure to be introduced next year. In May, the operators introduced standard names and conditions for advance fares, increasing the availability of railcard discounts. From September, the names of the main walk-up fares will be common across the whole network, so they will be easier for passengers, and Members of Parliament, to understand.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o199"><a name="80707-0012.htm_para25"><a name="08070740000010">The Government recognise, however, that the arrangements for bus ticketing are not so well advanced.

We should remember, however, that bus operators often work in a commercial world, and are free to set their own fares and determine conditions on ticket validity.</p>

Front Benchers are totally out of touch with local authorities, which need the ability to work more closely with bus operators and to introduce quality contracts if that is the right approach. Conservative Members shake their heads, but I suggest that they consult more closely the councillors in their areas.

We have allocated an extra &#163;212 million for 2008-09, rising to &#163;217 million and &#163;223 million in the following years, to travel concessions in England.

I can tell our seaside colleagues, the hon. Members for Scarborough and Whitby (Mr. Goodwill) and for East Worthing and Shoreham (Tim Loughton), that the allocation took account of the number of overnight visitors, which is greater in some areas.

 The issue has been raised by a number of Members. The hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham, for instance, said that his local authority did not necessarily want to participate. Some smaller district councils have said that they would prefer the county councils to carry out this function. We said in our response to the Select Committee report that, later this year, we would consult on whether the function of district councils should be transferred to county councils.</p>

The concessionary fares element represents a considerable part of the budgets of some district councils.. A number of issues need to be taken into account as we move from a system that includes an element of rate support grant to a new system, but we have said that we will consult on it.</p>

 Worthing invited officers from the Minister&#146;s Department to open the books and look at all the figures, but the Government did not use the figures that we had provided. Either the Minister believes that my local authorities are giving her Department the wrong figures, or she thinks that we are inventing the shortfall, or she thinks that the authorities are paying too much to the bus operators. Those are the only possible explanations. Which does she think my local authorities are guilty of?</p>

 The hon. Gentleman seems to have got into a bit of a muddle about the order in which the allocations were made. As I have said, when we consulted local authorities about the approach that they wished us to take, the formulae that I have set out proved the most popular. It is up to authorities to inform the Department of, for instance, visitor numbers or the amount of retail floor space. I should add that, according to the most recent annual figures available to us for Worthing&#146;s expenditure on concessionary fares, its special grant allocation for this year is 42 per cent. higher than the amount they said themselves was previously spent on concessionary fares.</p>

We also want to work closely with bus operators and local authorities to share the evidence. The research will explore the scope for more simplistic and deterministic ways of setting reimbursement, such as, perhaps, a table of payments for different regions and area types. But it is important to remember that, within this framework, local authorities have three-year settlements. We want to make sure that we do not disrupt agreements that have been reached, but we want to make sure that we are researching in the way that the Committee has suggested to look at potential suggestions from bus companies and authorities.</p>

 I welcome the terms of the review that the right hon. Lady has set out. It is indeed sensible and good news but I am slightly worried by the three-year time scale. I understand that there is a three-year settlement for local government, to which she has referred, but I think she will accept that certain local authorities are, for whatever reason, deeply out of pocket as a consequence of the present arrangements.

 I am doubly grateful to my right hon.

 As my hon. Friend knows, there are some areas where it is clear that bus operators and local authorities are working closely together and are producing a good service for passengers. However, it is also true that does not happen in other areas, which is why we are making some of the changes in the Local Transport Bill and which, as I pointed out, the main Opposition party does not support.</p>

If the hon. Gentleman is committing his party to that, I suggest that he cost it very carefully and look at some of the technical issues that surround it. However, that does not prevent individual local authorities on the border coming to agreements with authorities on the other side.</p>

The Government are certain that a generous settlement was made; the increase in his local authority was 58 per cent. on what was spent previously on concessionary travel. He also asked whether the &#163;4.50 grant would be repeated. We felt that it was right to pay local authorities for the initial issue of smartcards to make the changes.

Readers are not yet available on all buses, but there are different ways of looking at that issue and it is important that we do so. The hon. Gentleman will know that we are looking at BSOG, the bus service operators grant, to see where there are incentives. Quality contracts and quality partnerships could well be ways to make it easier to introduce smartcards. He raises an important point, but if we had not got a system that could be smartcard-compliant everywhere, it would have been a missed opportunity. He also raised the issue of penalty fare appeals.

The allocation for the current CSR to 2011 is an overall increase of 17.4 per cent. in the science and research budget&#151;an increase of just over &#163;3.5 billion.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o218"><a name="80707-0013.htm_para17"><a name="08070740000048">Inevitably, some research councils have had bigger increases than others, reflecting Government and societal priorities. The Medical Research Council received a 30.1 per cent. increase in funding and the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council had a 21.8 per cent. increase. That, in turn, reflects the increase in the volume of translational research that takes place in those councils. At the same time, other councils received different amounts. The Arts and Humanities Research Council received a 12.4 per cent. increase&#151;its budget remained on a plateau&#151;and the Science and Technology Facilities Council received 13.6 per cent.

Immediately after announcing the inquiry, however, all members&#146; mailbags were filled with correspondence from the particle physics and astronomy community. When the Secretary of State announced the budget allocations at Church house on 11 December, he and the Minister were taken aback by the fact that almost every question from the floor on that occasion came from members of that community. It soon became obvious that the allocation for the STFC was causing significant problems, so, although our report was about science budget allocations as a whole, it focused heavily on the STFC.

Both the Government and the STFC have responded, and last week the STFC made a number of welcome announcements on its future plans. This estimates day debate offers the Minister an opportunity to give further clarification on some of the still outstanding issues, and I hope he will take it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o221"><a name="80707-0013.htm_para20"><a name="08070740000051">The Government accepted some of our recommendations, and we should be grateful for small mercies. For example, we recommended that the Government change the name of the science budget to the &#147;science and research budget&#148; to reflect the inclusion of the arts, humanities and knowledge transfer, and the fact that they accepted that major change needs to be shouted from the rooftops. We welcomed the Government&#146;s commitment to maintaining above-inflation increases for the science budget&#151;now the science and research budget. We also welcomed the Government&#146;s commitment to innovation and knowledge transfer. I think that there is general agreement that it is right to turn world-leading basic research into health and wealth benefits for the country, and we compliment the Minister and the Government on that.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman is beginning his speech on characteristically great form. Does he agree, however, that the name does not matter, and nor, in some ways, does the total amount that is expended?

 I refuse to respond to such comments from a sedentary position. It is right to say that maintaining blue-sky research is crucial for this nation&#146;s future in terms of wealth and of health. All Committee members are conscious of the fact that we have to keep the Government&#146;s nose to the grindstone in producing the resources for basic research, and I think that this report does that. It is up to other parties to match that commitment&#151;that might be a comment the Minister wanted to hear.</p>

Indeed, the way both the Government and the STFC handled the budget process was, to put it mildly, deeply flawed. Disappointingly, rather than engage with the criticisms, the Government have rejected almost all of the conclusions and recommendations that followed. I know that other Members will wish to return to them, but I want to focus initially on the STFC.</p>

To be fair to the STFC, however, it has taken some positive steps following our critique. In co-ordination with the Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills, it has commissioned an independent organisational review following our criticism of its senior management. We look forward to seeing the conclusions of the review and what positive changes will follow. The STFC also consulted extensively within its community prior to last week&#146;s publication of its &#147;roots and branches&#148; reprioritisation of the entire council programme.</p>

Members will wish to add their impressions of the visit, but we are encouraged that the STFC has announced that key research activities, such as ALICE&#151; accelerators and lasers in combined experiments&#151;and EMMA, or the electron model with many applications, will continue at Daresbury. Although the STFC has always said publicly that it is committed to Daresbury, the decisions to retain ALICE and EMMA, and the acknowledgement that it will take some time to rebuild the science capacity there, are welcome both in terms of Daresbury&#146;s future and as a vindication of the serious concerns that we raised in our report.</p>

It will receive that support only because the UK is legally bound to a multi-year contract.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o230"><a name="80707-0014.htm_para7"><a name="08070740000066">The STFC has declared that it will cease payments to EISCAT in 2011, but EISCAT membership is on a five-year rolling contract. It is now 2008, and it appears that we are tied in until at least 2013, not 2011. The STFC has decided that it wants to leave, but it has not even discussed this with the director of EISCAT or given any formal notice of withdrawal. It is that lack of communication and shoddy handling of key facts that has landed the STFC in real trouble over its future plans. Perhaps the Minister will clarify the position on EISCAT this evening.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o231"><a name="80707-0014.htm_para8"><a name="08070740000067">It is that same lack of communication that appears to be at the heart of the STFC&#146;s budget problems. Its inability to communicate properly with its own community will, I hope, be put right in the future. In redressing the balance, the STFC clearly has some difficult times ahead, but the fact that it has listened&#151;albeit belatedly&#151;not only to the Committee, but to its community, is a positive step. We welcome the STFC&#146;s willingness to address our criticisms constructively. The fact that it will spend almost &#163;2 billion over the next three years on what is a hugely exciting programme is something that we should now support, instead of raking over old coals. Of course, there have been some losers in the funding round, but there have also been some big winners.</p>

purely for the sake of it. The Government rejected the bulk of our conclusions and recommendations, and we acknowledge that they have every right to do so, but they do not have the right to traduce what the Committee said or to produce a response that was impolite, inaccurate and, at times, incomprehensible. That is unacceptable and should be challenged.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o233"><a name="80707-0014.htm_para10"><a name="08070740000069">The Government were hasty in rejecting our recommendations regarding the transparency of the allocations process, and in particular our suggestion that documents prepared for bilateral negotiations between the Government and the research councils should be published as a matter of course, which goes to the heart of the issue of transparency and communications with the community. The Government rejected the recommendations on two grounds. First, they claimed that some information is commercially confidential&#151;I can understand that&#151;and, secondly, that transparency would put at risk &#147;candid discussion and robust appraisal&#148; during the allocation process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o234"><a name="80707-0014.htm_para11"><a name="08070740000070">The Minister must recognise that those are not sensible rebuttals. Commercial sensitivity did not prevent the release of most of the information under the Freedom of Information Act 2000 and, if that is an issue, DIUS should be able to release the documents as a matter of course, with steps taken to remove commercially confidential information prior to release. The second concern, that transparency would put candid discussion at risk, simply does not hold. We have not asked to see transcripts of the negotiations, because that would be preposterous, but we have asked for the documents relating to the negotiations so that we can see on what basis the decisions are being made.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o235"><a name="80707-0014.htm_para12"><a name="08070740000071">Keeping the negotiations confidential opens the Government up to accusations that they have inappropriately influenced the decisions that research councils take. That is the most damaging accusation for the relationship between the Government, the research councils and the research community. Accusations that the Government have broken the Haldane principle are already coming from organisations such as CaSE, the Campaign for Science and Engineering, and when such strong organisations make complaints, people sit up and listen, and so should the Government. They cannot simply dismiss those accusations. Will the Minister consider our recommendation that the documents that are prepared by research councils for use in bilaterals with DIUS are published as a matter of course?</p>

 Does my hon. Friend agree that the Government&#146;s argument that this decision is part of the comprehensive spending review negotiations is different in this case? It is not like allocations to the Higher Education Funding Council, for example, where the Government rightly and transparently say that they want to direct Government priorities and to see that what the council proposes to spend in the settlement is what the Government want it to do. In this case, the Government claim, rightly or wrongly&#151;rightly, in my view&#151;that they do not have any influence on particular scientific programmes. Therefore that process of negotiation is especially different in Haldane.</p>

It is clear from our report and the Government&#146;s response that those new bodies&#151;welcome as they are&#151;are partially supported by reallocated money that previously supported basic science, which I think was the point that the hon.

Can the Minister reassure us that the increased emphasis on translational science will not have a detrimental effect on basic science&#151;the kind of science that is not on the fast-track to translation, but will instead enhance humanity&#146;s knowledge base in the long-term?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o245"><a name="80707-0014.htm_para22"><a name="08070740000083">Finally, at the heart of the problems over the STFC&#146;s budget is the financial legacy that the STFC was left with following the merger of the Particle Physics and Astronomy Research Council, or PPARC, and the Council for the Central Laboratory of the Research Councils, or CCLRC. The Government have repeatedly denied that the origins of the STFC&#146;s budget shortfall have anything to do with an inherited deficit from CCLRC by pointing out that the STFC was formed without a budget deficit. That is absolutely true, and the Committee has no wish to reopen that argument. However, the Government have consistently missed the point. As Professor Keith Mason, the former chief executive of PPARC and current chief executive of the STFC, so correctly put it:</p>
<a name="80707-0014.htm_brev5"><a name="08070740000147"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;the base line budget allocation to the ex-CCLRC...was not fully raised to compensate for the running costs of Diamond and ISIS Target Station II&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o246"><a name="80707-0014.htm_para23"><a name="08070740000084">That was the point.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o247"><a name="80707-0014.htm_para24"><a name="08070740000085">Let us consider the facts. CCLRC would have had a budget deficit of approximately &#163;80 million, in today&#146;s money, had it continued as a stand-alone council, because its baseline allocation was not sufficient to meet the running costs associated with Diamond and the ISIS second target station coming online. That is shown in the National Audit Office report, &#147;Big Science&#148;, from January 2007&#151;it is not something that we made up. The STFC was given approximately the combined budget of CCLRC and PPARC and the STFC&#146;s budgetary shortfall is almost exactly the same size as the amount that CCLRC would have been short of had it been able to continue as a stand-alone council. Those facts cannot be dismissed on the grounds that CCLRC should have planned its budgets more carefully on the basis of a flat cash settlement. That might be true, but it is unfair to saddle former PPARC users with a deficit derived from CCLRC. That is exactly what happened as a result of the budget settlement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o248"><a name="80707-0014.htm_para25"><a name="08070740000086">The Government assured us that there would be no legacy issues associated with the merger. They got it wrong and they should take responsibility for that, rather than hiding behind other people&#146;s decisions. Although we know the outcome of the programmatic review, we still do not know what the grant allocations will look like. Will the Minister consider a modest STFC uplift to prevent significant grant cuts if Professor Bill Wakeham recommends that when he reports in the autumn?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o249"><a name="80707-0014.htm_para26"><a name="08070740000087">The process has been interesting and has raised some fundamental issues about the Haldane principles and the independence of the research councils. It has also raised some very interesting issues about how individual research councils work. At the end of the day, the major problems have not transpired to be as serious as was first thought. I am grateful for that. I hope that when the Minister replies he is able to give not only the community in the STFC but the whole research community the commitment that the Government will seriously consider the recommendations of the Committee, rethink some of them and bring forward new proposals.</p>

time establishing a relationship with the science community in Durham. That community is reflected in our excellent world-class university, our science learning centre and Framwellgate school, which is to be rebuilt as a science village.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o250"><a name="80707-0014.htm_para27"><a name="08070740000089">I have also wholeheartedly supported the prominence that the Government have given to science, and the recognised and often cited need for us to maintain and enhance the science budget given the many years of Tory neglect. Indeed, the uplift in the budget was needed to keep us internationally competitive in an increasingly global economy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o251"><a name="80707-0014.htm_para28"><a name="08070740000090">The 2007 comprehensive spending review was flagged up in advance as a very difficult spending round, and so it proved, but I am particularly glad that science funding was protected. As I think the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough (Mr. Willis) mentioned, science funding has doubled in real terms since 1997, having gone from &#163;1.3 billion then to &#163;3.4 billion in 2007-08. The CSR 2007 allocation made provision for a further rise of &#163;4 billion between 2008 and 2011. That is an average increase of 2.7 per cent. a year in real terms over the next three years. I was consoled by the fact that, despite a difficult spending review, science appeared to be protected, and the Government were continuing to support world-class research and sought to drive up the economic benefit that could be derived from investing in science.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o252"><a name="80707-0014.htm_para29"><a name="08070740000091">As the Committee&#146;s report points out, the headline figure is a three-year increase in the science budget of 17.4 per cent. As I have said, that reflects a Government commitment to implement the main recommendations of the Cooksey review on health research funding and the Sainsbury review on the role that science and innovation can play in keeping the UK competitive. It is of course true that not all research councils will receive the same percentage of uplift in their budget. As was mentioned, the Medical Research Council will receive a 30 per cent. increase. Nevertheless, overall, even the Science and Technology Facilities Council budget had a planned increase of 13.6 per cent. I will talk a bit more about that percentage later.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o253"><a name="80707-0014.htm_para30"><a name="08070740000092">I therefore felt some consternation and confusion when I started to receive frantic telephone calls from members of the physics community in Durham about the dreadful cuts that would be inflicted on them after April. That appeared to relate to budget cuts that were to be introduced by the STFC and that would affect not only their projects, but programmes supporting students. Something seemed to be going dreadfully wrong, and I had already made up my mind that the matter needed investigation, but news of the impending disastrous cuts had also reached the Science and Technology Committee, and it took the view that we should look into the STFC issues as part of the wider inquiry on science budget allocations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o255"><a name="80707-0015.htm_para1"><a name="08070740000094">Despite the depth of the inquiry, we still have not got to the bottom of the extent to which the issue arose from the initial funding problems of STFC, as the Government response was inadequate in that respect. They simply refute allegations made by the Committee, instead of establishing detailed evidence about the funding of CCLRC and PPARC when they were disbanded, and when STFC took over from them. Paragraph 39 of the Committee&#146;s report makes that very clear and asks the Government to look into the legacy issues in detail. However, all that the Government do in their response is make it clear that they provided an extra &#163;185 million in excess of the flat cash settlement over the CSR period. We all know that that additional money, welcome though it was, was to fund specific projects and priorities that had already been planned. There is a lack of detail, and I hope and suspect that the Committee will return to the issue, as we need to get to the bottom of the funding allocation and the extent to which it meant that significant programmes would have to be cut.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o256"><a name="80707-0015.htm_para2"><a name="08070740000095">In the Government response, there is a lack of recognition of what it will mean for the STFC when the full economic costs come on board; that will, of course, reduce the distance that research grants can cover. When Professor Mason, the chief executive of the STFC, first appeared before the Committee, it seemed to me that the funding had not been received for all the STFC&#146;s commitments. That problem was compounded by a prioritisation of the programmes identified by the STFC; in particular, new areas for growth had been identified. That prioritisation, with subsequent cuts to other parts of the STFC, was the root of the problem and appeared significantly to upset the science community. I know that from my experience in Durham, from a lot of the evidence that the Committee received in its visits, and from witnesses who came before it. The new prioritisation programmes seemed to come from absolutely nowhere, and there had been no real consultation with those likely to be affected.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o257"><a name="80707-0015.htm_para3"><a name="08070740000096">The relationship between the STFC management and at least one key sector of the physics community seemed very weak, and led to a lot of distrust on the part of the academics involved. In particular, there was a view that disproportionate cuts were being made to particle physics. Conclusion 10, which relates to paragraph 46 of the report, summarises that well:</p>
<a name="80707-0015.htm_brev0"><a name="08070740000148"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;We welcome STFC&#146;s decision to support its major facilities to the extent set out in its Delivery Plan...However, we are concerned that the decision to support the large facilities has come at the expense of research in fields where the UK excels&#148;.</p>

Scientists in Durham and elsewhere who are involved in ILC-related work maintain that they were not consulted at all about the STFC decision, and it is the lack of transparency and the poor peer review in setting the priorities for the STFC that the Committee wishes to investigate. Of course, the issue has to some extent been overtaken by last week&#146;s report from the STFC on the new priorities. Nevertheless, that was a key issue that the Committee investigated, and some of the Government response was perhaps a little weak.</p>

scientific community. Confidence in peer review is essential if decisions by research councils are to be seen as legitimate by the relevant academic community. I hope that the STFC has learned from its actions and will do as it has promised and bring on board all members of the academic community who are involved in ensuring that that community has a greater say in the decisions taken.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o260"><a name="80707-0015.htm_para6"><a name="08070740000099">It is clear from the Government&#146;s response to the report that peer review is not considered a matter for the Government to get involved in directly because of the Haldane principles. I think that we would all agree that it is not appropriate for the Government to get involved in the day-to-day operation of research councils, or even in prioritisation, but it would have been appropriate for the Government to state that the efficacy of the peer review system and processes at the STFC could be improved in the light of the very heavy criticism that we unearthed.</p>

 On the Haldane principle and conclusion 6 of the report, the hon. Lady will be mindful of the fact that the Committee argued that cross-cutting programmes that affect more than one council, largely in pursuit of Government-inspired initiatives, have skewed budgets. Does she agree with that conclusion? I know that she is attempting to be very measured, but is that an issue that the Government should look into further?</p>

<p><a name="st_o300"><a name="08070740000101"><a name="80707-0015.htm_spnew1"><a name="08070740000180"><b>Dr. Blackman-Woods:</b>
 The key issue is transparency. I think that we would all accept that the Government may wish to put more of the budget into one area than another, and I hope that we all feel, across the House, that that is a perfectly legitimate thing for them to do. That may mean that they point research councils in directions that mean pulling their budgets. We have seen that happen with regard to health research. The Committee was not convinced that the Haldane principles had been breached; we merely asked questions to get greater clarity from Government to ensure that the Haldane principles would not be interfered with.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o261"><a name="80707-0015.htm_para7"><a name="08070740000102">The response from the STFC grudgingly acknowledges in paragraph 86 that more needs to be done in terms of achieving effective consultation across its programmes. We have since seen some evidence that that may be the case. However, it is also the case that unless the STFC makes strenuous efforts fully to involve all parts of the community in its decisions, it will not be possible in the short term, or even the medium term, completely to restore the faith of the relevant academic communities in its ability to represent their interests.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o262"><a name="80707-0015.htm_para8"><a name="08070740000103">The next matter that I want to consider is international reputation. Many of the scientists to whom we spoke were very concerned about the damage that the whole episode was doing to the UK&#146;s reputation for science investment and commitment to international projects. There was strong concern that the actions taken by the STFC, and the way in which they were taken, would have a detrimental effect on our reputation overseas. It is not enough for the Government to assert, as they do in paragraph 93 of their response, that the UK remains a reliable partner. A reputation for being a reliable partner has to be built up over time, and people will judge the Government by their actions and by the amount of money that is given to the science community  <br>

to enable it to support those international collaborations. I hope that I am making a helpful suggestion to the Government by saying that lessons need to be learned from what happened in this instance. It is important for them to emphasise that they will support and prioritise our international collaborations. They need to go beyond the stage outlined in their response to think about how they are going to address those criticisms and build up confidence again. It is not good enough to assert merely that our reputation is intact&#151;the academic community needs more support than that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o263"><a name="80707-0015.htm_para9"><a name="08070740000104">My last point relates to the lack of confidence in some parts of our science community about how secure its future is. That was perhaps the worst thing to emerge from this unhappy affair. In April, I met a group of a undergraduate students, postgraduate students and post-doctoral research fellows in Durham. A few hundred people attended the meeting&#151;students from across the field of particle physics and the wider physics community. They were angry about the STFC decisions but, more than anything, concerned about their future careers. The Government should not underestimate how this set of cuts coming from nowhere without adequate explanation affected the confidence of those students. I find that especially galling given that the Government had done so much to support and raise the profile of science. I would have thought that they must at least see the STFC&#146;s actions as a PR disaster. It was most unfortunate that neither the Government&#146;s response nor that of the STFC acknowledged the damage that has been done to the trust of students and the academic community in general, and more needs to be done to bring that back into being.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o264"><a name="80707-0015.htm_para10"><a name="08070740000105">Of course, I did my best to assure the students that there was an ongoing commitment to them, to the work that they were doing, and to the particle physics community in general. They have international, globally portable skills, and it is important that the Government make it clear as soon as possible that they will continue to invest in science so that those students can go abroad for international collaboration as necessary but return to have a good career in the UK as well.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o265"><a name="80707-0015.htm_para11"><a name="08070740000106">Having talked to people in the community since, I know that they are glad that the STFC has softened some of its responses, including on the funding of the international linear collider. I think that that was a direct reaction to the Committee&#146;s report and to the protests made by the science community. Clearly, more attention will be paid to the STFC&#146;s decision-making processes and communications with its own scientific community and the world at large. People particularly welcome the commitment that no changes to rolling grants will be made before the Wakeham review has reported. I am grateful, as are they, that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Innovation, Universities and Skills has instigated that review; we all hope that it will enable us to draw a line under the whole process. I hope that lessons have been learned and that Wakeham will be a clear report that sets the way forward for the whole field of physics based on the judgment of the scientists involved and that reflects the Government&#146;s commitment to science funding in future. I also hope that the new programme that has been outlined by the STFC means that we will all be able to move forward knowing that the future of science is to be fully supported by this Government.</p>

 I draw attention to my entry in the Register of Members&#146; Interests as a non-executive director of a satellite company. I make that declaration because space comes into the budget of the Science and Technology Facilities Council.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o266"><a name="80707-0015.htm_para12"><a name="08070740000108">I am happy to piggy-back on the report and excellent work done by the Innovation, Universities, Science and Skills Committee. It is an important Committee, and I am glad that it was rescued following the Government&#146;s lamentable failure to keep the word &#147;science&#148; in any departmental name. Fortunately, the House of Commons did not allow it to disappear, and I played my part in trying to ensure that that was the case.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o267"><a name="80707-0015.htm_para13"><a name="08070740000109">This debate has been largely dominated by the STFC, which is better known as Swindon Town football club by those who are most active in it. It was a big failure by the Government not to anticipate what the implications of this would be. I happened to be giving a speech at the Rutherford Appleton laboratory at the beginning of December, immediately after Keith Mason made his speech at the same conference. I was able to stir things up a little bit because I had been warned by the science community that the STFC&#146;s move to change the budget balance was not very popular, because it had left the gap that the Committee subsequently investigated. Rather than go over that ground again, I would like the Minister to give us some indication of the impact of the &#163;1.9 billion settlement that the STFC announced a few days ago, and to outline whether it largely solves the problems that were previously discussed. That announcement happened only recently, and it is difficult to evaluate its implications. I am glad, however, that there has been a settlement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o268"><a name="80707-0015.htm_para14"><a name="08070740000110">When I was Minister, a very long time ago, we always had problems with big physics, not least because of the contributions to organisations such as CERN, which often skewed budgets in quite an alarming way. However, CERN deserves a mention today. In 1994, I was involved with the beginnings of the project now known as the large hadron collider, and we are about to see the culmination of that project after a long time&#151;a 14-year gap. It is a hugely important project. For the record, I would like to compliment the <i> Financial Times</i>, which, in its colour supplement at the weekend, produced an excellent article by Clive Cookson on CERN and the large hadron collider, including some useful glossaries of the terms that sometimes make it difficult to explain why CERN is important.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o269"><a name="80707-0015.htm_para15"><a name="08070740000111">The studies of fundamental particles and forces that make up the universe are, perhaps, about to be unlocked, and we could reach a sudden understanding of the Higgs boson and all the other excitements that scientists have pondered for a long time, which would justify the British Government&#146;s contribution to CERN over the years. I know it has sometimes been controversial because of its unbalancing of budgets and the difficulties of ensuring that other parts of physics and astronomy got their fair share.</p>

 It might well be&#151;that is a fair point&#151;but let us find out what happens when this thing is switched on. The construction of it is the most remarkable engineering triumph. I went to see the earlier establishment at CERN, but I have not seen the current edifice, only photographs of it.</p>

 Does the hon. Gentleman agree that it was the foresight of successive British Governments that brought the partnership for CERN together? Indeed, it is fair to say that no Governments in the world could afford to do such a thing now. Do not those British Governments, and Britain, deserve a pat on the back for the things that have come out of CERN, such as the world wide web? They could only have been brought about with the support of the British Government.</p>

<p><a name="st_o305"><a name="08070740000115"><a name="80707-0015.htm_spnew6"><a name="08070740000185"><b>Mr. Taylor:</b>
 The hon. Gentleman, with whom I have enjoyed several investigative trips to various scientific and telecommunications establishments, has put his finger on it. I am grateful to him for saying &#147;Governments&#148;, because there are times when I think that the Labour party believes that the world started in 1997. Actually, it did not. The project that has now come to fruition goes back a long way and has been supported, sometimes with considerable difficulty, by protecting the CERN budget from those who wished the funds had been allocated elsewhere.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o270"><a name="80707-0015.htm_para16"><a name="08070740000116">The hon. Member for City of Durham (Dr. Blackman-Woods), whose constituency has a very fine university, was a bit churlish, which was worrying. I would not have picked up a party political point of view in what she said were it not for one thing. It is of course correct to say that the science budget has doubled through the money that goes to the research councils, and I have paid warm tribute to my main successor, Lord Sainsbury of Turville, for the work that he did in ensuring that that was the case. I put that on the record with no caveats attached. I welcome it; I only wish I had had the ability to persuade my Chancellor of Exchequer that we should do the same thing. It was not for want of trying, but I clearly did not have the powers of persuasion that Lord Sainsbury had when it came to money. Nevertheless, it is of extreme concern that the percentage of gross domestic product spent on R and D by the Government has not increased since I left office in 1997. I wish that the hon. Member for City of Durham had made that point in her balanced speech because it is a matter of great concern to many people, not least those in industry who work closely with other Departments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o271"><a name="80707-0015.htm_para17"><a name="08070740000117">Obviously, the Ministry of Defence research budget has declined. I remember working with the then chief scientific adviser to the Government, Lord May, who is now playing an important role in the other place with regard to science. He wrote a paper, which I requested, on the significance of the decline in the defence research budget. Sadly, although the paper was very influential, it did not prevent the curtailment of that departmental research. That has had a big effect on many of the value added companies that this country requires, and I hope that the Minister will take it into account when he talks about the Government&#146;s record. We have to put it in that context.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o272"><a name="80707-0015.htm_para18"><a name="08070740000118">Other international comparisons are of concern. We always talk about the way this country does well in citations, and I do not dispute that. Nevertheless, we  <br>

can see the rate of growth of research and citations in other countries. Unsurprisingly, I suppose, China shows a particular growth in citations in mathematics, engineering and the physical sciences. For the record, and the ease of those who wish to find it, the previous figure about GDP was taken from page 34 of the Sainsbury review, which was published in October 2007. The point about the worrying tendencies in citations is on page 36. The British Government&#146;s proud record on citations is rather retrospective, and we have to be careful about other countries racing to the top.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o273"><a name="80707-0015.htm_para19"><a name="08070740000119">It is important to note that page 35 of the same report shows that the amount of research conducted by the British Government in the public sector is still lagging behind that of many of our competitors. It is certainly not something that we should boast about too much. In this country, the private sector does almost twice as much, in terms of percentage of GDP, as the Government. There are worrying concerns if one looks at the Government as a whole, and the impact on science.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o274"><a name="80707-0015.htm_para20"><a name="08070740000120">My report, which was a submission to the shadow Cabinet on science policy, indicated that we should look at whether further mergers should take place in the research councils. There is quite an unproductive hierarchy among the remaining research councils, which is duplicatory. The Minister&#146;s duty, while preserving the Haldane principles, as I had to try to do when I was Minister, is to give guidance on the linking themes and cross-disciplinary research that the research councils should bear in mind. I know that that is happening, but I am still rather worried about the process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o275"><a name="80707-0015.htm_para21"><a name="08070740000121">I have talked to most of the people involved in the research councils during the past 18 months while conducting my research, and we have to be a bit careful about just saying that peer review is wonderful. It would be useful for the Minister to start a proper inquiry into whether peer review is quite what it is cracked up to be in what is increasingly becoming a multidisciplinary age. I do not get such feedback from many of the scientists involved, so perhaps it is a worthy study for the Select Committee.</p>

<p><a name="st_o306"><a name="08070740000122"><a name="80707-0015.htm_spnew7"><a name="08070740000186"><b>Mr. Willis:</b>
 Indeed, successive Select Committees have pondered exactly that question. The hon. Gentleman will know that when broad-based metrics were suggested as an alternative to peer review, nobody could agree about what should be in the metrics, so we went back to peer review.</p>

 I agree that it is a conundrum. Given that Select Committees are collectively much brighter than me, I am sure that if the Select Committee is still worrying about how to conduct a review, that proves the complexity of the matter. I still think that it is important, though, largely because science in this country, even basic science, needs to be increasingly cross-disciplinary. I am not sure whether the systems that deliver research grants are helping that process. University vice-chancellors talk avidly about it, but if they do not think that they will get a five-star department out of it, they are not so keen. The challenge is to perform well at multidisciplinary level. I am goading the Minister, really, rather than criticising him. He is relatively new in the job and has made a very good start, if I may say so, but I would certainly want to get my teeth into that matter if I were lucky enough to be in his position again.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o276"><a name="80707-0016.htm_para0"><a name="08070740000124">That brings me to a point on which we must be careful about our thinking. Of course basic science is absolutely essential&#151;I have no problem in saying that. However, we have a habit in this country of giving a status to basic scientists that we do not give to applied scientists, and certainly not to the category known as engineers. That is a national weakness. The trouble with my saying that is that people will take it out of context and say, &#147;Well, the former Minister was really trying to say that we should downgrade basic science.&#148; That is not what I am saying at all. We should raise the status of other scientists to that of basic scientists.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o277"><a name="80707-0016.htm_para1"><a name="08070740000125">The whole process pushes basic science into coming up with &#147;the idea&#148;, or an emergent idea. It may not be the one that was predicted&#151;that is the whole joy of basic scientific research. However, the point of discovery has become the point of publication, and vice-chancellors admit to me that it is often the point at which they say, &#147;Right, go back and do some new work so that we can get a five-star department next time.&#148; Whether the research be at Durham, Cambridge, Oxford or Imperial college, it hangs in the air somewhat, even though in many cases it could connect with that of other scientists. Increasingly, discoveries need to be exposed to those in other environments and disciplines so that we can capture their full benefit. That is a gap in our current work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o278"><a name="80707-0016.htm_para2"><a name="08070740000126">Certain changes have been made, and I welcome them. The Technology Strategy Board is examining some of the work that is being done, and I have spoken to it. It has been put at arm&#146;s length, which is a good development. I am not criticising it, but I would go further. My report suggested an innovative projects agency, which would have a budget of &#163;1 billion. Before our Front-Bench spokesman starts jumping up and down, I should say that that would not be new money. It would be a combination of what I regard as the far too diffuse Government expenditure on R and D, the post-discovery basic science process. The agency&#146;s budget would therefore be three to four times that of the TSB.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o279"><a name="80707-0016.htm_para3"><a name="08070740000127">I shall give the Minister a piece of advice. He might not like it, but the great joy of being a Back Bencher in opposition is giving advice freely. The regional development agencies are a nightmare, and he should pay rigorous attention to them. Frankly, he should throttle their scientific expenditure. Time after time I have heard academics and others say, &#147;Oh, the RDA!&#148; Most RDAs are risk-averse and do not have a proper idea of what they want to do. They love the concept of nanotechnology without having the remotest idea of what it is or what it involves.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o280"><a name="80707-0016.htm_para4"><a name="08070740000128">One vice-chancellor said to me that he had spent a year trying to persuade his local RDA&#151;I shall not name it&#151;to involve itself in a very exciting project. In the end, he used his own university funds and found some other way of covering the funding gap because the RDA spent the whole year saying, &#147;It&#146;s a wonderful project, but we&#146;re not quite sure.&#148; The Minister should get the money back from the RDAs and give it to the TSB. In a way, he would be doing what we have said we will do if and when we come back into power. My hon. Friend the Member for Windsor (Adam Afriyie) might criticise me for publicising an idea that I have given him, but in the national interest we must make much more effort to focus what we do. My report makes many other suggestions, but it is available on the web, so I shall not bother to go into them now.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o281"><a name="80707-0016.htm_para5"><a name="08070740000129">The challenge that we face is getting more and more extreme. We have to show the people whom we want to attract to this country that we are doing exciting research. We need to attract and retain PhD research students. A considerable percentage of our current PhD students are from abroad, and we need to keep them here rather than allow them to go elsewhere. We need to work much more closely with industry, because a lot of the really challenging research beyond the basic is done in industry laboratories. The interconnection between those laboratories and universities is critical.</p>

It is an extremely good guide to a university about its cost base, and if the FEC outcome is too high, the university knows that it has its internal overheads wrong. However, if FEC becomes a sort of bible that cannot be varied, many of the companies that want to work with universities will shift their contracts abroad. I could give chapter and verse of what has actually happened in several cases in which universities have said, &#147;Well, this is the FEC of our postgrad. It is &#163;100,000 a year, and like it or lump it.&#148; That is not the way to stimulate research. Many big companies now have research centres around the world and will concentrate on the areas where they think there is both individual, human expertise and a climate for research and development.</p>

 I thank the hon. Gentleman. Does he agree that much research in this country is paid for by charities and voluntary groups? They suffer under the VAT regime, which must be examined.

These are exciting times for Chinese universities, and we must ensure that they are exciting times for our leading British universities as well.

 I am grateful for the opportunity to follow the hon. Member for Esher and Walton (Mr. Taylor) and to accept his invitation to be radical. We have heard some criticisms of the STFC, but many other aspects of the science budget need to be tackled in the debate. I do not get heavily stimulated by talking about budgets&#151;I find it rather boring. Having run a department, in which I had a few million pounds to budget, I was quite creative, but I think that I got out just in time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o286"><a name="80707-0016.htm_para10"><a name="08070745000002">Scrutinising the research councils is very much part of a Select Committee&#146;s work. It takes me back to the time when we scrutinised the Medical Research Council, which is now extolled for its work. However, I remember that our Committee&#146;s report was much more vehement than the report about the STFC. It created a hum in the community, but in the case of both research councils, the hum came from the grass roots. Those who are conducting the research and doing the work feel that something is not right. They suddenly find a way through the parliamentary scrutiny system to get to a Department with which they find it difficult to engage. It is not always the fault of Departments or Select Committees that we have not picked up on the problem. Scientists are not great communicators in the political process and we must tackle the issue of getting our young people who are coming through the system to realise where the money comes from. I hold my hand up and admit that too many scientists and technologists believe that the world owes them a living and that, if they come up with a smart idea, it will immediately be funded. Things have never been like that and, in my opinion, never should be. One has to make the case, justify what one is doing and show what benefit it gives the world, whether it is blue-skies research or research into a product.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o287"><a name="80707-0016.htm_para11"><a name="08070745000003">I left research partly because we were having to get rid of people, and employ people on one-year, six-month and one-month contracts in awful laboratories.

Every university now has a good laboratory. I believe that that has stimulated many young people to come into research&#151;perhaps not enough, but at least something has started to happen.</p>

mistake. I remember the conservatism among the scientific community, which thought that the measure was only a crazy ten-minute Bill. We knew that things could change and they did. That continues and we need further resources, as we have heard all evening.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o289"><a name="80707-0016.htm_para13"><a name="08070745000005">Much of the science around us has resulted in great health benefits to people in this country. My speciality is cancer, but I am interested in health generally. The bucket loads of money that we have given to cancer were driven by the research knowledge that emanated from scientists and medics in this country as well as in the United States. The discovery of oncogenes stimulated a field of cancer research, on which the Government picked up. They doubled the budget for research and treatment. We now have cancer plan 2, and we have realised that there is a journey to take on palliative care, on which there is further research to be done and clinical trials to undertake. The trials must not take place abroad&#151;we should carry them out on our patients here because patients in a clinical trial generally do better and we get more information. We need more nurses to help get patients into clinical trials and so on. That is beginning to happen. Under the aegis of the cancer tsar, Mike Richards, there is great drive. Science, medicine and evidence underwrite all that continuing work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o290"><a name="80707-0016.htm_para14"><a name="08070745000006">Today, there was a meeting in this place for ethnic minority groups from different communities, mainly in London. It has been realised that the cancer rates in different sub-populations&#151;major populations in parts of the country&#151;are different. Ten years ago, none of us realised that that was a problem. Now that we do, medical understanding is excellent. Women with breast cancers from Indian communities in the east end of London have a different culture and different problems in entering the national health service. We suddenly woke up to that and we are doing something about it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o291"><a name="80707-0016.htm_para15"><a name="08070745000007">New procedures emerged from the Darzi report last week for the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence to make drugs and technologies available throughout the country. Primary care trusts now have to justify why somebody is not an exceptional case. If there is an exceptional case, everybody in the country who is in the same category must get the exceptional treatment. That is a major step forward, which I hope will get rid of the postcode lottery. We are therefore learning.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o292"><a name="80707-0016.htm_para16"><a name="08070745000008">Sometimes there is a lack of political drive in this country and from the Government to make things happen even faster. For example, we often cut research. I am especially interested in honey bees. Hon. Members may not be excited about that, but honey bee research has suddenly captured the imagination. A friend of mine said that it was the only subject discussed in a general committee meeting of the Labour party on the Isle of Arran. I understand that there are problems in Scotland, but honey bee research is an amazing field. Yet what do we do in this country? We sack the people who are conducting the research at Rothamsted. What did we do about BSE? We cut the research into BSE just before it happened. The previous Government cut the money for wave energy research, but now it is a fashionable subject for research, which provides great stimulation and experience. We were good at cutting money for research. We had an amateur approach of saying, &#147;Well it&#146;s not very important at the minute, so we&#146;ll cut the research.&#148; That has gone.</p>

Rare cancers&#151;pancreatic, liver and kidney&#151;do not get the same services as breast cancer and so on. There is therefore a good reason for believing that we have a big research future that will need much more money.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o294"><a name="80707-0016.htm_para18"><a name="08070745000010">It has also been said that commercial influence has been brought to bear on research in our universities and institutions. Research from this country and the United States led to the internet. Basic research led to it and its exploitation. There would be no silicon valley in California without that basic research. I could cite case after case&#151;for example, DNA, a small short note in nature, which revolutionised the world. We should protect that basic understanding.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o295"><a name="80707-0016.htm_para19"><a name="08070745000011">Research councils need to be examined, and Select Committees should scrutinise them. They also need to think about how they can join together. For example, I know people who worked on atmospheric chemistry in three different departments, but they never spoke to each other. The previous speaker mentioned the fact that we have to get people in cross-cutting areas. The people who drink coffee together work together; the people who drink together get things done. That is my motto. People must work and discuss their problems with each other over the odd pint or half pint, depending on one&#146;s taste.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o296"><a name="80707-0016.htm_para20"><a name="08070745000012">Some research councils also have too many establishment figures making the noises. It is easy for that to happen in Britain. What is wrong with having good graduate students or members of the public on those councils, to listen and talk about the issues? I think I know why. When we put the public on to certain committees, such as on genetic modification, and when we had those juries, they have embarrassed a lot of the scientists by asking, for instance, &#147;What does that mean?&#148;, &#147;How does that happen?&#148; and so on. The public ask for the basic information, which is very important in science. Research councils have a heck of a lot to learn.</p>

The development of different breeding programmes&#151;not necessarily genetically modified, but different programmes, involving different types of wheat and maize, for example&#151;could lead to plants that can withstand drought and live in inclement parts of the world. Plant genetics gets a rum deal in this country, in terms of medical science and medical experiments.</p>

 It is a little known fact that at the age of 12, I aspired to being a plant breeder, but I never got there. The hon. Gentleman is making a characteristically trenchant speech. Does he agree that one important aspect is not merely the cross-cutting of different departments, but the ability to maintain certain national capacities in order to take a strategic view and move things forward? Where one is simply decentralising to the research councils and looking at peer review and so forth, the difficulty is that when we need a lever to pull, we suddenly find that we have no one left to pull it.</p>

field, for instance at Imperial, Dundee university or wherever else&#151;the research is going on all over the place&#151;where would it be exploited? I would guess that such a breakthrough might end up in California or somewhere else. The people there, or in India, China and so on, would know exactly how to take it into development. We must learn not just how to compete and how to beat those countries, but how to work together. After all, their students come over here, are very friendly towards us and then they go back, so there can be interchange.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman is being generous in giving way. The lesson that the Roslin institute learned from the cloning of Dolly the sheep was quite instructive. PPL Therapeutics, the company involved, subsequently moved to the United States. Many people in the science community in the United States simply could not believe what we had managed to do and were determined to get hold of the technology as quickly as possible. We are in a very competitive global market.</p>

<p><a name="st_o316"><a name="08070745000017"><a name="80707-0016.htm_spnew8"><a name="08070745000112"><b>Dr. Gibson:</b>
 Yes, it is a competitive market, but who makes the competition? I do not feel that scientists&#151;at least not the ones I know&#151;have ever been competing with each other. We compete with each other over who gets their paper in <i> Nature</i> or in the journal of this or that institute. However, the quality of the paper that someone publishes is important, too, and not just to their kudos, but to the world in general, because it is more read.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o298"><a name="80707-0016.htm_para22"><a name="08070745000018">One point that the hon. Gentleman did not make is that papers now do not have just one or two names on them. All the best papers have about 20, 30 or 40 names on them of people who have interacted in different ways in that subject&#151;one can look in <i> Nature</i> to see that. There are very few lone wolves these days. We have moved on from the days of the magic amateur monk who discovered breeding problems in peas. Science is big now and it needs money. We no longer have rich Darwins who can sail round the world, make wonderful observations in that amateurish way and take a long time to publish their work. Things are not like that anymore. After all, Darwin published only because Alfred Russel Wallace was breathing down his neck and was going to publish anyway, so he had to beat him to the punch. The world is different now, but there is still a bit of amateurishness in our science. We tend to think that we are very clever, but competition and, even more so, co-operation are very important.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o299"><a name="80707-0016.htm_para23"><a name="08070745000019">Let me finish by saying something about the regional development agencies, of which there has been some criticism. The ones of which I have experience&#151;in the north-west and north-east&#151;are magic. The way they have interacted with the universities and the community is great. The situation is very different in the east of England, where we have had our moment in the sun. I wanted to make Norwich into a science city, which would not cost a penny&#151;indeed, that is mentioned in the report that the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough (Mr. Willis) talked about.</p>

cities. Some people think that &#147;science city&#148; is just something that is put up on a sign at the entrance to a city, but it is not. It is a concept involving people working together in industry and science, and in centres in which young people learn about science. It also involves schools that are scientifically erudite in the sense that they have special status. There are schools that specialise in engineering, for example.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o301"><a name="80707-0016.htm_para25"><a name="08070745000021">In the Select Committee on which I serve, I remember asking a representative of the Royal Academy how many special schools did engineering. The answer was, &#147;I don&#146;t know.&#148; I would have thought that that would be one of the first things that a member of the Royal Academy would want to know. Surely they would want to know whether there were enough schools of that kind and whether we were encouraging enough young people to go into that field. Surely they should be asking what the Royal Academy should be doing to make that happen.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o302"><a name="80707-0016.htm_para26"><a name="08070745000022">We need the science city concept, and regional development agencies that do not just play the game of co-operating but actually do so. We must also ensure that we do not have any more instances of science centres closing. There are 20 per cent. cuts being made in Glasgow, for example, by a nationalist party that works on the basis of its supreme excellence in everything&#151;because things happen differently in Scotland&#151;yet it is closing science centres. We have a real battle on our hands right across the board. I believe that the science budget should have been quadrupled and, by gosh, as long as some of us are still breathing, it will be.</p>

 It is a real pleasure to follow the hon. Member for Norwich, North (Dr. Gibson). As always, he has made a vigorous and superbly informed contribution. He has redefined the term &#147;wide-ranging&#148; tonight, speaking on everything from honey bees to stem cell research. I shall try to top that by slipping in something about nuclear fusion, which he missed out. However, he has forgotten more about science than most of us ever knew, apart from one or two honourable exceptions in the Chamber tonight.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o303"><a name="80707-0017.htm_para0"><a name="08070745000024">It is easiest, and most usual, to sanction certain sanitised and unexciting research and science projects, particularly in translational research, where outcomes are predictable. Of course that is important, but it must not be done at the expense of basic science and true discovery processes. Only by taking real risks will we push forward the frontiers of knowledge for the ultimate benefit of mankind, to help us eventually to save the planet. However, the universities and funding councils have become risk averse from years of battering by the sensationalist media and from interfering politicians, although there is none of those in the Chamber tonight. They have also come under pressure from commercial organisations, which are skewing their decisions on research projects. That is why I want to speak briefly tonight in favour of basic science and research, which, by definition, involves great risk, uncertainty and unexpected outcomes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o304"><a name="80707-0017.htm_para1"><a name="08070745000025">The system of peer review, which has already been mentioned, has been examined by the Select Committee on a number of occasions. It has serious weaknesses, in  <br>

that it fails to reject mediocre and poor research projects, and favours predictable journeyman-type work that is unlikely to deliver spectacular results or push forward the boundaries of our understanding for the benefit of mankind. Peer review acts as a gatekeeper at the start and the end of the research process. At the start, it determines which projects will get funding to go ahead in the first place. At the end, it determines which ones will get published in which academic peer review journals, which is important to the whole process and to spreading that knowledge.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o305"><a name="80707-0017.htm_para2"><a name="08070745000026">Peer review is instrumental in the whole project selection process, and it is therefore of great importance. However, it tends to back the safer bets and to reject the more imaginative, ambitious and, some might say, off-the-wall projects&#151;the kind that the hon. Member for Norwich, North and I enjoy. But at the very worst, those projects will excite, encourage and inspire future generations of scientists, and who knows what might flow from them in the future? Such projects also enable us to encourage doctoral researchers to this country and to keep them here. They add so much to the UK&#146;s research base, and we need to continue to do that.</p>

 I do not think that enough is spent on them. We need to support more doctoral researchers in our universities&#151;particularly UK-bred doctoral researchers, because they will mature, become the wealth generators and knowledge creators of the future and help to push forward medical science, which the hon. Gentleman is so concerned about. That is why I back the fund from the Royal Society, Britain&#146;s national academy of sciences, for the blue-skies research that gets around the peer review constraints to some extent.</p>

As I said in an intervention earlier, it may deliver even more for mankind if it disproves the existence of the Higgs boson rather than proves it, but we will see about that over the next few exciting months. On nuclear fusion, if we ever get Q factors up to the 35 or 40 level, we will take the greatest step ever in mankind&#146;s history&#151;by saving the planet and moving forward.</p>

constituents. In actual fact, after the last review, I received for the first time ever some very angry correspondence from my constituents. They were neither scientists nor specialists; they were just extremely annoyed at the news that Jodrell Bank would probably close. It was an extraordinary result for a Government who have shown their commitment to science by doubling the budget, and the report under discussion examines some of the background to, and the reasons why, it came about.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o308"><a name="80707-0017.htm_para5"><a name="08070745000032">I should like to discuss the issue by trying to answer three questions that are pertinent to Jodrell Bank. I hope that at the end of the debate, my hon. Friend the Minister will tell the House the latest news on e-MERLIN and Jodrell Bank, because although there have been stories with a positive spin in the press, it is not yet clear, as far as I can ascertain, whether Jodrell Bank&#146;s future is secure, so I should be very grateful if the Minister updated us.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o309"><a name="80707-0017.htm_para6"><a name="08070745000033">Three key questions need answering. First, do the Government have a regional science policy? The Select Committee on Innovation, Universities, Science and Skills investigated and took evidence, and its Chairman, the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough (Mr. Willis), explained how the Government appeared to put forward a very confused position both in their evidence and in their response.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o310"><a name="80707-0017.htm_para7"><a name="08070745000034">Secondly, why were there cuts to astronomy, particle physics and ground-based solar-terrestrial physics when we were being told that the budget was growing? Was that a mistake? Was it a policy decision? What was behind that situation? Thirdly, has the Science and Technology Facilities Council done its job properly in allocating its share of the budget? I should like to deal with those three questions in reverse order.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o311"><a name="80707-0017.htm_para8"><a name="08070745000035">The answer to the third question is the easiest&#151;it is no. The STFC has not done its job properly. I shall not read them out, but Members should read paragraphs 59 and 87 of the Select Committee report. The Committee is chaired by a Liberal Democrat, a genuine Liberal, and for him to use words such as &#147;deplore&#148;, &#147;inaccurate&#148; and &#147;unconvincing&#148; to describe the evidence given by the chief executive of the STFC is about as strong as it gets.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o312"><a name="80707-0017.htm_para9"><a name="08070745000036">Frankly, I am surprised that, having had that level of public criticism, the chief executive is still in his position. That criticism did not come from nowhere, but was based on evidence. As has already been mentioned, there was no consultation on the international linear collider when funding was withdrawn. The situation on Gemini was ludicrous. First, there was not going to be any funding for those two telescopes, then there was going to be some, then &#147;maybe&#148;, then there was going to be funding&#151;it was a hokey-cokey policy that was in and out as far as funding was concerned. That undoubtedly damaged this country&#146;s reputation in international astronomy. As the Chair of the Committee said, the evidence given on solar terrestrial physics was at odds with the facts; that is the kindest way of putting it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o313"><a name="80707-0017.htm_para10"><a name="08070745000037">On top of all that, the chief executive held secret reviews of the work going on in the STFC. That demoralised the staff, who did not know what was going on, and the scientific community. It is clear that the STFC did not do its job, and setting up a communications director will not really resolve the issue. There have been some better policy statements since,  <br>

<p><a name="stpa_o314"><a name="80707-0017.htm_para11"><a name="08070745000040">My second question was about the funding gap of between &#163;75 million and &#163;80 million, depending on how the figures are looked at. That gap led to some serious scientific research being threatened. It is clear that, as the Committee explained in the report, the gap was there because of the costs of ISIS and the Diamond Light Source. I do not know why the Government had to respond as they did. The Committee was clear. It said:</p>
<a name="80707-0017.htm_brev0"><a name="08070745000088"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;We believe that the Government should ensure that its original commitment to leave no legacy funding issues from the previous Councils is honoured.&#148;</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o316"><a name="80707-0017.htm_para13"><a name="08070745000042">Well, it did not inherit a deficit, but it did not have the money to fund ongoing commitments. That is a very fine distinction and it is really not worthy of my Government to say that they honoured a commitment. What the commitment meant in plain English was that there would not be any cuts to future programmes; but what the funding situation meant was that such cuts were likely.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o317"><a name="80707-0017.htm_para14"><a name="08070745000043">What were the cuts? The one that I am most concerned about was the cut to e-MERLIN and Jodrell Bank. E-MERLIN, a major international astronomical facility, had already had &#163;8 million committed to it. Rather surprisingly&#151;it is worth briefly mentioning peer review&#151;it had been prioritised by the advisory bodies to the STFC as less important than Atlas at CERN. I do not know quite how important Atlas is; I support the large hadron collider at CERN; I do not know whether we will find the Higgs boson or not. I worry rather more about the evaporation of any micro-black holes that may be created; if they do not evaporate, none of us will know about it. That is the real problem at CERN.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o318"><a name="80707-0017.htm_para15"><a name="08070745000044">When witnesses talked about the peer review process and the people advising the STFC, both Professor Holdaway and Professor Chattopadhyay&#151;my apologies for the pronunciation&#151;said that they were concerned that that process did not involve consultations with the relevant bodies. They were also worried that vested interests were working against people working outside the organisation, though that applied to the linear accelerators rather than to Jodrell Bank. That was clear in the evidence we took. There may be no better system than peer review&#151;neither the Select Committee nor anyone else has come up with one&#151;but we should not  <br>

assume that it is perfect. It is not. Elected Members who care about the expenditure of public money and who care about science need to recognise that peer review is an imperfect system that is capable of criticism from both the science community and the political community.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o319"><a name="80707-0017.htm_para16"><a name="08070745000045">I shall not repeat what I have said about e-MERLIN and Jodrell Bank, but it is an unhappy situation. We believed that there would be enough money for them, but there has not been; and it is not clear how e-MERLIN and Joddrell Bank were de-prioritised. I hope that the Minister will be able to give a commitment to their future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o320"><a name="80707-0017.htm_para17"><a name="08070745000046">In many ways, the Select Committee spent more time discussing the third subject&#151;I refer to our discussion of the Daresbury campus and the continuation of fundamental science there&#151;than discussing anything else. We received a number of responses. The Government said that they were, are and will be committed in future to the continuation of fundamental science at Daresbury. That is good. Daresbury is in the north-west, so I think that the Government&#146;s statement is about where science should take place&#151;in other words, a regional science policy. At the same time, others&#151;I will not repeat the examples cited by the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough&#151;told us that where science took place did not matter at all. I think that the Government have half a regional policy in that they have a historical policy of commitment to some places outside the south-east.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o321"><a name="80707-0017.htm_para18"><a name="08070745000047">As for the Haldane principle and regional policy, if it is the Government&#146;s view that their policy is an historical accident and that they are carrying out a political commitment because it would be too embarrassing to jettison it&#151;in truth, they do not want a regional policy and will eventually end up without one&#151;they should not, and cannot, maintain that view. It is impossible not to have a regional policy in science or anything else. If we do not have a stated regional policy, the people who take the decisions on where science investment should go will be in the very places where science is already located. That would be an anti-regional policy, which would end up with investment in the golden triangle between Oxford, Cambridge and the south-east. It is not practical politics to say that there will be no regional policy, because the result will be a negative regional policy.</p>

The professors who came before the Committee were affronted when I asked whether they had considered going to Newcastle, Sheffield or Manchester&#151;my hon. Friend the Member for Norwich, North (Dr. Gibson) suggested Dundee. Their reaction was, &#147;Why should we ever leave London? Why should we leave this cosy triangle?&#148; They should do so because if great cities such as Edinburgh, Manchester, Sheffield and Newcastle increase their knowledge base through investment in science, that will make this country competitive. If there is not a positive policy, that will not happen.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o324"><a name="80707-0017.htm_para21"><a name="08070745000050">That prompts the question: what is a detailed policy? Clearly, at the level of absurdity, we would not tell someone using a gas chromatograph to use a flame ionisation detector and not an electron capture device. As we go up the scale of science, we must ask whether decisions are for politicians or for the science community. On big scientific projects, expenditure is so high that those decisions must become political ones, whether it is admitted or not. Where such investment takes place does not fundamentally interfere with the principle that detailed decisions on science are taken by scientists. However, huge spending decisions, and decisions on where that money goes, should be taken in respect of a regional policy, and by people who are elected to spend that money.</p>

 I thank my hon. Friend for his reference to Edinburgh. He knows well its astronomy and physics capability. I strongly applaud his comments on the Haldane principle. If we go back post second world war, we realise that the key work on artificial insemination in Cambridge would probably not have been done had it been left to the Ministry of Agriculture. In fact, a research council was responsible, so we must maintain independence in relation to scientific development.</p>

 I thank my right hon. Friend for that intervention. It was interesting to read the original 1919 Haldane report. Talking to Members of the other place and this House, Haldane assumed that the scientists would get on with it, because the objectives were clear: to win the war. There was not the assumption, which is sometimes drawn, that the totality of science should be self-governing once the money has been handed over.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o325"><a name="80707-0017.htm_para22"><a name="08070745000053">I want to finish on two points, the first of which is related to the discussion about regional science policy and the Haldane principle. Politicians are elected to spend money, and Ministers do that directly in government, and should be accountable. I asked my hon. Friend the Minister for Science and Innovation, &#147;If Jodrell Bank closes, whose head should I ask for?&#148; I do not want to ask for his head, because he is a good Minister. In the final analysis, however, on such big issues, I should know whether the decision has been taken by the chief executive of the STFC or by a Minister. Unfortunately, throughout this process lines of accountability have been breached, and nothing is clear. It is too big an issue to explore this evening, but sadly that has become more typical of Government over the past quarter of a century. Ministers have tried to protect themselves by farming decisions out to principals, non-departmental public bodies or quangos, and saying &#147;Not me, guv&#148; when it comes to the consequences of difficult decisions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o326"><a name="80707-0017.htm_para23"><a name="08070745000054">I agree with other Members that decisions should not be made&#151;and I understand that they will not be made&#151;on the financial structure of science until Wakeham reports. It would be absurd to take a serious look at what are and should be the priorities of science spending, and to continue to make long-term decisions, during the three or four months before the report is published.</p>

Certainly the quality of today&#146;s debate has shown that those in this place who are interested in science are interested in what flows from that&#151; namely, what we hope will be an evidence-based policy with the right degree of transparency and accountability to enable us to seek to improve the United Kingdom&#146;s enviable position in science.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o329"><a name="80707-0017.htm_para26"><a name="08070745000058">I think it right to begin, as did my hon. Friend the Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough (Mr. Willis), by recognising the Government&#146;s fine record, particularly in comparison with that of the previous Government, but even of itself, in terms of the quantum of funding for and championing of science. Some of the Select Committee&#146;s recommendations that seem to criticise the Government, in this and other reports, stem from the fact that the Government are, in a sense, a victim of their own success. They are a victim of the raised expectations to which people in the science world are accustomed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o330"><a name="80707-0017.htm_para27"><a name="08070745000059">When budgets increase by less than the significant amount that scientists expect, they naturally want higher budgets, but if they cannot get those, they do not want the Government to deny their pain. I was not around during the last Conservative Government, but I know that there was a lot of pain to deny. I believe that Ministers said that a tight spending round would mean cuts. It is terrible that those cuts were made: it was short-termism. This is not the time to go into what happened then, but I think that we now need honesty and a recognition of the realities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o331"><a name="80707-0017.htm_para28"><a name="08070745000060">Constituents of mine, in the Rutherford Appleton laboratory and in Oxford university, raised concerns, and I wanted the Select Committee to conduct an inquiry. I am pleased that my colleagues in the Committee agreed to include in our general scrutiny of research councils specific decisions about science budget allocations by the STFC. I pay tribute to members of all parties who were prepared to compromise, and to ensure that the eventual report was very clear. While I am speaking from the Front Bench, let me observe that science need not be too party political. I think that that was exemplified by the conduct of the Select Committee under the excellent chairmanship of my hon. Friend the Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o332"><a name="80707-0017.htm_para29"><a name="08070745000061">Both the hon. Members for Esher and Walton (Mr. Taylor) and for Manchester, Blackley (Graham Stringer) mentioned peer reviews. As my hon. Friend the Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough said, they are better than any other method that has been considered for the making of decisions about the merit of a scientific case in the context of either publication or funding. Nevertheless, I do not think it appropriate to claim that peer review as it currently operates in the United Kingdom is anywhere near perfect. I believe that two reports from the old Science and Technology Committee suggested to its successor that an inquiry be conducted into how the current peer review system could be improved. As Committee members know, because I say this regularly, I still think that that should be done. The stakes are enormously high in terms of getting peer review right, both for individual careers and for getting decisions right.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o333"><a name="80707-0018.htm_para0"><a name="08070745000062">Today, importantly, we have had strong, but measured and evidence-based, criticism of the Government in this matter from Labour Members. I agreed with pretty much everything that the hon. Member for Manchester, Blackley said, except his concern that we ought to be worried about micro black holes. I am not convinced by that, although I guess it makes for a good story on the &#147;Today&#148; programme.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o334"><a name="80707-0018.htm_para1"><a name="08070745000063">The report has messages that the Government must heed and take cognisance of. I share the view of other Members that it was disappointing that the Government did not seem to acknowledge any way in which they could improve matters, except by renaming the science budget. I look forward to the Minister accepting&#151;I hope he accepts that he will not be criticised for this&#151;that improvements could be made to the Government&#146;s performance. For example, the reputation of this country, not just in science but as a collaboration partner, is at stake. Sir Keith O&#146;Nions accepted that there was the potential for harm to the UK&#146;s reputation in international partnerships either by decisions that were hard to understand or by decisions that were unnecessarily precipitate and did not seem to be based on adequate consultation or adequate peer review in terms of the quality of the process as well as the outcome.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o335"><a name="80707-0018.htm_para2"><a name="08070745000064">The reputation of the UK is increasingly important because so much science is now done in big international collaborations. A few members of the Select Committee present here had the pleasure and privilege of going to see the large hadron collider before it was closed. My view of that could be described in one word: &#147;Wow&#148;&#151;&#147;Wow&#148; at the scale of the undertaking, at the scientific ambition in terms of the questions it will answer and at the recognition there by the scientists of all nationalities of the UK&#146;s contribution. Concern was raised there&#151;the Committee touched on that in the report&#151;about whether that was to be maintained.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o336"><a name="80707-0018.htm_para3"><a name="08070745000065">Although there was a firm commitment by the STFC to continue to invest in ATLAS and the big experiments, there were two smaller experiments&#151;LHCb and ALICE; not the ALICE at Daresbury, which forms part of the RLP programme, but another one&#151;which were categorised as medium or low priority. I noticed in the revision to the delivery plan published in the last few days by the STFC that LHCb has been upgraded, but I could not find in a sea of acronyms the right one for what was happening to the UK&#146;s commitment to the ALICE experiment at CERN. I remain concerned about that. I do not know whether the Minister could wade through the acronym soup in the document that we received to find that out for me. Those are small experiments but they are international partnerships at CERN.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o337"><a name="80707-0018.htm_para4"><a name="08070745000066">The themes that have come out of the debate are the overall level of funding, dealt with by the hon. Members for City of Durham (Dr. Blackman-Woods), for Esher and Walton (Mr. Taylor) and others, the direction of funding and whether too many cross-cutting programmes are determined by Government, sapping the room for manoeuvre of individual councils. I gave a speech this morning at a conference on cellular senescence, the molecular biology of ageing. The Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council was represented there and set out clearly what its contribution was to a cross-cutting programme.   <br>

Ageing is one of the cross-cutting programmes that the Government have laid down and there is nothing wrong with that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o338"><a name="80707-0018.htm_para5"><a name="08070745000067">Another issue was transparency and I shall dwell on two points, one of which is the transparency of the process. This point was introduced by my hon. Friend the Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough in respect of whether the Government essentially interfered, legitimately or illegitimately&#151;I will come to that&#151;in the scientific plans of research councils, through the CRS process of asking to see draft delivery plans, there being a view from Government about whether those were adequate. New plans would then come back and the funding would be signed off. If the delivery plans in effect say, &#147;We&#146;re thinking of this because we think project A has scientific merit&#148;, and the Government response in effect says, &#147;Well, we think project B is the one that ought to be funded, and if you come back to us with that recommendation, you will be rewarded in the comprehensive spending review,&#148; that will clearly be an example of the Government having an influence over strategic, or even sub-strategic, decisions. We will not know whether that has taken place or not, because we cannot see both sides of the correspondence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o339"><a name="80707-0018.htm_para6"><a name="08070745000068">It is interesting to note what the Government said on this in respect of the Arts and Humanities Research Council in response to the Select Committee conclusion in paragraph 116 of its fourth report. The Committee said:</p>
<a name="80707-0018.htm_brev0"><a name="08070745000093"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;It seems to be a breach of the Haldane Principle that the Government should direct a Research Council to switch funding from postgraduate awards to programme funding merely on the basis of it being out of step with other research councils, or indeed for any other reason.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o340"><a name="80707-0018.htm_para7"><a name="08070745000069">The reason is, I think, not material. The Government said:</p>
<a name="80707-0018.htm_brev1"><a name="08070745000094"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;All Research Councils were asked to prepare Delivery Plans for publication which reflected the activities that the Council proposed to support once it knew its actual allocation. The draft Delivery Plans were subject to discussion between the relevant Research Council and the Government, to check that they reflected the plans submitted by Councils in response to the scenarios commissioned earlier in the allocations round, and the terms of the Councils&#146; specific allocation letter&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o341"><a name="80707-0018.htm_para8"><a name="08070745000070">That gives the Government a lot of scope to influence the decisions of the research council at a strategic, or even sub-strategic, level.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o342"><a name="80707-0018.htm_para9"><a name="08070745000071">The Minister might be surprised to hear this, but I do not think that if the Government were transparent about doing that, there would necessarily be anything wrong with that. It is public money, and as long as politicians do not intervene in the peer review process to change the judgments made about the scientific merit of the proposals&#151;there might be a danger of that, but if there were transparency it would be dealt with&#151;the Government are entitled to say, &#147;We want to have more spending on ageing&#148; or cross-cutting on stem cells. They will have to defend themselves for doing that because there is an opportunity cost, but they are entitled to do so as they are in charge of public funding. However, if they do that, it has to be transparent. They cannot have it both ways, as it would be corrosive if there were a feeling that scientific decisions were being interfered with in a way that was not open.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o343"><a name="80707-0018.htm_para10"><a name="08070745000072">The same applies to regional policy. I represent a constituency in the golden triangle, but I think that it would be legitimate for the Government to say, &#147;In this  <br>

Members of the Committee who attended the evidence sessions and the visits will know that my concern was that the Government should be clear and honest with Daresbury about its future, because we are dealing with people and their careers. The people to whom we spoke said that the Government said that it had a bright future, but the decisions made by the STFC told them otherwise. That is why it is important that the Government are willing to engage with the Committee&#146;s recommendation to start a debate, perhaps through a White Paper, on regional policy on science. It may be that the Minister does not know the answer, and the Government should not be criticised for not having the right answer, but we should at least have the debate.</p>

Questions are always raised in Select Committee inquiries about who is to blame, and the temptation is to blame the research council staff&#151;and we strongly criticised them. However, the danger is that that is seen as scapegoating someone who has to make difficult decisions. It is true that the Committee said that those decisions were made badly, but sacking the management is not necessarily the answer, because the problems will live on.</p>

I do not think that that meant that it should improve its spin. The announcement sent by e-mail on 3 July included a list of highlights of the STFC funding programme, and I looked down it to find some lowlights, because I expected that some of the cuts&#151;some of which have been confirmed and are uncontentious&#151;would be mentioned. However, none of the cuts was mentioned except the ExoMars mission, on which it states:</p>

the way in which scientists, and perhaps the Government, have been thinking about the future of science. Nor should we forget that the three national academies have received extremely good settlements. The Royal Academy of Engineering received an increase of 31.5 per cent., the British Academy received an increase of 23.7 per cent. and even the Royal Society received an increase of 18.2 per cent. Those are significant increases.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o358"><a name="80707-0018.htm_para25"><a name="08070749000003">When I was elected to Parliament in 1997, the UK science base that I left was in the doldrums. I remember that every year in my department&#151;the department of chemistry and applied chemistry at the University of Salford&#151;the central library sent us a list of essential journals and publications, and we had to go down the list and decide which of them we would cut out of our research budget. That happened not for one year, but for two or three. Essential posts remained unfilled. No maintenance was done. We did not have the money to replace our nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometers. Large instruments across the infrastructure lay unreplaced for decades. That was no way to conduct research in Great Britain.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o359"><a name="80707-0018.htm_para26"><a name="08070749000004">When the research assessment exercise came along, science and engineering departments that carried out applied research suffered badly. Nearly all the departments that relied almost entirely on applied research are now closed&#151;including the three great engineering departments at the University of Salford and even my old department, which was the largest chemistry department in Britain when I taught there.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o360"><a name="80707-0018.htm_para27"><a name="08070749000005">Today, the picture is quite different. The infrastructure in our universities has been improved, in my opinion, beyond recognition since 1997, with huge investments not only in buildings but in other major capital schemes. The instruments that were not bought in 1997 are all there now. There are some superb instruments in some superb departments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o361"><a name="80707-0018.htm_para28"><a name="08070749000006">I visit the University of Manchester regularly, as I am on the external advisory body of the school of chemistry there. Every time I visit, there are cranes lifting things backwards and forwards and new buildings going up. I visit the laboratories, as I have for decades. I have never seen such state-of-the art laboratories as those I can now see by walking into any science department at that great university.</p>

Let us not forget, either, that the Labour Government came to power at a time when we had a job retaining graduates for postgraduate studies. We recognised that problem and one of the first things we did was to increase the remuneration for MSc and PhD students. That remuneration is not brilliant, but it is better than it was&#151;in fact, it is double what it was&#151;under the previous Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o363"><a name="80707-0018.htm_para30"><a name="08070749000008">The Government should be congratulated on those significant increases in the UK science research base, not only because of the research grants that they give through the science research councils but because of the major investment to which I just referred.

and Skills and the Minister for Science and Innovation been on the back foot, instead of on the front foot where they should proudly be?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o364"><a name="80707-0018.htm_para31"><a name="08070749000009">The simple explanation, in my opinion, is that the two major reviews that I have just mentioned, combined with the significant shift in research priorities to meet the needs of a modern society, have resulted in significant cuts in some research programmes. Let us not forget that other research programmes have benefited significantly. There has been a significant shift in the Medical Research Council research budget and the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council research budget&#151;a shift towards the life sciences, perhaps, and away from the physical sciences. Let us not believe that the money is not there; it is just being moved around.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o365"><a name="80707-0018.htm_para32"><a name="08070749000010">Let us consider the Haldane principle. It was established in 1919 and recommended that non-departmental specific research should be managed through research councils&#151;that is, that decisions on expenditure should be determined by scientists rather than by politicians. Ninety years later, that principle is still in place. Our Select Committee concluded that perhaps it had been breached. In addition to full economic costs, the research councils have had other significant expenditure. The Technology Strategy Board and the Office for Strategic Co-ordination of Health Research have been mentioned, and we should also mention the Energy Technologies Institute. The creation of those three institutes alone has required a considerable shift in funding. We are talking about agreements made by scientists&#151;people in the field&#151;and not entirely by Ministers. However, I do not have time to go into the details.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o366"><a name="80707-0018.htm_para33"><a name="08070749000011">The seven research councils have decided to go for interdisciplinary research like never before, and our Select Committee has pressed them to do so. We have said that we are fed up with the research councils being like seven silos, with the scientists in one silo never talking to those in the other six. They are now beginning to talk to each other. Research Councils UK was established, but it did not really bring that about. I hope that the identification of six significant areas that will benefit the public, whom we represent, has now been recognised. Some of those areas have already been mentioned.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o367"><a name="80707-0018.htm_para34"><a name="08070749000012">The question is whether the Government have breached the Haldane principle. Our report suggests that they have. The July issue of <i> Chemistry World </i>was published just a few days ago, and I want to cite two articles in it by distinguished gentlemen. The first is by Randal Richards, who is no lightweight in the field of science. He recently retired as director of research and innovation at the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, and latterly he was its interim chief executive. He wrote a letter to <i> Chemistry World, </i>and I shall quote part of it:</p>
<a name="80707-0018.htm_brev11"><a name="08070749000042"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The six cross-council research themes were identified by the research councils themselves. The fact that some of these themes coincide with public policy challenges identified by the government should not be surprising because they include some major scientific and technological changes that are world wide&#151;sustainable energy and environmental change, for example.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o368"><a name="80707-0018.htm_para35"><a name="08070749000013">He rejects the suggestion that the EPSRC, and by extrapolation the other research councils, has failed to conform with the Haldane principle. He reminds us that the research councils were</p>
<a name="80707-0018.htm_brev12"><a name="08070749000043"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;pretty quick about reminding government and officials&#148;</p>

Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough (Mr. Willis) for his work as Chairman of the Innovation, Universities, Science and Skills Committee and for his excellent opening words. He is a champion of science and a scientific approach here in Parliament and elsewhere. Perhaps when he steps down from this House&#151;at the next election, I understand&#151;he might step up to the challenge of enthusing the next generation in the same way as he has enthused us in Parliament. As a former member of the Committee, I miss the enthusiastic and energetic inquiry into and rational analysis of cross-departmental scientific issues that take place under his most able chairmanship. He and all members of the Committee can be rightly proud of their review of the science budget allocations and the STFC. The evidence sessions that preceded it revealed some deep concerns running through the science community. Many of those concerns were emphasised in contributions from both sides of the House, which were heartfelt, well presented, rational and thoughtful. The hon. Gentleman was eloquent and articulate in his exposition of the potential for inappropriate interference by Ministers in the allocation of budgets.</p>

I would build on that merely by saying that the main reason such a large amount of resource is available for the science budget is that the previous Conservative Government delivered the conditions in which the current Government have been able to spend.</p>

Just last month, I was at the Diamond Light Source project in Oxfordshire&#151;a truly world-class facility that attracts scientific and commercial interest from across the globe, and I think that there are greater opportunities to realise some of that commercial interest in a more fruitful way in future.</p>

To an even greater extent, I am optimistic because we understand the important role that science plays in society.

seems to agree that the science budget left the STFC with an &#163;80 million shortfall. The Select Committee concluded that the Government must &#147;demonstrate greater effectiveness&#148; in the way it manages research in the UK, which is putting the point quite lightly, given the concern that the science budget has provoked.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o382"><a name="80707-0019.htm_para12"><a name="08070749000028">It will come as a relief to many that the STFC announced last week that it had balanced its budget. We now know that some of the high-profile facilities, such as ALICE&#151;accelerators and lasers in combined experiments&#151;at Daresbury and e-MERLIN at Jodrell Bank, may be safe. My first question to the minister is this: did he have a hand in saving those headline projects? Perhaps he can clear up that matter. Was he involved in the discussions before the press release was issued last week? Was he or his Department informed about the STFC announcements before they were made? If he was, there are more questions to be answered about what influence the Minister may have brought to bear.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o383"><a name="80707-0019.htm_para13"><a name="08070749000029">Despite the celebration about the saving of Jodrell Bank and one or two other headline facilities, we must not forget what will disappear, and I will quickly put some of those projects on the record. Astronomy has been hit quite hard. AstroGrid, which is developing an open-source eye on the sky, will lose funding. Support for the Birmingham Solar Oscillations Network and the Cambridge Astronomical Survey Unit will go. The STFC aims to sell 50 per cent. of the UK&#146;s observing time in Gemini. The UK&#146;s contribution to the Isaac Newton group of telescopes, described by the Particle Physics, Astronomy and Nuclear Physics Science Committee&#151;PPAN&#151;as a &#147;valuable asset&#148;, will fall by half. There will be a withdrawal of support from the particle physics collaboration at Stanford university. Because of funding constraints, PPAN</p>

At a time when science promises solutions to many of our social and economic needs, Ministers cannot afford to bury their heads in the sand.

Either way, the Minister has an opportunity today to be courageous. We have heard that word once or twice, and we have heard the call for transparency and openness. We have heard about the boldness and courage of former Science Ministers, who were very clear and open about what they were doing when there was a budget reduction.

 The Government welcome the report of the Select Committee&#146;s inquiry into the science budget allocations, and we very much welcome this debate. I appreciate the overall constructive way in which the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough (Mr. Willis) raised the issues mentioned in the report. There are clearly matters on which we continue to disagree, and I do not think that his characterisation of our response to the report was accurate. We have taken its recommendations carefully into account and, in many cases, agreed with them. The report has been very helpful to us.

The new comprehensive spending review allocation means that the budget will increase to almost &#163;4 billion in 2010-11. That is an average increase of 2.7 per cent. a year in real terms over the next three years. Within a tight financial framework, that is a strong settlement and highlights the Government&#146;s long-standing support for science and research in the UK, as set out in our 10-year science and innovation framework. I was very pleased that the hon. Members for Harrogate and Knaresborough and for Oxford, West and Abingdon (Dr. Harris), and Labour Members, recognised that strong support for UK science.</p>

fundamental research that expands the frontiers of knowledge. It is important to recognise the wider benefits of such research. It produces highly skilled people, drives innovation, attracts inward investment and can be translated into many successful products and services. Research and innovation improve our productivity as a nation, thus providing the means for our creation of wealth and directly benefiting and underpinning key public services in everything from health care to defence.</p>

 Does my hon. Friend accept that there must be a balance between pure research and commercial exploitation and that, although one can conduct pure research on its own, one cannot do the commercial exploitation without the research? The balance must be right. When the Select Committee visited the observatory in Edinburgh, it was clear that the people there were excited about being asked to do more commercial work but felt that it should be recognised that that commercial work had previously been restricted. The balance must be right so that a facility does not simply become a science park.</p>

 I agree that, in all such cases, it is a matter of balance. However, I remind my hon. Friend and the House that the Government are committed to investment in basic research. That underpins the later commercial exploitation of research. As he knows, we support some of that commercialisation and applied research and development through, for example, the Energy Technologies Institute and especially the activities of the Technology Strategy Board, which will spend, in co-ordination with the research councils and the regional development agencies, &#163;1 billion in the next three years.</p>

 Yes, I do. I have said on record&#151;and will continue to say&#151;that the Government want Daresbury to develop as a world-class centre for science and innovation. We do not perceive its future as a technology park, as some have suggested. I shall say more about that later, especially in response to my hon.

<p><a name="stpa_o396"><a name="80707-0019.htm_para26"><a name="0807081000024">Citations have been mentioned this evening. The UK has the most productive science base of any country in the G8. At the same time, knowledge transfer between research and business continues to grow. UK universities are now producing spin-out companies of equivalent number and quality to some of the top US institutions. Since 2003, 30 companies have been floated on the stock exchange at a value of &#163;1.5 billion at initial public offering. Furthermore, several high-profile trade sales have taken place, including seven in the past two years, which raised &#163;1.9 billion.

<p><a name="stpa_o397"><a name="80707-0019.htm_para27"><a name="0807081000025">It is the Government&#146;s duty to set the strategic direction for the research base. We have discussed that in great detail this evening. To do that, the Government took several high-level decisions when allocating the science budget. Over the period of the comprehensive spending review 2007, research will be funded at 90 per cent. of its full economic cost; the Sainsbury and Cooksey reviews will be implemented, and we will support collaborative projects involving the Technology Strategy Board and the Energy Technologies Institute. We will also support research in matters of strategic importance to the country&#151;for example, in medicine and on key challenges such as energy supply and the environment. Again, we heard strong support in the debate for more cross-disciplinary research, which is guaranteed in the comprehensive strategy review 2007 settlement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o398"><a name="80707-0019.htm_para28"><a name="0807081000026">I know that there is keen interest in the relationship between the Government and research councils, especially in the way in which research funding is prioritised and managed. That is not surprising. As hon. Members know, for many years, the British Government have been guided by the Haldane principle. Detailed decisions on how research money is spent are for the research community to make through the research councils, once the Government have set the overarching parameters. The basis for funding research is also enshrined in legislation, through the Science and Technology Act 1965. The allocation of the comprehensive spending review 2007 science budget is consistent with Haldane, and I am happy to debate that this evening.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o399"><a name="80707-0019.htm_para29"><a name="0807081000027">My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Innovation, Universities and Skills recently restated the Government&#146;s position on the Haldane principle in his speech at the Royal Academy of Engineering in April. He made it clear that it is researchers, through their participation in peer review, who are best placed to determine detailed research priorities. The research councils act as</p>
<a name="80707-0019.htm_brev9"><a name="0807081000120"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;guardians of the independence of science&#148;.</p>

Haldane is fundamental to the health of our excellent research base and its strong economic impacts, and is underpinned by peer review, which we have also debated at some length this evening.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o401"><a name="80707-0019.htm_para31"><a name="0807081000029">Research councils fund research on a competitive basis following independent expert peer review. I would be the first to admit that improvements could probably be made to the peer review process, but no system is absolutely perfect and it has stood the test of time. The system is regarded as an international benchmark of excellence in research funding and provides a guarantee of the quality of UK research.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o402"><a name="80707-0019.htm_para32"><a name="0807081000030">Peer review processes are sensitive to the different needs and cultures that exist in the academic community. They support different types of research and encourage adventurous or multidisciplinary research. For peer review to work, senior researchers must give up their time to provide valuable expertise. A number of eminent scientists assist research councils in making difficult decisions. It is important for the Government and researchers to defend peer review robustly.</p>

 It is important that the Minister should deal with peer review, and I am grateful to him for doing so. He said in his response that the Committee ought to be careful in what we say when we criticise the peer review process, because it might make it difficult to attract internationally renowned scientists to participate, but is that not a lose-lose situation? The Minister has accepted that there are problems with peer review. Surely it is the right of a Select Committee to say so too, even if that has the effect of deterring people.</p>

<p><a name="st_o336"><a name="0807081000033"><a name="80707-0020.htm_spnew1"><a name="0807081000159"><b>Ian Pearson:</b>
 Let us be clear about what I said. I said that no system was perfect. I am sure that the peer review process has scope for improvement, and that is something that research councils look at regularly to ensure that the structures are right. However, I shall say something more on that in a moment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o404"><a name="80707-0020.htm_para1"><a name="0807081000034">The key point is that the Government understand clearly why those whose work is not funded may question those who gave it a lower priority. However, that is all the more likely in a scientifically strong nation, which thankfully we are in the United Kingdom, where rejected research proposals are of real scientific quality. We have heard mention this evening of a number of detailed projects, some of which have been regarded as a low priority. In an excellent research nation, there will have to be winners and losers. However, it is hard to conceive of an alternative that does not shift responsibility for making detailed decisions away from scientists.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o405"><a name="80707-0020.htm_para2"><a name="0807081000035">I reject the comments of those, not least the hon. Member for Tatton (Mr. Osborne), who say that Ministers should intervene and take the detailed decisions on which areas of science should be funded. That would involve scientists spending their time lobbying Ministers to get funding, instead of those decisions being made through peer group research. The Government do not want to see the success or failure of detailed lines of research being determined by political lobbying, and we will not intervene to take decisions that should properly be taken after peer review by the scientists in the research councils.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o406"><a name="80707-0020.htm_para3"><a name="0807081000036">A number of projects have been mentioned, including e-MERLIN, ALICE and EMMA. This refers directly to a comment made by the hon. Member for Windsor (Adam Afriyie). It is not the Government&#146;s responsibility to take decisions on such projects. It is the responsibility of individual research councils to do so, and that is what they have done through the comprehensive spending review process.</p>

 Will the Minister categorically confirm here and now that he and his Department had no involvement in the decisions that were made last week by the STFC?

hon. Members would expect, but it is ultimately up to the research councils to make detailed decisions on projects. It is simply not right for the Government to interfere in those detailed decisions, and we do not do so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o407"><a name="80707-0020.htm_para4"><a name="0807081000039">I should like briefly to talk about the detailed draft delivery plan process. The rationale was to ensure that each council undertook a rigorous prioritisation process. We did not wish to second-guess or take decisions for the research councils. We wanted to ensure that a robust process was followed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o408"><a name="80707-0020.htm_para5"><a name="0807081000040">The STFC has been referred to by many hon. Members this evening, and the first thing that I want to do is acknowledge the concerns that have been expressed in the particle physics and astronomy community about the science budget allocations. Those concerns were reflected in the Select Committee&#146;s report. Hon. Members will be aware that, last Thursday, the STFC announced the results of a programmatic review. It will be holding a meeting tomorrow at which the outcome will be discussed with scientists themselves.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o409"><a name="80707-0020.htm_para6"><a name="0807081000041">The Department considered that the final delivery plan drawn up by the STFC, following the receipt of its allocation in October 2007, raised two strategic issues that merited further independent advice. That is why we asked Sir Tom McKillop to extend his work with the Northwest Regional Development Agency to advise on the future development of the Daresbury campus, and asked Research Councils UK to initiate a review of the health of physics as a whole, given the interest of a number of research councils in this subject. People sometimes forget that physics is funded by a number of the research councils, to the tune of more than &#163;500 million a year at the moment&#151;and that is on a rising profile over the CSR period.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o410"><a name="80707-0020.htm_para7"><a name="0807081000042">The Government are working with the STFC to review the way in which its allocation was handled, and to ensure that all the relevant lessons are learned for the future. In particular, the STFC has recognised that it could have communicated its plans better, and it is taking steps to address that. The STFC will take account of these lessons as it takes forward the organisational review, which will cover strategy and planning, customer and stakeholder engagement, governance and risk-management processes, delivery, value for money and the management of change.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o411"><a name="80707-0020.htm_para8"><a name="0807081000043">Before I conclude, I should like to respond to some of the comments made by my hon. Friend the Member for Manchester, Blackley on science policy. We have a clear 10-year framework that provides a statement on the Government&#146;s science policy. We say very clearly that public funding of research is dedicated to supporting excellence, irrespective of its UK location. That policy remains firmly in place. My response to him is that investment in the development of Daresbury&#151;to which I am very committed&#151;and Harwell will take place on the basis of their being world-class campuses for science and innovation, not on the basis of their geographic location. He will be aware that I have a long-standing interest in regional policy, and I hope that we will have the opportunity to discuss science cities and clusters. My hon. Friend the Member for Norwich, North (Dr. Gibson) mentioned his desire to develop Norwich as a science cluster. There is great potential there, and it is a subject on which we can have further discussions.</p>

 I am deeply grateful for this opportunity to raise this issue in the House tonight, and I look forward to the Minister&#146;s reply. The issue is the refusal of primary care trusts up and down the country&#151;but in particular my own PCT, West Kent&#151;to fund the provision of Lucentis and Avastin for those who are losing their sight.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o444"><a name="80707-0021.htm_para0"><a name="0807081000080">The national health service exists especially to make sure that nobody loses the ability to function in the most normal way if that is possible: to see, to hear, to have some degree of movement are all essential to function normally. They are neither luxuries nor lifestyle changes, but are utterly basic and essential. I cannot believe that the founding fathers of the NHS ever foresaw the day when that same NHS, which seems to find money for a whole lot of things that some would consider desirable but not essential, could not find money for that which is essential.</p>

<p><a name="st_o343"><a name="0807081000082"><a name="80707-0021.htm_spmin0"><a name="0807081000166"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health (Ann Keen)</b>

 I am pleased to see that the Minister agrees.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o446"><a name="80707-0021.htm_para2"><a name="0807081000084">Miss Y does not wish to be named because she is a frail lady of pensionable age who does not want an enormous amount of press publicity flowing around her. Mr. X does not wish to be named because he is working and his employer does not yet know of his difficulties. For understandable reasons, he does not wish his employer to become&#151;possibly prematurely&#151;alarmed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o447"><a name="80707-0021.htm_para3"><a name="0807081000085">Miss Y is well known to me. She is a pillar of the Maidstone community and a lady with whom I have worked on many a charitable project. In particular, she has shown tremendous initiative in co-ordinating a charity that helps to teach children English in the Ukraine. She helped to start it, and it continues to this day. Needless to say, she is a lady of great responsibility who has saved all her life. She has her own very small and modest flat and had saved to ensure that she would be able to meet the rainy days of her retirement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o448"><a name="80707-0021.htm_para4"><a name="0807081000086">I visited Miss Y at home and saw first hand the difficulties that she is now experiencing as her independence is snatched from her bit by bit because of a deterioration in her sight. She is losing the sight of both eyes. Members of the public often read the press and get the idea that there is a miracle cure and demand it, but what is crucial in this case is that her consultant recommended to her that she try Lucentis. She asked whether it would be funded. That was slightly before the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence decreed that the treatment would be licensed and she was advised that it would not be funded. Nevertheless, she applied. The consultant said that there was an urgency to her condition, so at the same time this pensioner lady began to pay from her savings for private treatment. That cost her  <br>

well in excess of &#163;5,000 but&#151;and this is crucial&#151;it has been effective. It has arrested what had been a steady decline and gives her not much but something by way of sight. That reminds me of a lady who stood up at a recent meeting I attended&#151;not about this matter at all; it was a general charitable do&#151;and said to me, &#147;Miss Widdecombe, do you realise that I can see you tonight only because I have paid for it?&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o449"><a name="80707-0021.htm_para5"><a name="0807081000087">Under no circumstances should we have such a system. People have always had the ability to opt out of the NHS because they preferred private facilities, but on this occasion, we are building up a picture of people who do not opt out, but are driven out because the NHS will not supply that which enables them to do something as basic as see. When I took up this lady&#146;s case with the PCT, it wrote back that her visual acuity was &#147;outside the accepted range&#148;, but that was because she had paid to ensure that it was.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o450"><a name="80707-0021.htm_para6"><a name="0807081000088">Let me come on to the case of Mr. X. He is not a pensioner; he is only 39. He has a family of five and both he and his wife work full time. He suffers from proliferative diabetic retinopathy, but, combined with that, he also suffers from retinal vein occlusion. He is now losing his sight. The recommendation for Lucentis was again not made by him, but by his own consultant at Maidstone hospital as long ago as 2007. Mr. X was denied Lucentis.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o451"><a name="80707-0021.htm_para7"><a name="0807081000089">Mr. X, who naturally enough lives in Maidstone, has had to travel to Southport every six weeks to receive treatment. I am sure that the Minister&#146;s geography is more than up to working out the distance between Maidstone and Southport. The treatment costs &#163;465 and the travel has to be paid on top. He has to take a day off work and, because his sight obviously limits his mobility, so, too, does his wife. They are supporting a family of five and they do not have the time to take off work. Mr. X is concerned for his future. He wants to go on working, but he cannot see that lasting for ever.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o452"><a name="80707-0021.htm_para8"><a name="0807081000090">When I wrote to the PCT, I said that</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o454"><a name="80707-0021.htm_para10"><a name="0807081000092">Such assistance has still been denied. The most recent development is the PCT writing to Mr. X to tell him that the appeal panel has deferred the decision. The letter was so cold that I actually wrote back to the PCT:</p>
<a name="80707-0021.htm_brev2"><a name="0807081000148"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;I have seen more sympathetic letters from motor mechanics&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o455"><a name="80707-0021.htm_para11"><a name="0807081000093">That, regrettably, is true, as there was no expression of sympathy and no hope for the future. Once again, a constituent has to pay to try to ensure that he gets what his consultant recommended in the first place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o456"><a name="80707-0021.htm_para12"><a name="0807081000094">Very rarely, if at all, do I quote in this House anything to do with my other role as a columnist for the <i> Daily Express. </i>I did, however, write about the provision of Lucentis when the newspaper was running a campaign on behalf of the war veteran, Jack Patch. As a result of the huge publicity, his PCT backed off and he is now getting his treatment, but I was flooded with letters from other Members&#146; constituents expressing dismay that they were going blind and could not get the treatment funded, so had to pay for it themselves to avoid going blind.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o457"><a name="80707-0021.htm_para13"><a name="0807081000095">As the Minister well knows, if people are allowed to go blind, the costs to the state are horrendous. Mr. X will cease work, so he will not be productive from the age of 39 to 65 when he otherwise would have been. He  <br>

will require benefits, and he will get them, as he will qualify for them. He will require all manner of additional care, and it will be forthcoming. Therefore, it does not even make economic sense to let people go blind instead of ensuring that they retain their sight for as long as possible.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o458"><a name="80707-0021.htm_para14"><a name="0807081000096">To go off track&#151;I do not expect the Minister to answer this point&#151;I recently read of a lady who went progressively deaf and who has a young child. She was told that a cochlear implant would solve the problem, but that her PCT would not fund the admittedly considerable cost of such an operation. In a 21st century health service, we have people who are not enabled to see, and people who are not enabled to hear&#151;I reckon Nye Bevan is probably turning in his grave.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o459"><a name="80707-0021.htm_para15"><a name="0807081000097">Many years ago, when I was shadowing one of the Minister&#146;s predecessors, I predicted that NICE would turn out to be extremely nasty. That is what NICE has turned out to be&#151;very nasty indeed. We are talking about real people, whose illnesses are real. The solutions have been proposed by consultants, not witch doctors, and yet they cannot get help. Will the Minister consider urgently what can be done for people such as the two constituents in different situations whom I have mentioned, and for all those others whom I am not directly representing tonight?</p>

 The right hon. Member for Maidstone and The Weald (Miss Widdecombe) deserves credit for securing the debate. Her concern about such issues is well known. If she will bear with me, I will make some remarks about aspects of the working of NICE and the NHS in general, before addressing her specific points.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o460"><a name="80707-0021.htm_para16"><a name="0807081000099">I am pleased to pay tribute to all NHS staff. The right hon. Lady has expressed her concerns passionately tonight, but I am confident that she would also wish to congratulate staff in the main on their work, especially those in the West Kent PCT area and in Maidstone and the Weald.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o461"><a name="80707-0021.htm_para17"><a name="0807081000100">All of us would be greatly concerned were there any risk to our sight or to that of our loved ones. My mother had dry macular degeneration, for which no treatment was available, and I watched her sight and quality of life deteriorate. There are approximately 26,000 new cases of wet age-related macular degeneration every year, and it is the most common cause of sight loss in people aged over 60.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o462"><a name="80707-0021.htm_para18"><a name="0807081000101">We can only try to imagine the worry of someone who is at risk of losing their sight. We all want access to the best treatments available. Understandably, there is a lot of interest in this area, especially as the development of new treatments potentially offers hope to more patients than in the past. Many are helped and treated successfully.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o463"><a name="80707-0021.htm_para19"><a name="0807081000102">To provide the best possible services for NHS patients, we have a duty to ensure that new treatments used in the NHS are both clinically sound and cost-effective. That is why NICE was established in 1999. I need to remind the House of the purpose of NICE and the importance of its role, as it has had great achievements and helped many people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o464"><a name="80707-0021.htm_para20"><a name="0807081000103">NICE was established as part of a range of measures to tackle the variations in prescribing practice across the country. Before NICE, guidance was issued by numerous bodies at national, regional and local levels, which was confusing not only for patients but, most  <br>

importantly, for clinicians. The lack of coherent guidance was in part responsible for the variation in prescribing practice across the country. I am sure that the right hon. Lady is aware that NICE issues robust, evidence-based guidance on the clinical and cost-effectiveness of new and existing treatments. It has already recommended the use of photodynamic therapy for treating wet age-related macular degeneration in some patients. All PCTs are required to fund such treatment in accordance with that guidance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o465"><a name="80707-0021.htm_para21"><a name="0807081000104">I am sure that the right hon. Lady knows that NICE is currently appraising Lucentis and Macugen for the treatment of age-related macular degeneration, and that draft guidance for the NHS was published earlier this year. That guidance recommended Lucentis, subject to a number of clinical criteria, but not Macugen. However, my Department has made clear in good practice guidance for the NHS, published in December 2006, that funding for individual treatments should not be withheld simply because NICE has not issued final guidance.</p>

<p><a name="st_o346"><a name="0807081000105"><a name="80707-0021.htm_spnew2"><a name="0807081000169"><b>Miss Widdecombe:</b>
 Miss Y has already paid for her treatment; Mr. X wants continuing treatment to be paid for. Are there any provisions&#151;my local PCT seems to think not&#151;for reimbursement when people would have qualified had the rulings been known earlier?</p>

<p><a name="st_o347"><a name="0807081000106"><a name="80707-0021.htm_spnew3"><a name="0807081000170"><b>Ann Keen:</b>
 I will check on that. I believe that the strategic health authority confirmed that Miss Y had not paid for Lucentis but had paid for Avastin.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o466"><a name="80707-0021.htm_para22"><a name="0807081000107">The guidance advises NHS organisations that until NICE has published final guidance on a treatment, they should continue with local arrangements for introducing new technologies, based on an assessment of the available evidence. The guidance also identifies potential sources of information to help PCTs to make such assessments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o467"><a name="80707-0021.htm_para23"><a name="0807081000108">When the local NHS decides not to fund a treatment, the patient and the clinician can expect an explanation. To underpin that, the Government will require PCTs to establish clear and very transparent arrangements both for local decision making on the funding of new drugs and for consideration of exceptional funding requests, and to publish information on those arrangements. That is laid down in the draft constitution which we published last week.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o468"><a name="80707-0021.htm_para24"><a name="0807081000109">Lucentis and Macugen are licensed treatments for wet age-related macular degeneration. Doctors can prescribe Macugen or Lucentis in advance of NICE guidance if they believe that it is the right treatment for their patients, subject to funding from the PCT. When Lucentis was licensed in January 2007, services for people in West Kent with wet age-related macular degeneration were commissioned by the south east coast specialised commissioning group. To ensure equitable access for all patients on the south-east coast, the group commissioned the local health policy support unit&#146;s policy recommendation committee to give guidance to commissioners on the most cost-effective delivery.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o469"><a name="80707-0021.htm_para25"><a name="0807081000110">Owing to the significant differences between preliminary NICE guidance issued for consultation in June 2007 and the policy recommendation committee&#146;s guidance, a review of both guidelines was undertaken by the south east coast specialised commissioning group. The group recommended the use of Lucentis rather than Macugen, while maintaining the previous eligibility criteria.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o470"><a name="80707-0021.htm_para26"><a name="0807081000111">In the last few minutes of my speech, I want to concentrate on the right hon. Lady&#146;s constituents, Mr. X and Miss Y. I am totally sympathetic to the concerns that the right hon. Lady has raised about those two specific cases. I have been assured by South East Coast strategic health authority that such cases are considered by individual treatment panels, which always have at least one member who is a clinician. Each case is considered on its merits, and without setting precedents for future claims. Treatments may be inside or outside the national health service.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o471"><a name="80707-0021.htm_para27"><a name="0807081000112">Individual treatment panels were established in West Kent in consultation with all health community partners, primarily to consider funding for treatments for named individuals owing to their exceptional clinical circumstances and exceptions for treatments excluded by the PCT&#146;s clinical policies. West Kent PCT confirmed today that the individual treatment panel would reconsider the case of the constituent referred to as Miss Y, and would write to her and her consultant once the panel had reached a decision.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o472"><a name="80707-0021.htm_para28"><a name="0807081000113">I am exceptionally sorry that Miss Y has had to go through this trauma, which must have been very stressful for someone such as the lady whom the right hon. Lady has described. I am grateful to the right hon. Lady for raising the case with me; I am only sorry that she had to do so in this way.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o473"><a name="80707-0021.htm_para29"><a name="0807081000114">In the case of Mr. X, I have this afternoon been reassured by South East Coast SHA that it will ensure that Mr. X has the opportunity now to meet the PCT decision makers and his specialist so that they can explain the rationale for the decision. It will also ensure that a specialist provides reassurance about the recommended treatment for his condition. I am led to believe that there is concern about the recommended treatment for the condition. Therefore, I would expect any patient to be reassured and to have a lot of support and guidance about possible future treatment, and not, of course, to receive a letter.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o474"><a name="80707-0021.htm_para30"><a name="0807081000115">I understand West Kent PCT&#146;s position is that while it is sympathetic to the distress and anxiety of people within its area, it cannot fund an unlicensed and unapproved treatment when an effective and nationally recognised alternative for a condition is available, but the management of such communication is essential and I would have expected better from today&#146;s NHS.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o475"><a name="80707-0021.htm_para31"><a name="0807081000116">West Kent PCT, like every PCT, has a duty to ensure that best possible use is made of taxpayers&#146; money to meet the health needs of its whole population. Decisions about individual cases must be based on all available evidence. The right hon. Lady would respect such decisions. It is the management of decision making that has caused distress to a young man with a young family.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o476"><a name="80707-0021.htm_para32"><a name="0807081000117">I hope that I have been able to set out the importance of having a proper evidence-based approach to the introduction of new treatments, but how we communicate about new treatments and their management is important. If at any time the right hon. Lady feels that Mr. X and Miss Y are not receiving what I have stated tonight, I will willingly meet her and take an interest in both cases. I wish both of her constituents well with their future treatment.</p>
